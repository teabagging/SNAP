I was impressed with the quality of this video overall! Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Watch","review":"I had high hopes for this movie from watching it previewed for what seemed like forever. OMG, it was like watching an old, has-been lecherous dude act like a horny teenager...and not in a funny or entertaining way, either. It was painful watching Tom stick his tongue down the mouths of every young woman in the movie. I wanted to puke. I wish I could give it zero stars. Sadly, I spent my hard-earned money to see this at the theater. Let this be a warning: SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy yourself something fun instead of wasting it on this horror of a flick. I only wish someone had warned me."},{"rating":"1","title":"UltraViolet Kills the Digital Copy","review":"The movie itself is quite good. The digital copy, on the other hand, kills it. Mobile devices should stop carrying the Flixster app because it takes freedom away from the consumer. Not only that, it's redundant. iOS devices have iCloud, Windows Phone has SkyDrive and Android has Google Play. With UltraViolet, the digital copy has to be watched through the Flixster app which has a horrible user interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death of Rock","review":"As someone who grew up the Eighties, Who lived that music, saw many of those bands play live, and had every one of those albums the day they came out, I have to say this movie pretty much just took a dump on everything that music represents for me. What the heck? Those songs were one of a kind originals, performances by artists that are not meant for a musical. They are Rock and Roll songs, music with Balls and raw passion, not Broadway songs to be performed with that sterility, by actors and then overmixed. Gah!!! Gah!!! The only good line: \\"I just threw up. In my pants. Out of my ass.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame turkey MUSICAL","review":"I was so exited about this movie, and it is so bad ..... think hair-metal bands meets \\" GREASE \\", this is one stupid, stupid movie . I HATE MUSICALS ! They are constantly breaking into songs, (and ruining them). I guess if You like GLEE, or GREASE, and you like hair-metal songs sung in a pop way by teenage girls, go nuts !

I want a refund!","review":"Amazon should give you a refund if you hate a movie within the first 30 minutes.I hated this movie in the first 10 minutes. The lead female has the most annoyingvoice I have ever heard. I can't listen no mo. And the cinematography is awful!looks like it was shot on 16mm or something. I can see it working on stage asa musical but it doesn't work on the screen. Don't waste your time. Wait till itis free on netflix.

Appeared to be a parody but wasn't. The story was predictable other than the unexpected relationship that the bar owners ended up in at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This movie was highly disapointing. I thought I would love it, and I was so sad when I missed seeing it in theaters. I am so glad I didn't pay a movie ticket price to see this. It was just pathetic and horrible. There are very few movies that I want to quit watching half way through, but I totally wanted to bail on this movie! I finished it, but feel like I lost 2 hours of my life that I will not get back. Terrible Movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"could not make it past the first 20 minutes","review":"Tried to watch this but didn't get far. Seeing \\"stars\\" lip-synching to non-original recordings of 80s hits: not my idea of entertainment. Plus, if you are going to make a movie set in 1987, try a little harder to make it authentic! Julianne Hough's hair in the opening scene looks more like a cross between Farrah Fawcett and a modern-day style than remotely like anything I saw in 1987. In 1987 it was all about bad perms and big, fried, curled bangs. Not even CLOSE to what is in this movie. Secondly, I distinctly heard \\"I Remember You\\" by Skid Row in the record-store scene. DID NOT COME OUT UNTIL 1989. Lazy, lazy, lazy. How this movie received the rave reviews it did is beyond me. Weak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie ever","review":"This movie is ridiculous. The lip syncing is completely off timing, the way they break out into song at the most random times is awkward and completely cheesy, and Zeta-Jones' acting is horrendous. I couldn't even finish watching this movie. Glad I only paid $3.99 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted 2 hours watching this!!!!","review":"I may have been expecting too much... I graduated in 1987 which is supposed to be the year this movie takes place but they were off on hair and clothes styles which was dissapointing. A lot of songs by Pat Benatar, Journey and Foreigner came out in the early eighties so that was another inaccuracy. I thought the casting was bad as well. Why not cast Stacie Jaxx with someone younger and taller that looked more like he belopnged in a hair benad??? The actor who played Drew made the character seem like someone who would have gotten his butt kicked-he couldn't pull off the rocker tough act at all.In the last scene at the concert, Sherrie's outfit was ridiculous!This was a total waste of time and could have been done so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh brother","review":"Formulaic and poorly acted. Cruise is OK, Baldwin is atrocious. Brand should go back to doing voiceovers for cartoons. Lot's of other musicals that satisfy, but this one? Not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely did not rock","review":"I actually watched this movie about 4 times. I could not stand how bad this was to me. When you see advertisements for this you think there would be full songs and you would be able to rock out to it. That is definitely not the case. The songs are about 1/3 of the actual song and cut off usually before the chorus. Picture singing Journey and ending the song before \\"and it goes on and on and on...\\", or having half the songs butchered. I have been told that it is my generation that hates it and honestly that is not the case. When you want to see a musical you want it to have full songs and sing along with it. The soundtrack is exactly like the movie. 1/3 of the song for a full price which is a rip off. This movie was a serious failure to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!!!!!","review":"Don't waste your money or your time on this!Wish I could have those 2 hours back (they can keep the money!!!_"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREASE, it is not","review":"For a musical to succeed you need at least two ingredients : good music and good choreography.You see a better choreography in a mediocre Bollywood than in this film.Music is ok but the cast is very bad.

I was torn between giving it 1 star and 2, but I went with 2 because some of the singing is very good. The story is just a stupid as can be, though. Tom Cruise does a good job of singing, although I don't think I saw any evidence of his supposed 5-octave range. There are some other good singers, too, although I didn't think the female lead had a very good voice. Overall a weird movie with a couple of redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"Extremely cheesy movie. Didn't make it through the first hour. I just turned it off and watched a rerun of something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT MOVIE EXCEPT FOR ONE SCENE...","review":"I absolutely loved this movie, and my wife and I were raving about it, and how we were going to tell all our friends about it. Then there was a scene with 2 men falling in love and stuff. Totally inapropriate, and did not fit in with the theme and feel of the movie. It felt like it was just stuck in. We both thought that scene just did not fit with the rest of the wonderfully done musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give Rock of Ages a big fat \\"zero\\" if I could","review":"Horrible movie!

Tom Cruise especially was a massive disappointment. One of his worst films and performances ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie!","review":"Before everyone that loved this movie attacks me, please don't. I did not attack you for liking it. That said...I absolutely lovelovelove 80s music. It is the soundtrack to my life. To hear my beloved songs....destroyed....by people who can NOT sing (Mary J Blige excepted here) sickened me. Even with fast forward there was a very poor excuse for a plot behind the vocal failures. All I can say is thank goodness for Redbox. Worst buck fifty I ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING it's Rockstar GLEE","review":"Not what I expected...I muted most of the corny music numbers.

Anyway just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schlock For The Ages","review":"Yet another musical that recycles 1970's & '80's pop songs. In this case the movie and most of the songs are bad. Also most of the musical numbers are thrown in without any reason. I wanted to like this movie but nothing about it is good - sets, costumes, locations are dirty &/or dark. The plot is the one about reformers vs. rockers, with no likable characters. The 2 young romantic leads are cute, but the story is such cliche, that the actors & audience become numb within 1/2 hour into the movie. There is a number with Alec Baldwin & Russell Brand that tries to be campy but comes across as tired & pointless. This has all been done before & done better. Mary J Blige tries but is overwhelmed by the ridiculous stereotypical character she plays - a retread of the Cher character in the equally bad Burlesque. Most of the rest of the cast is wasted. Save your money & time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"You'll want to watch it again and again. The songs are awesome, and the actors are all awesome! Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you ready to ROCK?","review":"Story line was ok, but the MUSIC was rockin!

Why did Tom Cruise do this movie? All the actors did a great job, but the movie should never have been green lighted by the studio. How many great movies were put on hold so this stupid flick could get made? It could possibly have been good if they would have use origional music, or they could have used the real rock bands in the movie. Tom Cruise is no John Bon Jovie or Steve Perry.

Couldn't take my eyes off Tom Cruise. Gotta own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock of ages","review":"Nice try for the return of the musical...but this movie was more irritating than anything else. I wanted to like it, I'm a rock fan, but the characters couldn't pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! I want my time back!","review":"I love 80's hairbands, musicals, and movies- but this combination of the three does not work. I had read the bad reviews, but figured with this cast, it could not be that bad. I WAS WRONG. Don't waste your time or money. Parts of it were over the top cheesy which I appreciated, because I thought they were making fun of themselves and the 80's era; but then there were too many parts that felt serious, which then had me wondering if I'd misread the parody. The parts with Stacee Jaxx- were over the top funny, while the Sherri/ Drew parts were just too sweet and bordered dramatic. The whole thing turns out to be a mess. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"SYTYCD + Glee = terrible movie","review":"Great concept for a movie, but the plot gets 1/5 and the songs, which I generally liked, had that awful canned sound that one encounters in so many terrible TV shows(i.e. Glee) It's ironic to me in that if you are from the group of people who actually liked the music in its heyday (poison, def leppard) I'd find it hard to believe you like the genre of work spawned from those involved in the creation of this movie (Mia Michaels, Adam Shankman, etc) and thus the movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock of Ages - Very Bad","review":"Even though the movie had big name actors, it was horrendous. The acting was terrible, the dialogue pitiful and the story-line just pathetic. A pure waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it.....","review":"The first ten minutes were painful, but I endured through 20, just for the sake of giving it a chance.

Still great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally entertained","review":"This movie was funny, cheezy, and had a great soundtrack.

But the cast do a great job with their individual caricatures of the various roles they each play. Tom Cruise, especially surprised me. His tongue-in-cheek impression of the egomaniac lead singer was hilarious and was worth the money itself.Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Malin Akerman all do great caricatures of their various roles.Enjoyed the music, particularly the Foreigner numbers. Some were a bit corny but \\"Hit me with Your Best' by Zeta-Jones and the \\"Juke Box Hero/I Love RocknRoll\\" medley were highlights.Julianne Hough was a surprise. A dancing Jennifer Aniston.If you like musicals and especially if you like 80s soft rock, then you'll enjoy this movie for sheer entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Karaoke","review":"Rock of Ages has its heart in the right place, but not its soundtrack.Growing up on '80s rock such as Poison, Twisted Sister, and Bon Jovi, I'm hesitant to hear my favorite songs sung by actors or anyone else other than the original singer(s). The cast is competent, but it feels like karaoke night.The more disappointing aspect is the lack of cameos from the real rock stars that built the foundation for this film and provided the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining","review":"Tom Cruise fun to see, rest pretty pathetic. Would not spend money on, save for a flight :-) hope that helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music but stupid movie","review":"The only good thing about this movie was the music which definately took me back to some fun times! Tom Cruise so over-acted in this movie that is was almost comical. The direction of the Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand characters was confusing and just not necessary. This movie could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked the music","review":"story was lame but the music was a great blast from the past and cruise was great in his role"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun ride","review":"This light-hearted musical film takes some of the music of the 1980's and creates a story around it. In that way, it reminded me of Mama Mia, which created a musical around the music of Abba. This movie uses music from a number of different performers and it's sung by the actors in the film. I won't go into a summary of the story line as others have done that. The story does hang together. It was fun to hear actors such as Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin sing...they actually can carry a tune!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this crazy movie!","review":"I love this crazy movie! It's like the actors just let go and let the acting flow through them. The characters are outrageous and hysterical! I won't give away any secrets, for anyone who has not seen this yet, but be prepared to laugh out loud at what our favorite actors come up with this time! The movie is NOT for kids, but anyone over 15 will really enjoy this. The music is predictable, and very well done. It is amazing that Tom Cruise actually did the singing for this. Who would have thought?????? See this movie. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a fun musical with lots of laughs, tears and happiness","review":"i really love this musical. Before watching it, I had no idea it orginally was a broadway musical. the songs are awesome! i was born in the late 80's and wished i could have experienced the early to late 80's even early 90's music. diego boneta blew me away and so did julianne hough. my favorite numbers are anyway you want it, don't stop believing and wanted dead or alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"Takes you back to the days of big hair and big hair bands! Even if you say you don't like musicals, don't pass on this gem if you even remotely like '80's rock!Tom Cruise will surprise you!

In Rock Of Ages!!!!Can't wait to see it on stage !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Although Tom Cruise's singing was a pleasant surprise, the rest of the movie was predictable, trite, and boring. Don't waste your money. The plot line was almost identical to Coyote Ugly. I can see why it flopped at the movie theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched Story Poor Acting","review":"The story is corny and predictable. Acting doesn't rise up beyond the material except for Tom Cruise who takes his best stab at Axel Rose. Alec Baldwin is funny solely because he seems to know what a mess it is and doesn't take it too seriously. the soundtrack mashes together a bunch of songs that only makes them seem sappy. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music","review":"Not so great story line but really great music... Enjoyed it to a degree. Good enough to watch once but no more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Hands down the WORST movie I have ever seen. So ridiculous. Horrible. Even if I wanted something that was a little goofy/ light-hearted, this is absurd. It just dumbfounds me that so many \\"stars\\" would participate in this, but I guess everyone has their price."},{"rating":"1","title":"good music, awful movie","review":"I purchased the movie (which I regret) due to the fact that I thought it was a movie about various bands yet also had good music and a large cast. It did have good music yet I also felt like I was watching Glee gone bad. I could not take myself to watch the entire thing I had to keep fast fowarding some of the songs. You can only take so many talk-sing moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh, i hate these movies.","review":"I was curious to see what this movie would be like because Tom Cruise was in it, and I love Tom Cruise films, but this is kind of like a mixture of glee and american idol.

My husband is not a fan of musicals, so I didn't tell him until the show started, but he even admitted it was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"Wanted to turn it off, kept thinking it might improve.....was very wrong! There is time I will never have back"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is just....gross.","review":"I'm pretty easy. I'll watch some really stupid movies and I'm easily entertained. This movie was stupid, as I anticipated it would be. But it was also just bad. And gross. I'm not very easily offended. I like crass, dark, even violent (sometimes) humor. Sometimes things just aren't funny. I got the impression from my mother that this movie was dumb, but worth watching. I actually found myself wishing I could have that time back. The last movie I remember feeling that way about was Ghost Rider...which was better...seriously. Don't pay money to watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the mood","review":"Maybe you have to be in the right mood. My wife and i were not and hated it.

I feel bad for all the Rock Bands who gave permission to use these incredible songs. I'm sure it they had seen it first, they would've refused. It's a wonder that the actors still have a career after doing this movie/musical. I'm a hard core rocker and was very, very dissapointed to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking!!!","review":"Tom Cruise is the perfect 80's rocker!! Hilarious play between Baldwin and Brant!! Great music and vocals!! Would definately recommend to any child of the 80's who grew up with this music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't care for this movie!","review":"I think with all the money spent on this movie the producers could have put it to better use than to depict the life of a self-centered deadbeat entertainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVER THE TOP & CAMPY ... BUT NONE THE LESS ENJOYABLE","review":"NOT SURE THE HISTORICALLY OVER-RATED CRUISE WAS THE RIGHT FIT IN THIS MOVIE ... BUT HE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB PLAYING A BOOZE SOAKED & SEX CRAZED '80s HAIR METAL GOD. JULIANNE HOUGH, MALIN AKERMAN, ALEC BALDWIN, PAUL GIAMATTI, AND RUSSELL BRAND DID A NICE JOB, AS DID CATHERINE ZETA-JONES IN A SECONDARY ROLE ... THE STRENGTH OF THIS FILM IS THE MUSIC ... TOP NOTCH '80s HAIR METAL & ROCK ...

I loved the humor and thought the two lead performers and all the big name actors did a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch something else","review":"Horrible movie, although Tommy boy did sound pretty good on the mic. Not to mention, the service cut of 3/4 of the way though the movie! $ better spent watching something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why this movie kinda flopped","review":"Another unapologetic attempt at cashing out with a Greatest Hits list. Despite the star power behind it, it's so predictable that I guess I'd rather see Mamma Mia again. Alec Baldwin is the best thing going on in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Cruise is so hot in this i couldn't believe it....","review":"It's fun - Cruise nailed it - there is definitely something about him that is extremely special - he knows the camera loves him and he knows how to move for it. The movie isn't the best but the story is fun, music fun, Baldwin & Russell are very funny. Rock on."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost as bad as the broadway experience","review":"but at least the movie rental cost a whole lot less. To be fair, I did hatenthe play so why would I rent the movie? I just had to see Tom Cruise in the role of the old rocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie.","review":"We are big musical movie fans and this one translated well from stage to video. Instead of renting it we bought it because we knew we would end up watching it more than once. My husband who swore up and down they would ruin all of his favorite music, loved it, he was even singing along!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this be PG-13?","review":"an astonishingly bad \\"musical.\\" The insipid young lovers could be expected, but the film holds no musical value and the actors struggle with bad dialogue. The only amusing/interesting moment is the Baldwin-Brand number \\"I Can't Fight the Feeling\\" as comic relief. Worst of all is the PG-13 rating which must have resulted from a bribe or intense studio pressure. There is nothing PG-13 about face licking, adult spanking, and violent sex in a bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"If you love musicals and 80s rock, you'll love this. The plot line was a touch over the top (as it is in most musicals), but Tom Cruise was genius in this. One of the only movies I like him in."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Nostalgia","review":"Really liked the music, even the covers Tom Cruise and others did, as it brought me back to those middle school and high school years music-wise. Cruise is over-the-top and, like the other characters, entertainingly superficial. The movie was better than I had anticipated it would be. As a musical movie, it is no \\"Grease\\" but is quirky and entertaining enough to be a fun view and definitely different than a lot of the other same old fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God it's over!","review":"That was horrible! Why did I bother? At times, Rock of Ages seems to attempt to be serious, but falls short. Other times it seems akin to a \\"Scary Movie\\" type of flick, intentionally tongue-in-cheek, but overall, doesn't seem to be able to make up it's mind. I found myself checking the clock, and the time remaining all too often. I thought I would be treated to great renditions of songs I love, expecting something similar to \\"Across the Universe\\", and the songs were good, don't get me wrong. The plot however was pure garbage. In a nutshell, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worse movies ever made","review":"About two minutes into watching Rock of Ages, I realized that it is probably one of the worse movies I have ever seen. It was so bad I began to wonder if the A-list talent in this train wreck ever thought for one minute that their part in this film was possibly one of the biggest mistakes they ever made in their career. For me, I just want that two hours of my life back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Cruise was the only good thing in this movie","review":"I watched this movie because I was on a flight to India. I actually expected it to be decent. Not great, but ok. It wasn't. The music was distracting, it didn't add to the overall story. I liked the songs, but they seemed to take away from the story, which was lackluster at best. The two leads were annoying. I love Alex Baldwin, but his bad wig was so ridiculous I couldn't take the role seriously. It was hard to tell if they were trying to make it a parity or trying to take themselves seriously. The only good thing in the movie was Tom Cruise. When he came on the screen and in all his scenes, he brought the movie to an all new level. He is the only reason to watch this movie. A good example of how a great actor can still be great in a really bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music...awful movie","review":"I really wanted to love this movie since I grew up listening to the music in it. However, the acting was horrible and there wasn't really a strong storyline. I'm no prude but this movie had a couple of very unnecessary parts in it that were just thrown in without any reason. I would not recommend this movie. Buy the songs by the original artists and skip this waste of time. The music was the only reason I gave the movie 2 stars. Otherwise, it truly doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrble","review":"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie this bad.

I never would have bought it. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"I watched the flick not expecting much but wanting to see if Tom Cruise could pull off a musical. Yes, yes he can! He sang some of the songs just as well as the the original artists. Not only that, he was completely believable as a drugged-out/ high-as-a-kite rock star.Now, as for the rest of the movie, I think I really enjoyed it because it struck a chord with me. I was growing up/ a young adult in the 80's in Orange County in Southern California. I remember driving up to LA and \\"cruising\\" on Sunset Blvd and some of my friends trying to sneak into the clubs with fake ID's. The big hair in the movie didn't even look weird to me... it still looked good (ha ha ha). So... I am not sure I could truly recommend this movie to people that did not come out of that era because I am very biased.

The voices of the main leads were too smooth- Julianne Hough's voice was as far from rock n' roll as they could possibly get (and actually borderline obnoxious if I have to be honest).

It's a collection of his best tales, including The Call of Cthulhu, The Mountains of Madness, The Dunwich Horror, and the Shadow out of Time. Joyce Carol Oates offers a decent essay at the beginning to introduce the reader to Lovecraft's history and provide some insight into his bizarre imagination. Lovecraft aficionados likely won't find anything new here, but intrigued newcomers should find this collection to be a perfect portal for entering Lovecraft's weird world."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRICKLY MINT","review":"Once this mint is in the mouth it feels like prickly sandpaper. It doesn't taste like any mint I've ever ingested, and it sticks to whatever part of the surface of your mouth it's laying on if you don't constantly move it around. To be frank, I'd rather swallow it and take my chances being digested as medication, rather than have to have this in my mouth of ANY length of time. Would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone trying to stop smoking. There's got to be a better way than ingesting and having to endure prickly, irritating, awful tasting logenges like this just to stop smoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit with the essence of cherry","review":"We can make seedless watermelons and jelly beans that taste like buttered popcorn but we can't make a stop smoking aid that doesn't taste like vomit. I've tried them all: the gum, the lozenge, the patch, books, and everytime I ask myself why. Chewing tobacco tastes way better. Maybe this flavor is a non-smoker/non-chewer's poor interpretation of what it's like to enjoy tobacco. We can split atoms and can \\"almost\\" create man made black holes but this is what we have to offer in the stop smoking isle. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tobacco chewers","review":"Chewing these tablets is better than chewing Copenhagen. Also, chewing tobacco has far more nicotine than cigarettes. The lozenges will give you a buzz, but it won't destroy your gums and teeth. I chewed only half a can for twenty years and it did the latter damage. I quit once on the lozenges, then went back, but it beats snuff. I speak extensively at work, and it won't give you cottonmouth, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"EZ quit","review":"I was a light smoker (5-6 cigarettes a day), but decided to go ahead and quit altogether in order to qualify for some better (less pricey) life insurance. Went with the 2 mg when a co-worker told me how the 4 mg lozenges did such a great job for him. He was a 2 pack a day smoker and was able to quit smoking and is doing well so far.I have used them off and on for the past 3 weeks and they are helpful. I would caution others however that the first couple of days of use will leave the inside of your mouth feeling a little sensitive, but it does pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product...except.....","review":"I've been SMOKE FREE for 3 YEARS and I quit using commit.....the only thing is , 3 years later I am STILL using the commit lozenges.

I always ended up smoking again at some point. All they did for me was keep me addicted to the nicotine I craved so much. Luckily, one day I just decided to quit cold turkey and now over four years have passed and I have never had a cig since or a nicotine replacement product either. The addiction to nicotine is totally gone and I have no cravings or desire to ever smoke again. After the first year you don't even think about it any longer.I hope everyone who is looking for a way to quit smoking finds his or her own way and makes it work. Not smoking is the smart way to live. Good luck to everyone from a former two pack a day smoker."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 lozenges broken in small pieces","review":"In one package of 108, 20 or more lozenges were broken.

They are expensive and from what I have witnessed they just don't work. Cold turkey might be a better and cheaper choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"why prolong the agony?","review":"All these lozenges do is keep you addicted to nicotine. I quit \\"cold turkey\\" without any crutches and stayed off cigarettes for 6 years until a divorce gave me an excuse to start again. I have tried to quit again using these lozenges, and all they do is keep you addicted. You never get over wanting a cigarette. My sister-in-law has been chewing nicorette for 2 years. She still wants a cigarette, but chews the gum instead. Why prolong the agony?? If you just quit, you will be over the rough part in a couple of weeks, and, unless you start hanging out in places like bars where smoking prevails, you just might stay off nicotine entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"The image does NOT show that these lozenges are MINT flavor.

Stopped several times, using the \\"patch\\", but it never lasted & I was always \\"sneaking\\" a cigarette here & there. Commit eased the craving, plus the appetitie suppressant is definitely a great feature. I've been smoke free for a year, although the nicotine craving does not go away quietly.

Since I am a student I can relate to this story. High School students are pulled in so many different directions and deal with so many deadlines, social pressures, and insecurities every day. This book reminds older readers what it is like to be in high school and helps younger readers realize they are not the only ones trying to grow up in this difficult setting. I felt like I knew the main character right away as he was so realistic. The writing was easy to read and very insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing story told with style","review":"On one level, this is a simple story of adolescence - on another, it is a complex and stylistically intricate story of writing, of love, of commitment, and of discovering the potential within oneself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully narcissistic","review":"There are many entertaining, talented contemporary memoirists, and Ms. Moses is not among them. She must have publishing connections, because she does not come close to standing (or leaning) on her own as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I was all set for some fun, light reading, having read all of the reviews above... instead, I found the author highly annoying. She strains for humor, and the result is tedious. The recipes seem to be included largely to fill up enough space to make this qualify as \\"book length.\\" Erma Bombeck she is NOT. I'm a stay at home mother of three myself, so I know a thing or two about living with children,and there are a lot more witty and wry things to write about than endlessly discussing projectile vomiting, things kids can spill on the couch and clueless husbands. Shirley Jackson's Raising Demons and Life Among the Savages are funnier and more \\"timely\\" than this (are they still in print?) Peg Bracken's old recipes are better than these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly entertaining","review":"This is a delightful and heartwarming take on family life in today's hectic world. It is engaging from the beginning, inviting the reader to share in the author's frustrations and, ultimately, her triumphs. Moses cleverly incorporates wonderful recipes into her account of one major life-changing year for her family. I often found myself laughing out loud and wanting to share these stories with those around me. This is a charming book and a perfect gift for any occasion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Moses is amazingly funny","review":"This book captures the essence of motherhood at the turn of the century. It should be required reading for all mothers--and fathers--coping with kids in these difficult times. Although very funny, behind the humor there is a Swiftian sense of the irony and absurdity of modern life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I love reading about women and how they juggle career, family, and personal time, and was looking forward to doing so in a humorous light by reading Food and Whine. I just found the book to be too cute and too self-conscious to be realistic. By the end, I felt like I had spent a long time on a family trip with the Moses clan, and wanted out of the minivan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of its promise","review":"While the cover copy on this book makes it sound intriguing and funny, it really was a lot of whining and kvetching. I have two small children and if I wanted to read about someone else raising kids without humor, I'd definitely read this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and touching","review":"I read Food and Whine in two sittings, and would have done so in one, except I had to go to work. This book is so funny that I actually got a stomach ache laughing. But it's not, as the flap copy contends, some kind of updated Erma Bombeck. It's more like a memoir than like a series of stand-up takes on various mommy-related subjects. Also, the author grapples seriously with serious things, like her mother's cancer. In general, I found it to be a incredibly honest and refreshingly real account of motherhood -- and unlike most other books on this subject that I've read over the years, there's nothing gloppy or sentimental or trite about it. It's the author's disarming honesty, and ability to laugh at herself, that makes this book such a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Erma Bombeck!","review":"I was looking forward to reading a funny book about the perils and joys of parenthood and I was extremely disappointed!

I think this book is more of a dictionary rather than a helpful guide for guitar players seeking to improve skills. You wouldn't buy a dictionary to understand grammer just as this book won't help in making you a better player. I think it might be useful to people who are professional musicians but for the rest of us, the book is hard to apply.

A few times, they zoom in on her face while she is demonstrating a new sequence and so it isn't until the SECOND time she does it that you can see what she actually did. I honestly don't see how anyone can follow it. I finally had to just turn it off because I found it extremely frustrating. In the past, I've been good at keeping up with dance workouts, but this one was just too irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"foundation for the study of Logic","review":"If you want to begin the formal study of Aristotelian Logic (the Organon), get this book first as preparation (Porphyry's intro is only 20 pages), seeing as how it was used that way by liberal arts students for a millenium.

Every other page seems to be a full page advertisement. In the most recent issue I received, you actually have to go all the way to page 42 before you do not run into a full page ad.The pages that do have actual magazine articles are odd font sizes and very difficult to read by writing style. The stories seem to be recycled every month, and usually have little to do with health. They seem to focus on the word \\"Women's\\" more than they do \\"Health\\". A 3-page Botox ad just doesn't seem very fitting to me in terms of health.Despite how much I tried to like them, after two months of going through the entire magazine \\"because I paid for it\\", it now heads pretty much straight to the trash.Not recommended even at a deal price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Magazine","review":"Good things about Women's Health: great recipes, interesting workouts to try (keep things interesting), fun style tips.

I own many books on murals, trompe loeil, acrylic paint techniques, etc. and nothing compares to what I have learned from this book. It's just like going to school to learn these techniques (which I have, by the way). I could have saved myself alot of time and money if I knew that this book was coming out. It covers everything, from colors to use, equipment, brushes, perspective, and paint techniques to how to plan out a trompe loeil mural. It's about time someone wrote a book that doesn't hold back any secrets. I had many questions even after taking a week long class and I think this book has answered all of them. If you are serious about becoming a trompe loeil artist (which I am) or you just want to learn the right way to do a trompe loeil mural in your home, this is the book for you. There are many photos of wonderful murals the author has done with step-by-step instructions.

Refreshingly, she stresses the importance of being professional and trustworthy at all times. A great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical","review":"I've had this book for years and find it lacking. For me this is another how to book that merely showcases a specific artist's work.

When I found these cases, I ordered two immediately. They do hold a lot of cars and don't take up too much space. BUT - My children have two complaints: 1) the latch doesn't hold the case shut well and it sometimes comes open, once spilling most of the contents onto a snow-covered driveway. 2) The interior design is flawed so the gate designed to keep the cars from falling out of the case when it opens still allows cars to spill out even when it's in place. YET, my boys wouldn't give their cases up for the world. The ratings are theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy enough","review":"My son has never taken this case out of his bedroom, yet the plastic hinge has come unhooked several times and spilled out the cars.

Maybe I'll buy him a suitcase and modify it myself to hold cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy but needs an off switch","review":"We bought this for my son's second birthday. He loves it. It was definitely worth the buy. Our only complaint is that there is no way to turn off the moving capability without getting under the hood and disconnecting the battery. Since the accelerator is located where his feet rest, the tractor will take off when he's trying to get on and off.

Let's be real if you saw this animated version of \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" the Disney and other B versions are garbage! The songs are great and easy remember, it has a tween twist to it, so the language is not adult but rather closer to early adolescents. How often do you see a dog like Crosby that is so laid back and loyal? Crosby and Jack make this movie! So if you're sick of the current trends in Anime, take a look at an older version of Anime. There are plenty of entertaining songs for kids and lots of funny moments for the adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow....","review":"I had this movie put on tape for me when it came on tv almost 17 years ago!

Because, I really have no passion or any like for Anime at all, but this version of Jack and the Beanstalk is soooo weird that you'd probably catch yourself watching it once....then again just maybe a little later...and then it may come as a surprize to you that you watch it cause it's such an attention catcher. And for that first person to review this movie...I'm happy to have discovered that it's going to be on DVD!!! I can't wait! I haven't seen this movie in over a decade.

I was delighted to discover that the film is as fantastic as I remembered and the video quality is cleaner than ever.However, my delight quickly turned into disappointment and rage as the English audio track was 1-2 seconds off throughout the film, so sound effects do not match up with the action on screen and the lip syncing is broken. This is simply unacceptable and completely ruined the viewing experience for me.I would give this DVD release 1 star, except the Japanese audio is perfectly in sync. (Too bad the subtitles are \\"dubtitles,\\" meaning the English script--instead of an actual translation--is played over the Japanese audio.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the sign of the cross","review":"As a relative newcomer to the life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this blended study of martyrdom and Bonhoeffer's life. Both well-organized and clearly communicated, the text provides a thorough and nuanced view into the life of an inspiring man in whom there was little difference between belief and action. I was especially interested in the life-altering effect the Sermon on the Mount had on Bonhoeffer's view of social responsibility. Throughout the central theme threads are woven among a rich collection of friends, philosophers, theologians, and many others, all of whom add color to the larger fabric of a life lived under the sign of the cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think I found something BETTER","review":"The Glytone Mini Peel was a good product, but, it does leave me with questions.

I tried pushing harder which only made me knick my knee which I never do.

Only brief paragraphs are dedicated to such topics as boxing frames, while entire subjects, such as frame-rail repair, are completing missing.Far from being a \\"how-to\\" book for the average do-it-yourself, home rod builder, it is simply a \\"how-to\\" install various after-market kits offered by some of Street Rodder's well know advertisers. Although the book is billed as a \\"Chassis and Suspension Handbook\\", it spends as much time on wiring and other topics as it does on the advertised subjects.The average, do-it-yourselfer better look someplace else if you want a how-to manual.

He rambles a bit here and there, and there's not much in the way of descriptions or tying instructions, but it's like sitting down with a favorite uncle who, for the umpteenth time, tells you about fishing the Test when he was Over There in the Big One.

First thing I noticed was I couldn't get the Bargman plug from my trailer to plug far enough in to be latched by the cover of the Pico. But I thought it was far enough in to work (the directionals worked.) Getting underway I found I had no trailer brakes (and no tail lights.) After 2 hours of trouble shooting, I found if I pushed hard on the plug and had someone else do all the switching and looking, I could get all functions to work. But as soon as I released my grip everything stopped working. Luckily I found a Bargman recepticle at a nearby Walmart that had a good RV department.

However, there were two chapters, \\"What about all this Occult Stuff?\\" and \\"What about all this New Age stuff?\\" that I found deeply disturbing. The author claims that meditation and Eastern religions like kind and gentle Buddhism are Satanic!! Yes, sitting quietly and focusing your thoughts on love and light (for many New Age students this means the love and light of God or Jesus) is actually the work of the devil! I just pray that some troubled adolescent doesn't take too seriously the part about STONING TO DEATH someone who is or claims to be a psychic or medium. It's one thing to not believe in or agree with a religion that is different from yours.

He showed his care and concern for these patients in a way that it made me feel more loved and cared for by my own therapist. He came across as such a real, genuine person that has a respect for clients dealing with these painful issues.

It is also from here the anime and manga deviates and of course nothing can ever beat Minekura's manga version.Just found out that the \\"burial\\" story arc will be made into OVA this year and this is definitely something to look forward to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"I am aware that it was for charity and that it was not all eddie, but was not pleased with any of the comedians other than eddie and the one before him (i think). There was a guy that looked like a turtle that i thought was going to slip in his own sweat and shaking. There was also a group of guys that hurt my throat listening to them talk, at first I thought they were kidding but.... eh.. Its just- nobody was funny.. Overall, not worth paying $15 bucks for. $5 or $10 would have suited better.By the way if you want to see \\"good\\" eddie izzard buy all his other dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit depressing","review":"I got this dvd with the hopes of seeing more of the amazing Eddie Izzard standup, however, he appears in very little of the actual dvd. Some of the comedians/sketches are funny (the one compairing Eddie Izzard to Obi-Wan Kenobi is freakishly hilarious), but overall, I was very disapointed. However, there are a few funny moments, that almost make it worth it (the Yorkshire men skit for example). Oh, and watch the outtakes. They're almost funnier than the actual dvd.Note to American Audiences: Much of this humor is very British, and you will not understand it all. Likewise, some of these comedians have VERY thick accents that make it difficult for non-UKers to understand what they're saying. (Much like Brad Pitt's character in the movie \\"Snatch\\") You can tell that they speak English, but individual words are EXTREAMLY hard to make out for some of the comedians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want more Izzard, please...","review":"This product is a bit misleading. I was really expecting to see a bit more of Eddie Izzard, but he makes only a few, very brief appearances during this charity event. Skip this one and go for one of his stand up discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Eddie Izzard","review":"This was a little disappointing; I didn't even watch the whole dvd to be honest. I had expected a dvd of Eddie Izzard solo and it may well be my fault for not reading the full description. I have his other dvd's and continue to enjoy them even though I have seen them over more than several times. I had been looking forward to adding another one to the collection, but it didn't turn out that way. It could be I just lack patience to try but Eddie I. just seemed to take the role of MC and he is way too talented not to have another solo dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Know Where You Live","review":"This film was a huge disappointment. When I buy an Eddie Izzard DVD, I want only Eddie Izzard. I did not know that it was a variety show. It was not made clear, because the words were in fine print that he was hosting Amnesty International. The humor, other than Eddie's, is very corny and we fast forwarded to the short spurts of Eddie. I truly don't even feel it deserves a 1 rating. This and \\"The Circle\\" were just awful. Eddie does his best as a stand up comedian. I'll be more careful before ordering another DVD. It was not made clear that Eddie Izzard had so little time on the DVD. Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help with thick accents","review":"My wife showed me this neat little trick -With your DVD player running, mute you TV.

When I first took it running the back piece fell right off. I had to stop and search for it, but it was nowhere to be found.

In a world of common sense this would be called stealing but under a technical interpretation of our copyright laws people such as this are getting away with it! At the very least, they should tell you what they're up to but these recordings are usually offered without any explanation. Anyone who purchases this CD can return it for a refund because the title track is incorrectly listed as the Bacharach & David composition \\"(They Long To Be) Close To You\\" which only serves to demonstrate that these people are winging it without any real knowledge about these recordings.

It had very little hard, practical advice on HOW to GM a conspiracy type game - such as how do you plot it out? How do you gradually reveal the conspiracy to the players, how do you keep them guessing and intrigued?It was also heavily padded with large, badly-drawn 'illustrations' that added nothing to the information, or to the 'feel' of the game. The space could have been much more usefully employed fleshing out the mechanics of running the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"my sides hurt from laughter","review":"Oh my gosh.

It's easily the best sitcom on the air...(personally i think it's ten times better than the rote Everybody Love Raymond) I should dock a star for lackluster commentary track (how about some actual information? and where is Leah?? Come on...it takes half an hour!) Oh well, the show is too good so it gets 5 stars, Bring on season three!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, HORRIBLE DVDs","review":"This show is very funny..The problem is that the quality of the video on these discs is absolutely horrendous. Most releases of TV shows include, say 6 episodes maximum per disc. The bitrate is so low that they can fit 11 episodes on each disc - and they are still charging the amount for 3 discs that everyone else is for a 4 disc set!The quality of the video on this discs is really a disgrace, and totally against one of the main reasons people would by the DVD. They really should have compressed the video less and given us 4-5 discs. With the show in syndication, you can now catch up to 5 episodes some days. Just watch the show on TV and forget this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price Increase! BOGUS","review":"I was looking on amazon for the seasons of King of Queens- and the other day, you could get season 1 & 2 together for $35!!

Sorry, the show is good, not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King IS the King","review":"This compilation covers the first season of one of the best sitcoms to come along in the last 10 years. Doug and Carrie, a modern-day Ralph and Alice Kramden, are a real-life couple with real-life problems that they have to deal with every day. But they do it in the funniest manner...lucky for the viewers. Their biggest daily problem is Carrie's father, Arthur. He is as abrasive as possible, but still loveable. Their friends are diverse in every way possible, but add to the comical atmosphere. If you've seen even only one episode of the entire series and enjoyed it, then you need to get the first season. It sets the tone and grounds you for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of Tarts.","review":"The King of Queens has to be the worst show I have ever seen! I tried getting into this show through reruns and I just couldn't. The acting between Kevin James and Leah Remini is painful to watch, there's no chemistry at all! The writing is lame and hokey.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rain Is Over!!","review":"The Kings rain is over PEO-PLE! i asked my acting teacher about this show and he said it was bread at the circus. Now, you dont know what this means so I will tell. back in Roman times they would give the people free bread when they went tot he circus so they would forget about the louzy affairs of the State. My actin teacher also said this show is padlum, which is an old word for baby food. its not acting, just a comedian doing his act bouncing if off of actors who wish they were in better shows or movies.He also said if you MUSt watch a sitcom it should be 3rd rock because the main actor in it is theatre traied or Frazer because the writers are intellingent.So, say good bye to The King.

The whole thing was poorly packaged in a shipping box that was way too big for the product with very little cushioning material so the whole thing rattled around.

It was an all around good story and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best there is at what he does","review":"The story of Wolverine's experience in the Weapon X facility is such a intense story and so awesome that it is definitely a must read! If haven't read any Wolverine before this, I suggest you read at least a couple comics before reading this. You need to see how Wolverine is now to really get a sense of what made him to basically what he is now. There are other factors but, this is not the origins of Wolverine (which you should also read). This is just a story of how he became such a bad ass dude (unwilling) and why he is a little not right in the head to say the least! Buy it but be careful because mine was \\"new\\" and came with some weird sticky stuff on the cover nothing major but still I like my graphic novels in pristine condition (\\"new\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"The Weapon X story is a classic. It is one of the greatest Marvel stories told. And it is all collected here in one inexpensive volume. If you like the X-Men, if you like Wolverine, or if you just like comic books, you should have this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-hyped story","review":"Weapon X was an extremely dissapointing read. As I was reading it, I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing exciting or engaging ever took place. Before this story was written, Weapon X and the way Wolverine's skeleton had been laced with admantium had remained a mystery. It should have been kept that way. Barry Windsor Smith's take on the origination of Wolvie's indestructable skeleton is bland and it was the type of comic I had to force myself to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"OK, if you want to read a synopsis of this book, or other philisophical mumbo-jumbo, scroll on down. But I'm here to give you the skinny - this is an incredible collection, absolutely stunning, and an indespensible part of any Wolverine fan's library. Barry Smith's art is raw and savage, and manages to capture the \\"cold\\" feel of Canadian outback and underground secret labs, to say nothing of Weapon X himself. The story is actually pretty decent here too, what there is of it, anyway. This is actually the origin story of Wolvie's adamantium bones, not the character himself, but is a much cooler tale than \\"Origin\\" (boy, THAT was a stinker, but anyway...)bottom line? You can't go wrong with this one: HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Origin, there was Weapon X","review":"This volume finds Logan down on his luck, drifting around Canada after being ejected from special ops, he's kidnapped by a secret government group. Immediately, the brainwashing and Adamantium bonding begins. A bald, twisted man named Professor is behind it all, though he seems to be taking orders from some invisible backer. Dr. Cornelius and his assistant Miss Hines are reluctant aids to the barbarism.This tells the story from Logan's kidnapping to his escape. Barry Windsor-Smith both scripts and provides the breathtaking art. It's a shame he doesn't produce comics and graphics more often. The pencil work is unique and the scripting is solid.By far, this is one of my favorite Wolverine stories and I recommend it for comic book fans and newcomers alike.This reprints the Wolverine stories from Marvel Comics Presents #72-84."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"...book is very disjointed and non-linear.

I've owned it for at least 2 years, and use it quite often. I make jewelry using sterling and copper, and find it just perfect...the handpiece is comfortable to use, and the hose is a good length, though it could be a little bit longer. I use mine solely with MAPP gas disposable tanks. It's hard to find, but in the directions, bernzomatic says you can use the flame tip with propane or mapp. I prefer mapp because it's hotter but the flame is smaller. The other tips that come with it...I've never used, and they are to be used with propane only, according to bernzomatic directions. I've definitely used this torch longer than 30 hours, and it's still going strong. I've actually purchased a second one of these as backup, just in case the one I use now wears out. But I purchased the 2nd one a year ago and still haven't needed it. I highly recommend this torch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inexpensive torch....","review":"I bought this torch less than a year ago and have enjoyed it. I used it for soldering small sterling silver pieces, and it worked fabulously. Recently, though, I noticed the knob had acquired multiple cracks around the top plastic seal, similar to a spider web. Needless to say, I'm afraid to use it anymore for fear it will leak. I'm not sure how the cracks developed- possibly I was screwing it on too tightly? Otherwise, it is still in good shape. Considering the prices of some of the upper end torches available, I would have to say it was a decent deal for how long it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of Junk","review":"Two of the tips were not included in the packaged torch. I emailed TDS requesting the two missing tips or a replacement package with all the parts included. They did not reply. So I used the torch. I had about 1 hour of use before it quit working. I would not ever buy another Bernzomatic Product and never buy from this supplier again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinued","review":"I just purchased this torch a week ago. After reading the reviews I went in search of replacement tips. I was not able to find them and finally emailed Bernzomatic. This was the reply I received:We no longer have the replacement tip kits for the ST900D torch as it has been discontinued.So, if you purchase this torch it is good for 10 hours and then it can get thrown away.

This book, however, is a remarkable exception. The concepts described within are right on target, and are invaluable for readers at any level of any organization. Readers will realize that quickly responding to customer needs is by no means a new concept. Yet for the first time, the authors have shown how a strategy that truly embraces that mentality can lead to quantifiable market gains.

His guitar sound is very crisp, and fast. Guitarists today I would compare him to would be maybe John Petrucci (a legend in his own right).He is my favorite musician from those days, and this collection seems to be released a lot. :) But I will buy it anyway!I would love to see new material from him, but he is quite content writing and working behind the scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that evoked plenty of emotion","review":"Set in South Africa in the early 1960's the story is about a dysfunctional family who play host to a family of displaced wanders.

My own opinion of the album (I bought the vinyl in 1979 when it first came out) is equally contradictory: this is my LEAST favorite Horslips album, yet it is the one I listen to the MOST. Figure that out. Though I can't select one track that beats anything on their earlier albums musically, the album in its entirety holds me, always beckons me back, and the songs always linger in the mind. (Perhaps because I associate it with my time in West Belfast in the early 80s). While their other albums contained treatments of traditional subject matter, this one was a departure. More introspective. More geared to personal human emotional experience than to \\"the Irish experience.\\" Because it haunts the mind, it gets 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Gasp of a Once Great Band","review":"For lovers of Horselips, this release was to put it bluntly - pathetic. After years of mixing tradtional Irish music with rock, the band gradually moved to a more pop/hard rock oriented sound with culminated in Short Stories. The band tries hard to sound almost punk, but falls short in almost every way. There is nothing original at all on this release, only tired repetitive guitar riffs, no violin or flute or any of the things that made Horselips so interesting. Try Dancehall Sweethearts, The Tain or Celtic Symphony for a taste of the real Horselips, or give Aliens a spin if you prefer a slightly harder sound.

I have replaced the grate and the same thing happened again. It is actually stressful trying to handle it without it breaking. Even before it breaks, the plastic has jagged edges that can hurt a pups paw. When it cracks it can be downright dangerous.

Some things I was totally against how you can not RUN with then in your ears. If you try to run with them far in your eas there is no chance they will stay in your ears. Also, if you take them in and out to talk to people every so often they start to 'scar' after a while. YOU CAN NOT HEAR PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE IN YOUR EARS AND THE MUSIC IS OFF.

I tried every size attachment and still wasn't able to wear these as designed (and that's only a guess, as the product's instructions are anything but--you shouldn't have to track down an online FAQ or tutorial on how to properly wear headphones). When they were able to stay put for a few minutes, the sound quality was tinny and hissy at best. Needless to say, these have been returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a kid, just don't want to register","review":"These headphones are great. Apple product, so well designed both asthetically and functionally. Comes with a case that easily fits in your pocket.

Great sound and comfortable fit.Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"theses earphones are awful","review":"I am surprised that Apple has such a great MP3 player and the worlds worst earphones to go with it. The original earphones sound great, but hurt like hell. So I bought these, the sound is beyond compromised and the fit is mediocre. As I was doing my morning walk I nothiced a couple of problems-the wind creates noise, like and windtunnel, and I kept getting little shocks. So back that pair went. The second pair sounded just as bad, and the wind effect was no different.

The soft plastic adaptors do not fit the ear as promised. The plastic is so soft it doesnt stay in the ear. i tried this on several people with differing sizes of ears and none fit! Not one person could keep them in the ear. They fall out. I couldnt tell you what they sound like as I couldnt get them to fit my ear!

I replaced them with Sony Earbuds (ASIN B000094Q77) and was BLOWN AWAY by the sound improvement. I listen to a lot of bass-heavy music and there was simply no comparison. When I bought my new ipod I decided to splurge for the new in-ear headphones to maintain the sleek white look of the ipod (you know you want everyone to be jealous of your cool white ipod earphones) but the sound quality was such a disappointment after using the Sony ones, I'll gladly sacrifice the looks for the better sound. I tried all three sizes and took the fitting advice from other reviewers here, but I just hate them! Big disappointment. Save your forty bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"Simply stated, poor bass quality, atleast no better than the standard earphones. The sound gets muffled from external street noise. Whats worse is that when the cord rubs against your jacket or shirt, it echoes through your ear, creating a distortion in sound.The good is that they are comfortable.I think apple went wrong with the soft/flexi rubber caps, and should have used a harder rubber for them to seal out external noise. The flexi rubber cap creates this chamber effect that makes the sound distant and airy. Its wierd.I'm returning them and getting the standard earphones or maybe even Sony's or something. Not worth $40.Don't buy these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall out constantly and very poor sound quality","review":"I just recently purchased these headphones, believing I was upgrading from the standard ipod headphones, but was extremely disappointed. First, the earphones are constantly falling out while I'm running or I'm worried about them falling out. Secondly, and more importantly, the sound is very poor.

They are uncomfortable when I put them in my ears, they don't stay in place, and my ears were hurting after the 10 minutes I spent pulling my ear around to get them in like the Apple website suggests. They felt really weird when I finally did get them in, like I was walking around with my ears plugged.

Initially they were great: extremely comfortable, great sound, and no tangled mess. About two months after my purchase the right earbud suddenly produced no sound. Thinking that I perhaps inadvertently damaged the cord, and because I was very annoyed with the lack of sound balance, I decided to purchase a new pair with a gift card. Yet the same problem has again occured, this time only after a few weeks of use. I am a big user of various electronics and know for certain that I was not misusing this product, so I am convinced this was niether my error, nor simply bad luck. They were great while they lasted, so hopefully I can convince Apple to exchange my bad set for a new one. Buyers Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the WORST","review":"A.

I was quite pleased with the extremely clear sound, better bass, and great fit of these headphones...for 3 months. Then the volume in the left bud started reducing and going in and out. I sent them to Apple and got a new pair in 3 days. 5 months later, I am having the same problem, but with the right bud instead.While these have great sound and fit wonderfully, they are a hassle, and I do not suggest anyone buys them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better fidelity for high frequencies but missing some bass","review":"I have three sets of in ear headphones as I do not want to miss out on exploiting the possibilities of my ipod. These are a) originals, b) a set of \\"hi fi\\" ones which have light in ear soft plastic flanges that cut out ambient noise, and c) the ones under review. I must add the caveat that I listen mainly to improvised (jazz) and classical music with particular emphasis on the piano in both genres. THe originals have a strong bass but poor fidelity, the hi fi ones have good fidelity but are less comfortable in the ears, whilst the ones under review are comfortable, have excellent high end fidelity but lack bass presence. In conclusion, I am happy with the latest earbud headphones especially when playing piano music but switch back to the originals when I find the bass presence is crucial - acoustic bass, I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a work in progress","review":"I have no doubt that Apple will eventually get these right, but these in-ear headphones are just not ready for prime time.

In addition, the sound is less than memorable.After hours of frustration, I gave up and ordered ETYMOTIC RESEARCH ER-4P MicroPro earphones. At more than five times the price of the Apple counterparts, they are worth every cent -- they bring all the possibilities of the iPod to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Sound","review":"Honestly, after all those previous review, I thought this earphone was crap. But since I didn't like the Sony Earplugs because it makes all type of music heavy bass and blurs the sound, I took a risk and bought a pair of this ipod in-ear.It does take some time to try different method to make it fit. I had to use the smallest plastic, so I guess my ear is small.Took me around 10 min to find the right position to fit them. I found that putting it upside down fits the best. Anyway, once it fits, they sound so good that I couldn't take them off.Conclusion: Very balanced bass, and very clean sound.... Alan...

I ordered them because I have a pair of the Sony in-ear headphones that I bought at the Apple store. I loved the Sony one's, but I wanted to get another pair so I tried the Apple headphones. Let me tell you they are terrible. My fiance and I both tried all three sizes on and they just don't stay in. I could not even get them to stay in without moving, they would just fall out of my ear. As with all Apple products the look and feel was great, and the case was amazing. But what good are earphones if they don't stay in your ear?Pros - 1. Great case2. Matching colorCons - 1. Don't stay in your ear2. ExpensiveI would not recommend these to anyone, unless you have a freakishly shaped ear that can somehow accommodate these earbuds. Apple severely messed this one up.

After a 1/2 hour of use, I didn't find either to be the case. In fact, I preferred the sound of the original headphones over the newer ones which sounded flat. I tested this by switching headphones back and forth while listening to a variety of songs (classical, rock, etc.). As for the fit issue, it's possible that I didn't put them in the right way. But I did try on all three sizes and ultimately did not find any as comfortable as the originals. The one good thing about them is that they come in a neat case, so you can avoid the inevitable tangle of wires of the original iPod headphones. But the case alone does not justify the price tag.

Not great, but fine. I never even tried the other sets.Why? Because the sound was sooooo horrid. Apple told me, at purchase, that the quality was the same as what came w/the iPods - it's just how they fit in the ears was the difference, but they are WAY off.

I was overjoyed. What added more to my joy was the box of accesories that was also included. The mini dock, in ear headphones, and iSkin. Well I have to say I tried out both earphones. AS I have read in these past reviews most of the sound quality might/might not fade away as time progresses. I am surprised (by other reviews) to say that it was not the in ear headphones that faded, but the included ones. This makes sense to me as the price tag is 39.00 on average. So basically I am saying that with the in-ear headphones I have been nothing short of delighted and pleasantly surprised at the comfort, ease, and sound quality that these tiny headphones produce. I wish you all good luck and happiness with your future purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good fit, poor sound","review":"Although they sound and fit better than the standard IPod headphones, the sound is muffled, bass is inadequate, and highs are shrill.

Then the left. Now it's both and no matter what I do (jam them in my ears, fiddle with the wires, turn the volume up and up and up), they aren't working anymore.When they do work, they're really great. They aren't as great as advertised (in my opinion), but they are nice little headphones. I only wish I had done some research first before spending so much money on them because my 10 dollar headphones will now be accompanying me and my iPod wherever I go.Word to the cautious -- they may die on you some day.

When I put them in rotated about 90 degrees \\"up\\" and a few degrees out, they go right in and stay snug. Great sound, very comfortable.

I few minutes later, if I had managed not to touch the cord and release it from my ear, the suction would release and I had to start all over.

There is little to no bass, and the headphones give you a massive headache after about 15 minutes of use (I switched headphones and no longer felt a headache).These headphones are hardly worth $9.99, let alone the price they're going for. I bought a nice pair of Sony earbuds at Best Buy for $5, and the quality is much, much higher than the quality of these.Sorry, Apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Apple quality product","review":"Apple should remove their name from this product. As with other reviews below, I couldn't believe the very cheap and lousy sound quality from these earbuds. They look great and they are comfortable but the sound is so bad what's the point?Perhaps technology and reality have collided here and standard headphones are the only real answer to quality music listening.Don't waste your time and money with this dud bud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it","review":"Okay, so I took the bait and shelled out $40 for these (seems like all the official iPod accessories one wants are $40). Yes, they have good sound, BUT you need to be sure the headphones are jammed down your ear to seal them in there to hear the quality. Five minutes later the seal has broken, and you lose a lot of the bass tones.In summary, yes, they have good sound quality and yes, if you fiddle with them enough you hear all of their sounds and tones, and five minutes later you are doing it again...are they worth $40? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"urg... they look UGLY!","review":"I'm not sure why they chose such a crappy design, I thought the Apple people were better than this.The sound on these things is pretty good if you JAM the bud into your head. The problem is external. Just when I think you got the earbud in there just right, I'll catch a reflection of myself in a car window with these things sticking (awkwardly) from the sides of my head.They should follow the contours of the human ear! Is that so much to ask? Since ear canals travel upwards, the earbuds should be crooked. These are straight, jutting from the users head very un-sexy like (in contrast to the sleekness of the iPod). Horrible, horrible design. Form over function.Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I somehow give it less than 1?","review":"1.) Design is bad. Once you've mastered the art of ear bud placementand the contortionist's moves required, you've thrown your back out.You shouldn't need to \\"aerobicize\\" to put on headphones, sorry.2.) Sound is okay. Nothing a cheaper and more \\"wearable\\" earphone couldn't beat.3.) Like a few of my other reviewers, the left bud dropped to50% volume first, and as of today has dropped to 20%.I've tried switching left with right, and no doubt it is the buds.Of course, it could just be that my ears are poorly designed.I'll make sure and return them as well.Too bad that a great system like the IPod can't come up with a better product than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly Bass","review":"I haven't had the problem as others with the earbuds not fitting, however, I am not happy with sound quality that the earbuds provide. They isolate sound well, but the range of sound that these provide isn't really satisfying. I think it's a little tinny, however I think most users won't be that dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones__if you can stand to have them in your ears","review":"I was going to just return these headphones, but then read the positive reviews here on Amazon, and thought I'd give it a try and follow the directions posted by the gentleman that said I wasn't wearing them correctly. And I have to admit, when I had them crammed into my ears far enough, the sound was amazing. Crystal clear highs and midtones, clear, but not overpowering bass.That being said, they would not stay in my ears. I guess I must have \\"abnormal\\" ear canals, because I couldn't get them to stay in my ears, even with the smallest earpiece attachments. So my questions is, what good are the best headphones on the planet if you can't get them to stay where they need to be? If you have larger ear canals than me, they might be fine, but for this tightly-ear canaled guy, they just aren't workable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe OK as a spare","review":"I bought these because I thought they'd be better than the headphones that came with my Nano-they are actually quite inferior. I keep them as a spare only. The sound is really harsh, grating, with little to no bass. The different eq settings barely made any difference. I since bought the Sennheiser CX 300S in-ear monitor-these rule! For less that $20 more you get vastly, I mean vastly superior sound quality. As a matter of fact, when I first got the Sennheiser's I thought they sounded a little muddy, then I turned off the eq and like magic perfect sound, perfect balance. I really feel kind of ripped off by Apple on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This sound STINKS - --- -- there is NO bass, it is HORRIBLE quality sound, and the freaking things FALL OUT of your ears, no matter WHAT you do/ HOW you put them in. DON'T BUT THESE! Get the Sony headhones that actually hold in place, foe 10 measly bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Are they better than the default iPod ear buds? Yes. Are they worth the $50 I paid (now $40 on Amazon)? No. They sound good, but the problem is that they fell apart after only a few months of regular gym going. Maybe something with the sweat? I don't know. The actual sound-producing portion would no longer stay attached to the part that goes in your ear. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, tinny and tossed out","review":"These are the worst earbuds on the market. Plain and simply put they don't fit -- none of the three sizes -- and they don't make anything sound better than my original earbuds that came with the iPod.

Overall review: S for suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reviews Help Me Figure Out What Was Wrong!","review":"I've had these for over two months and hated it since day one! But until I went online and look up negative comments and reviews from Amazon, I notice people had positive things to say. So started to read the suggestions from people who like it and Stephen aka svogelpohl from NJ suggestion work perfectly. These little things deliver great sound it just a matter of how you put them inside your ear. You cannot put them in like normal headphones which is kind of crappy but when you get them in correctly they sound awesome. The reason why I don't give a 5 stars is because they completely take away any outside sound from coming in. Thats not good for me who take public transportation in NYC and you have to worry about your surroundings at every stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but very uncomfortable","review":"I disliked these earbuds because of how uncomfortable they were.The sound was good, but I had to get another set of headphones because I could not stand to wear these earbuds.Thanks:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money - 2 weeks and they stop working!","review":"I have small 'ear holes' - perhaps it's a disabilty, i don't know - but I do know that I am not the only person in the world like this.So, I am limited in the ear phones I can use - the one's that ship with iPods simply do not even begin to fit in my ears. SO - I spend $40 on the in-ear type to have them stop working afetr 2 weeks... twice. Yes, I didnt learn my lesson the last time - and the same thing happened.I also had problems with Apple's RCA cable (connecting a laptop to external monitor) - I went through 3 of these - and they all stopped working in about a month.I don't think I will ever learn my lesson, because I just purchased ear-buds again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKE AFTER ONLY 2 MONTHS!!!!","review":"When i first got these headphones, they were really good; comfortable, good sound, and small. It was 78 days and the right ear completely shut off! I tried just living with it for about 5 days and found i couldn't stand it. I am now in the process of trying to return them. this is so complicated! If I were you I would not buy these headphones. find some different headphones. thats what ive got to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good (3.5 stars actually)","review":"The Apple iPod In-ear headphones will not win any awards, but they are not as bad as some reviews here and other places suggest. First off, they are initially extremely uncomfortable. Finding the right fit and size is made more difficult by the cheapie feeling silicon covers. But if you make the investment and take the time to work through it these produce a very nice sound (and become easier to insert over time, too). Nice bass and nice treble.Initially I was planning on returning these but when I went back to the fontopia earbuds ($10 model) I couldn't stand the flater and more compressed sound. Hey, for $40 these are a decent set of phones. Not the greatest, but not overly bassy like most stuff in this price range either."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality, and you have to have the ears for it","review":"just one thing: these headphones HAVE, MUST stay deep in your ears for you to get the bass response it claims to have. not good, returned mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Not These?","review":"Apple should include these with the iPod purchase, instead of the uncomfortable and less effective set that everyone complains about. These are very comfortable and provide great sound. Getting them in your ears correctly is important for optimal use, but it isn't rocket science. If you want comfort and performance, pay the extra bucks and buy these now or, you can keep buying the cheap ones, wind up paying more, and never be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible tinny sound","review":"I love Apple products - most of them, that is. But these headphones sound as good as a $4.99 pair at Sam Goody - and I was sooo excited about getting them. If you like deep sound, stick with the original earbuds or find another brand. These in-ear ones are three steps down from average (I can't believe Apple would stand behind these lemons and actually promote them as \\"high quality). I returned mine the morning after and never looked back. Please save your $ or invest it elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT BUY!!","review":"I just bought a 15 GB iPod and so far LOVE IT!! My ears are sensitive to in-ear phones and thought the in-ear headphones with rubber cups would be more comfortable, and they certainly are. Only problem is the sound is extremely inferior to the ones included with the iPod. The original earphones have robust depth and these earphones sound like tin -- worse than my SONY walkman back in 1982. A step backwards in technology. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good trade off","review":"I was hoping they would sound better than the ear buds that came with the iPod but they are the worst sounding headphones I have ever used. They are so tinny I can't stand using them. Sure they are way more comfortable than the buds that came with the ipod but I think I would rather have slightly sore ears than goose bumps from such horrible sound. They do sound better if you cram them deep in your ears but they wont stay there with any of the 3 sizes of rubber pads."},{"rating":"1","title":"soooooo annoying","review":"These headphones represent the apitomy of terrible fitting ear buds. I've tried everything, including opening up my ear canal with my free hand. The bud would stay in for maybe 30 seconds, then just squeeze itself out. I don't know how the sound quality is, because I got so frustrated with them that I swung them against the wall......as i requested, they broke promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Ordered these because the supplied earbuds don't fit and keep falling out. There may be one person out of a billion whose ears suit the hard round buds. The new ones fit a lot better but the sound quality was very poor with a hissing sound. Did a test with the family and everyone prefered the old ones. Sent these back (amazon had the nerve to deduct $5 from the refund) and now waiting for Sennheisers px 100 in white. Also the Shure earbuds are great if you can afford the price. ipods rule but their earbuds are garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"First, let me say this is about the 12th pair of earbuds I have purchased, I just tried those Phillips in ear buds that Target sells with their Ipod accessories for about 30 bucks, big mistake.Anyway, these Apple's are great. It took me about 5 minutes to figure out that I needed the medium size. It fits great, like you may have read, they need to be all the way in for proper fit and sound, if you think they sound \\"tinny\\" they are not in all the way. I didn't have to use the upside down trick, but I did find that pulling at my ear with the opposite hand while placing these in the ear made for a better more secure fit.I would have given 5 stars but the placement is a bit tricky. They might not work for everyone, but I wouldn't let some of the negative reviews deter you from trying these. For the price they have incredible sound. The bass response is fantasic and they sound about 200% clearer than the original earbuds.I would recommend these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these for running, exercise","review":"I have liked these headphones for sitting and listening but it is absolutely impossible to run or exercise with them. Besides not staying in your ears they have two heavy connectors that serve to pull the buds out of your ears while creating more noise than the iPod itself. Unless all you need are phones for the airplane, these are probably not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great!","review":"I was a bit skeptical after reading these reviews, but decided to shell out the $40 because the ear buds that came with the ipod actually hurt my ears. I just got them today, and when I first put them in I was very disappointed. The music sounded very tinny. But that was in the car on my way home from work. Later at home, I used the suggestion about pulling on your ear when you put these in, and the music sounded 100 times better. I love these now. They are very comfortable, I found that the medium size plugs fit my ear best. They really do block out a lot of noise, you can barely hear yourself singing. I can't wait to test them out on the Chicago EL trains."},{"rating":"1","title":"mislead by other reviews","review":"Having read a number of the reviews here, I'm trying to figure out if they are using the same product that I am. These are actually far worse than the ear bud's that come with the iPod. Even most sony ear buds sound far better than these.Fit was really not an issue...it was mainly the sound. I will admit that very high end sound was pretty clear, but contrary to what other viewers have said, the low-end bass is horrible. I tried messing with the different caps and fit, but even with the buds fitting quite snugly in the hear, the sound is just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"misstep","review":"Why should we pay $10 more for a set of headphones that (1) has a good chance of coming loose becoming high-pitched and bass-less when it does, (2) takes 10 times longer to put in your ears than the regular Apple headphones, and (3) once in your ear, can become quite uncomfortable. The whole design is flawed. Also I rather have a dial to reel in the headphones instead of that stupid square which you need to hand-reel the headphones around. What was Apple thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these earbuds","review":"Do not buy these earbuds.They hurt your ears, have thin and flat sound, and (unless you plan on remaining completely still while listening to your iPod) will fall out of your ears about every two minutes.The only way for me to get decent sound in these things was to press the \\"buds\\" all the way into my ears - and they usually stayed there for about 30 seconds.I didn't think that Apple would ever put out a substandard product.

These things are terrible. I read a review on the site which addresses people like me who are pissed off at the fact that these things fall out of your ears 10 seconds after you put them on. They say something like, \\"You haven't inserted them correctly\\". I was under the impression these were headphones and that surgery wasn't involved. You put the things in your ears, it shouldn't be rocket science. It's a terrible product, plain and simple. It seems to me that the only necessary quality that headphones must have should be that they fit and are comfortable, and they have great sound quality. The sound quality on these is fine, but unfortunately you never get to enjoy it, as they can't stay in your ears. Don't waste your money, buy a regular pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY HURT LIKE CRAZY","review":"I just got my ipod shuffle and the earphones came with them.

I switched to the smalls and did the ear-pull thing. Now they're in and they're what I expected when I first bought them, if not better. The main drawback is obviously the hit-or-miss fit.

I thought that these ear buds would be a great upgrade for my iPod. They look great, have the typical terrific Apple packaging, and claimed to stay in your ears better. Musically, I was looking for a little more dynamic range and volume. What I got was actually very brassy sound with no bass what-so-ever. I actually thought that something had happened to my iPod when I plugged them in. It was painful to listen to. Needless to say, when I found out that the buds were the source of the problem, I wound up giving them away. I assure you, these are not worth 40 dollars. I am very disappointed in Apple for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple In-Ear Headphones Big Disappointment","review":"Save your money and time and do not buy these headphones. It's hard for me to believe that Apple put their name on such a poor quality product. I purchased these headphones with my new iPod mini. My first listening experience with my iPod was with these headphones. My first impression was that the sound quality on the iPod was poor. The sound through these in-ear headphones was very tinny and flat. It sound like the music was coming through a cheap plastic hose. I was much relived when I plugged in the standard Apple headphones into my new iPod mini and heard a high quality sound from my new purchase. I've sent the Apple in-ear headphones back for a refund and purchased the highly recommended Sony MDR-EX71SL in-ear headphones (in-white, hard to find, but out there). Shame on Apple for putting their quality name on such an inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abyssmal","review":"The fact that these headphones have a 3-star rating causes me to lose confidence in the Amazon review system. After my Sennheiser CX500s died and had to be returned, I thought I would use these headphones until I bought a suitable replacement. After about 20 seconds of trying, I decided to toss them. Compared to the Sennheisers, they sound like listening to a tinny radio while wearing metal bucket over your head. Only by shoving them as far as I could into my ear canal and actually holding them there did I get them to approach an near-acceptable sound. If these were meant to be canal phones, their bulbous shape certainly doesn't make them easy to use as such, as it just causes them to push themselves out of the ear. Please, please do yourself a favor and buy some real earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop out every few minutes","review":"I have been trying to fit these buds in my ears for so long. Twisting my ear and twisting them in with no success. Tried all 3 of the sizes with no sucess. When I do get them in for a minute, there is a weird suction that occurs making it very uncomfortable.

The earphones that came with the Shuffle were useless in this environment. I couldn't hear a quiet passage unless I cranked the sound to a level that could make my ears bleed when the music got loud again. These in-ear headphones suppress most of the ambient noise in the gym. At least, I am not constantly adjusting the volume.I also find that if I wear the wires under a tee shirt I don't get the annoying noises caused by the wires bumping against my body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runners forget it","review":"I run about 2-3 miles each day and these earphones were supposed to go the distance with me.. Unfortunately, they come out the munute your body temperature rises. It becomes a constant struggle to run while shoving these things into your ears because the plastic surrounding the earpiece just doesn't hold when you start to sweat. If you run at all, try to keep the foam earpieces that come with the IPOD as long as possible. The foam keeps the sweat from your ear lobe and holds in place better. Don't buy these unless you want to be constantly frustrated and irritated."},{"rating":"1","title":"First sub-par apple product I've used.","review":"I'm amazed anyone likes these.I purchased these because normal earbuds feel uncomfortable to me after about 30 minutes or so. I found the sound on these in-ear headphones to be thin and lacking severly in bass sound. I ran some sound comparisons between these and the original earbuds by listening to a song all the way through with one set, then all the way through with the new headphones. I then had my tone-deaf roommate listen to them as well. We both concluded the same thing - the new headphones sucked.I know I had the earphones positioned correctly, as I returned these within about 2 hours and bought the Sony in-ear headphones instead. The sound quality between the Sony in-ear headphones and the Apple in-ear headphones had no comparison.Avoid these if your music quality matters to you. If you don't care that much, then they'll probably work, but I need my music to sound the way its supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought the Apple In-Ear Headphones about a month ago.While it is possible to get a decent sound by pushing the headphones far into the ear, I found this position to be very uncomfortable.

The fact that I bought these less than 3 months ago, separate from my IPOD made no difference to them.

The bass response is zero until you press the buds into deep into your ears with your forefingers. Let go, and they pop back out and sound worse than my old AM clock radio. I have a pair of the KOSS behind the neck phones, and will continue with those. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES. SAVE YOUR $$$. Ugh, they are very stylish but who cares if they don't sound good, right?? Hey Steve Jobs over at APPLE, get on the ball and make a pair of headphones that are equal to the greatness of the IPod!!!!!--chris in Brooklyn, NY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I just got these and opened them about 10 minutes ago. I was a bit unsure about getting them, what with the 1 star reviews, but I thought what the hell and took a chance. I have to say I am glad - 1 star reviewers must have strange ears as as well as being comfortable, they have a great sound. I am on pretty low volume and I can't hear the keys as I type. The design is great - they fit fine, and they are almost unnoticable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't keep them in my ears, too bad.","review":"I thought the sound from these headphones was great. But I have an hour-long commute each way every day, and anytime I move (i.e. walk down the block) the headphones begin to fall out of my ears and I have to jam them back in. I tried all the different 'fits' for the headphones and for me the smallest was the closest to the best fit, and the large and medium ones simply pushed themselves out of my ears. I wish there was a different design for the in-ear-insert, and then these headphones would still be in my ears today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for jogging","review":"I tried them for jogging and was very disappointed. I had to wrap them around my hand and jog musicless because they kept falling out."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are NOT replacement earphones!","review":"I purchased a set of these In-Ear headphones to replace a lost orignial ipod earphone set. They do not perform audibly at the same level as the originals. Although the form factor is more appealing, the audio quality is no where near as good as the originals. The first hint is the pysical size of the driver. The driver is only 9mm so it can't possibly sound as good as a larger speaker. If your expectation is to replace the originals... look for the ipod earphones with the remote (part # M9128G/A). It also sells for around $39. However, for the real audiophile...consider a pair of over-ear headphones. You will get full bass response and no ear pain due to outer ear irritation from the in ear variety! If you insist on in ear then try the SONY MDR-EX71SL/W Fontopia(R) Bud Style Headphones for iPod. I ordered these too (don't ask why) and they offer much better audio response than the ipod brand.... but still worthless in my book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"for better headphones, keep looking","review":"No matter how you insert these in your ear, the sound quality is tinny and overly bright. For $40, you expect an upgrade over the standard Apple headphones. These sounded worse. There is a way to fiddle: When you put the headphones into your ear canal horizontally and let the cord snake out through the gap above the lobe, some of the tinniness disappears. (This may be what those more favorable reviews are getting at.) However, the gain is marginal at best and if you jog, it's impossible to maintain the earphones in that position without constant adjustments. Apple should go back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way","review":"I don't know if I have \\"irregularly shaped\\" ear canals or simply ear canals that don't match the size of the ear buds Apple makes. I do know that I've tried jamming these things into my ears every which way and the sound is wreteched. I've followed all of the advice here and these things still don't do it. Obviously some people adore them, which is great. I agree that you should try them before you purchase them. If it takes you under two seconds to get them on and sounding good, do it. If not, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Headphones","review":"I'm currently on my fourth set of Apple in-ear headphones. I had the same problem with the previous three: the red strip of glue holding the silver part to the white weakens within time, and the earbuds keep falling apart, exposing their inner wires. I shove the wires back in, try to firmly press the silver part in, but it just doesn't hold.I'm by no means rough on my headphones; I do work out and run constantly, which might contribute to the band's weakening (e.x. moisture from sweat weakens the glue inside), but Apple is doing a disservice by not making them one solid piece and continuing to manufacture them as two pieces held together by a thin, weak band.I've had them replaced free of charge by Apple each time, but I think I'm through with the Apple In-Ear Headphones after this set inevitably separates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for some things","review":"Here's the scoop: if you enjoy listening to music while drifting off to sleep, these are great. It's almost like they're not there at all. If that's worth the price for you, then go for it. But don't think you're getting headphones for everyday use. The sound is, indeed on the tinny side, even when fitted properly (which does help a great deal). Most of the time, that doesn't matter too much, but here's the deal-killer for me: I really enjoy listening to piano music. I love Chopin, Keith Jarrett, and listen to them very frequently. These earphones render anything with piano unlistenable. The piano will be distorted and fuzzy, almost invariably, even at very low volumes. If you won't be listening to this type of music, or, as I said before, you want to listen to music while you're drifting off to sleep, these might be what you're looking for. But buyer beware if you enjoy piano music."},{"rating":"1","title":"slip, sliding away...","review":"While they deliver a fine stream of music, these headphones should not be bought by anyone planning on using them while running. They will fall out. And then slip out. And slide out. And, finally, fall out again. Really. In fact, I think my arms got a better work out trying to keep them in then my legsYes, these headphones arrive with 3 different ear piece sizes -- but they all fell out (some less frequently than others). Now, if you're planning on riding a plane, a subway, a train, a bus, or the like, these will be super fine. But not a horse.

And comfortable.But after a little more than a month of NORMAL use on an IPOD, the right channel decided to blow -- and now delivers only distorted sound.Normal use = moderate volume listening almost exclusively to jazz. And great care in storage. Apparently the bass of routine jazz is too much for these headphones.Don't waste your money on a superior product that becomes useless after one month of usage according to product guidelines.My headphones are in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"The best review I have read on these headphones was, \\"The opposite of good\\". Read it, for I couldn't have said it better myself.From my experience, it takes an act of God to actually fit these perfectly in my ear. It's as if I have to wait for the stars to align before i can hear the sound at its finest. Jogging? You can absolutely forget it. You'd be better off jogging in roller blades. Every step pulls at the ear piece and kills the sound quality. I literally jogged a hundred feet before i just put the ipod in my pocket.The sound, when ever so perfectly placed in my ear, is great. The problem is, getting it to fit perfectly in your ear is like building a house of cards. We can apparently put human beings on the moon, but we absolutely cannot figure out how to make great headphones. This is yet another dissapointing headphone. Whenever I purchased my $300 iPod, I never thought I would delve into the frustrating world of buying headphones.

Actually, my right ear they would stay in nicely - my left ear they just wouldn't stay in. I did try different sizes in each ear, but they just would not stay in. They would slowly slip out and sound tinny and high-pitched, or when moving around at all, they would come out very quickly. When they did stay in (or, I held them in with my fingers) the sound was great - I think this is one of those cases where Apple puts form before function, violating the age-old design rule of form follows function...I recommend the Sony MDR-EX51LP in-ear headphones. The sound isn't QUITE as good - you do get great bass, but not quite as deep or balanced as the Apple's. But, they stuck in my ears without a problem from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album by two great guitar players","review":"Phil Keaggy is one of my favorite (and the best) guitar players ever. I've not been a huge fan of his vocal work and/or lyrics, though. Basically, I'm a fan of his instrumental work (both electric and acoustic), and what he stands for and the kind of guy he is. However, here he is combined with Stonehill, another great guitar player (and one whose vocals I don't mind so much, but still not my favorite). Together I find this to be one of the best vocal outings by either one, and their guitars together are beautiful. Recommended if you're a fan of either musician, or just a fan of guitar in general. Would have been cool if they had some extra tracks of just them jamming, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"I am really pleased with this purchase.

I was immediately pulled in to the enchanting world created by Susan Cooper. Unfortunately, I never got to finish the series because my library did not have the final book.Several years later, I purchased the boxed set and started it all over again. It was even more amazing the second time around. The world crafted by Cooper is captivating. She uses the Arthur legends to pull in readers. The tales are chocked full of action, adventure, love, heartbreak, and mystery. These books are for all ages because they can capture and hold anyone's interest due to the diversity in the tales.If you are a fan of Arthurian legend or like adventure and mystery books, give these a shot because you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best series I read as child during high school!","review":"I was 15 when I started reading the books and was instantly transported to Great Britain. I pouted quite a bit when I could not find Over Stone Under Sea in the series. It drove me nuts trying to figure out what was missing in that series. It was only later during college that I found all of the books. I happily settled in and read them all. It was a wonderful evocation of a childhood that was innocent and sweet despite the hardships I went through dealing with mainstreaming. I loved the books and wanted them for myself. I could not find any books on the market for a long time for almost ten years till now. I am 27 now and in grad school. I still love those books and wish that they are out in the bookstores."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Never Have an Experience Quite Like It","review":"The first time I read these books I was fifteen. I can still remember it clearly. There was a huge snowstorm coming. (Not uncommon here in Canada) All of a sudden I was there in Buckinghamshire, and I had a tingly feeling like I was on the verge of something great. I have read the whole series twice now, and I will probably read it a hundred more times. It is absolutely incredible. Even though i am eighteen now I still want to be Jane. And even though Will is eleven I am still in love with him! Susan Cooper does a marvelous job of drawing you into England and Wales, so much so that they haunt you long after you're done the books. They are so timeless and you can read them fifty times and still be excited about what's coming next. Oh, and by the way: I loved the settings so much that the next year when I was sixteen I flew across the ocean by myself and visted Cornwall, Buckinghamshire, and Wales."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark is Rising","review":"I loved this series of books till the last chapter of the last book. I hate what Ms. Cooper did in the last chapter as she chose to have the human characters forget all that had happened in the entire epic. I hate that choice; if they couldn't remember the part they played in the fight against the Dark, then why write the book at all? A reader wants to see characters grow and learn, not be dumbed down and used by the writer for her own causes. This series had tremendous potential and Ms. Cooper really screwed it up at the end. And I'm mad at her for doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"un-christian yes, but trust your kids to know the difference","review":"When I first read these books I was a kid.

I am not saying the Harry Potter series is not good but this one is on a differnt level.This takes a more classic style approach to writing. Meaning you have to actauly think and read on a slightly higher level to realy enjoy it.Just about the only problem with it is that it is dated. Alot of younger kids will not understand some of the references. But For someone in the 12-15 range that wants a good read this is the one. Older readers say 15up will still enjoy it as well. Each book is short enoght that they can be read in a single sitting if you put your mind to it but after reading it 3 or 4 times you will still find aspects you missed on previous reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Easily ranks up among other great series like Narnia, Potter and His Dark Materials, this series just didn't get the exposure.

Particularly one that sticks with me and makes me sigh at the end. If that's something you've been missing from books you need to get this one. Susan Cooper has written a five-book trilogy giving you a new world, new faces, and much more. As most books go it's a good vs. evil world just past the cover. I think the most amazing thing to me was that this book was not written \\"just yesterday\\" and yet it still holds many things that we see today. One drawback, I don't suggest this book if you're in a time jam, you're going to need plenty of time to read this book. (I missed a homework assignment because I got so interested in this. Beware.) Nothing can compare to this set of books reaching out to all ages. Five stars, and sorry I can't give it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood love, a grown-up treasure","review":"This series of books made me want to be a writer when I grew up. I remember distinctly reading these books and realizing the power that authors have to create a world and populate it with living characters. Ms. Cooper has created a universe in which magic lives just under the surface of the \\"real\\" world--her theme, that the power of magic is accessible to believers, and that we have a responsibility to fight against evil in both the real and magical realms, continues to resonate with me and many other readers.I highly recommend The Dark is Rising series to children and adults. It's for a slightly older audience than the Harry Potter series, and makes a nice next level for kids who want more.I am thrilled that the series is still available and I am adding it to my collection in the hope of passing it on to the children in my life. That, and I'm going to re-read them myself-- they're just too good to pass up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Dark is Rising series","review":"This is a wonderfully creative and imaginative series.

It has all the essential elements of a great book. It has mystery, confusion, magic, neato stuff like that. I recomend this book to ages 10 & older. It seems like you could read The Dark is Rising without having to read the first book, Over Sea Under Stone. It is a great adventure, and I hope Poeple will continue to read it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating series...","review":"I first read this series as a youngster and have been looking for it in bookstores ever since! I'm well past the target age for Ms. Cooper's works, but her stories are so well written there's no reason not to put them on my bookshelf next to the Mercedes Lackey, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and Robert Jordan. Good characterization, cross-over of people from book to book, and it leaves open the possibility of seeing some of them reappear in more books? One can dream..."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN!","review":"These books are without a doubt THE BEST that I have ever read. I first opened them around the age of 8 and devoured ALL of them in an astounding amount of time. They are written as a modern resurgence of ancient celtic mythology. They educate the reader about ancient mythos without their even realizing it (I have read them at least a DOZEN times and it took me awhile to understand this). these novels are much like the Chronicles of Narnia (by C.S. Lewis) in that they are a great story, which has deeper levels if you care to delve into them. The best method I can use to get people to read these is to tell you about my brother. He is a 10 year old boy who is active in sports and hates reading. For school he had to read a book of his choice and I told him to try The Dark Is Rising. It took some doing, but when he really started reading it, he couldn't put it down. Soon after, he read every other book in the series until he had read them all (and was desiring more)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting series!","review":"The Dark Is Rising sequence is one of those rare children's series which will delight you regardless of your age.

They nicknamed the artifact the grail. Through a series of clues the children get closer to finding the grail, also an evil group is trying to find the manuscript that lead the children to there first clue.While this book has no direct link to the Arthurian myth it has similar themes, such as loyalty, bravery and a never ending fight against evil.

Most of the time you can pass right by the doll and the light indicator does not change.Third- The doll has some cute sayings, but they are to frequent and after awhile you just want to shut it off, because it can give you a headache. The doll also requires eight AAA batteries.Overall I was not happy with this items performance, the only thing my Daughter enjoyed most about the doll was the hand held unit and even that was put down in less than hour.Had my Daughter not been so excited to start playing with this doll and ripped the box to pieces I would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are you Hayley","review":"Don't waste your money or time.

I was really surprised that it had a QA sticker on it... there was no possible way that it should have passed inspection. Nothing was aligned properly during manufacturing, making it impossible to put it together.I bought this originally for backup cooking for when the power when out. The whole product was made of very thin metal and looked as if it would burn up in just a few uses. I was VERY disappointed. As I said... a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Sturdy","review":"The pieces do not attach together, they just stand up next to each other. As a result, the draw bridge base is not heavy enough to support pushing down on it to open and close the gate without it falling over. And since none of the pieces aside form the drawbridge do not attach in any way, my son is constantly knock over half the castle while he is trying to play with it. I am currently engineering a way to attach the pieces with hinges but I should not have to do this for a product this expensive. Very disappointing since this was his big xmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful castle!!!","review":"I knew when I purchased this castle that the pieces do not attach but that was just fine with me. It allows for creating different shapes and makes for easier storage.

The castle is not a solid unit, nor does it present the opportunity to be such. Every piece you see, stands independently. They do not interconnect. The individual pieces end up being: two towers, a drawbridge/entry, two side walls, two corner walls.The details are great and material durable, but my four year old is going to want function. I am going to want function without frustration. This castle will be a disappointment to us both come Christmas morning.We may keep and have a woodworker cut a board to match as a perfect base that we permanently secure all pieces to. Or, go back with the Melissa and Doug castle to save us money and additional work.I really wish I would have seen the other reviews re: the same details I find to be a serious downfall with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had never purchased","review":"My son has a castle that he loves and when his cousin comes over he plays all the time with the castle. For my nephew's pbithday I puchased him this castle. It is different from son's (his castle is one piece). I understood that this castle had different pieces and that it wasn't one piece. I did also think the pieces would be held together in some way - they aren't. Every time we get the castle set up the pieces fall over if you play with the castle.I am soo disappointed. This is one time where paying less money for a one piece castle would have been a much better bet.Now, after one month, the castle sits in its box unplayed with. The drawbridge connector also broke off and had to be glued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very convenient...","review":"First I have to admit that I bought this for my 3 year old, so maybe we are out of our league and he will eventually grow into it. The fact that the pieces do not slide together or interlock at all really ticks him off. He barely plays with the castle at all honestly. Maybe something to grow into but for now, not worth the money. Maybe at some point we will have enough dedicated space to mount it to something but its a pretty large piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"The castle is well built and not fragile, but really do you need a castle to play with your nights?

This is his second novel I have read (Skull Session is the first). He delves into interesting topics that create psychological thrillers. This book, in addition to being a book I couldn't put down, focuses on deeply philosophical and even spiritual issues that strike the heart of human behavior and responsibility.The only shortcoming in this book is the role of a religious-zealot-wacko who plays a prominent part. Although probably a realistic type of character, I just was not able to logically connect his mission and what would motivate him to kidnap a scientist. It seems incongruent that such a zealot would ever consider little knows scientific evidence to actually threaten his empire of mind numb followers.Otherwise, the characters are interesting and the story creative and intelligent. If you like this, I recommend Skull Session too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea and some new words","review":"Just could not get to liking this book despite the fascinating premise of a scientific cause of violence. Would have liked more of a plot line and more sympathetic characters rather than the sense of being lectured to, which at times was distracting. Plus the annoying habit of creating words really drove me crazy (but kept my attention looking for new ones) such as perseveration (not perseverance?), predacious (had to look it up, but predatory would have worked) and other 50 cent words that reinforced the feeling of textbook rather than recreational reading. All in all, would try this author again with another intriguing theme (if he maintains his perseveration)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but lets you down","review":"How promising: intelectually interesting topic, well researched, catching start and the craftmanshift of the author of \\"Skull session\\".

TV networks have tried to cash in on a lot of great (or even just ok) movies in the past by turning them into TV shows, and after retiring from that idea they suddenly decided to try it again after a 10+ year absence. The entire cast signed on to do this save for Chris the DJ from Northern Exposure and wow did this fail. You con only tell the same story or the same joke so many times before it gets old (I'm Greek my husband's not, my family is crazy my husband's isn't, etc.). It lacked the easy story flow that the movie had and was just another lame sitcom with canned laughter.

The jokes are far-fetched; not funny; and everything that makes the movie stand out from all low-brow basic sitcom humor (ie everything that makes it \\"smart\\") is absent from the television series.Don't waste your money on this DVD.

This book is no exception. He has the ONE TRUE WAY, and he will tell you at extreme length why any other opinion is not merely wrong, but proof of the other person's ignorance, delusions, etc. (I can hardly repeat all of his insults.)If you can stomach the insulting tone, there is some useful knowledge here. But you must supply all the judgement about the limits of his understanding or about any other possible opinions - he provides none."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sincere but flawed work.","review":"Mr. Clements book makes an attempt to be a primer for sparring in the renaisance style. Unfortunatly it is marred by some serious flaws. Poor scholarship leads to some misleading, and occationaly bizzare, statements about the practice of swordplay in the period he covers. People who are new to the subject are likely to walk away from his book with some odd ideas. The books strength is in its well developed diagrams and grounding in sparring practice. In this area though Clements skimps on the amount of material. There seems to be no end to his misleading preface, notes, introductions, and mini essays; but there is fairly little of what he does well. The middle third of his relativly brief book is all he devotes to the practice of swordplay. All in all I cannot really recomend this book to anyone, the neophyte will leave worse informed than when he started and there isn't enough solid technical information for those interested in the sparring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes! Finnaly.","review":"Yes! Finally! Someone produced a book that declares rapier fencing is a martial art! Finally a book that shows all the things other books on swords and fencing leave out. As a reenactor, this book opened my eyes to a lot of things I thought I knew and a lot of things I had been fooled on. This book is everything you WON'T learn in regular fencing. The only ones who won't like this book are fencers who think that flimsy epees and foils are God's gift to western civilization. If you're tired of fencers instructors who get their learning about renaissance swords from watching movies and tv, this book is your sole relief. Its no wonder sport fencers are so upset about it, it reminds everyone how silly their little game really is compared to the real thing and apparently they don't' want anyone else learning that. A real rapier is NOT a cutting SWORD and a rapier is NOT a foil or epee. To help you learn about HISTORICAL fencing this book is THE source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away!","review":"I have nothing good to say about this work. There are much better works for learning renaissance sword work. Run don't walk away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good basic book to clear the misconceptions","review":"I like the clarity of the pictures in the work. They provide a good 3-D like picture of what is going on for each technique. I like how the author takes great pains to clear up many myths about swords and sword-fighting that many stagecombat people like to foster in others to hide the fact that they themselves learned how to use a sword by taking sport fencing or watching Spartacus. If you want to learn how to use a rapier or cut and thrust sword, then this book is for you. The author shows you most all basic techniques in a clear format in such a way that you will be able to apply what you learn and create your own personal style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I heard alot about this and finally broke down and bought this one. Yikes. What a mess. You got to leave it to Clements: He's got a set of brass balls. A guy ranting and raving about how everyone else is mistaken about the history of swordplay... and then not knowing anything himself!Example: Clements thinks that one of the Renaissance rapier Great Masters, Ridolfo Capoferro da Cagli, is actually two masters, one Capoferro and one da Cagli. Has he actually looked at (let alone read) any of the sources? The book is full of this stuff. And that's stuff that even the worst mainstream fencing writer got right! Look at this as a purely self-serving promotional brochure, designed only to sell you another worthless book (Medieval Swordsmanship, which is even worse!) and to get the truly clueless and impressionable to pay membership fees to HACA. And to think they chopped trees down to make the paper for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Sir!","review":"For all those who've ever felt dismay at the silliness by which European fencing has been presented at renaissance fairs and movies, this book finally sets you on the martial path! For all those who've despaired at the way Western swordplay is denigrated, this book is a the answer. A incredibly rich offering of practical sword knowledge by an expert swordsman. It shatters the illusions of the modern sporting forms and the role-playing fantasies of role-players by describing the use of real weapons from the real historical sources. For me, this book does what Tao of Jeet Kune Do did for Asian martial arts styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that defies common thought!","review":"This book is for anyone who is not afraid to question his or her own beliefs in the often hotly debated arena of swordsmanship. From hours and hours of practice and research Clements is able to separate historical fact from fiction. This book though small in size is able to demonstrate the basics of a simple killing cut to advanced tactics with sword and dagger. Attacks to the leg, face and, body are shown that would make anyone cringe in pain. Few other people can offer this insight with such absolute credibility. Historical drawings and an incredible list of references round out his writings to show that his work is based exclusively in fact. This book introduces the work of Masters who have dedicated their lives to the study of fence and killed with this knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the serious student of fencing.","review":"The reality challenged will love this book. But, in truth, John Clement's self-important volume is not for anyone serious about reality. It is primarily for self-taught \\"swordsmen,\\" those individuals who like to dress up in historical costumes and pretend they really know something about fighting with swords. Mr. Clements comes across with a certain arrogance, as someone who believes he has a monopoly on genuine sword fighting skills and knowledge. Be wary of those who pat themselves on the back. As a fencing master of some years, I do not recommend Mr. Clement's book except as a novelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book after I attended some rapier seminars around the USA. I was hoping to get some further insights into the techniques I had learned about, but to my disappointment not even the basics are mentioned by Clements. I mean, not even the four hand positions... that basic! Also no explanation of the engagement, the disengage, time and measure... nothing.Clements comes across as a modern person writing about a weapon he is unfamiliar with and that he uses as he would use a baseball bat or a sharp stick. There may be some sound streetsmart advice for a casual practitioner, but little or no historical information. Also did not appreciate the many digs at the SCA, although I don't belong, and theatrical fencers, which I am not one.

They save money. Good for them. It may also help those who want to read something by that author that is no longer in print. I think that is the only good reason to \\"re-release\\" a title. I love Christine Feehan's work and she is not the only author I really like that does this. It's frustrating because you think \\"Oh boy, a new book by so and so\\" then crash! Also,I really dislike when authors re-release a title with \\"a few added revisions\\". The book is ages old and after you've bought it with new cover, etc you start reading to find its \\"old\\". I've really had to start watching those first print dates. Thank you for allowing to to blow off steam with regards to this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christine Feehan's \\"Fever\\"","review":"This is the first book in Christine Feehan's Leopard Series. The book was great. You feel as if you are right in the middle of all the action, not just reading about it. You laugh and sometimes almost cry because the story is so real the way she writes. Her stories are so believable that sometimes you forget its fiction. Amazing story, series and writer. Anyone into paranormal and romance need to read this book and all the others in this series and Feehan's other 2 series. They do not know what they are missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"Enjoyed this book greatly.

Both stories are about some innocent woman who comes to the jungle and happens upon a man who can turn in to a leopard. But the first store lacks an ending and the second is just plain romance novel with lots of sex, hunks of men, little plot, and light on character development. Guess, my expectations were set too high when I opened this one to read. I should have put it down after the first ten pages, but forced myself to read it, hoping it got better. It didn't. It may appeal to some, but it is not my kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ye Gods, please save me","review":"Jees Louise - I like hotted up chick lit as much as the next person, but still, it has to have SOME sense to it. I couldn't make it further than the first 60 pages or so, I tried though, I really did. But the characters were unvelievable, the plot - I'm not sure there was one. Just to give you an idea, the heroine, Maggie, is introduced as a straight-laced vet who, finding herself in a jungle as part of a family-inheritance storyline, suddenly turns into a ravenous sex-hungry siren. You have to give Feehan credit for trying to be creative and descriptive in the depiction of the jungle and so, but the essentials of the book (character, theme, plot etc) are so lacking it's not funny. Or actually, it is. It's so bad it does actually give you a giggle if nothing else. I don't know, it's just after reading something like Richelle Mead's Succubus series (which, despite the title, is fantastic) it's hard to give any sort of credit to this type of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"feehan fan","review":"Anyone who is a Christine Feehan fan will enjoy this book.

I have yet to find software that enhances the process of creating a mixed CD like this program does it. Those with even a bit of digital audio skill will comfortably be able to utilize this snappy program. For me the best feature is the user interface; lining up and/or crossfading tracks is enjoyable with this software, even fun! A remnant of the great Sonic Foundry past, this now-Sony gem is an absolute must-have for anyone who likes to get creative with burning audio CDs. These are precision tools that will let you fine tune things like indexing, in-and-out points, and silence between tracks if desired. Let the beat-matching begin (or not), and take your time until the mix is just right--there's no rush with CD Architect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best redbook audio CD software in this price range","review":"CD Architect is a complex but very easy to use piece of software. If you are looking for software to create audio CDs that are more than just the standard \\"simple\\" CDs that you get with standard burning software, this is what you are looking for. It allows you to create multiple indexes per track, crossfades between tracks, adjustable silence between tracks, and much more.However, with it lack of support for VST plugins, I wouldn't ever consider this as software for \\"mastering\\" an audio CD.

Trouble comes when he begins asking the question \\"Where can a man find peace and justice in this world\\". We soon find out that in this nameless postcolonial country, there is none to be found. This book is extrememly powerful in its portrayal of the fictional Matigaro, and the Kenyan government also found it powerful. Soon after its publication, rumors began to spread of a man named Matigari who traveled the countryside, fighting for justice amongst the common people. The government soon issued a warrant for his arrest, not understanding that this man was a fictional character. Not long after this, Ngugi himself was exiled from the country. This says more for tthe power of Ngugi and his writing than my words ever could."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. No. No. Athousand times No.","review":"Like every Kategeek I am always on the hunt for new and rare items to add to the already bloated K8T collection.Be warned if you are anything like me you will be VERRY disapointed.This is a book report of an audio cd with no Bush music,only a friendly enough voice telling you everything you already know with new age music in the backround.If you are a US Kate fan you would be better off using the money you could have spent on this disapointment an buy the UK version of Never Forever(The US version has the first bar of Babooshka cut out of it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Very thin - Rusting after washing","review":"Very poor quality Teaspoons, extremely thin.

We've had so much fun discovering all the surprises. My kids have memorized the text -- which is fascinating and filled with unusual facts.

It is very clear on how to sit, feel movements ect. Explains the different gaites and what to expect to feel when riding a horse.so for me it wasn't what i expecting to get, hence the 1 star.

As I used it only for the gym, I can't estimate the number of continuous hours of play. In any event. After about 3 months of usage (June 2006), it wouldn't last more than an hour. So I deleted the songs that didn't do much for me in the gym, bringing the total songs down to about 300. In August, I lost my workout steam--much like the Lyra lost it's music play steam--and put it away for a while.

It comes with a star map so you can follow constellations, but honestly it's more fun to do it on your own. You'll notice a vast improvement in luminosity and longevity after the lights go out if you use a CFL bulb instead of one of those old 60watt fluorescent bulbs.

I blame myself for thinking this was a good idea in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING.","review":"It arrived a day after ordering !The stars holds it's glow and the stickers too !I was surprised because i had purchased many glow in the dark starsand they never glowed as much as these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best impulse-buy of my life","review":"I bought this on a whim because I decided the walls in my dorm were too non-glowy. Turned out to be the single best impulse buy ever. There are so many stars, it's perfect for covering the entire room. Most of the stars are itty-bitty, but they look really great all up on my ceiling together. And also on my walls. And my furniture. And anything that would take them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull glow, falls off wall.","review":"The glow doesn't last long enough. Also it takes forever to put them up with the enclosed putty.

As long as you are freelancing the stars it is pretty easy. However, it gets very confusing following the constellation charts that come with the box, so it would help if you had an astronomer buddy to help with this part. Other than that, it seems like a really good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame to call it glow.","review":"Very dis-appointing. Hardly glow in dark. Very little putty provided. 90% of the stars are very small. No fun for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good stars","review":"This is a good deal ... you get an awful lot of high quality stars for a small price. The stars take a \\"charge\\" quickly (1-2 mins) and can last hours. Note that a large number of the stars are the sticker type, while others are made of a durable plastic. I found the sticker style stars (and moons, comets etc) handier than the plastic ones. First off, the plastic ones must be adhered with a putty of sorts, which is a bit of a drag and inevitably the putty-dispersion process won't be even enough. Secondly, the larger plastic stars are too bright, in my opinion; some of these are 4-5 inches wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for star grazing","review":"These are awesome!

A lot of different sizes add great depth and versatility.Love'emps. we added the glow in the dark planets as well and the room, now planetarium now rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Deal!","review":"I have purchased Glow-in-the-Dark stars in my local stores in the past and was always disappointed in them. They would hardly glow to start with, and went dim in a couple of minutes. The sticky stuff to hold them to the wall was terrible, and a few would fall down every night.I bought these based on other reviews, and I couldn't be more impressed! You get tons of stars - so many it took me over an hour to put them all up. They glow very bright at first and continued to have a warm glow through most of the night. The sticky material works great.I can't recommend these enough - buy them and you'll be glad you did!Star Explosion Glow In The Dark"},{"rating":"1","title":"the stars barely glow and the adhesive is terrible","review":"the stars glow for maybe 3 minutes after you shut the lights off, even after charging all day. they DO look nice while they are glowing.the amount of adhesive given would have worked fine if it was a much stronger adhesive......but they give you a VERY tiny amount and it does not hold up the bigger stars/galaxies well enough. they fall down.so i will be purchasing better adhesive.it does come with quite a lot of variety in shapes and sizes which was nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Bought this for my son because he wanted to cover his entire room in stars. While it is a bummer that some of the stars are stickers they still have the same effect as the plastic stars. There is still a lot of plastic stars in the box. Some people mentioned that the wall putty did not hold up the stars but I have had no issues and have had to use vary little per star to keep it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Bought this for my boyfriend who is obsessed with the stars. great gift, fast shipping.

There was more than enough stars to make a bunch of constellations on their ceiling. These are easy to use and weren't messy at all. The kids love staring at the stars and pointing out the names of constellation before they go to bed at night. I was surprised when they started pointing out the real ones once we were outside one evening.The experience really turned them on to learning about the constellations. We even ended up buying a real telescope and book about stars. What a fun way to learn for all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this before ordering","review":"I'm sorry to say I've been duped, it's my fault but if you are the kind of person that reads Amazon reviews before ordering, this one may come in handy. I wanted a whole bunch of plastic glow stars for my daughters' room, I quickly read \\"over 700 stars\\", a brief description, and ordered. Most (over 500) of the so called stars are nail sized stickers, not actual plastic stars. I must be honest and say that when I re-read the description of the contents, they did mention it in the product page. The stars are ok, the product doesn't get more than two or max three stars as a review, most of them are fairly small anyways. I'm not saying not to order them, just read carefully. There are much better products in the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money and Misleading","review":"725 stars is the most misleading marketing ever. The majority of the stars are as big as your tumb nail. And two pages of itty bitty stickers makes up about 125 of the 725. Plus they give you about a 1x1 sqaure of putty to put up the things. Really maybe five dollars worth of product, not worth 15 dollars at all. Very dissapointed. Even the box is misleading. See the plastic circular part of it those are all the stars in the entire thing. Why have a box three times larger than the product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality","review":"This adaptor is of low quality, and does not work well. I ended up getting a different sub-base for my router, and I am much happier using it than this cheap adaptor. Shipping on this item was over 6 dollars, making the cost almost the same as a sub-base. Don't go this route."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Tasty Meat Snack","review":"Yeah, it's pork, but it only has 5.25 grams of fat in 3.5 oz (98 grams) of dried meat. So it's pretty lean pork.

The works are literary celebrations of the hunter and his prey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Stories Tied to Real Life","review":"These stories use hunting as the backdrop to teach powerful lessons about life and nature. I am an avid hunter, fisherman and outdoorsman and found these stories to be both realistic and inspiring. They are more \\"real life stories\\" using hunting as a backdrop, than a Teddy Roosevelt type hunting story, or something out of field and stream. You don't always come home with a trophy buck or a 50 lb striped bass, and people who live in our largely strip mall nation forget that nature can be a cruel (although beautiful) companion at times.Two of the stories \\"the Ledge\\" and \\"Walking out\\" are both highly awarded and may be two of the best stories I have ever read.

Not wanting to deal with the hassle of sending it back and having some experience with these things I accessed the main jet and carefully cleaned it and the threaded chamber it's in, reassembled but to no avail. Same sluggish operation. Long story short, I disassembled deeper into the unit being carefull but in the end, I scrounged some parts off another heater and got it working properly.

It makes the case that maybe Hitler was not such a genius after all. Lewin states that Hitler made many mistakes both political and militarily. His presecution of the Jews resulted in Jewish scientists taking their skills to the U.K. and U.S.A.His stand fast policy on the battlefront resulted in million of dead German soldiers. His limitations on his generals resulted in additional losses of the battlefield. Hitler's leadership style resulted in conflicting domains for his underlings resulted in wasted effort and lost potential. The overall analysis was that Hitler was very intelligent, but his actions caused the Germans to lose the war. I thought the analysis was right on target.This is a nice short read with very good analysis of why Hitler helped the Germans lose the war.

It also doesn't include Hank's \\"(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle\\". But it seems EVERYTHING else is here - and it's wonderful this music book was released! (Five Stars if the mentioned songs were included!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Key","review":"I found that most of the songs in this book are in the key of F, and most of Hank's tunes are not played in the key of F on his records. The publishers told me that they don't claim to match the keys of the record and they may have been changed for guitar and piano arrangements, which makes no sense to me. The songs and lyrics appear to be correct otherwise, and I just played along with the records to transpose the keys by hand. It was a pain, but worth it to have an accurate representation of one of the greatest collections of songs of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection but some songs missing","review":"I got this as a gift for my dad, and he loves it.

Idolatry is and always has been the single greatest enemy of the people of God, and this century is no different. The only problem, it seems, is that Christians have become blind to modern day idols. Modern sources of authority such as politics, psychology, management theory and marketing have crept into the church and captivated her, and this is what Os Guinness and his friends warn us against.

In my case, I often suffer from good old plain overstimulation (too many people, too much commotion, too loud, too bright, unpleasant smells, low pain tolerance, food that is too spicy). The 21st century is all about overstimulation.

On one CD, she mixes so many different styles that you would swear that had other people sing some of the songs. She has a very versatile voice.Also, her songs are not typical love or heartbreak songs. There are a few of them, but they are tastefully done. But there are other types of songs on her album too, like \\"Song Unsung\\", about an unrealized potential, or \\"Make a Difference\\". I think that is one of, if not THE, most powerful songs on the album. It is a striking blend of melodies, emotions, and thoughts.

But I still enjoy Eden's piano work on the CD, and I feel a connection to the songs' lyrics... much like with Chantal Kreviazuk's.Simple themes to the lyrics? Possibly. Simple themes to the songs?

Sure a lot of it was way above my head when the author talks about minute matters of musical theory-but the bits I CAN understand are engrossing.What's it all about? The author takes apart The Beatles music and looks for the unique factors that make the music so wonderful .(e.g The use of 4ths..the trademark 7ths...the 'unexpected turns the music makes..and much more) It shows once and for all the brilliance of the songwriting Beatles-and explains 'why'.AND , finally , the definitive take on THAT chord-the opening chord of \\"A Hard Days Night\\".The (in)famous \\"aeolian cadences\\" are also (finally!) explained.Yes it's a very complex and detailed book-but endlessly fascinating and it keeps you reading chapter after chapter.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clueless marketing hype","review":"Lots of fancy layouts, probably because of the ad man's background, but nothing substantial to really give serious advice.

My taste in music is very diverse and this album seems to cover every angle. The vocals are so striking and the harmonies and lyrics are amazing. Every track is captivating and you'll want to listen to every song over and over. From the catchy rifts and hand clapping hit single \\"The First Single\\" to the folk-inspired \\"Give it Up\\" and the bittersweet ballad of \\"On Your Porch\\"... it's so hard to pick a favorite because every song is a highlight in itself. This is probably the one album I will never get tired of and it definitely will not play itself out."},{"rating":"2","title":"More....just give me more.......","review":"Thought Honorary Title was good but The Format is incredible.I hope that main stream producers dont jack the sound.This is a upbeat grassroots album with a hint of the 80's folk pop.If you like this then check out Copeland.Similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"this cd is one of the best I have heard. the format rocks and are my favorite band. if you like indi rock then you need to own this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Interventions & Lullabies","review":"Incredible CD, I can't stop listening to it.

My first impression was: \\"Hmm...sounds pretty good, and it's cheap, I'll just go ahead and get it.\\" But then, it never left my CD player. It is one of the most played albums on my iPod. With every listen, it gets better and better. The musical combinations they used to create this album are original and so pleasing to the ear that you can't help but smile. It's sort of impossible to place them into one current music genre (hence their name, The Format) but I think I would place them most comfortably in that pop rock category. I hesitate to do that, however, because the music is so original and so much better than most of the pop rock out there.

They didn't really catch my ear at the time, but a friend of mine alerted me to their tunes a couple of months later.The Format isn't bad. In fact, they're very good...at playing one song. While \\"Interventions and Lullabies\\" is certainly not void of great tunes, it just so happens it's one tune played 12 times. While \\"The First Single\\", \\"Give it Up\\", and \\"Tune Out\\" are three very good and insanely catchy songs, they're nearly interchangeable. That may be good for pop audiences who listen to the likes of Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne, but The Format has to work harder for a rock fan like myself.

I saw them live, and purchased this CD at their show. I can honestly say that I couldn't have expected anything nearly as great as this. Their music wraps the sounds of pop, rock, and emo into one fabulous package; and their deeply personal lyrics can relate to the life of any listener.

This album is excellent. It has both upbeat tunes and slow songs, but none of it is too hard. The singer's voice is very unique; you can sense the emotion in his voice and you can tell that the lyrics are heartfelt. I'm not sure how I'd classify this (probably emo), but genre lines should be crossed to give this one a try, as I am sure almost anyone would enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet piece of fiction","review":"This is a very sweet story about a time, place, and man that was the construct of the author of this book. Historians and philosophers will continue to debate whether Lao Tzu ever existed or, if the Tao Te Ching was the work of many men. This book, however, portrays a decidedly Judeo/Christian perspective to the man called Lao Tzu and his life and times. The book is inacurate in it's portayal of life and philosophy/religion during the Han Dynasty. The author clearly misrepresents the history and beliefs in ancient China in a desire to mold Chinese thinking into a monotheistic belief system. If the reader is willing to set aside the historical and philosophical truths of the Chineses culture, the story is set forth as a very sweet parable. As someone who takes the Chinese culture seriously, I was not able to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gypsy Jazz Guitarist","review":"I originally purchased this video in 1994 and every eight or nine months I rewatch it. The video focus's on Django's life history and some of his experiences. At the beginning of the video there are some great scenes of young gypsy guitarist playing classic jazz standards. The video also introduces many Django stylists playing throughout Europe, Bireh Lagrene, Babe Reinhardt and many others. The video and music quanlity are well done. The final scenes were recorded at an annual concert which is held in memory of Django at Samois Sur Seine.

We love the stroller, except that it is so poorly built that we have had to replace the back tires twice now, and our daughter is only a year old! In addition to the tires (which took me time and frustration to replace), the screws on the handle have come out twice.

I would go with a similar stroller that doesn't fall apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a terrible stroller","review":"This stroller really was poor. We were surprised, because we really liked our MacLaren umbrella stroller and were expecting great things from this one. We got the stroller, and the handle promptly fell off, again and again. You can't turn a corner with it, which is fine if you only want to walk/jog in a straight line. I thought this was VERY unsafe. I guess there were some good things about it, but the handle coming off made it unusable. I emailed the company, but no response; probably because I mentioned the word RECALL in the subject line. I would NOT buy this stroller. They should stick to the umbrella style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited when I saw the Mac 3.

These refer to the physical environments in which the ballads and plays might and probably were read. Including naturally the immortal Globe Theatre in London. So we see the floor plan of the Globe, and speculation as to how this would have affected the listening experience of the audience.

Our favorite songs are : Sun shines for all the same, P.I:G., BugZZzz, and Lullaby. We took our family to Switzerland for Easter, and the long car ride to Verbier was this time for us quite painless because our children were happily busy trying to sing along and to memorize Meeka's beautiful songs.

Also when Nick had to put his name and the date on the back of an envolope from his teacher and he wouldn't get it unless the fighting was over and that doesn't happen untill ten years later.I think this book would be a wonderful book for any 5th or 6th grader that likes a good fantasay novel.

After a few weeks, the whole town is saying the word. I liked this book because it is funny and realistic. This book would be better for people under thirteen because I don't think people over thirteen will think it is funny. I say that because it will only take adults about 45min. to read this book.

Nick starts telling everyone to say frindle instead of pen. It works, but the teachers won't put up with it and rebel against it. Mrs.Granger, giving out tons of detentoins everyday especially seems to hate it. After many news reports and angry parents, frindle was put into the dictionary, and Nick wins, but not after finding out that Mrs. Granger was on Nick's side the whole time.

How much learning went undone in fifth grade because of Nick's idiotic idea? In real life many kids who were in school to learn would detest him too, because of his hijacking of the school day with his selfish prank. I detested the ending, when Mrs. Granger capitulates. That's so phony. The entire book is phony because most kids like Nick go on to lead troubled lives, not become millionaires. Most millionaires I know are people who respected authority as kids and become authority as adults. The person with a good idea in the book is Bud Lawrence, who snatched up the trademark and made some money.

Like one time he turned his class into an island with palm trees and sand on the floor. When Nick Allen first went to fifth grade he heard about Mrs. Granger. He was scared about going into Mrs. Granger's class. Nick was starting to not be scared of Mrs. Granger's classroom.

I meanits about a pen! A PEN! I must say the cliff hangers were pretty good and it was kinda a game so i liked that to. Trust me if you read it i wouldnt think that you would think it. It wasnt the worst book in the world but who wants to read about a made up name for a pen a dinasour that came to life and you named it something differnt because ou didnt know what it was called for a science project or something but its a pen who wants to read about a pen!

The case barely zips around the keyboard width-wise, and is longer than it needs to be. No matter which direction I insert the keyboard, it's a bad fit. The extra pockets are somewhat useless -- they are each designed to fit the Palm or Handspring, which is silly because why would you be carrying two PDAs at once? The extra padding designed to protect the PDA means that the compartments are smaller than they appear to be, so the most they can carry is maybe one cable or a backup module. The case is unattractive and essentially useless -- I plan to return mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward... why not keep it simple?","review":"A small simple keyboard demands a small simple case. This is **NOT** it. The two pockets with Velcro closures should have been omitted. The whole idea of a PDA is that it can be put in a pocket where it's always handy -- and a keyboard (slim to start with) is the kind of thing that should fit into tiny crevices, much like a paperback book slides into a briefcase. The goofy pockets catch on everything, and make the case almost twice as thick. Also notice that they both face in the SAME direction. It is especially hard to put rigid items in the 'blind' pocket -- and to get them out -- unless the GoType has already been removed from the main compartment. I have thought about carefully cutting the pockets enirely off the case, but I have hesitated to do so... it seems such a drastic solution... -- This is a classic case of overdesign with inadequate forethought, and (I'm convinced) no field testing. --"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Gift!","review":"I received this book from my son and daughter-in-law for my 55th birthday.

What they did after those 5 songs, I dont care. The first 5 are all that I need (in fact, I honestly dont think I even let the disc get past 'U&I', I simply hit \\"start over\\") They persist today to be my favorite slow songs of all time (and this album was released in 1991!!). WOW. This was Jodeci's best album. Period. They were NEVER able to come close to 'Stay', 'Come and Talk To Me', 'Forever My Lady' 'I'm Still Waiting' and 'U&I'. This album is a classic, and to think that there are kids out there who have never even heard some of these songs (shame). Slow jams dont sound like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is still a classic to this day! Nice ballads!","review":"I'd get this album today if I wanted to, because this group just tore it up in '91 and much of '92 with songs from this debut! The three ballad hits, Forever My Lady (the jam!), Stay, and Come and Talk To Me have modern new jack touches, but are steeped in the classic R&B style of past groups. They were smart to place the smoother ballads first. The second half of the dance numbers are good; there are a few missteps, but the ballads still are the group's strongest suit. K-CI still is one of the best male singers from the '90s and it has helped in he and his brother's duo albums. The songs that Al B. Sure, Devante Swing and others produced on this album are very superb! Devante's songs stand out from many of the others! I hope that Jodeci considers recording a new album in the future. It would be another hit for them if they did it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my fave from them","review":"despite the two follow ups and the sucessful solo outings and what have you this disc for me is the best the crew has mustered.i agree with the reviewer about the fast songs not a strong suite of jodeci's. this album is one of the best in the 90's period.but they haven't followed it up for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jodeci was a nice group........a comeback in the works???","review":"I remember being in school when this album dropped. \\"Forever My Lady\\" was a nice lead single that gave this group and instant buzz. \\"Come & Talk to Me\\" was also a flawless track. The problem with this Cd that makes it short of a classic is the fast side \\"B\\". Side \\"A\\" are all slow songs that most people i know truly enjoyed. The more up tempo songs sounded rushed and not as natural.

I bought only for the 3 user multi-user option and got the 07 upgrade with it.

The cards are completely random & wacky & you will find yourself performing crazy stunts!The recommended ages are over 12 years and that is pretty much dead-on. There are several cards that younger players just won't get and then there are a few cards (such as \\"Name places you have been naked...\\") that just aren't appropriate for mixed audiences. (If all children answered that question--its completely innocent, if a bunch of 20somethings & kids answer it, well, then it gets shady!)We have had a blast playing this game.

The things the game asks the players to do aren't fun or funny. I think this might be a good game for 11-14 yr. olds. We had a group of 8 people playing ranging from 12 to 50 and the 12 yr old found it enjoyable. The rest found it painful, slow and disappointing in every way. Really expensive when you consider the outcome. A cheaper way to the same outcome would be to write down ridiculous things for your neighbor to do and pass them around the table. Really...it's that stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great gift for someone you don't like","review":"Basically if you like hazing and humiliating others then you will love this game. Don't get me wrong- I was more than happy to lose the game and take constant penalties, but that apparently causes tension. Anyway, you draw cards and have to try to convince the other players to pick their noses, or act bizarrely until the time is up, ignoring the other players who are trying to guess what what they're doing in order to relieve them. Even though we'd guessed correctly, the card had instructed the person to continue on with their odd antics until the time ran out. One person had to leave the game to make a mask out of odds and ends. This game is also painfully slow going. It took about thirty minutes to cycle through everyone's turn. Surely other reviewers, the addled ones, will say that I'm no fun.

The activities dictated by the game are just stupid and pointless. In a group of a dozen people (many of whom were drinking and should have been able to enjoy any silly thing), nobody understood what was supposed to be funny or enjoyable.

It was an awsome perfomance by kse and i was not suprised because i love kse' music and their one of the most talented bands out now! I got kse's disc alive or just breathing and all the tracks are fantastic specialy numbered days, fixation on darkness, my last serenade, life to lifeless, and, to the sons of man all makes this an worth owning disc as well as truly good quality metal along with some nice hardcore riffs along with it !! Buy it now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like it...","review":"I've listened to a lot of metal, and I've never heard anything as good as this. Sure...some bands sound similar with their blends of melody and heaviness, but KsE plain and simply sounds better than the rest. Everything flows...the music grabs you and you don't have to heart to stop the CD until the final track has finished. Great production work; heavy, modern sounding guitars with a dash of old school thrash metal (but no solos - they weren't needed); blistering drumwork; and the most uplifting, hair raising vocals ever. Sorry the singer had to leave, but I trust the rest of the band knew what they were doing when they chose his replacement. Can't wait for their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alive or Just Breathing","review":"This is definitely Killswitch's best album to date. Everyone in this band is very talented and really deserve all the attention they get (except for the new singer...ugh). The only problem I have with this CD is the singing, which is way to emo.

Buy this album if you wanna get your ass kicked around by a great metal album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the Rage","review":"This is one awesome cd. The singer screams with a rage that fits the music perfectly. Yes the singer screams and yells but he does sing too. Hightlights on the cd includeNumbered Days - the vesrse towards the end is awesome.Self Revolution - my favorite of all, with a great chorus that will make you want to yell along with it.My Last Serenade - just an all around cool song.Life To Lifeless - crazy intro, it is about 9-11-01.The Element Of One - one of the mellower songs on the disc.Rise Inside - another cool song, this one makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"ferrets are cute, roadrunner sucks","review":"i love the self titled release on ferret records, but i hate the rest on roadrunner records. i was betrayed when i purchased alive or just breathing, when i found that not only the band had been pussified, but 2 of the tracks on the self titled release had been re-recorded and pussified as well. i love screaming, and hate harmonized choruses and uninspired melodies. i find now that i am too metal for KSE. a damn shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEH","review":"My friend let me borrow this album along with Between The Buried and Me's first album and Converge: Jane Doe.FIRST OFF: THE OPENING RIFFS IN \\"MY LAST SERENADE\\" WERE STOLEN FROM SLAYER'S \\"GHOST OF WAR\\" FROM THE ALBUM SOUTH OF HEAVEN... minus the double bass... I'm surprised nobody pointed that out yet...I didn't catch on with this band nor did I enjoy this album. There's just something about them that I don't like. It's probably because music like this has already been done before and there really isn't anything 'great' or 'new' about the type of music on this album.If you've never listened to any of Metallica's older stuff, Slayer, and Hatebreed, you're probably gonna think this stuff is amazing.

Historical mysteries are pretty tiresome if they are not extremely well-written & there are a few very good ones in here, but they drown in the mediocrity of the rest of the stories. How many various time periods can you honestly claim to have believable detectives working when oftentimes the culture & history of the period would make it completely impossible for anyone to be a Holmes-like figure? It's just too hard to suspend my disbelief long enough to get into the stories & most of them are so simplistic & easy to solve that you can turn to the end to confirm your guess & then move on to the next story.

Bailey's The Luddite Rebellion, it seems now, was doomed from the start. The tale of the Luddites, those impoverished English hosiery workers who smashed machines in the 1800s, does not merit a whole book. The primary material on the topic is quickly exhuasted, and what is left are drawn-out discussions on whether the machine-smashers were politically motivated or not, and the ins and outs of a few insignificant trials. In addition, Bailey's more emotional outbursts against capitalist exploitation only detract from the seriousness of the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Screen","review":"The screen is very good, the pull system works fine, the only bad thing is how the screen is shipped to customers!... the packaging is not very good and the screen housing will bend if the box is dropped or mishandled.

It focuses on respect and responsibility for people within the context the classroom, which will then extend (hopefully)beyond. An excellent choice for a new teacher or someone who has been teaching and wants to teach children to be responsible for their own behaviour instead of taking on the role of constantly managing others behavior. Students are encouraged to problem solve and respect group decisions. This philosopy requires commitment on the part of the teacher to constantly teach respect and responsibility for self and others along with the curriculum. The philosophy is positive one and one children readily respond to since it honors and challenges them to think about how their behaviour effects others and themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The X-men Inferno hardcover is verrrrrrry different from the paperback!!!!!!!!!!

Copyright 1996, it shows beautifully the Voyager crew as they were at that time. Certainly, we've learned new things about the characters as the seasons progressed, and later novels reflect this, but these first efforts should not be dismissed just because they may not fit what we now know.Besides, this one was chock full of references to Chakotay's Native American heritage, which was, in fact, integral to the plot - something sorely lacking in the show after about the second season. For this reason (and also because it's still a Kes-inclusive story), it's worth the read.Okay, so the plot was a teensy bit predictable (two alien races at war, with a big secret between them), but why is that bad? This is a Star Trek tale, ferheavensake, it doesn't have to be the world's greatest novel. It just has to be a lively and entertaining ensemble story that makes me feel good at the end.

Yes, some simple jobs in America are bound to be exported. Yes, this will cause some pain and hardship for many. These are the costs of free trade. The government should use some of the gains from trade to provide training for those who are layed off. I apologize to those who do not understand this most basic economic principle.

The reasons why could be debated forever. But no matter what your political views, it's hard to dispute the central premise of this book--that our government's policies are hurting the average person.I'm not a political expert and I don't pretend to know if Mr. Dobbs got all of his facts straight. His writing can be a little dry and repetitive, and I'm taking one star off because I don't think he offers any real solutions.

You read this book and wonder: Can we save our country? What Lou Dobbs presents is a shocker. True, we may have been aware of most of the problems on a piecemeal basis. But when all the major problems are presented in a very easy-to-understand, concise manner, Lou's book surely must get every thinking man's attention. What I also like is that Lou blames and criticizes both parties--rare in today's political polarization which can destroy our country.Can we get our politicians (unfortunately, not many \\"statesmen\\" around) to think country first instead of party? Will corporate America realize that they are contributing heavily to the demise of America with their selfish agendas? It's a must read. Get it! Read it!

I was gripped by both books and could hardly put them down till finished. As a young female journalist and \\"baby buddhist\\" I was impressed with the material presented to support reincarnation, and also admiration for this writer who has done a great service in helping westerners better understand the buddhist concept of rebirth. I urge the author to make more of her work available on the Internet as she truly possesses a very special gift - her communication skills are excellent. As a strong admirer of the woman and her work, I may be criticised for being biased - I refute this by saying I have \\"checked up\\" and recommend both books highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear, honest, thrilling - best book on tulkus in print","review":"As a Buddhist practioner and student of one of the tulkus featured in Ms. MacKenzie's book, it was gratifying to see such clear and honest portrayal of how these teachers are appearing in the West to benefit beings.

This one was tempting. The topic is an excellent and intriguing one: Tibetan teachers being reborn in the West. However there is apparently not a lot to say on the subject as she drags in a variety of unrelated parapsychological material on reincarnation in order to pad the measly amount she actually writes on the tulkus. Her style is awful. She talks down to her audience and takes a \\"Gee Whiz!\\" mentality towards the whole subject that left me wondering if she was truly impressed with the tulkus or so disbelieving that she was making fun of them by overstatement. Unfortunately this is the only book on this subject that I am aware of, so I can't point elsewhere, but this one may be worse than nothing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"Our 13 year old daughter really picked up on this game.

Not even going to try to put this on our door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't state that it is designed for doors inside the house","review":"I bought this to replace the one we had, as the flap had cracked. I wanted the same model and size, so it would fit the hole in the door w/o modifications. Picture looked the same, measurements were too, so I ordered it. What the description lacked is that it is not made for doors that lead to the outside. This one has no weather stripping (hair-like brushes) like the old one.

It took my 5 year old cat 5 minutes to adjust and my second cat who is 4 about 2 days to get used to it. They are both big boys (15-17 pounds each) and they have no problem fitting through it. There is a small magnet at the bottom which keeps the flap in place and it has allowed us to keep the door closed which is saving on our cost to heat the house. This is very affordable and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what we needed","review":"This little cat door is perfect for an interior door between rooms. It was easy to install, but the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the instructions were really, well-- dumb. Thank goodness my husband is used to doing some similar projects so he could figure out the idiot sheet!! If it had been up to me, the cat door would still be in the box.My kitten figured out the door right away, and he uses it -- keeping the odor from his cat box contained in the mud room and not in the house.

I replaced the glass with plexiglass and then installed the cat flap with ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I can't believe more people haven't complained about the fact that this door has no tunnel! It means that if installed in a hollow-core door, you can see the guts of the door. We were going to use this for the kitty powder room but didn't because we didn't want cat liter or poop ending up inside the door! They offered some peel-and-stick black foam to cover up the gap. Now THAT'S CLASSY! What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy cheap cat door","review":"This cat flap has no weather stripping around the door and the locking mechanism is a sliding piece of plastic that catches on a tiny protrusion on the flap. It is so poorly constructed that the one I ordered arrived with the little piece of plastic broken off (I found it in the box it was shipped in). Thanks to Amazon, they issued me a full refund and I immediately purchased Cat Mate Lockable Flap Cat Door which is a couple dollars more but well worth it. It is weather-stripped and has a sturdy locking mechanism. It is the same type slider lock as the cheaply made one, but it is well designed. Both doors are identical in size and nearly the same in appearance but you will be much better off with the other one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The installation was fairly quick and easy. I installed 2 in less than 45 minutes. I would have given it 5 stars if the back of the door screwed in like the front.

Mind you, my cat's not tiny- he's a good 16 lbs! He's gone crazy and rolled all over because his paw gets stuck. There is nothing more horrifying than hearing your baby cry out in pain. It's annoying.

I won't say don't buy this, just be aware of what your are buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of CARP","review":"The latch on this door is very poorly made, even if it would work it is almost impossible to bend over and actually secure it. I ended up having to remove the latching mechanism and screw brackets on either side of the flap so I could use a paint stirring stick as a drop bar.I am now trying to find a cat door with a simple slide down cover that does not cost $60.So if you want to buy two doors and install them twice, buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good kitty door","review":"It is not expensive but does the job quite well.

This door is so much more than I expected. It has a little magnet in it to stop the door swinging after my cats go through, helping to keep air drafts at bay.

From reading it you can easily tell it was hastily put together. It holds no new information except what LaVey's divulges about his personality.

Its major flaw is it discusses obscure topics that would interest no one (except maybe LaVey)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh","review":"This book does contain a few good perspectives and essays, but I wouldn't waste my time. When I say a few, I mean a few. The further and further I got into the book, the less impressed I was with LaVey, and the more I considered him a JOKE.

It was a pity to delve into this work of short essays and find myself saying over and over, \\"What the hell is he talking about?\\" He has departed much from his usual crystal clear, in-your-face logical approach and adopted a confusing contradictory style of presenting topics.

Little indepth social theories, applications or practices compared to his earlier work (which ripped off Ragner Redbeard, Wilhelm Reich, P.T. Barnum, Ayn Rand, and Aleister Crowley, often without attribution). Hardly cutting edge or even relevant, but LaVey will always have a market in angst ridden teenagers.

Anton Szandor LaVey cuts right to the bone with this one. It is much more than mere rantings; It is a Rampage. He goes on an all out assault. No one is spared in this new tirade on the Human Condition. He attacks everyone from social workers to occultists. People whom he makes clear need to get a life (or maybe just need to get laid). He simply gets to the point and explains his dislike for these, and other, \\"Tasmanian Fleas.\\" He tells you what he really thinks of people and society.

My philosophy on life was almost identical even before I read the book. \\"Satan Speaks\\" Was also intelligent in it's wording, but it really didn't seem to say much, having little to no important or insightful content. Many of the chapters were not only pointless, but completely rediculous and added nothing to the book. Satan Speaks seems like a collection of essays that was probably better left unpublished.

That said, there was absolutely no damage to it - I swear if I could clean it up a bit the store would have taken back from me, convinced it had never been used. Since then, Ive taken this bag on a good number of extended trips (urban/tourist backpacking - not the wilderness kind) with the same result.

I was wrong. I liked the premise, and it started off pretty good, but lost its charm about 1/3 of the way through. I agree with the reviewer who described the writing style as 'heavy handed'. I also had issues with the general likeability of the characters. 'Pepper', the best friend, is described as some hottie, boy-magnet, but comes across with about as much charm as truck driver. And I gradually grew to dislike 'Frances' (the deathmaiden), finding her to be critical, self righteous and overly-dramatic. When, after an unsettling discovery, Frances strips and throws herself into the ocean, as though to cleanse the filth of what she has learned from her being, I had to put the book down. I spent the rest of the bus ride contently counting potholes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning new talent","review":"This is a captivating and unique story, with a heroine who has a unique profession - that of deathmaiden, someone who eases the passage into the next world. You will believe that Frances Oliver and the Society of Deathmaidens actually exists (who knows? Maybe it does). Also unique is the author's strong voice and lyrical prose. I can't remember the last time I actually enjoyed reading descriptive passages, but Ruth Francisco can really make you feel like you can see, hear and smell the story as it unfolds. I can't speak too highly of this book!

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really creaks to the end","review":"It starts out as an interesting premise, but you can see this is a first time novel by the heavy-handed way in which the author feeds us the information about the duties of a deathmaiden and their supposed organization and philosophy. Add to that all the background on the Maya cannabilistic practices, and we lose sight of the characters, who are not really intriguing enough to sustain this book. A worthy first effort which could have used a great deal more editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Death and this Maiden","review":"Tomas, a little boy, dies under the care of Frances Oliver, a deathmaiden. She is a member of the fictional Society of Deathmaidens, a hospice-like Dr. Kevorkian-esque group that acts as midwives to the dying, helping them transition with dignity. But Frances starts asking questions into Tomas' death. From the start, this unusual computer-and-TV-spurning heroine with friends such as the eccentric artist and deathmaiden would-have-been Pepper, gets tangled into an intriguing plotthat takes a long time to reach its conclusion and uncover the evidence, but offers twists and turns; there has to be some suspense in this mystery, after all, but it's Frances' soul reflections and inner struggle that drive the book, as well as an exploration of the meaning of medicine and the value of death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good begginer book","review":"A good book for learning the basics of kit methods.

The sound quality is likely not any better than previous issues of all of these songs, in fact it theoretically could be louder and more distorted given the way music on cd is mastered these days, but it could be that they used the old 16 Biggest Hits master and didn't even re-master the recordings. Save your money, buy the cheaper 16 Biggest Hits cd, and avoid pieces of junk like this that are put out because record companies cannot think of new ways to market recordings without rehasing the exact same thing over and over again.

When teaching my boys about slavery, I want them to really be able to get an idea of the plight of the slaves themselves, not just the impact on the U.S. as a country or an overview of the slave trade and the dissension that led to the Civil War. This book provides the perfect tool for showing the boys that the slaves of early U.S. weren't just a faceless entity, but a people who deserve our compassion, and a culture that has been passed down to African-Americans the boys know today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a workout","review":"I just tried the pilates section of this dvd.

While it starts out with the 'birth' of the human torch, soon many random superheros and super villains are incorporated within the book. There's lots of action, but the reader doesn't really care who wins or who loses, since other than the torch and the protagonist (a photographer) there is absolutely no characterization! Obviously the author is trying to pack in as many superheros/supervillains into one book as he can. There's almost nothing to keep you turning the pages in this book and i am surprised i even finished it. I recommend sticking with a book that focuses on just one hero (or one group of heros, such as with the X-Men). Don't waste your time reading this book with no plot or characterization.Idea to fellow female readers: Check out \\"Merridian\\" instead. It is way cool.To female and male readers: pick up an ordinary comic book or a good graphic novel like Galaxy Express 999."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT GRAPHIC NOVEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book was a great representation of the Marvel superheroes coming from just your average Joe, in this case a reporter with no super powers at all.

A much better alternative for hiding scratches is Mohawk Furniture Scratch Remover. I have used Mohawk with amazing results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful, but not a miracle","review":"I imagined this would be like a large chapstick, but it's really tightly wound cloth wrapped in paper and saturated in an oily substance. Maybe it can remove the most superficial of scratches, but if the scratch has any depth to it at all, it will still be visible from certain angles. We bought this to remove cat scratches from our dining room table. The product has definitely made the scratches less visible and given the wood a nice, well-conditioned sheen. But like I say, the scratches are still there -- you just don't notice them as much.

Applying the product to the scratch left a conspicuously shiny area, while also marginally covering the scratch. You'd have to be seriously myopic to NOT see the scratch still.Other reviewers note success on furniture scrached by pets. I believe this product would be far more successful on multiple, less deep scratches left from claws on a housecat. It even notes on the side of the container that the product should not be used on deep scratches, but I would not have characterized my scratch as deep at all.All in all, not worth the $9 I spent on it (although my landlord accepted the attempt at repair).

I dunno what Eltron was thinking when they let some pinhead design the cover for this thing, but then the Edsel got onto the market too, didn't it?That said, the trimmer itself is great, and you get a feel with it that the quality of the motor and blades is a step above everything else available. It cuts cleanly and doesn't pull or snag on those little cables us over-40-somethings seem to sprout in the tips of our noses. It doesn't cut quite as close as the lesser-quality trimmers do, but I won't quibble over that. My Eltron hasn't bit me yet, and that's a big deal!Bottom line, this is a terrifc trimmer hidden in a really stupid case. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five.

She still will bark through the correction if someone comes to the door, but is much faster to respond to my \\"Quiet\\". I will probably send this one on with her to her \\"forever\\" home and get another one for the next dog. She doesn't seem to be learning not to bark which is why it is only 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innoek Automatic No Bark Dog Collar, BC-50B","review":"My 17lb dog would screech when his bark got loud enough to trigger the jolt. He has learned not to bark as loud but my wife felt it was too harsh and has hidden the collar from me. I believe it was worth the expense and almost solved the barking problem.

Easy return though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont think it works","review":"This comes with a 6volt battery, but I almost threw it away due to packaging. Once inserted into the big box housing, its a simple screw to secure everything in place. The collar is long enough to fit around my bulldogs giant neck, but doens't have so much excess that it's a safety hazard. My gripe is that the box has a light on it and no matter which way I had the battery face, it did not light up. How do I know if this thing even is doing what it's supposed to???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works alright, not extremely effective","review":"This collar was used for a Miniature Pinscher. He managed to find the threshold for this device and still barks. He also completely ignores the device if someone particularly scary enters our domain. He remains quiet for regular visitors, however, and this was a relief. All in all, for anything larger than a Jack Russell it would probably be completely ineffective and for even as small a dog as ours it wasn't fully as efficient as we hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken on arrival","review":"This collar arrived today. First thing I noticed was that the box on the collarrattled when handled. I opened the plug to put the battery in (positive end up) and found the insides of the box moved around making it difficult to get the plug back in. I put the collar on my GSD. She has a big bark but the collar had absolutely no effect on her.I tested the collar on a hard non glass surface like the instructions say and the indicator light didn't come on. I put another new battery in the collar and re-tested it. No indicator light.

I have worked with many different breeds and sometimes there is a barking issue, as I have about 12 fruit trees filled with birds and squirrels. I was very excited about this product and it was my first \\"shock\\" collar experience. The ultra-sonic collar had no effect on my dogs fixation at talking to the birds, rodents, and sky. The other dogs would just sit and stare at him. The collar has been used daily for almost a month and it is not going off, correcting or working. I just sit and watch him bark with it on for a full hour with no obvious corrections and this is a typical day. I called the company after the first week of this and they told me to give it time - well I think a month is long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Effective","review":"Our 13-pound dog is much better behaved with this collar on!

Pretty poor battery if it died after a few hours use !Either that or the dog got used to being shocked and it did not work. Either way , I'm not very happy with its performance. I think a training collar would have been a better choice.The collar was working when I first got it. I actually tried it on myself and got a nasty shock! It WAS very painful!

He was baby and my guardian. It scared so bad he is gone now. Had him such a baby I couldln't walk and he was very protective of me he was really hurting that day. I just want to let you know the collar go off at any time. I called company no symphothy from them but thats ok I'm not done.

It is more effective and more humane to work with a trainer who can teach you and your dog how to get barking and being quiet on command control. You also need to control your dog's access to windows and other sources of stimulation. It takes time and energy but is the only fix for these problems. Both shock and citronella are ineffective and really not kind. They're a quick fix that doesn't work. Remember that these behaviors have been going on for quite awhile so self-reinforcing before we owners actually make a plan to effectively change behavior so it will take a little while to see improvement. Be patient and do the work. Just like getting in shape as people, there are no shortcuts. I know it's not easy -- I had the same problem with my sheltie. Only training worked. She's fine now. I also don't let her by the picture window when I'm gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functions as promised but ineffective","review":"This product works but it is ineffective with my dog.

When I put this collar on him, I saw the red light flash which is supposed to indicate the collar is buzzing. The directions explain that the collar will automatically adjust its intensity level if the dog continues to bark. The problem is there are only four levels so if you have a dog that requires a higher level of intensity in order to work, then this collar will not work for your dog. I tried the collar at least five or six times to be sure the highest setting was being activated and still, he continued to bark as if he felt nothing. I will never waste my money on this type of product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This collar never worked","review":"I ordered this very expensive collar for my dog and it never, ever worked. It doesn't say that it is supposed to have an indicator light or anything, and it is only triggered by the dog barking, so it was difficult to tell whether it was working. Finally my boyfriend bravely put it on his neck and yelled to make it work. It didn't. I replaced the battery, thinking the one that had come with it was bad.

My call was answered quickly the representative was polite and took my information then sent out a replacement unit asking only that I send back this unit, post paid by them. However my dog still ignores the replacement collar. I have another innotek collar that is radio controlled, my dog respects that one although it doesn't have much range, I think it's there cheapest model.I also tried another brand bark collar off the internet, cheap. It worked but it was sound activated and my other dog set it off or her tags hitting her food bowl could set it off. I would put it on occasionally, but it ate batteries and soon fell apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Anti-Bark System, Bad Actual Collar","review":"I bought this collar for my German Shepherd and it worked great.

Until he somehow got the collar off, chewed it and crushed the box (it was destroyed). If they could put the box on a better collar it would be a 5 star item. This dog is 2 years old, has been through 4-6 different collars (while growing) and never even touched any of them.

He barked about 5 times, figured out he didn't like the result and has been quiet ever since. He's also alot less hyper than before. I suspect if I take the collar off, he'll remain quiet. But if he starts up again, the collar will be put right back on.Excellent product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for the price","review":"I have this collar on both my dogs. It works fairly well as long as it keeps contact. The only problem I've found is that it has to be put on very tight, has a tendency to work around the neck (so it's not in the right place), and doesn't work as well on dogs with thicker/longer hair.

For some reason the collar never activated. So I tested it to make sure it was working and it was. Then I called Innotek's Customer Service to talk to them about the problem. I was told to trim the hair from her neck around her voice box to make sure the contacts could touch her skin. So I trimmed her hair put the collar on and made sure the contacts were on her skin. She heard something started barking and once again it never activated. The little red light never came on or started to flash. I swear I think she barked more with it on. It has been a total waste of money. Invest in a $1 squirt bottle you can put water in. That's what I've done and it's helped. When she starts barking I just squirt her and say no and she stops."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch! shock w/o bark!","review":"My dog had a bad reaction to this device.

Everyone said that they only had to use the collar a few times, and the dog picked up that they should not bark anymore. My dog just loves to bark; I know the collar is shocking him because he jumps and makes a yelping sound, but he continues to bark until the collar reaches maximum shocking capacity. When the collar is on maximum, the shock sends his 12 pound body to jump and convulse, and he makes a screaming sound that is very scary. As soon as I take the collar off (because this just seems like torture), he returns to barking. He barks at all other dogs, except for his friend dogs. This collar is a failure for my dog's barking issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yap Zapper!","review":"I don't mind dogs, but when they decide to bark because they think it served thier purpose to do so, this lil wonder saves you the trouble of running around and reminding them who is the alpha of the pack and that they need to shut up.

The same shock as an invisible fence system.I read some reviews that described it as being just like the old wind up hand buzzers that we used to use when we were kids.What planet did you grow up on?

At first we could figure out why it wasn't shocking when she barked but when we tried making it tighter we saw results. You can tell right away when it shocks. Our dog caught on pretty fast. She only had to get shocked three times and now doesn't even try it. She hardly wears it now because if she starts to bark too much now I yell the command \\"no bark!\\" and hold up the collar and she stops. I don't even need to put it on her.

It zapped him once on the first day then nothing after that. I took out the battery to reset it and it zapped on the first bark then nothing after. It now doesnt zap him at all or it is so faint that he doesnt care. I have a training collar that zaps also. It has settings for 1 through 10 (10 being strongest). I can put on level 1 and hit the button and he responds. I have used on myself and it is a very faint shock but enough to stop in his tracks. This barking collar must not even be that strong. It is a total waste of money and time. having to take out the battery for 1 minute to reset it is crazy. It should just shock and that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my dog","review":"I am really sorry I purchased this item. I followed the directions closely and adjust (and readjusted) the collar multiple times. I am not new to adjusting these types of collars because we have an invisible fence system and my dogs must wear prong collars daily. This no-bark collar does nothing, and my dog just continues to bark at passing dogs, mail van, UPS truck, etc. Also, that battery they show for you to order is not the correct one for this collar! I had to order the Pet-Safe Deluxe Bark Control Collar, PDBC-300, and it worked the first day I used it. It also came with an operating book and has multiple levels easily adjustable to your dog.

Relying on the first two reviews, thinking that it was a great book, I bought it.Didn't take me long to realize the exaggeration on the usefulness of the book. It seems to be mixing some New Age flavor into it if you listen to the CD. Yes, I agree with later reviews. The singing was unpleasant.Next time I will wait for more reviews to be posted before making any purchase again. A valuable lesson: Pay serious attention to negative reviews especially those that comment on the actual content."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Needs Improvement!!","review":"The singing is BAD!! I will not use it for meditation as I find the singing too modernized. The text of the book is below average.

Also there is no coverage of the origin and/or beliefs behind the mantras.A waste of money in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything But Soothing","review":"I listened to the CD and wondered if any of the previous reviewers ever listened to it. It was bad, real bad. Too much of New Age flavor in the music and also the singer's (yes, sounded more like singing than chanting) control of voice was deplorable. Read the book... the singer is the author's daughter. Better get someone who can sing properly... I cannot imagine how anyone can use this CD for meditation purpose. So bad that I am not going to use the CD ever again.There isn't much info about the mantras either. If you have the chance to get hold of a copy, browse through and you will agree with me.I was hoping to get a book with a decent CD of mantras. This is definitely NOT what I expected. There are better ones out there, I am sure.

Granted - we do simple billing with no variable rates, no stock prices as someone listed below, and no changes in product (i.e. therapy or testing). Statements look great, bookkeeping takes just minutes a week, and everything is compatible with my accountant.

They're essentially two separate programs that even my CPA, who teaches Quickbooks for the PC, couldn't even figure out. He was lost right out of the chute, so he called Intuit and after a being on hold for 20 minutes was told that \\"yep, the Mac version doesn't have many of the features that come with the PC version.\\" His pronouncement was that the Mac version sucks compared to the PC edition. It's not unusual for there to be minor differences between PC and Mac versions of various software programs but Quickbooks is the worst by far. If you're a Mac ranger, do your research and comparo before you buy. Sorry I spent the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get it to run","review":"I couldn't even get this program to run. Actually, it did run on my Mac under a different username -- one with virtually nothing else installed -- but wouldn't work under my username. Calls to support were useless. I got the usual drone-type replies where they were obviously copying-and-pasting some responses that had little or nothing to do with my problem and generally didn't even relate to my operating system (OS X).Of course, having opened the product, it was too late to return it. So I was simply out the money on a product that doesn't work at all for me.Given all this, I think one star is perhaps too much. Under some conditions, the product simply doesn't work at all, and if it doesn't work for you, you will lose your money with no recourse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so \\"QuickBooks\\"","review":"MacMoney has been a premier accounting program for the Mac for years.

If you're like me, your accountant and bookkeeper are on Windoz - that's why I was psyched when I thought I would really be able to share my Mac QB files with them, and vice-versa. Mistake #1 - I give my bookkeeper a backup from QB 2006 before I updated to 2007. BIG mistake. QB is not backward compatable. So when my bookkeper sent the file back to me in Mac format, (after spending hours updating it), I was not able to import it into QB 2007. To me, this is nuts. But the helpful tech person we spoke with, suggested that even if it had been '07 this sharing business between Mac and Windows versions is sort of a one time deal. This wasn't intended to be a back and forth thing, between Mac and Windows. Huh? So what's the point? Here's my work-around: I bought a used XP box on eBay and am trading my Mac '07 for Windoz '07."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGGHH! Stick with the PC version if you can!","review":"Wow! What a disappointment. I moved over from QBPro 2003 for PC to QBpro 2007 for Mac. I thought I was moving forward, but it is a huge step backwards. The functionality and feature set of the Mac 2007 version are way behind what I had on the 2003 PC version. Printing reports and customer statements is a joke! The window layout is amateurish with no sense of function. What happened, Intuit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No doubt great but unsuitable for the UK","review":"Being a devoted Mac fan forced to work on a PC due to software constraints I was really excited to learn that Quickbooks was available in this format. I was unable to purchase it in the UK but quickly found it for sale in the US. Following installation I tried to open an existing Quickbooks (PC) file and discovered that this was not possible. I then spent a lot of time on forums, e-mailing Intuit and calling help lines trying to find out why. Bizarrely US and UK versions are incompatible and Intuit has no plans to release a UK version. PC and Mac versions of Quickbooks are also very reluctant to communicate with each other and a trial version is needed to bridge the gap. I wasted time and money in buying this product and wouldn't want others to make the same mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just got it and they have done some excellent upgrades","review":"In QB 2007 for Mac I appreciate them adding more time saving features. For instance, I really like the \\"Add Icons to the Tool Bar\\" presentation. It is very easy to do and less confusing than previous editions.The other thing I really like is the new Tutorial Center. It was informative and fast. It is also interactive which is an excellent way to retain the training it just gave you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable","review":"Intuit has treated Mac users as second-class for years and this release is one more example. There are dozens - maybe hundreds - of things this release of Quickbooks doesn't do that have been available in the Windows version for years. Example? You can't even sort a register in this version! From an accounting point of view...well, let's say it's a waste of money. If you want a professional accounting application for the Mac that most people can use with a little investment in learning, buy MYOB/AccountEdge. PLEASE do not waste your money on Quickbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Downhill","review":"I recently upgraded with this product from the Pro version of 1998 and in that time they gutted the power of the program requiring a subscription service to process payroll at a minimum of $25/mo when the user could do it before. This is a substantial cost impact for a small business with only a few employees (in my case, the payroll service would cost me $6.50 per paycheck!) Quickbooks makes big promises but is now segmenting their products so as to keep the revenue coming in and costing the small business more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great product, but Mac users get a rough deal","review":"So why does it get 1 star. Well the PC version can do more than the Mac version. The Mac version is crippled, and for no real reason.You can not network this on a Mac (PC supports 5 users, Mac just 1).You can not create sales orders & custom price levels (but can on the PC version).You can not accept credit card payments in QuickBooks.I looked at MYOB (you can network MYOB) and at Quickbooks. Quickbooks won only because this was for at home. I use MYOB at work ( we have 7 people access MYOB AccountEdge). The interface on QuickBooks is cleaner. The Invoice LAyout tool a breeze. The option to backup to .Mac is great (for home use)When the developers finally stop cutting corners and make the Mac version as feature complete as the PC version it will be a good product. If you need any of the points listed above then choose MYOB and not quickbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No payroll","review":"For several years I used QB for Windows, but for the past couple I didn't use it and in the mean time all my Windows machines died or were replaced by Macs. So I got QB for Mac. One of the two major things I need it for, payroll, is not supported on the Mac. For those who don't know, the payroll feature is not just about paying employees (I have none but myself,) it's also about knowing how big a check to write to yourself based on what was on invoices; computing withholding; printing your check and the withholding checks to send to state and federal gov't; printing a W-2 at the end of the year; getting a breakdown on exactly what you were paid for. None of this is available on the Mac version. That is absolutely incomprehensible to me.On the bright side, it did cost more than the Windows version.I'm so angry at Intuit I will probably not even use TurboTax again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as QuickBooks Windows experience","review":"We have used QuickBooks on a PC since the 1990's. We loved the way Inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting. QuickBooks for Mac is TERRIBLE in comparison. If you plan to use the payroll features, it is unusable. QuickBooks Mac payroll redirects you to the internet, where it is handled by PayCycle (an independent company). Payroll is not integrated at all in the Mac (instead import/export operation). On the PC, it is part of the QuickBooks application. We could not get job costing to work, and the tax calculations made no sense. We were paying TONS of money to PayCycle, so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically. We finally reverted back to QuickBooks for Windows and are MUCH happier with Intuit handling our payroll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Registration takes forever!!","review":"Registering most software is a process that has been streamlined until it is mostly painless. Not so with Quickbooks Pro for Mac. After buying a copy, I could only open it 8 times before I HAD to register the product - the online registration process failed so I HAD to register by phone. After keying in my license info, I was put on hold for 5 minutes. The agent laboriously re-typed all of my information and tried to sell me more stuff. The agent balked when I asked to complain about this to a supervisor. The software seems OK, but Intuit's system for extracting information out of paying customers is odious and time consuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of antiquated junk","review":"I upgraded from 2005 for only 3 reasons.1) I wanted a universal binary version for my new macbook pro. 2005 had a habit of crashing every now and then.2) I wanted to be able to synchronise my address book with the OS X address book.3) I hoped that they had updated some of the antiquated interface behaviour.The result. I got none of the above.1) It still crashes. Probably more often..2) Absolutley useless. It insists on using quickbook entries rather than OS X address book entries.

It is so archaic and totally formatted for PC Users.Mac people are visually oriented and this is classic CPA stuff without any good ideas.

Then came the payroll entries. If you must do payroll, avoid this product! You cannot process payroll from within QBPro. You must either use the Quickbooks online service (and trust all of your employees' personal information to the nameless, faceless employees of a company somewhere in cyberspace) or use a stand alone payroll application from a third party developer that is a total piece of crap. I've been using a 12-year-old copy of MYOB that works great except that it does run on the new Macs. When we decided to \\"upgrade\\" to QBPro at the recommendation of our accountant, we had no idea of the level of frustration and disappointment that was in store.

Now I understand that to do payroll, you HAVE to pay monthly fees to one of two outside companies to actually do payroll. Only doing a few payroll checks a month does not justify the ~$25/month fee for us. In our older version (QB 4), you used to be able to manually input the tax withholding info and generate tax forms (941, 940, W-2) to at least use as a guideline for manually doing IRS paperwork. Now... no way. You apparently cannot bypass this step and manually enter anything in payroll. You can buy an Excel spreadsheet on e-bay to do payroll, but we are not sure how to tie that in with QB. Intuit does mention this issue in small print, but we did not understand the roadblock this would be to using QB 2007. We are not pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot adjust check layout","review":"QBPro only includes three check layouts without any ability to adjust individual fields on the check.

At least Intuit makes improvements every year (not like Microsoft!)- sometimes they are noticeable (like the very cool layout designer) and other times they are \\"under the hood\\" (like the export ease to a windows file and back again to a mac file). Having been a user for almost 10 years and being a major campaigner to get QB upgraded past version 4, I am so happy (and willing to upgrade yearly) that Intuit has a new found appreciation for us Mac users.

When taken in doors the picture always casted a dark shadow behind. My advice is if you are planning to buy this camera, make sure you buy it from a vendor that will allow you to return this camera.

Just really poorly executed in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My","review":"The concept is brilliant but the production is horrid.

However, there are a few things that I'd much like to see in a revised edition. First and foremost, nutritional values. There aren't any in this book. For anyone who is dieting and trying to stay frugal, this isn't the book for you. The recipes use alot of meat, cheese and everything has alot of butter and all pans are \\"greased\\" first.The book reminds me alot of the recipes grandma used to make. I loved them. I still do and this book is good. However, my waist-line and cholessterol don't.If you like your basic old fashioned recipes then order it. You'll love it.

Recieved my book today and even my husband was interested in reading it! I have been searching for years for recipes such as crackers (this book provides 2) and pita bread as well as homemade tortillas.

Good job Tawra."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Pennypinchers!","review":"For families on a budget and for families that want to get back to the basics of real cooking!We started out needing a budget and needing to save money to pay off debts, Tawra's book helped us slash our grocery bill -the tips and the recipes, along with her success story, made us feel as though it was possible. The humor in it also made it feel down to earth and not preachy as other frugal cookbooks have seemed.Tawra encourages substituting items for cheaper ones and for experimenting with the guides she has set. I can imagine her in my kitchen telling me to go ahead and use the fresh peas from my garden (and therefore cheaper) than the canned or frozen variety. Or to use less cheese or more spice, etc.Good for beginners and experienced cooks alike, it really sets the challenge to spend less and eat better!Thank you, Tawra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, truly frugal cooking","review":"These days, too many recipes featured in magazines and cooking shows are \\"gourmet\\" - expensive and time-consuming. This book is different. It offers easy, money saving recipes and even some Jar Mix recipes for gift baskets. It is perfect for the cook who has to get good food on the table while staying within a budget. I think students, homemakers, single parents and anyone on a tight budget who wants to eat well would especially like this book. The only part that disappointed me was the meat section, which was just not as comprehensive as I would have liked. For example, there are no ground meat recipes that I could find. Ground beef is low cost and can be used in dozens of recipes. Also, crock pot cooking, a frugal and easy option, is not listed. However, this book is still well worth purchasing and anyone who uses it regularly will save money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss","review":"I returned this book.

I found it of no use for actually making nutritious family meals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cookbook if you are looking for ways to save money","review":"What I like about this cookbook was that a lot of the recipes look appetizing. The author lists the length of what kinds of foods can be in the freezer, ways to cut down on grocery costs etc. The author also lists tips about cooking throughout the book which I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like visiting with an old friend!","review":"This book epitomizes \\"comfort food\\" for me and my family. I reach for it several times a week, and not just for meal planning. It is wonderful for science projects with my kindergartener and preschooler, great for teaching 2 teens how to do some basic cooking, and makes gift-giving a snap (homemade playdough is a *huge* hit at birthday parties when the kids get to pick their own colors! ;). Definitely a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cookbook you will turn to again and again!","review":"I just love \\"Not Just Beans\\". This is the type of cookbook I wish I would have had when I was learning how to cook. I have bought some \\"frugal\\" cookbooks before and have been very disappointed in the variety of recipes. This cookbook has a ton of great recipes, and you won't be disappointed. No, it is not a vegetarian cookbook (the title doesn't say it is), but you will reduce your meat consumption and keep your food budget lower if you give some of these great recipes a try. Two thumbs up for Tawra and her mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I have used this book at least once a week since I purchased it! The recipes are quick, easy & yummy!

I read the first half of the book before I decided that it was a collassal waste of my time because I needed to participate in a discussion event at B-school. No one could tell that I only read half the book because the chapters did not progress in content. And what was worse, I had several classmates who only browsed sections of the book and were also able to effectively participate in the conversation.

The world is changing rapidly and Pink explains how the 3 A's (abundance, automation and Asia) will continue to change how people live and work.

But don't go away, because we still need you.We are entering in age in which we are in need of people that can see answers to problems that don't even exist yet. We need people who can tell stories, see the big picture, and can feel for what others are going through. We aren't teaching students how to be at peace with themselves, which only leads to a life of inner turmoil.I like that this book touches base on educational choices- unfortunately we are diminishing the artists in students because our normal education system teaches them that being an artists isn't a lucrative option. But, what we aren't teaching our students is that money can't buy you happiness. Being an artist might.This book has many cool points. I like that Pink gives you steps at the end of each section for you to educate yourself a little bit further on that topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase!","review":"I've read half of the book, and so far I find it very interesting and an easy read. I'm in the middle of grad school, and reading tons of information on brain research. This book is a breeze compared to all of that! It presents some ideas to consider about creativity, the direction our world is going, and the role our nation and children will play in that. Pink was a speaker at the Texas Music Educators Convention this past February which inspired me to order the book (through Amazon rather than pay convention prices!). I BELIEVE you can go to www.tmea.org and find a link to his speech. Pink presents facts and data in an easy-to-read manner, and keeps the interest of the reader. He also finds that delicate balance between humor and hard-core data. Honestly, it is hard to put it down! I also gave the principal of my school a copy...it never hurts to thank an administrator for their hard work, or remind them how important your subject area is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan Pink the Presenter","review":"The author was a presenter at an advertising agency owners' conference that I attended in Montreal last fall. He is an effective speaker who has earned the right to present his material through hard work, tireless research and an infectious belief in his thesis. Having met him in person and after devouring his book, I thoroughly recommend it to school and career counselors as well as anyone who needs to figure out what's going on in our skill-based economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for creatives and business owners","review":"This book has made a huge and positive difference in my personal and professional life. Regardless of what we do for a living, we're all creative in some way. How we apply that creativity is changing more rapidly than at any other time. Our biggest advantage and favor we can do ourselves is to embrace our right-brain characteristics and thrive because of them.Mr. Pink's book is full of useful stories and exercises to help nurture your own right-brain and grow to your full potential. He explains the functioning of the human brain, its left and right sides and how they serve us, in a very approachable manner. His understanding of the functioning of the brain using the fMRI scan technology may appear over simplistic to a field specialist, but the information is intended to guide us through the subsequent chapters that fully engage both the sides of the brain.Long live the era of right-brain thinking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book for Health and Fitness","review":"My teacher made us buy this book. It helped in my classes a lot. Helps with mediation and building greater creativity. Great read as well for leisure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daniel Pink's Attempt to Change the World","review":"As a dominantly left-brained thinker, Daniel Pink's book, A Whole New Mind, Why Right Brainers Will Rule the Future, sent chills through my confidence. His theory states left brained thought processes will be accomplished faster and more efficiently by computers or stolen by outsource recipients. I thought this book was a new type of thinking, but redundant and too abstract for the time. Pink mentions six senses that give a competitive edge, only two of which even remotely relate to the topic at hand. Read this book for information purposes, not pleasure. It was an easy read, but was not engaging; by the seventh chapter I was bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan Pink nails it.","review":"Dan Pink's AWNM is outstanding. Integrating the right and left brains creates an integrated person. An integrated person can engage the world with greater understanding and ability to make a positive difference. The biggest drawback was the cutout of the head on the cover, which caught on to everything, including my fingers as I tried to read the book. A small nuisance for a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink has his finger on the pulse","review":"What I have gotten from this book is that we are moving into an era of American renaissance-- where the right side of the brain finally has parity with the left side. In other words, science, art, the concepts of beauty, quality, and innovativeness will all play an important role in defining our culture.I just hope he is right (hey the Italians did it, why can't we?)-- and may it last 500 years!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole New Mind","review":"I found this title in a magazine I was reading and had to read it!

However, these factors will also make the future difficult for Americans with right-brain skills as these can also be performed by Asians or automation at low cost.Even those with high touch skills are vulnerable - look at the increasing range of jobs being performed by illegal Mexican. At first it started with farm and domestic labor, then on to fast-food and heavy construction labor. Now they increasingly are employed operating machinery and performing carpentry, painting, carpentry, rug-laying, etc. At the same time, President Bush wants to open truck driving to countless Mexican citizens as well. Perhaps the only Americans really safe, even with high-touch skills, are reporters needing a good command of English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommendable","review":"This book not only changed the way I think, it also open my eyes to new things and ideas!Each one of the six senses:Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, Meaning that Daniel describes also has techniques to improve in that sense and also further reading. It's for sure that after reading this books you're going to end with new books in your wish lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dried and Satly Fish Smell","review":"Hey. I am one of the more right-side-of-the-brain people, and I honestly don't like this fishy smelling book. I sincerely could not say exactly why except maybe because I'm just not into ruling the world. Also this book reads too much like dry history or business textbooks I read in the 70s. They too had a dried and salty fish smell from too many assumptions. After hurting my jaw trying to chew on this book for one day, my stomach began to hurt, and I finally tossed this book back into a public library building. It's too young or too dead to have enough meat on it, or to be be digested well. If you need more of a 'left-brain' review than this one, you could read other \\"I don't like\\" this book contributions. I ditto them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A better title for this book would be \\"Things You Realize Just By Paying Attention.\\" This is easily one of the most boring books I've ever read. The author tells you nothing that you haven't already learned by paying attention to marketing and media for the past decade and a half. Not only that, he does so without humor or what I consider to be a narrative flow. I made it just over halfway through the book before I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"More technotrash pseudo-fiction","review":"First let me state that the terms \\"technotrash pseudo-fiction\\" are not intended to be negative in the sense that this book is trash to be ignored or thrown away. What is significant here is the genre of technotrash pseudo-fiction. See the other reviews to get a feel for what I am talking about. The book reads like a story, which it is. It offers up that comfort food satisfaction for the mind that many crave--just like pulp fiction! So, if you are looking for any sort of depth or a cut-to-the-chase analysis, this book is a waste of time--in fact, just browse the book here at Amazon and read the reviews. I use the descriptor pseudo-fiction because the book is not fiction, it is just layman science served up that way.Two stars for being well-written, two stars for lack of depth and far too much fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top pick for business and general-interest libraries alike","review":"For decades the key to surviving in the world has been left-brain thinking with careers keyed to lawyers, accountants and engineers. The future, former White House speechwriter Daniel Pink maintains, is in right-brain thinkers - designers, teachers, creative and empathic professions: A WHOLE NEW MIND tells how to stimulate and use right-brain thinking for maximum profit and achievement, and this audio receives a fine reading by author Pink himself. A top pick for business and general-interest libraries alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book and very insightful writer. I've already passed my copy around to multiple friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new direction...","review":"I'd say this book is necessary for the next generation of workers in America. It provides a new direction for living at the next level of consciousness beyond survival. Though the left brain has gotten us to abundance and automation, it is the right brain that will help generate differentiating ideas for a generation to come. In a world where information is freely available, the information and all the left brain techniques used to manipulate, store and retrieve it are no longer a differentiator."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd like to know just where is this Right Brain Utopia","review":"Wow, things sure sound great in Pink's extravagantly affluent utopia of right brainers! Can I come and play, too?I read that he hails from Northern Virginia someplace...sounds like he's one of those Beltway Bandits sucking at the U.S. Federal Government teat?? I see from the copyright date that this magazine article-cum-\\"book\\" was authored during the height of those no-bid contracts doled out to the Bush-Cheney lackeys pushing their \\"war\\" in Iraq. One good fantasy deserves another, as evidenced in this \\"book\\".I think this Mr. Pink should take a short 4-hour drive down here to Norfolk Virginia and see what it's like to have to survive in the Real World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every little helps","review":"In a sense, Pink is the Malcolm Gladwell of the brain. He has synthesised a lot of stuff into one place. Fortunately 'Whole New Mind', unlike 'Blink', only misses the point in some areas while getting most of it right. His treatment of design is a little 'breathless' and I would recommend reading Virginia Postrel's Substance of Style for a more hard edged treatment. Stephen Denning's work on leadership story telling contradicts the value of the rich narrative that Pink espouses. The rest of the book is first rate and I would recommend this book to anyone serious about increasing their economic value - I've given it to my 16 year old daughter to read as she embarks on a path towards the holy grail of an MFA."},{"rating":"1","title":"total wishful thinking","review":"Pink apparently was doing a right-brain exercise when he came up with the fantastical, unsupported central thesis of this book. He thinks that for some reason, all the analytical jobs with barriers to entry (education, hard work) are going to move overseas, but the creative, empathic-type jobs in this country won't (why? - he never says) and instead somehow artsy-fartsy (uneducated, lazy, but astoundingly creative) you is going to be so valued that you will be able to hire all the programming/accounting/lawyering and other white-collar skills from India with your spare change.This book exists to tell you what you want to hear, regardless of how thinly-supported it is. I can't believe it got published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole New Mind","review":"This is a very interesting book. It made me aware of our ever changing times and a new need for Right-brained thinkers. It was well written, with good examples and an easy way to understand this issue. I would highly recommend this nonfiction for mind expansion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole New Excitement!","review":"Pink's description made my right brain light up in excitement for the future possibilities on this planet! It left me very curious to hear how left brainers have reviewed this book. Is there resistance or a shared committment to this shift?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Eye opening","review":"This book connects the reader with a wide ranging variety of areas. It opens one to re-imagining the world and people around us. He suggests music to listen to, books to read, web sites to visit and people to engage. He recounts his personal process in search of an answer: how do we conceive the world? It doesn't tilt into: How we Should conceive the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the way Pink thinks!","review":"Daniel Pink takes us on a developmental journey - from that which worked in the C20th/Information Age ie focus being on 'knowledge workers' through to what he strongly believes (and rationalises!) is required for success in the present/future ie the C21st/Conceptual Age. This age instead focuses on 'creators and empathisers'.In order to be successful in this age, Pink highlights that six aptitudes are required, namely: \\"Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning\\". What I really like is that these aptitudes can be applied at the organisational level and most importantly at the individual level.As ever, fascinating reading delivered with candour and a great sense of FUN! I would recommend this book to any Entrapreneur, forward-thinking HR/OD person, Line Manager and/or to anyone wanting to understand how she/he can more effectively drive her/his career forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"This is a fascinating book! As an educator of more than 35 years, who hasn't done brain research but has worked with children and adults all these years, I absolutely concurred with Daniel Pink. I read the book first and then purchased this CD so I could review what I read more than a year ago and I wanted to loan it to friends who love books on CD. If you have an inkling that there is something to this idea of right brain-left brain theory----you will love this book!!! And if you are an educator, you really need to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly interesting, but little depth and value.","review":"The Strenght Based concept is interesting. Psychobabble, but interesting. If your company is implementing this strategy, then by all means get this book and read it. Otherwise, it isn't worth it. A little self reflection will do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Book Study for Teachers","review":"Perhaps I read this book with a whole new mind but I took away lots of new and somewhat random information from this book: The combination of automation, abundanc, and Asia has been a death-knoll for American industry. We must change the way we prepare children for the future to teach the new important qualities including play, story, empathy, symphony, and design. Most effective leaders are funny. IQ accounts for less than ten percent of career success. Other important facts are imagination, joyfulness, and social dexterity. Design is \\"utility enhanced by significance.\\" The four basics of effective design are contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. Choose things, we are urged now, because they delight you not simply because they are functional. Stories are easier to remember because stories are how we remember. We believe that stories amuse and facts illuminate, but this is not true. Symphony is seeing how everything works together to make a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work!","review":"Daniel H.Pink has done a great job explaining how being a right brainier can help you become successful in this era. The book is well-written and easy to understand. You should definitely buy this book if you're looking to capitalize on your brain creative side. I have to say my money was well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toward skills that cannot be outsourced","review":"Pink genially prods us into a future of retooling ourselves for survival, managing to make it seem more interesting than horrifying. He gets playful advising games to develop creativity and empathy, moving us towards the kind of skills that can't be outsourced. The challenges he covers are real and inescapable, except that it's happening so fast that Pink's correct predictions seem outdated for being made slightly before they happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent condition and delivery","review":"This book was quickly delivered and in excellent condition. I look forward to useing you again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one.","review":"I was a fan of \\"Free Agent Nation\\" by Daniel Pink. This book is another good read.It boils down to this: aesthetics matter. Attractive things seem to work better. Tapping into human connectedness and style -- that is smart business.Every chapter has a portfolio -- things to DO to follow up on the chapter's ideas. That is incredibly valuable -- that alone is worth the price of the book.Daniel Pink has a good grasp of research and culture, and a fundamentally readable writing style.This was an enjoyable evening's read -- and one with many dog-eared pages. I added 10 or 15 items to my wish list because of this.Good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Pink's hypothesis that right brained skills will be the core of post outsourced America is quite thought provoking. Tom Peters and others have made much the same argument. Creativity and design will be the new skillsets in demand after much of the current left brain analytical skills (programming, accounting etc. per Tom Friedman's viewpoint) end up as commodity skills moving to Asia and India. I think it is a bit hard to know that yet since with the falling dollar and increasing wage costs in those areas, Americans are becoming more competitive. That said I found this a fascinating read. Incidentally, on my own several years ago, I tried Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain (recommended in Pink's book) and I found that it truly was liberating to my creative side. So I know that at least that part of Pink's book definitely works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Colorful Coaster...","review":"I was expecting a little depth of the Subconcious mind and what it can do to benefit you...

It was a summer course where we were squeezing a semester into 1 week. What we needed was another book to read. HOWEVER, once I began reading it, I was hooked. I read some of it aloud to my husband who became so interested he read it after me. We have passed it on to our best friends.I can't wait for my college-age daughter to read it and give me her opinion. This is a book that will be interesting to a broad range of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in years!","review":"My copy of A whole New Mind has highlighted text and page markers everywhere.

(I am still incredibly fond of my last-Primal Leadership)This book is great for anyone who leads people, is concerned about their own skill set and how to be marketable, or has kids they are trying to guide down the right path.It is easy to read, gives examples to clarify and ways to build the necessary skills that will take all of us into the next century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reborn of Mankind","review":"The simple acknowledge that left Brain skills have been rulling the world, and the conclusion that it is not enough anymore, is a glorious achievement for Mankind reborn.I hope that many people who will read this book, can effectively start reborning and changing their whole lifes, the way of doing things and come to free their minds from left brain claws, being creative and more human. Learn about the million things they have been missing, and share all the beuty they posess, coming directly from their right-brain resources.This book came to my ands as a fountain of good and full-filling inspiration source, wich has confirmed what I\`ve allways felt was missing to be said an done, in order to enable, us humans, taking the next important step, to what the Author calls the \\"Conceptual Age\\", and to get there we defenetely need to embrace a \\"Whole new Mind\\".Fernando Brito Barros"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abundance, Asia and Automation: how it affects our lives","review":"Dan Pink's book lays out three significant factors that affect our lives - abundance (too much stuff), Asia (outsourcing of labor) and Automation (replacement of labor by machines) - and provides suggestions on how one can \\"survive\\" in such a world (hint: different sets of skills, ways of thinking and networking). The book takes an optimistic point of view, which is a relief these days, with all the Doom And Gloom books around. It is well-written and provides excellent examples at the end of every chapter (URLs as well as books) for people who want to rise to the challenge of the Three As.

His previous book \\"Free Agent Nation\\" is also a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been a Pamphlet","review":"Like far too many books, A WHOLE NEW MIND really could have been a pamphlet. The book does contain a few good ideas, but nothing that really warrants an entire book. This is a disappointing follow-up to Dan Pink's first book, FREE AGENT NATION, which is more of an eye-opener that is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premise is flawed and dated","review":"The author is on the bandwagon that a MFA is the degree of the future and that we can protect our jobs from being automated or offshored by learning to Design Beauty, Tell Stories, Compose Symphony, Show Empathy, Plan, and find Meaning. One of his foundational examples is a quote from GM that they are a design company that happens to make cars. While that was a great argument in 2004, they are also a failed company that required a government bailout. Overall, it is an interesting and thought provoking book, even if I do disagree with his conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"This is the best book on the subject of organized crime in America that I have ever read. At 512 pages it was clearly well researched, engaging, and informative. Mr. Fox has written a virtual encyclopedia of 20th century criminal organizations. No malarkey or false Hollywood romanticizing here. Mr. Fox shows just how pernicious the mobsters have been since Prohibition. He details how gangsters came to the USA for profit rather than some grand international conspiracy. It still seems shocking the way J. Edgar Hoover stood by as the mobsters power grew. One flaw in the authors reasoning to me was his speculations about the mobs involvement in JFK's assasination without giving the reader any conclusive evidence. Nonetheless every aspect is covered, the reader will be glad they read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Design great service on Order","review":"Saw this design 10 years ago.

Unfortunately it was 'as shown'.Since I operate a rental store, this affects my operation more than the average collector and I'm sure some people couldn't care less.

Additionally one of the plastic end tube covers on one of the legs (non-structural piece) arrived completely split.

Unlike other games where you have to role dice to see if you can complete an action, this game gives you a set amount of points, called \\"stones\\", and basically lets you decide what to do, and whether or not you accomplish the feat.

Of the set approximately 40% of the dies are duds. If there is a way to sharpen these non-performers, I'd be on my way to being happy with this purchase.The punch handle has a nice chrome plating and a spring loaded centering punch and a small tensioning ball that holds the punch to the handle (like a ratchet holds sockets...).

Divine art of torture had pretty much a catchy tune on each song, these songs like to diversify a little more and add much more range but still keep that 'it' that necrophagia does so well and we all love. This album also uses many more synths to add a horror effect (which personally i love, some may not). Songs such as akumu show what necrophagia are capable of (some may say its a filler but its one of my favorite tracks because it is so different) and if you absolutely love horror, buy this album for 'return to texas' alone because of Bill \\"chop top, Otis P Driftwood\\"'s intro on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"death metal masterpiece","review":"I don't know about the applesauce dude above, but we musn't make fun of the retarted.

Our family has found a few of these songs a real blessing to learn to sing together quietly. The album describes itself well: a great collection of songs that will take you to the \\"quiet side\\". Sort of like experiencing \\"the Lord . . . makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul\\". If you are not a Catholic, you may find the topical arrangement of the songs and some of the inner artwork oriented this way.

I can not imagine what those months must have been like, nor can I imagine what must have gone through Renee's mind that night on the beach! But in reading and re-reading I can't help but believe a large portion of the evidence against John Frazier was circumstance and the jury truly must have wrestled with those ideas. Dale Hudson is a superb author and had me hooked from the first page of this story.

There is no discussion of the fact that the husband was greatly responsible for his wife's career. No comments of his inability to function sexually unless some form of porn was involved.

Our daughter is a climber so she would open the oven doors and step up to climb up and through the window (after she pulled the flowers out), be careful of this. The thing that she did love was the grill and the way it sounds and lights up. She also loved the coffee pot, and how the coffee would \\"disappear\\" when poured.

It has everything (pretend of course)- a microwave, oven, coffemaker, dishwasher, refrigerator, cupboards, sink, PLUS a grill that really looks like it has flames!!! The setup can get frustrating as it is impossible to \\"gently tap\\" (as the directions say) the screws to make holes to screw in the screws!! Use a big nail and hammer to make the holes and a power drill to screw in the screws - which the dirctions say NOT to use, but if you use it carefully, it is fine - or you'll be a week putting it together and tearing your hair out. My kids LOVE this kitchen and I do too. Best present ever!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kitchen!","review":"I bought this kitchen for the nursery at our church.

I've read previous reviews about the possibility of the doors not fitting right but had no idea it was this terrible.

It was the perfect shape! Just make sure to measure how much batter goes into each side, and don't eyeball it. I baked both sides in case I liked one better, but if I had been making an egg, I would have had some carving to do, as one pan baked up much higher. I'd buy it again. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost image makes the black text too grey","review":"especially when the background is white.

It just depends on priorities of the toy design/builder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Flimsy","review":"I bought this for my four year old son for Easter. The pieces were rolled up at at the edges slightly and although he is very good at puzzles, it frustrated him immensly. The pieces would not stay together because they were too thin and rolled up at the edges.This was fine because we left them out and covered them with books to flatten.

It was cheap, but I don't recommend buying it because it's a waste of money and your time. I don't know if this happened to other people, but ugh, it was very annoying and frustrating to use. If you're buying this for a little kid for a one time use, that would be fine. However, if you're planning on using it on cosplay multiple times DO NOT buy this. I recommend trying Wet n Wild H2O Proof Liquid Eyeliner, Ultra Black 881. Yeah, it's eyeliner but it works SO much better than this stuff.

One note of caution: Amazon's cost per box is a little high. In this pack of 12, each box of mix costs about $2.30, but a box costs around $1.80 in my local Target. So, I recommend this product, and I suggest buying it at a local store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woah!","review":"Yikes! Call me a wuss, but some of the areas in AvP made me jump out of my chair! The atmosphere in most of the levels are very dark, so when something JUMPS OUT AT YOU, your heart rate tends to skyrocket! The facehuggers are especially nasty (and cheap), jumping out and landing on your face for an instant kill. My god, when a facehugger jumps on your face, making an awful hissing noise and quite abruptly takes up 80% of the screen, it's a wonder why Fox Interactive hasn't been sued yet for causing a few heart attacks! And man, this game is HARD! But, Fox has released a patch with a save feature, so it's okay now. Believe me, this game is not intended for the faint of heart! But, for those of us who aren't, go out and BUY this!

With the Alien you can cut Marines into up to 5parts and chop heads off. The Marine is awsome to! You can use Smartguns and Pulse Rifles. Overall the game is fun and scary. The downside is the game is way to short, but for $20 at Amazon what else more do you want. I really recommend this game to anyone who likes first person shotter."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but not long enough","review":"i am an avid gamer, and am very fond of the aliens series, so i thought that this game would be a dream come true. infortunately, it wasn't. first of all, there are only 15 different maps. the maps get reused so frequently, it gets boring after a while. the learning curve is vewry basic, despite what the box says, and the alien is by far the easyest (sp?) to use. the marine is at an unfair disadvantage, as he only has a limite4d number of weapons, and they get taken away after every level. instead of a campain, the game has a mission sstem, like a video game. on top of that, you have to beat on the most difficult setting to play all of the \\"unique\\" levels. this is IMPOSIBLE to do with the marine. what this game needs is a really good add on, to save it from the pits of video game hell. if you want a good shooter, for the same price, buy half-life, game of the year edition; it comes with a free copy of team fortress, a game that alone blows avp out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious candy","review":"Best candy ever...

Its primary drawback, however, is the emphasis on romantic verbiage and music as a background for endless scenics of woodlands and nature vistas -- a poor substitute for helpful information on the art and science of bonsai horticulture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need to know about Bonsai","review":"This film is a perfect ¡Bonsai Learning Media for Dummies¡!

I certainly did not find it worth the money ($24.95) I paid. Segues are poor, videography is fair to poor. Perhaps it was my copy? No, I checked with a friend, who also purchased it and was as equally disappointed. My friend is less \\"vocal\\" than I. This has no comparison to some of the other videos I bought in the U.K., from a televised garden show, which covered bonsai as a topic. Those were excellent and at the US equivalent of $14.95, were far better value.I would suggest that the word \\"banzai, or bonzai\\" would fit better, as it would more signify a bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner","review":"I would believe there are many bonsai learning materials available to choose from depending upon your level of knowledge.

The songs are short and get right to the point, and that's to make you dance! Edy Dmx makes a note that this release is dedicated to his dad (RIP) who used to love to dance. Some of the deep vocals on CD2 reminds me of David Gahan and an old obscure 80's band Hohokam! Great stuff.

He almost always at 8 months, falls asleep in the seat. The only Con that I have with this seat is that it is somewhat difficult to install if you are not using the latch. We have this seat in the back center of our 2005 Toyota Highlander and it fits great, but the center seat does not allow for latch installation. It was difficult to get the belts tight. Other than that, the straps are easy to adjust and tighten, and my son is extremely happy in this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it- horrible seat","review":"I had to return this seat to BRU and take a Marathon instead.

My daughter has been stuck in it on several occasions while the straps were stuck. You must push the button in extremely hard to get them to release. Sometimes the straps will not tighten down all the way. I have to pull so hard to get them to tighten down that I have marks on my hands. Other reviewers have had the same complaint so I know it's not a strength issue. Please make sure to check this out if you decide to buy this model. Even the store I purchased it from now tells me they know of the issue. I just hope they are passing on the info to new customers.

A Must Buy Item!","review":"I got this seat as a replacement for the Cosco Eddie Bauer edition car seat (which is horrible!! It is really bad for younger kids, particularly under the age of 2 because of the child's head not being supported at all!). And so far, I have been really impressed. My son who is now 1 years old, has been in it for several months, and his head hardly rolls around like it used to in the other seat, so I am sure his neck feels better. The base size is great, it fits nicely on the seat (I have a Jeep Cherokee, and the back seat is not a standard full size seat.), even when it was all the way in the rear facing reclining position. I love all of the cozy padding and the color of the fabric too. I just wish that the material was treated a with a better stain repellent because it will stain on the easy side, other than that, this seat is a definite winner, I just wish they made car's seats as nice as this one on the driver's and passager's seats as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"sophie'smom","review":"GREAT carseat. Comfortable for baby, she fell asleep in it while I was finishing installation. She used to scream every time we were in the car. Now she loves the ride and the view.

LOVE it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very pleased!","review":"I am very glad my husband and i purchased this car seat. Our 5 month old daughter is just increadibly long and had out grown her infant carrier. This seat is easy to install in our SUV and snug enough for our precious girl to fall fast asleep in every time!

Fantastic buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it for a Marathon","review":"We had a Marathon with our oldest and LOVED it! I figured the Decathlon would be even better for our new baby boy. The pads were nice, but the straps were IMPOSSIBLE to loosen and tighten. My husband is a fairly large man, and it was difficult for even him to yank on them. He took apart the straps, re-threaded them, etc. to no avail. Returned for second Decathlon, to find the same problem. Finally returned for another Marathon. Again, LOVE the Marathon. Never looked back to the mess that was the Decathlon. Called Britax, they weren't helpful. Amazon bent over backwards to refund. Amazon's customer service, again is amazing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decathlon harness","review":"The seat is very comforable and my 6 month old does like his new seat however getting him in and out is a nightmare. The strap is impossible to tighten. I have been searching the web to make sure that maybe it was just me not adjusting it correctly. I have found many others with this same problem and now that I have read that a fireman had a hard time tightening the harness I know it is not just my lack of strength. I plan on calling Britax. I bought the carseat through amazon. I am glad my son is comfortable but his safety is more important. I can't see it being safe when you can not secure him properly in the harness. He also tends to fall forward when he falls asleep. I have reclined it as instructed but it has not helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long awaited fun read","review":"I have waited for years for the D series to be translated into English. This first book is the one that the original movie is based on. The movie and book are not identical stories; certain elements were changed around in the movie, probably to condense the plot to a reasonable running time. The book is quick, fun read with lots of action right from the beginning. The story itself is only 235 pages so you can probably read it in a day or two. It also includes the first chapter of the second book as a teaser; it looks like it will be just as good.As far as the horror aspect of the story goes, there are numerous killings but they are not gory. There is really nothing more frightening in here than you would find in a Harry Potter book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Perspective to Classic Horror","review":"The story takes place in the year 12,090 a.d.

When Louise Brown, a researcher on sex trafficking around the world, travels to Heera Mandi, she realizes that the issue may be more complex than she had originally imagined. This is essentially a journal of her repeated visits to Pakistan over a number of years. She follows a number of characters, but the undisputed star of her study is Maha, a fading dancer in her thirties who is trying to keep her daughters from following in her footsteps. As time goes on, Brown becomes more involved in Maha's life and less of a casual observer - but she remains an excellent narrator throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is...","review":"...almost ridiculous - this DVD is basically just an excerpt of the Sandy Jones beginners video, just with different background/music - and it didn't feel well composed either.

If it ripped off that easily just by putting it on then I would not feel safe putting my child in there either.I was very disappointed but Babies R Us was nice enough let us do an exchange for something else so before we purchase another one we are going to look closer at how they are designed, for safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward and very clear","review":"The book is great. No pie in the sky stuff but real practical instructions that you would need to get started and realistically have things work. Full of ideas with the advantages and disadvantages so you know the up and downside of a strategy. Best money I ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD quality.","review":"DVD is poor quality, I need to return it cos it freezes. We only watched it twice. Content is good but they need to use better DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"LoVe FiNdS A HoMe","review":"In the sequel, Lillian has been adopted and it's several years later. Annie, married and pregnant, visits her fellow doctor friend,Dr. Owen, who desperately wants a baby, but seems unable to become pregnant.Lillian finds a love interest, an assistant to her adoptive dad, the latter has become quite overprotective.Patty Duke, who at 63, is starting to look her age appears as Annie's mother-in-law, a mid-wife set in her ideas. The film is of value since both Duke and Doc Owen come to understand and tolerate each other. At times, Ms. Duke looks like Irene Ryan portraying Granny Clampett in the old Beverly Hillbillies television show. Nevertheless, Duke turns in a very good performance as a spunky lady.The movie is also a good one as it avoids violence and ends in a way that we will be ready for part 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"clicheclichecliche","review":"Too predictable and cliche ridden.

I believe that it reminds us that their is a place called home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Big Fan","review":"I love the Love Comes Softly range I have every single one and all I can say is absolutly BRILLIANT!!. When I recieved Love Finds A Home I was so thrilled but when I watched it I was saying to myself that this cannot be the end of the series because there is a lot more to come in the next one. What I think Lilly will become more involved with Joshua and Belinda and Lee to have the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Finds...an ending no one expected","review":"Particularly if you've read the books. The films (with the exception of the first two) are nothing like Janette's book series of the same name. Though the films claim to be based on the books, there is little, if anything, that made it through to the end of the series. Belinda's first name made it, and that is about it.As I have stated with my reviews of the previous films, they are nice option for family movie night, but they are not a good representation of Oke's series. The books are so much better, and preserve the fully Christian message that the author intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"wholesome movies","review":"I am a fan of the \\"Love comes softly \\"series. Love finds a home, is one of my favorites .

It was so predictable. How I prefer English made historical films where the women don't look like they have makeup on and their hair is in authentic styles. The clincher was at the end the editing was so bad that you can obviously see the baby is a doll!! It's just not worth your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"worse movie ever!","review":"this series is all messed up. Michal Landon jr. is the worse filmaker in the world!. in the book Belinda was at a home in boston were she meets drew,she hasn't seen him for years. Jannete Oke wrote four more books about Belinda and drew's kids. this movies are so messed up, watch movies 1-3 but don't waste your time on this movie. READ THE BOOKS!

Just wished they would have stay more to the books verion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"This is really a good movie and I understand a series of movies. Much like the TV series Little House on the Prairie. Good story, good acting and lessons to be learned. Actually, I bought this movie because Patty Duke was starring. Everything she does, has a good moral message and she was exceptional in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing conclusion to the 8-part series","review":"My family enjoyed the first seven movies in the \\"Love Comes Softly\\" series but we were not pleased with the eighth and final episode, \\"Love Finds a Home\\". The story line and the acting left much to be desired. There was very little connection to the previous episodes and there was no real ending to bring the series to a logical conclusion (the movie just ended and left you longing for some form of a thread that tied the generations of this family together). We will most likely watch the first seven episodes again but I doubt that we'll waste our time with the final episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"t DVD","review":"I absolutely loved this series, I Try to get all of the dvd when they come out hope i did not miss any"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit hatin, poseur","review":"Didn't pay enough attention to whatever the persons name was who was crying his/her eyes out about lbc \\"changing\\" and are now following the crowd.

But I, for one, love Throwing...also. Get used to change."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Lucky Boys Album yet","review":"I feel that this is the best Lucky Boys Confussion CD yet. It has a lot of great songs that get stuck in your mind. All of the songs sound great instrumentally and the songs are really easy to learn the words too (especially if you listen to them as much as I have). \\"Atari\\" is probably my favorite song because it says so much about my life. \\"Driver\\" is also a great song to listen to especially while you are driving. The songs on this album are so easy to get into, and the music is so easy to just start singing along with. The CD is just a really great one, I feel that it is the best one yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, it's pretty enjoyable.","review":"I like some fun, upbeat, meaningless stuff to listen to while working out, so I figured this would be a good fit. I was surprised though; there's actually a little musical and lyrical depth here. If you want something to listen to in the background that doesn't make you feel like you should be wearing diapers, this isn't bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best bands of our time","review":"im mainly a rap fan but when i heard this it broadened my horizons in music theres a lot of good music and this is the best rock ive heard for a long time. If you havent bought this cd your crazy cuz its one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe they are not famous!","review":"Lucky Boys Confusion is one of my all time bands. They are a band that most of their songs sound different rather then the same old thing. Hey driver was in without a paddle and that populized them a little bit. Atari and sunday afternoon are my favorite songs. I can't wait to see them in concert. If you have never gotten one of their albums what are you waiting for??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This CD is amazing! I was recently introduced to Lucky Boys Confusion this summer and after hearing Throwing the Game and their latest album, Commitment, I have fallen in love. They are an amazing, high-energy band with a punk/alternative sound. They are definitely a band that should be added to anybody's permanent collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music all around!","review":"my girlfriend first introduced me to lucky boys and lets just say i have been hooked ever since. I just recently saw them live and well......if you dont like them.....see them live and it will definatly change your mind because there are an awesome live band! The Cd is great to, all of the songs seem to be of a different genre and they are all catchy. if you are a fan of good music than buy this album because you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own Commitment","review":"Lucky Boys Confusion's newest album, Commitment, is an album everyone should own. The music is amazing, and the lyrics are powerful. Anyone who likes any type of rock has to buy this CD. LBC expresses a profound energy and theme in each song on Commitment. Their single, \\"Hey Driver\\" is one of the best songs they have written. However, \\"Hey Driver\\" is not the only good song on the CD. Commitment includes great songs such as \\"Broken,\\" \\"Atari,\\" \\"Sunday Afternoon,\\" \\"Closer to our Graves,\\" and so many more. I, Weibs, love every song on this CD. Any questions, e-mail me at LBC_Geek_354_Weibs@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love it","review":"This is the best CD you'll ever buy. Just listen to there new single Hey Driver and you'll fall in love with Lucky Boys Confusion. And I swear you'll like this CD so much you'll want to buy their first one too! So buy Commitment today! What are you waiting for it's only $4 at www.amazon.com! Just try it out you'll love it I guarantee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!!!!!!!","review":"This album is the most amazing thing I've ever heard. I've listened to it at least 80 times through in 2 months. It NEVER gets old! It's one of those albums you can listen to all the way through without having to skip a song that sucks, cuz none of them do! LBC combines a bunch of different styles to create one of the most unique sounds ever. If you are even remotely interested in music you will LOVE this album. IT'S AWESOME! I also recommend their other 3 albums: Growing out of It, Throwing the Game, and The Soapbox Spectacle."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"Holy Cow! I love this cd! I heard their song \\"Hey Driver\\" on the radio and immediately fell in love with it. I couldn't wait for this CD to arrive in the mail and it was the only CD in my stereo for a few months straight. Everything about this CD makes me love LBC. My favorite songs are tracks 2-9 but they are all awesome!This is totally what I expected after hearing the song clips on Amazon and reading the positive reviews. I am so glad I chose to buy this disc. Lucky Boys Confusion \\"Comittment\\" is an awesome addition to anyone's CD collection. You'll love it!FYI, the parental advisory sticker is only there because one song has the f-word in it four or five times. The rest of the CD is appropriate and clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing band","review":"These guys are amazing. From \\"dumb pop song\\" off of their premier CD to \\"hey driver\\" off of Commitment, Lucky Boys Confusion has continued to hit their fans with a barrage of music, ranging from soft acoustic solos to mosh pit bashes. The variety of music compiled on this CD is not only unique, but truly amazing to listen to. If you have never listened to another Lucky Boys Confusion CD, this is an amazing place to start. Hey Driver, Sunday Morning, and Atari are wonderfully written and performed songs by this chicago band that will amaze and thrill everyone from their most dedicated of fans to the someone hearing one of their songs on a radio station. I HIGHLY reccomend this CD to anyone itnerested in the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"LBC strikes again","review":"I had previously only heard a few hits like Arizona Stand, Fred Astaire, and Bossman and loved them. So I decided to buy the new album and it was so worth it!!! It is a whole bunch of fantastic songs (my personal favorite being hey driver, but all are great!) I highly recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Simply amazing","review":"The boys never cease to amaze, and Commitment is definitely a testament to their progression as song writers. Their sound has definitely moved away more from the ska/reggae sound they had...but it's still there. Honestly, do not hesitate to pick this album up. Something to Believe, for lack of a better word is superb. Ordinary and Closer to Our Graves, again, amazing. Pick it up. You won't be sorry, just amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD in a long time","review":"I purchased the LBC last night at midnight. I waited a long time for this and I was not disappointed. All of the songs are really good and they seem to flow very easily from one to another. I definitely reccomend that everyone buys this cd and supports the boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I understand the cd has been released for a while now, and I have had it since its release. It just really disappoints me to see all these positive reviews. For someone who has been a big LBC fan since 1999, this cd really disappointed me. LBC sold out with this album and I just want people to understand that this is not the LBC that I know and love. LBC was at its best with \\"Growing Out of It\\" and \\"Throwing the Game\\". I really hope consumers look into one of those first because anyone who liked them then will agree with me, they sold out. I have never been more disappointed in a band.With that said, there are moments of greatness, \\"Ordinary\\" is one of my favorite LBC songs of all time and then \\"Medicine and Gasoline\\" is also a solid track.I hope that you consider this when looking at buying an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky Boys Confusion Review","review":"I rated the Lucky Boys Confusion CD as a five for a reason. This CD has only uplifting and upbeat songs on it. It is so great for listening to in the car, just make sure you don't get a ticket for singing to loud to it. This is one of the best CDs I have heard all year. It sort of a pop/ punkish band and these guys deserve to be number 1! This CD has so many good songs that when i took the poll for which is my favorite song, I had no idea what to pick. But, I ended up picked Atari so make sure to listen to that one. BUY THIS CD NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for young girls","review":"My daughter received this for her 5th Birthday, although I believe the target audience is a bit older. We have not used the online application yet, because I feel she's too young, but the MP3 player itself is cute, and my daughter loves it. It works well, she uses it all the time, and she loves the fact that she can change the look anytime she wants. I do wish it had a screen so I could immediately go to the album I want, but using the fast forward button to get to the song we want really isn't that much of a bother. Charging is easy, and downloading doesn't get much simpler. I bought one for my niece's 7th Birthday too, since we liked it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute!!!","review":"I bought this MP3 player for my 6 yr old twins for Xmas. They love music and are always stealing my CD's. I also wanted them to have a way to listen to Irish music to practice their dance steps. They love them and so do I! This player is so easy to use, and downloading the music was as easy as copying a file to a memory stick. There arent any fancy playlist options but who cares! All I know is that the backseat of my car is no longer a battle zone for which song to put on the radio. They each have their Barbie player earplugs in and little smiles on their faces. And who can beat the price!!! They are also just as interested in changing the little outfits that come with the player. I highly recommend this as an inexpensive way to give your kid her own music without paying for a complicated MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute 1st MP3 Player","review":"This flash drive based MP3 player is cute and should be fun for its target audience. We have not tried the web site, and if you already have Windows Media Player 11 on your PC, there is no reason to install it from the enclosed software. In fact, the player is viewed as a hard drive, so you can simply drag and drop unprotected (non-DRM) MP3 or WMA files. Windows Media Player is usful if you want to organize songs or sync from that program, but it isn't necessary to get songs on to the player. If you use iTunes, you will need to convert your music to MP3; Protected iTunes store songs will NOT work at all, but MP3 songs purchased from Amazon will work. Sound quality is ok, I doubt may 7-8 year olds are audiophiles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but poor quality","review":"I bought this for my 9 year-old daughter who was mainly interested in unlocking all the features you get on Barbiegirl.com when you purchase this product. We've had it about a week and the headphones are broken (poor wiring connection in the plug makes the sound go in and out). A co-worker of mine is on his third as the first two had problems with the player itself. Also, the instructions are not great so it takes some trial and error to get it right (for instance, the CD you need to install is \\"hidden\\" in the base). Now, that's my perspective. My daughter still likes it and enjoys the expanded features on barbiegirl.com so she is more forgiving than I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie Girl MP3 software a failure","review":"I am having the same problems getting the Barbie Girl MP3 software to function properly and work as advertised. I have no problem loading music on it. But trying to get the website registration software to work has been an absolute failure. It is a huge disappointment as a child's Christmas present. Its main function is supposed to be as a key code to unlock Barbie Girl website special features. Tech support for Mattel just hangs up on you because they are \\"experiencing a high volume of calls\\" all week and weekend. I bet they are. Amazon just referred me to another number, apparently for Broderbund software support, and they are closed on the weekend!I, too, am no computer idiot and my computer meets the specs. This is absolutely not worth any amount of money with these glitches and no tech support. This is all my daughter wanted for Christmas. What a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as cheap as they come","review":"My little one really wanted one, so I succumbed, and as soon as it came, I knew it wouldn't last long. The USB connector actually is ON THE TOY!! After less than 20 times of using, it has stopped working, the light has stayed on, and no computer will recognize it. I think for a child under 9 or 10, an inexpensive \\"generic\\" mp3 plyer from WALMART or online at Amazon would be preferable. One good thing is that hte volume is VERY low, which I think is a good thing for children to get used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter receieved this for her 6th birthday..","review":"My daughter received this for her 6th birthday. She LOVES it! I love it since I'm finally able to get my iPod back from her!My only two complaints - the software is not Mac compatible and the sound is a bit low. My daughter wears hearing aides, and the highest volume is a little low for her (she doesn't wear her hearing aides while using the headphones, of course). The highest volume is a good, moderate setting though for non-hearing impaired users (not too loud)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie MP3 Player","review":"I bought this Barbie MP3 Player for my daughter's 7th birthday and she absolutely loves it!

She is definitely more into the music than the website though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 Player for girls 6 and up","review":"I bought this for my daughter 2 years ago, for Christmas when it first came out. Originally I would say I was very impressed with the product as an MP3 player, but the website had some issues. I think the website has improved, and the MP3 player has survived well, although the headphones have been replaced (more for lost earbuds/pieces and bad fit than anything). It has even made it through a 2 year old little brothers constant \\"borrowing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a gift.","review":"Purchased this for my neices' 5th birthday and she loves it.

She specially liked the accesories that she can put on the mp3 and on the earphones. You can change the look of the doll just snapping more hair and accesories. The quality of sound is excellent for a player this cheap. Also girls can go into special sections of the Barbie web site. The doll looks very nice in your desk or table.This is a very good option now when your daughter asks for an mp3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality material, way too expensive considering what you've got","review":"I am not satisfied with this toy in any way. It looks cheap, it doesn't show the playing song, there is no way of knowing what song is next.The sound is low. It is very expensive considering what you've got and 512Mb is way too little for the price. I purchase a 2gb minisd memory and the mp3 player won't work if the memory is inserted, so there is no way of using more than 512mb. I only purchased it because my daugther wanted so badly to use all the features on the barbie site but I don't think is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software doesn't work, can't get online","review":"Despite my misgivings base on other reviews I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It was at the top of her list, largely because of the Barbie.com site and the promised secret codes included with this item. Frankly I am appalled at what is essentially blackmail, but one cannot explain that to a 9 year old. Anyway...I cannot get the software to work. I loaded it on the computer and it keeps telling me \\"application failed.\\" I am not a computer idiot and my system more than meets the hardware requirements. I was able to load music on the player via Windows Media Player, but I have a VERY UNHAPPY little girl. While the player seems worth the $20 I paid, it would be a utter rip-off at the original $80 price.

It said it was completely charged, but when I turned it on, I truned the volume up and down, I hit the play/pause button a few times, I even tried to flip through the songs, BUT IT JUST STOPPED WORKING!!!!!!!!!!!

The analog to digital conversion box (hardware)is terrible. Video looks fine in a very small screen 360x480, however when u enlarge it to regular size (full computer screen) it is very grainy, choppy, overall very low quality, not suitable to be burnt on DVD or CD for archiving or for later to be watched on TV o r Computer.I even tried to capture MiniDV video using the Pinnacle 9 studio software and it makes the capture grainy, which shouldn't happen b/c minidv is digital. When I use software like Adobe Premiere its crystal clear. So the software capturing abilities and the hardware it comes with are terrible. I would never recommend this anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your best option","review":"I first purchased this about 3 years ago. At first it worked but I could not get it to actually export the videos w/o locking up my machine and finally crashing. If you are going to be doing any type of video editing its ideal to have a top of the line machine. I have a 3.4 GHZ Pentium w/ 1 GB RAM. I would think that this setup would be totally sufficent to convert a 2 hr video from VHS to DVD. Unfortunately it wasn't. So a few months later I gave it another go w/ an additional 3 GB of ram.. in total 4 GB RAM.Now the program won't even recognize the Moviebox USB, I un-installed the drivers and reinstalled 3 times.

Unfortunately, as stated by the other reviewers, it is simply a republication under a new title of a book that seemed pertinent and timely in 1996 but now seems outdated and a bit tired. Perhaps the authors could have updated the interviews, as is the title should have been \\"Being a Pagan in 1996\\". Many of the interviews are interesting and the book is well put together..."},{"rating":"1","title":"great for nostalgia I guess...","review":"I'm sure this was a wonderful preformance when first preformed in 1935, but this copy is scratchy and sounds to old to really enjoy.

The book is great for adults, teens, and to share with younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"so much information about seaglass...and the photos allow you to compare what you have already found or looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Considering there was only one other book on sea glass that I knew of, I absolutely HAD to have another-being the avid sea glass fan that I am. However, upon receiving the book, I was greatly unimpressed with not only the images, but also the lack of magnificent specimens. The book tells more about ceramic shards than it does actual glass. In my opinion, I find actual glass to be much more attractive than any kind of pottery shard.Furthermore, the book had hardly any information on where to find glass, how to look for it, or even when to go and look... absolutely nothing about actually collecting. Or what about the weathering process of the shards? Nope. I was very disappointed in the lack of information. For those craving explanations of the possible origins, when and where to find glass, and just general information regarding anything one can think of about sea glass, get the book Pure Sea Glass. It's an amazing reference whenever I come home with new and interesting pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass from the Past","review":"What a wonderful book. The photography is great and the information on sea glass, the history and hunting, of this hobby is fantastic. Through this book I've interested both my daughter and husband in the searching of sea glass. Now we all comb the beaches of Southwestern Wisconsin (Lake Michigan)in search of a prize. I leave this book on my coffe table and even had my daughter's friends (20years and older) go out looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"In all of the time I have been purchasing from Amazon this is the only thing I have ever returned. I bought it with another book about sea glass which I did like. The content is mainly of pieces no one will ever find unless they are on an archeological expedition. It is devoted not only to sea glass but to fresh water inland glass. This lady found all of the pieces of a porcelain doll's head, how likely is that? She just is not a beach comber I suppose. The description is misleading. Don't buy this book if you are a SEA Glass collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"This book picks up around the time that Frank Miller wrapped up his first run on the series and around the time right before Frank Miller started his second run on the series. It's caught between greatness, thus overshadowed by the better-known arcs, but it does a good job of holding the inbetween.Please, don't pass this book up just because it's not Frank Miller. It does have good stories in it (all except for one...surprisingly, it's the Frank Miller issue [Frank only wrote one issue and co-wrote another out of all the issues collected in here, by the way]), and the art is very good. While none of what you read in Love's Labor's Lost will be forever remembered as some of Daredevil's most defining and infamous moments (save, perhaps, Heather Glenn's suicide), all this book does is give more strength to the character of Matt Murdock/Daredevil, thus showing that he doesn't need Frank Miller to be good.This book shows that he's great just by himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this?","review":"don't know why I bought this thing.

Very unsafe!!","review":"While this toy is a huge hit in our church nursery, the front looks like steps and all of the kids climb up it and tip it over backwards. It is very cute and durable but every kid who has played with it has climbed up the \\"steps\\" and held onto the handle and tipped it over. I would look for a cart that does not look like steps in the front. It's just too tempting for the little ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for climbers","review":"My 8 month old loves this toy. Sadly I do not. It's just right for him to push up to any piece of furniture and use it as a ladder to get into all sorts of trouble. Plus even though he's only 16 lbs it flips over if he stands on top while holding the handle.I'm sure it'd be perfect if your child isn't inventive because on the rare moments he actually uses it to practice walking it works great. But sadly my child prefers to explore the heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and educational","review":"We purchased our daughter the Around the Block Walker by the Parents company. It is a great toy. It does move fast on the wooden floor. When my daughter was 9 months old, she did climb on it so I tipped it over on it's back. From there, she was able to open and close the lid and play with the blocks. Until she was able to walk, she did push it around with my supervision. Her 3 year old cousin would come over and the two girls would play with the blocks and build a 'tower'.I did notice that the paint came off from the drawings of the walker onto the rubber/plastic blocks but that was because I had washed the rubber/plastic blocks and did not dry them well before placing them back into the walker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous toy DO NOT BUY","review":"I saw this toy at a friend's place and bought it for my then 11 month old daughter. She was just starting to walk. She loved this toy and loved pushing it around but one day the handle slipped from her hand and she fell head on on the hard wood floor and had a seizure. We ended up in the hospital. I think this toy and other walkers are very dangerous for toddlers especially ones who are just starting to walk. The pediatrician at the hospital told us that walkers are not good for little kids. Also the wooden blocks are too heavy. If your child thraws it at another child or at you it may do serious harm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint comes off wooden blocks","review":"We purchased my son the Around the Block Walker that is distributed by the Parents company. The wooden blocks that came with the walker contain painted images and the paint comes off on the other blocks and on our hands. I called the company to file an official complaint and was told they would send me the same set of blocks as a replacement. When I explained why that DIDN'T make sense they stated that was their policy. Well the same set of blocks arrived and I just finished washing off the paint that is again getting all over everything. It should be noted they are not near a heat source. When I called this time they told me I would need to pay to ship the second set back - that being their policy. I am seriously irritated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for little hands & minds!","review":"I got this for our son for his first bithday. Right away he pushed the toy and screamed with delight. He couldn't turn it around (he was mad)and that would be the only dissapointment we would face. I love that there is a gap between the lids so his fingers cannot get crushed. My favorite thing about it is that it comes with 3 different types of blocks for the different ages/skill levels. The rubber ones are excellect for the first stacking tries!! He is now 17 months and is using it as a chair as well as a play toy. The soft cotton blocks he is currently using for a tossing game. This toy seems to keep having more and more uses! I would recommend this for the beginner/walking stages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dangerous","review":"My daughter started walking at 10 months and got this toy for her birthday. I was very excited about it - beads on the wire + blocks + push-toy = wonderful, right? WRONG! The second day she used it, she climbed right up the front and leaned over the handle, falling flat on her face. So I took off the handles so she could lean over and push it. She still climbed on top of the lids and the wheels moved under her and she fell flat on her face again. So I took the lids off too (not easy, by the way). Then she climbed on top of the hard, wooden blocks and the same result. I took the hard blocks out and it is now and empty toy for her to push around. It is awful that I've had to destroy this toy to make it safe for my toddler to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Toy","review":"We bought this toy for our 1 year old son. It is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great. I agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well.My biggest compaint, however, is that when both lids are closed, the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder. Our son constantly tries to climb it, like stairs. The other day, he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle. My son fell over with it and crashed on his face. There are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon, but they DO NOT prevent it from falling over.My son is fine, but this toy is very dangerous and I do not recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disapointed!","review":"We are VERY disappointed with this walker. We generally love Parents toys, because they are well made and durable.We bought this for our daughter when she was about 11 months and on the verge of walking to help her get around - a BIG mistake. The walker has no breaks, or the way to slow it down, so she gave up very quickly to try and walk with it. Also, there are these hard rubber pieces next to the back wheels, which are very painful to step on. I made a mistake once, and ended up with a bloody instep.Next, almost immediately, the paint started to melt off of the wooden block. Melt off, and it's about 70 degrees in our house at all times. Not to mention that these blocks are simply too hard for little kids. I like the rounded edges, but my daughter had trouble picking it up until recently.Last but not least, the sturdy quality which we like with Parents toys is just not there. In addition to paint melting, the push-bar is not coming off.Very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Perfect...","review":"Everything was perfect...

They also cover in some detail, multiple scripting languages.However, this book - as with all others - have superficial examples. Every author develops mailing or phone lists for their examples. No one gives an example using purchase orders or invoices - things that we will drive the expansion of XML.This is a good book for a beginner and anyone just getting exposed to XML.

The 9-11-55 picks up much more than our regular house vac, and with its long hose is great for hard-to-reach places. A kit of accessories is available that lets you extend the hose, add a foam filter for water work, or add one of several adaptors for upholstery, crevices, floors, etc. I use these accessories frequently.Yes, the vacuum, bags and accessories are expensive.

He spends most of his talents spewing anger and pointing fingers. Christ would have made his points without anger and living examples. If I gave Mr. Smith the benefit of the doubt and listened to his subtle implications, (that he is the only mortal who can translate scripture), I would have to throw away almost everything my church leaders have taught. My final thought is why does Mr. Smith translate scripture metaphorically then change to more literal translations when it's convenient to his \\"story\\" line?"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR","review":"This was no help at all.

It would be easlier to find level mark if they had a larger view for when level."},{"rating":"1","title":"The AnglePro feature is useless","review":"While the auto leveling feature works fine (checked with a 4' level and a water level at 34'), the AnglePro function is off by about 3 degrees (at 8 feet it's off by 4\\") which is plainly visible just by eye.I haven't decided if I'm going to return it or take it apart and see if I can adjust it. Also as already mentioned in another review, the center mark is very hard to see. I might try to paint it with thinned out model paint (if I don't return the unit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is seems.","review":"To answer the first reviewers question it has a attachement device with a little pin to punch it into the wall. If you don't mind pinholes here and there.More importantly I have two complaints. First, the centerpoint of the horizonal level is not well marked. It should have a big red line not a little black one like all the rest. But I see why they didn't mark it well. When I hang the level on the wall a movement of less than one line thickness makes a huge difference on whether the line is acutally even with the floor or not. I am reduced to standing back and looking at the line and the floor and saying, \\"Yep, that looks good.\\" I coulda done that myself and saved the 20 bucks.If I give it a little nod to usefulness it does give you a dependably straight line across the wall from one point. This can be useful but buy a used one or on sale. Wait till B & D has discontinued it and you can buy it in the bargin basket with all the other, \\"almost good enough\\" stuff B & D does."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucks","review":"I purchased this from Home Depot, and I'm glad I did....because I'm going to return it. The gripes have to with the what others have mentioned.When switching the laser between the two sides, a straight line is not level. One side appears to be higher than the other.The aparatus to attach to the wall is good in theory, but does not lock the leveler from being able to rotate once attached (by magnet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"On The Level","review":"If you are looking for a versatile tool, keep looking. The auto-level seems to work ok but the calibration for manually leveling is *way* off. There is no zero notation but if you center between the +/-15* marks you are nearly 10* off.The wall mounting device is a joke as well. First of all the quick mounting pin snapped off the first time I tried to stick it in sheetrock(before I had even put much pressure on it) and the magnet it uses to hold the level is barely strong enough under the best conditions. Trying to rotate the level usually results in it falling off the wall.Many small design bits are not well thought out. It feels like the designers never tried their own product. Maybe if B&D; does a couple revisions they can make this a useful part of a layout kit but it isn't nearly there yet.R"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Worst Amazon Purchase","review":"The only thing this level is good for is getting a straight line. The gauge is very difficult to read which defeats the purpose of a level. The wall mount is useless as well. I was really looking forward to using it, I ended up using a chalk line and a normal level.I would have liked to return it but unfortunately I don't live in the US. My advice to you is to try the cheaper one with the suction cup it's about half the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"usage is limited","review":"I bought this tool to install speakers at home and be correctly aligned to one another. This tool is poorly designed to stay in place and do its alignment. I ended up not using it at all.The pictures mention it's great to install frames on walls... it's probably the only usage I would see it working.Also, to make this happen, you have to install it on a wall, it comes with a big nail that will perforate your dry wall and leave a huge hole...

Yes there are some humurous moments and Sandler does have a funny line or two, but this is truly a drama. The story is about friendship. Even though it appears it is about how Sandler can't handle the grief over the lose of his family on 9/11, it is also just as much about Cheadle coming to grips with his own life which is not where he wants it to be.

Mr. Binder explains some things which helped me understand more about the story and that prompted me to watch a second time. I appreciated it more. Yep, I still cried again.

I'm a die hard Sandler fan, so maybe my expectations were set to high, but really, who wants to finish watching a $30 blu-ray and look at your buddy and say \\"man i wished i hadn't bought that.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst waste of my time.","review":"This movie by far is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.I feel that anyone who made money on this movie should return it and create an account in which to pay for anyones time who wasted it on purchasing this dvd and even watching the movie.Adam Sandler is a big bomb in this one.Save your time and money and look elsewhere for something to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden 911 victims","review":"I cried and thought about this movie for a week.Yes I can agree that the movie was a little difficult to follow, but the story line was excellent.

Usually Adam Sandler is crazy and funny, so it was nice to see him switch roles and take on something serious. This is a beautiful movie about coping with an issue that was untouchable for quite sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic story about mental illness","review":"Wow...this is a powerful movie. There's nothing comical at all throughout the two hour running time - in fact, I laughed only once. It's touching, and sad, and engrossing. And very, very good.The acting is superb. Sandler continues to amaze me with the range of his acting. Don Cheadle is brilliant as usual. Liv Tyler is very believable as a psychotherapist, and Donald Sutherland is just pure greatness. Even though his role is small, you just can't take your eyes off him.I have a friend who is mentally ill, and this movie hit very close to home for me. It's not exactly the kind of movie you'd have a few beers and hang out with a bunch of friends to watch. It's the kind of movie that makes you think; a movie that touches you, that gets in your head and stays there.It's well worth the viewing. Even though it's sad, it's very real. The acting is mesmerizing...and, well, it's just a very good, powerful film. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, Crappy Blu Ray Transfer","review":"Reign Over Me is a grown folks drama. I have read the good and bad reviews. The movie is excellent with adult themes and situations. It is well acted and entertaining. It is not perfect. It is what it is and that is very underrated. But the video I bought from Blockbuster on a 3 for $10 rack (a former rental) is a beautiful print with great sound. My Blu Ray was transfered and obviously, NO ONE LOOKED AT THE TRANSFER BEFORE PRINTING 1,000,000 or so copies! They never lightened up Cheadle. Low Quality technical stuff for an overlooked but wonderful film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, what a waste of time","review":"I read all these great reviews so was ready for this movie. What I wasn't ready for was how inane and boring it is. And that music that keeps playing whenever Adam Sandler is riding on his segue, or scooter, or whatever it is! It wants to be a feel-good movie, but in the end, you're left scratching your head and thinking...'did I really waste a whole evening on this drivel?' How this movie got so many stars is truly a mystery. The only saving grace was seeing New York city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reign Over Me","review":"Reign Over Me is a great film.

With all of the 911 Controversy that our mainstream media throws at us this was a REAL look at a casualty of WAR.God Bless New York,Marc and Stella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Another Sandler Flop.","review":"Don Cheadle tried to pull this film back repeatedly from the gutter as Sandler was as persistantly adamant about leading it back into it. What good parts there were was carried by Cheadle and they came at intervals that made you think the movie was starting to turn good. Unfortunately it was a false hope. Sandler's over acting of his character's part was way too much. The movie subject matter is admirable and worth writing many 'good' storylines. It does have a good ending in spite of Sandlers inability to perform earlier throughout the flick. I have to admit the best part I liked about the video was the jam session with Sandler in the \\"Special Features\\" section of the DVD. Overall, I have to say I didn't really care for the movie but then again maybe I was looking for a little more of Sandlers funny side to help it along.Reign Over Me (Widescreen Edition)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"The hubby and I were really looking forward to this one and I hate to be the first party pooper on the ratings but... It only gets 2 stars because Don Cheadle was so good in it. Adam Sandler was good too but it was just soooo slow. Not like I thought this was going to be some feel good movie but you wanted to hang yourself it was so depressing and with no real resolution. It was so long that when I realized there was 30 minutes left, I got online and read the ending to see if it was worth watching. It wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I saw this movie last night for the first time. First of all I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler, he's had a couple movies I've enjoyed but not many but this movie was totally different than anything I have ever seen him do before. Not only was it not funny but it was extremely boring, didn't make any sence and very stupid. I would not recomend this movie to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reign Over Me","review":"The subject matter in this movie makes it difficult to rate in accordance to your scale as it surpasses the 5 stars you allow. I have complex PTSD and I related to this film as no other accept perhaps \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". I don't even like Adam Sandler but after seeing his performance in a dramatic role I'm now a fan forever if he should ever again portray a dramatic character in any film. SUPERB ACTING!!!!!! More movies need to be produced about this debilitating subject matter. There just aren't enough to help the public understand how devastating it is to live with every day and every waking moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reign Over Me","review":"Adam Sandler takes on a role that challenges his acting range. He plays a depressed middle age man who wants nothing to do with the world. Don Cheadle plays a Dentist who runs into Sandler's character on the street. Cheadle and Sandler used to be college roommates studying to become dentists. The two start talking and catching up. Cheadle soon realizes that Sandler needs mental help and tries to get it for him. Sandler wants nothing to do with it. This is a very sad movie and Adam Sandler as well as all the other actors do a superb job. I highly recommend this movie. But beware if you are expecting a comedy performance from Sandler.

After seeing some of the mindless flicks he's stared in- not that they wern't appreciated- I was completely blown away by Adam Sandler's performance in this wonderful film. I'm sure this role took a toll on him, but he really should take on some more serious roles. He's so good at them. I loved \\"Funny People\\" and even \\"50 First Dates\\" had some dramatic tones, but this one was a triumph. Watch it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everyone","review":"I just love Adam Sandler & Don Cheadle. This is one of Adams best roles, not only is it serious, I wasn't really sure after seeing Punch Drunk Love. But it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I already own it, but got this one for my mother. She said it was like new and really loved the story line. It makes my cry everytime I watch it. Even though we were across the states when 911 happened, America's heart went out to the fallen and their families. This is just one look inside the devistation of a family and the ones that survived. I don't think any of us will ever forget, but it is definitely a reminder, eye opener,ect of the devistation that happened that day to our fellow brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont know why I love it so much.","review":"I wont go on with an extensive review here, as I think there are enough. I will say that this movie sparks a range of emotions within me every time I watch it. I laugh one moment, cry(or try not to) the next. I dont read into all the character development, or the 9/11 storyline like most of the negative reviewers have. I watch and enjoy. Every single time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect bummer of a movie","review":"Now, who would watch this, really? A former dentist whose family was killed on 9/11 suffers from PTS while Don Cheadle tries to snap him out of it for two hours. There are no laughs, but, strangely, there are no tears here either. It's just an unrelenting downer, though it does have a somewhat Hollywood ending. Sandler's mumbling gets annoying, and when he tries to commit suicide by cop, he still ends up free, which probably would never happen in real life. Watch this if you want to be bummed out for two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warming","review":"This movie is absolutly fantastic. Adam Sandler is again, amazing, as he always is.

It was fairly simple to set and it worked well until I noticed that the clock was falling behind. I reset it and slowly it fell behind again. I went and bought a new battery and it still fell behind. I am looking at it right now after reseting it for the last time a couple of weeks ago and it is almost 15 minutes behind. With the clock being so off, it makes me wonder how accurate the other modes are. I either recieved a shody stopwatch or some reconfiguring needs to be done by the manufacturer.Update 09/02/2006:Was cleaning out my desk and came upon my stopwatch(don't ask me why I still have it). I was delt another hard blow when I looked at the clock again. It hasn't fallen behind this time. No, instead it is twenty minutes fast. I am incredibly disturbed by this.

As reported by other reviewers, the alarm seems to go off at random times and there is no obvious way to stop it. I was hoping that the Sportline website might have a manual with better instructions. The web site says that the manual can be found on the website, but I can't find it.

Two alien factions are struggling to regain control of Planet, or Manifold Six as they call it, while several new human factions emerge.This may become a little repetitive for those familiar with Alpha Centauri at the beginning, but play for long enough and you'll be hooked all over again. New native lifeforms, units, technologies, projects and facilities spark up Planet and allow you to rediscover the game. You can mix and match factions to pit your favourite side against the new, or try one of the alien factions and see how bizarrely they transform units and human technology.The creators of this game tried to make it a cross between an expansion pack and a sequel, and they've succeeded amazingly. As addictive as Alpha Centauri itself, Alien Crossfire is a worthy successor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Expansion","review":"Alien Crossfire is not a sequel but a refinement of the original game which, by the way, can still be played after the expansion is installed. Gameplay is unchanged but the new techs and units add balance and even more subtlety to the game. I find the seven new factions to be slightly more powerful than the seven original but it's fun to mix and match. The two alien factions have an advantage at the beginning of the game but are left out of the world council, which can be a big disadvantage later on. There are some minor bugs so be sure to get the patch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expansion is a rip off;","review":"The game is fun to play and the graphic change is tremendous improvement over the original Alpha Centauri;However the time it took to change a few graphics and one or two game points is so little; I was hardly worth buying originally; this is why so few people bought it and why its value is higher;I like the improvements to the interface and story line the alien crossfire yields; but it is weak as far as an improvement; however I'll probably keep my copy.The two alien race factions Manifold Caretakers and the Manifold Usurpers and the terraforming icons for these factions is pure genius and artistically great; my favorite faction is the Nautalis Pirates;And the fungal tower is a refreshing improvement to the creatures of Alpha Centauri;"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite tea","review":"I drink two cups of this tea every day.

I would highly recommend buying Twinnings green tea with mint. It doesn't have \\"Moroccan mint\\" as a title, but it is a lot closer to the original namesake.

Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea \\"taste\\" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. \\"Sushi Bar\\"-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty.

I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less.

The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected.

Not strong, though, and very, very smooth.A bit of honey or sweetener is nice with this one.I don't get distinct tastes of other things that they put in the tea -- the flavor is more of a gestalt. It is a mint flavor that is more complex than the typical strong plain mint tea.Very, very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"First of all, the smell when you open each bag is very pleasing. I like the fact that each tea bag is individually foil wrapped for freshness. I enjoy this tea at least twice per day, especially mid-afternoon at work when time seems to stand still. If you like herbal spices you will definitely enjoy this tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not the best","review":"This is a good product. But I thought it was not as smooth as Tzao (sp?) or even Bigelow Organic Green Tea (from Sam's Club). The Bigelow is also much less expensive (175 bags for about $7.00). I've had better tea than all of these in Asia, but don't know the brand names.Also, if you go to China or Japan, green tea is usually not green. It varies from dark brown to pale green, including many shades of amber depending on growing conditions, processing and harvesting time.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I love the Stash brand tea. I love the flavors of Pomegranate, Raspberry but put them together with green tea isn't a taste I like. I figured given the fact that I love the taste of Pomegranate and Raspberries I would like this one but personally I don't like it. But just because I don't like it doesn't mean someone else wouldn't like it. It is something you should judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tea, good price, refreshing, and healthy","review":"This tea is quite good as bagged green teas go. The best--or among the best--I've found on a supermarket shelf. However, I work with a lot of Chinese people and so routinely get gifts of quality green teas from China. As such, I'ma bit spoiled. And while this tea holds its own and may be a top choice among American teas, if I had a nice stable connection for good green teas from China, I'd like to get those. Problem is, many are expensive. One gift from a wealthy family member in China was a container that I was told cost about 7000 RMB, or about $1000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astringent, weak tea","review":"I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like, I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best price you'll find","review":"This is one of my favorite teas. Stash's mix of green tea and chai spice is the best I have found. It is aromatic, yet milder than regular chai. Tastes great both plain and with milk. This deal on Amazon is by far the cheapest way to buy it, especially if you \\"subscribe and save.\\" I drink this almost every day during the fall and winter, so it is a great opportunity to stock up. If you enjoy green tea, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemongrass and Mint","review":"It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste. It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too. The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass. I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint. It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes. I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor. Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tea, don't buy online","review":"I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angeliques's Descent","review":"This book was well written but too dark for me. I could only get through the first few chapters before I decided not to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"As a Dark Shadows fan I looked forward to this book. I was disappointed that Lara Parker didn't remember the last time Barnabas and Angelique were together or didn't do any research before she wrote this book. At the end of the 1840 storyline Barnabas realized how much in love he was with Angelique after she helped him save Quentin Collins. He was about to declare his love to her when she was shot and killed by Lemar Trask.Barnabas chased after Trask to get revenge but was thwarted when Trask went into the parallel time room and disappeared into 1841 Parallel time. None of this is mentioned in Parker's book. She writes Barnabas' character as if he still fears and hates Angelique even though this book is supposed to continue the 1970/71 Collins family storyline. If this book is supposed to continue the storyline Barnabas should mourn Angelique's passing. He shouldn't be fearful that she might return.The only thing I enjoyed about this book were the chapters involving Angelique's past."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Dark Shadows Completists Only","review":"Somewhere within this dull 500-page novel there is a good 250-page novel.

Unfortunately, these ideas get lost amidst the overly-descriptive prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Shadows: Angelique's Descent","review":"I am an avid Dark Shadows fans, ever since I was in grade school, now that I am older, and working on my second college degree, I can really enjoy Dark Shadows on the Sci-Fi channel.

Actress Lara Parker, the original Angelique, writes an intriguing, erotic tale of betrayal, occultism and secrets with the first family of Collinsport in a time long ago. I won't say I'm a die-hard fan, but I do know Angelique's story was one of the few things that captured my attention about this series (and which continues to intrigue me). Parker's writing style is lush and fluid, with an amazing ability to capture the essence of the actors who played those fantastic characters every DS fan has come to love (or hate, as the case may be). I've read some of her work before (she contributed to INNOVATION Comics' DS comic book series) and I was pleased -- she's outdone herself here with this excellent first novel of a (hopefully) long series of DS novels. Don't be afraid of the dark -- try this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice reminder of why DS is so fun","review":"It was nice to finally read something new about two of the most important characters in DS. Parker does a nice job of setting atmosphere and filling in some of the internal components of Angelique. However, the book took too much time during Angelique's early years without using this background information to inform her motivation in later years. What was it about these experiences that made her drawn to Barnabas or made her so vengeful in the actual story line of the soap? Likewise, Parker should have spent more time on the latter years (pre the story line seen on TV - when A & B first become intertwined) in a more substantial way. Nonetheless, it was a fun read and I look forward to having a go at the latest DS novel. It's great to see some new material about some wonderfully fun characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"If you are a fan of dark shadows, then you already know the story, the first part of the book is about a young Angelique which was a dull read the second half is a retelling of dark shadows earlier episode's which l have seen many times, I will read another book from Lara Parker, but this book was disappointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good good good","review":"This book is soooo good.

It was not. The actors were adequate (I am not a great fan of Robert Donat) but only. The film was dark, the sound poor, the characters did not really come alive to me and I saw very little believable chemistry between Donat's character, Sir Robert Morton, and that of the Winslow daughter, played by Margaret Leighton. The courtroom part was the best but the whole movie suffered from severe creakiness. My advice: go straight to the newer version, which was beautifully acted, completely engrossing, and blessed with wit and subtle humor as well as dramatic intensity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor audio quality","review":"This is an excellent movie but the copy I received had very poor sound and only mediocre picture quality. Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Involving story of a father willing to do whatever it takes to prove his schoolboy son innocent of a minor theft.","review":"Based on an English play, this film does a good job of showing the consequences to an average middle-class family stemming from the father refusing to allow his young son to be dismissed from the Royal Navy College for a small theft he says he did not commit. The father's choices reverberate though the whole family. and the nation itself. Good enough to watch, with a lovely cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine viewing for fans of british drama and Robert Donat.","review":"This movie is one of the finer examples of 1940's british drama. Robert Donat (Goodbye Mr. Chips/ The Count of Monte Cristo) gives a great double- edged performance as an aloof barrister and as a conscientious member of Parliament. In the House of Commons Donat argues for bringing the case of the accused naval cadet forward, quoting the Magna Carta, \\"Let right be done.\\" The British Naval Ministry however does not want to set the dangerous precedent of allowing a subject to sue The Crown. Although Robert Donat is the nominal star of the movie he doesn't make his first appearance until 30 minutes into the feature! Margaret Leighton appears as the accused's sister and as a suffragette offers considerable sexual tension between her character and Donat's.

Our narrower style would not fit properly in the connector. So, it was either return it and pay as much for shipping as the item cost, or use the connector cable sent with it.

Still, for the price, probably would've kept it.After lighting the burners on high and letting it run for a while I bent over to change the setting to medium and the burners went out.

The housings behind the reflector (normally not hot at all) turned red hot and emitted a loud \\"jet engine\\" sound.

So I am stuck with a defective product, which is too bad. It seemed a good deal for the price and the burner that does work puts out a good amount of heat. (Another possible shortcoming: the dishes/burners can't be re-aimed, but are both fixed aiming straight forward.

It doesn't sound as technical, but it's still that heavy sound that you would expect from the band. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I hear way too many similarities to Trivium's brilliant album released last year 'Ascendancy' & As I Lay Dying's awesome 'Shadows are Security.'

I was told by the Tech support people that although it is rated waterproof it is only is it is \\"standing\\" water and up to 1 meter.

It does a nice job with the GPS, the GMRS/FRS is clear, the batteries don't vibrate loose when riding (I mount mine on the handlebars of my dirtbike while riding in the desert)batteries have a good life, the poll location send location is a GREAT feature. Imagine riding with your kids and you loose sight of them, simply poll their location and there they are on your screen. Also if something happens to you being able to send your location is great.

It seems to be a classic example of having an unsophisticated design poured into a package entirely too small to contain it. The directions were of no help, which made using it more than I wanted to endure. It wasn't made to be user friendly enough to entice the user to explore its possibilities. I would have liked it better if less memory space were used for features and more for menus that would guide the user into the features that he really wanted to use. The screen had to be high resolution...it bordered on being microscopic in size and stuffed with information that one could scarcely sort out.

I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund. Be sure to test this yourself. Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down. I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price. I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio. This is an overpriced GPS.

Too bad that Arnold doesn't mention his use (or abuse?) of growth drugs. The second part of the book, where Arnold gives advice on how one should train, is unfortunately of low value to somebody who wants to know how to train for maximum results.

He talks not just about how he got into musclebuilding, but also his family, his time in the Austrian Army, his goals, his love life,etc. The second half is a how to guide for muscle building. Not bad but needed some work. For instance he lays out a diet to gain weight but doesn't give a plan to lose weight ( other than some basic don't eat junkfood,etc.).

Not in the spirit of the movie or the truth as I understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate DVD","review":"The squadron identification letters on the side of the Avro Lancaster shown in the picture are wrong. 617 Squadron's letters were AJ (and still are to my knowledge, as 617 The Dambusters are still an operational RAF Squadron flying Tornados). If the producers can't even get that basic fact right then how can we rely on the rest the content?

It provides next to nothing in terms of educational value, and the man himself should have thought a lot harder about the content before throwing it together.It's surprising that LP allowed this DVD to be made and released, especially considering the generally informative and well made releases they have in the marketplace.When viewed after a well put together and enjoyable tutorial like Luis Conte's 'Studio Percussionist\` you soon realise what a waste of time Bashiri's effort is.Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"This DVD didn't give me what I was looking for. The DVD seem to promote his CD rather than teach contemparary music rhythms. I felt that Luis Conte's \\"Studio Percussionist\\" was a much better learning DVD. Also, \\"Adventures in Rhythm\\" was pretty good, but keep your remote close because he moves fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bordering on Useless...","review":"Either I completely misunderstood the target audience, or I'm a lot better at hand percussion than I thought! The percussion \\"techniques\\" on this DVD were about as basic/minimal as it gets. And I thought I was supposed to be gaining access to some \\"inside info\\"!It looks to me like the \\"author\\" of this work (Bashiri Johnson) really seems to be much more comfortable as a stick (kit?) percussion player, and he really didn't exhibit much skill as a hand drummer (no traditional hand techniques such as slaps, no \\"standard\\" afro/cuban conga patterns such as tumbao, calypso, bolero, etc).I really feel that my money was misspent on this product. So far the best investment I have made in video hand percussion instruction is the Kalani \\"Ultimate Conga/Bongo Jam\\" series; these DVDs are much more informative and useful for those who are qualified to swim in anything deeper than the kiddie pool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential cookbook.","review":"If someone was starting up a cookbook collection, I would recommend this one as a great place to begin. Not only are the recipes a good foundation for any cooking repertoire, each of them carries an explanation of why a particular prepartion approach is most appropriate. Even though I have over 20 years of experience in the kitchen, I still found some very informative and helpful information in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star recipes......no stars for the index....","review":"I agree with all the five star reviews, except for one thing....the index is very difficult to read.....I went through with a marker and drew in divisions between the alphabet sections, and put a header on each page, but it is still tedious......I suggest in future editions the authors use varying type face, and different font sizes to distinguish between topics and subtopics. I have at least a hundred cook books, and this is the first one I reach for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Standard Recipes","review":"This is not a cook book one looks to for new recipes, rather it is a cook book that will tell you the best way to do something basic, like cooking a turkey. It is also a really interesting read for those who are really anal about finding the best way to do something, in this case cook (the title is apt.) The book is not strong on using innovative ingredients or the preparation of interesting new dishes, but hey! this is a book that will tell you how to do the basics, which is always good.This Thanksgiving I followed the recipe for cooking a turkey. I innovated a little, like adding garlic, but basically I did everything they said. It was the best turkey I have ever had. It was so good that my mother called me months later to find out how I made it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A COOKING BIBLE!","review":"This is hands-down the best cookbook I've ever owned. It gets into the chemistry of cooking--things like WHY uncooked pie crusts stick to pans and how to prevent it. Most cookbooks stick to just straightforward recipes and some \\"hows\\", without ever explaining the \\"whys\\", but The Best Recipe covers that and more for EVERY basic dish you can think of. Any fool can follow a recipe, but it takes a certain, special kind of foodie fuss over the details and theories about cooking. This cookbook is for anyone who's obsessed with the pleasures of preparing fabulous food...eating it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Recipe Cook Book","review":"I think this Cookbook is wonderful, great recipes. The only thing I have against it is that all pictures of recipes (except) the front cover are all black and white.

I also feel that you should tell people when they are in color and also when they are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Essential Cookbook","review":"I almost hesitate to advise people to buy this book, for the selfish reason of wanting to hoard these cooking secrets. Seriously, though, I have learned skills and methods I had never seen elsewhere, and it has improved my cooking immensely. It wasn't that bad before! I have successfully made many recipes from this book and have found in most cases it IS \\"the Best Recipe.\\" Before I cook anything from another cookbook, I cross-check against The Best Recipe first. Everyone who loves to cook and takes pride in flawless execution should own this book.The only thing that could possibly improve TBR would be a full color illustration and photo section."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Recipe","review":"For years I have depended on Cook's Magazine to teach me the right way to do so many things.

They have made some stuff over 30 times until they decided it was perfect in taste, color, texture, etc. How amazing is that. It has tons and tons of recipes for everything!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reap the benefits","review":"Wow. You would not believe what the staff of Cook's Illustrated went through to find the perfect way to roast a chicken or cook an egg. The great news is of course you get to reap the benefits of their wisdom and testing. Before each section (Roast Chicken, for example), there is a summary of their test efforts. What they went through, what the result was, what they found. All this just so they can show you the perfect roasting method. If you don't care to know, just skip to the recipe and follow the instructions. If you do care to know, read the sections and understand the directions.There aren't a lot of \\"recipes\\" per se. That's because the book concentrates more on cooking method rather than a straight-out recipe book. Again, in the example of roast chicken, they suggested butter, salt, and pepper for seasoning. But it's their method that insures the chicken will be moist and delicious, whatever seasoning you add, yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cook's Illustrated Produces Again!!","review":"Wow. They never cease to amaze me. This is not just a salt and pepper cookbook. It's a tutorial to everything your Mom and Grandma never were able to teach you. It is a book of techniques. I received this book for Christmas, I looked up the Prime Rib recipe, which yes, calls for salt and pepper. But, also a cooking method I have never heard of before and probably wouldn't have tried if I had seen it anywhere else. I served up the juiciest most delicious Prime Rib dinner thanks to them. I am a really good cook and I still learn so much from them. Every one of their methods I have tried has produced great results. From Prime Rib to poached eggs. They don't have a lot of exotic recipes, but they do tell you how and why to cook many things very well. Next I'm off to try the brine soaked turkey, its supposed to be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Resource!","review":"The Best Recipe seems to be an expanded edition of The Cook's Bible. Both these recipe books are now complete necessities in my day to day cooking. Even when I've discovered a fantastic recipe in another cookbook, I then consult Best Recipe to see if there's any additional way to improve upon what I've found. I credit both these books (Best/Bible) with improving my sauteed and roasted chicken - no more over-doneness!! And the chocolate chip cookies?!? OH MY - soooo good, so chewy and yet crisp on the outside!! My only complaint about Best is that the index is maddening to use. I finally marked mine up with the alphabet so that I could more easily navigate my way through it. Thanks to Christopher Kimball and the rest of the editors at Cook's Illustrated for another great cooking resource...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all serious cooks","review":"I am a budding home chef and out of the 400 cookbooks I own, this one is the one I use the most when I am trying to find the best way / secret to cooking any ingredient. I was stumped when preparing BBQ pork ribs and the secret I learned was to wrap the ribs after cooking in aluminium foil and let it rest in a paper bag. It works like a charm! My seared Ahi Tuna was a failure until I found out that the secret was to soak it in extra virgin olive oil for 1 hour. This is the only cookbook I read cover to cover. Yes, the prose is rather dry but if you are a serious cook intent on improving your technique, the book is worth every penny. It sure beats trial and error. Read this book and get it right the first time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"I really like this cookbook. More for the information surrounding the recipes than for the recipes themselves. I learned a great deal from reading this book thoroughly.Not that the recipes aren't good; they are, though it's not for me to say if they're the best. I thought the recipe for Clam Chowder was pretty lackluster, but maybe I'm spoiled by having so many great versions available here in New England.Really, my one complaint is the index; I find it extremely difficult to use as there is so little typographical differentiation between headings, such as Beef, and the contents, like Roasted. But, the fact that I care about the index tells you I use this book. You will, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"this book is ok not as good as I had hoped you can find a lot of free recipies on the internet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized","review":"I rated this cookbook only two stars for a simple reason: poor organization. It is impossible to find anything in this book, especially if you're in a hurry. The Table of Contents is so sparse (only listing major sections like \\"Poultry\\") that you literally have to hunt through each chapter. (There isn't any additional content listing at the beginning of the chapters, either.)Also, the book claims to have test some recipes 80 times but they can't even give you the courtesy of providing an estimated preparation time.There is some nice bonus information like Science Facts and recipe variations, but unfortunately because of the layout it all blends in together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have and great gift","review":"This cookbook is my all-time favorite. The book covers 700 recipes and explains in great detail how the folks at Cook's Illustrated came to achieve the \\"best recipe\\". It debunks some old cooking techniques that your mother taught you and introduces you to new methods. I cooked a New Year's Eve meal straight from the book and my guests were raving about it! I highly recommend this book to new cooks and seasoned pro's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Recipe - The Worst Index","review":"This is a fantastic cookbook. All the reviews make that clear. However, the index is nearly useless. Who in the world edited it??? They should be fired. It is nearly impossible to tell where you are in the alphabet.

I used to dread cooking but now I can find recipes that have basic ingredients and taste great! This book proves things don't have to be complicated to be great.

This cookbook has the one perfect recipe for every dish. The authors did a lot of research testing several recipes and compiling the best. They tried 80 recipes just for chocolate chip cookies. The authors also discuss the process of trying several recipes and suggest the best kitchen utensils and ingredients. The Best Recipe is an excellent cookbook. There are recipes for everything from appetizers to desserts. The book is a must-have for any cook. I recommend The Best Recipe for anyone interested in cooking and tired of trying out numerous recipes for one dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, after a fashion.","review":"The basic idea is good--it will collect spider webs--but there are some significant design problems. When the tip contacts a surface (which it will when collecting webs off walls and ceilings) the friction causes the unit to stall. The extending rod (about the size and thickness of a portable radio whip antenna) is insufficiently rigid to support the plastic collecting tip in operation. This leads to severe oscillations and makes collecting small fine webs clumsy. The motor is too seriously underpowered to overcome either the friction or the oscillations, and half the time in use is spent waiting for the unit to spin back up to speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I purchased this fireplace for out door use.

If you've taken a lot of time off because of fatigue or other pregnancy related issues, or aren't a fitness fan, this video will help you stay toned. You'll have to supplement with cardio of course, to keep up your endurance and keep weight off, but strength training is just as important. All of the women featured are fit with just a tiny perfect belly, which is probably intended to be inspiring, but makes me want to slap them instead. I'd like to see at least one pleasantly plump woman sweating with the rest. Who really only gains 20 pounds anyway?Enough ranting-see Kathy Smith's pregnancy video or Leisa Hart's fit mama for some good cardio choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I have only one other workout tape for pregnancy. So I did not want to get bored of using just one so i decided to get this one. I was happy I did get this one. I love this one alot. I like that it has different work outs then my other dvd I bought. I like the instructor too. Sometimes if the instructor is not good you don't even feel like watching the dvd. I recommend this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet, relaxing DVD -- then, you get a blasting ad!","review":"My daughter really enjoyed this DVD. It was a really nice \\"settling down\\" video. Then, to my shock (though, if I had read reviews here--I wouldn't have been so surprised) the show ended and a blaringly loud ad came on. What a ridiculous decision to have made by the marketing folks at Baby Einstein. Any relaxation achieved for your child will be quickly undone at the end of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"My son loves all the Baby Einstein videos. This one is very peaceful with soft music and images. It still has the puppet shows, but they are toned down and I think it's pretty much this sleepy lamb. It made me tired watching it! Good for winding down or relaxing with baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alignment Critical!","review":"This is a handy accessory. Had I bought it at the list price, I would have been a bit disappointed. This is an example of how things are not as simple as you read. That can be a good thing. You DO have to know the sky to use this and the scope together! Also the setup requires knowing true compass direction, the bright stars overhead, and it helps to have a GPS or at least a good guess at your lat. and long.. I have a Star Atlas 2000.0, but do not have all the names of the stars requested by the Autostar during setup. I recommend picking the 2-star mode (NOT the EASY mode) and select widely separated stars that 1) you can recognize and 2) are near the area you want to view... This about doubles the accuracy. Lastly 3) center the alignment stars in THE SCOPE not just in the view finder. This is VERY IMPORTANT in the higher power ETX125. Overall, it is great how it will maintain a track in the level alt.azamath mode. That alone is worth the [price]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autostar for Dummies? Where is it? I'll buy.","review":"I'm a rank astronomy novice. I read the Autostar manual word for word twice before I dared to hook it to my ETX-90 scope. So far the Autostar is far far too complicated for this CPA, MBA to understand. The computer seems very slow to respond to commands. Maybe if I read the Autostar manual another dozen times I'll figure some of it out. Meanwhile I'll use the simple controller that came with my scope.

As we turned the page and saw that the bunny's parents were a cow (wearing a flowered hat) and a horse we laughed and laughed and laughed. It's a heartwarming story about a bunny and his nontraditional parents that is also very funny.As a book to teach about adoption I'm sure there are better books. As a book that will make your child giggle and want to give you a hug it's a terrific book with a wonderful happy ending. The artistry in the illustrations is fantastic and the pictures are so nicely painted that we paused and looked at the pictures and the painting techniques before reading each page.The reading level is right around the second grade level and it has some nice vocabulary. It's a good book for a young reader to enjoy reading to his or her parents with a few new vocabulary words for them to learn.We love Twichy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful awful awful awful","review":"I agree with the other negative reviews -- this is without a doubt the single worst adoption book for kids I have ever read -- and, as an adoptive mom, I've read quite a few. I just got back from a meeting of my adoption support group, at which we compared notes on children's adoption books, and our group was unanimous in our dislike for this book. None of us (five families) would ever read this book to our kids. This book presents adoption as a big problem, something so upsetting it causes the adopted child to run away. I prefer books that explain adoption without implying that it's something to be upset about.

It maneuvers very easy and our 15 month-old daughter loves to ride in it. We recently returned from an international vacation and the travel case came in very handy...no problems checking it and no concerns about its cleanliness after traveling in cargo. The shoulder strap also adds to its convenience...easy to carry over your shoulder and very lightweight. Incredibly easy to open and close. Great canopy for added sun protection. We are thrilled with this purchase...worth every cent over the cheap umbrella strollers!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this stroller","review":"what junk, i have a cheapie stroller that has better wheels..the shading cover is also worthless, i felt ripped off when i made the mistake of buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an OK stroller","review":"I had been very excited when I got this stroller for my baby shower. I really liked the light weight and I had the carseat that goes with this stroller. Yes, it was definately a convenience when I had to go out the first few months. But now a year later, the wheels really do not push well. For me, it does not push well on smooth or uneven surfaces. Whenever I am in a store the wheels are always sticking. I have finally decided to retire this stroller. And I'll be getting a chicco umbrella stroler instead. One of my friends has one so I tried it before I bought it. The wheels and steering are great on it!!! But I had expected the be using the Combi for quite a bit longer than I had. If I had to buy something initially I think I would have gone with Peg Perego or Maclaren.Sorry Combi...I really wanted to love this stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't bother with a traditional umbrella stroller","review":"This is a great lightweight stroller. I have a LiteRider stroller and a cheap umbrella stroller. The LiteRider was impossible to carry when folded and took up too much space in my trunk. The umbrella stroller was ok, but didn't have a canopy and the handles were too low. This stroller folds compactly, has a carry strap and is so easy to maneuver with one hand. I had to buy this when I took a trip home with my 13 month old daughter because I had the worst time getting through the airport with the LiteRider. This stroller allowed me to have two hands free because I could sling it over my shoulder with the carry strap. I only gave this stroller 4 stars because it would be sweet if it had a cup holder--but not a big deal at all. This stroller is worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to travel w/","review":"I love the look of this stroller, although mine is red, silver, and black. I bought it b/c I needed a lightweight stroller to travel w/ and one w/ a shoulder strap. Although it is very lightweight, the weight does hurt your shoulder after 5 min of carrying but switching shoulders helps. The only problem i have w/ it is when baby leans forward the velcro on the backrest becomes unnattached and the backrest comes forward w/ her. This may not happen w/ a younger, lighter baby, mine is 19 mo. It didn't seem to pose as a safety risk though. All in all it seems pretty comfortable and does its job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is a pretty decent clock. 9 minute snooze is better than 10, I think.

Rathburn realizes what is going on, and joins forces with Barnabas to get Angelique.A bit rambling at times, and one wishes for more of Barnabas, but a good book overall.By the way, there are some in-jokes for series fans: The Pennock Supper Club (actor Chris Pennock was on DARK SHADOWS); \\"Mr. DiCenzo, the lawyer\\" (assistant producer George DiCenzo); and \\"Gordon Collins\\" (Gordon Russell was one of the writers). There may be more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go and get it!","review":"I could not put the book down, read it in two and half days. Excellent. Very well written.

However, I feel Lara Parker's passion for the project captures the concept in a fuller sense. Her quality writing is a cut above what is presented here.

Now, the shadows again descend upon Collinwood as Angelique reaches out from the bowels of hell in an effort to reunite with... or perhaps destroy... the only man she ever has loved, Barnabas Collins. And of course, caught in the middle of the supernatural forces all around her is Victoria Winters, who finds herself both longing after and fearing Barnabas even as she is swept off her feet by a mysterious newcomer. How closely does this book mirror the beloved series? Well, the first post-prologue chapter begins with the words, \\"My name is Victoria Winters...\\" Fans of the serial should snap this book up and perhaps use their own dark powers to summon up new books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric, sexy, fun! I loved this book!","review":"\\"Dreams of the Dark\\" continues in the best tradition of the Dark Shadows TV series. It is full of gothic atmosphere, yet not wordy in the way of traditional Victorian literature. These vamps suck the reader in, and make you like it. I wouldn't dream of spoiling the story for those who have yet to experience it; suffice it to say that the familiar characters hold some surprises, and the new vamp is complex, fascinating, and oh so seductive! Fans of Anne Rice, vampire fiction, and Dark Shadows alike should enjoy this latest effort.

The editors of this series would be better off nurturing stories that expand and contribute to the existing Collins Mythos as did \\"Descent\\". The change in character of Victoria Winters was inexcusable and the description of her in the vampire's embrace completely out of sync with the original series. The tacked-on revelation of Vicki's birthright in the final chapter was, like this entire ordeal, uninspired. An entire novel could be devoted to exploring her link to the Collins family, and in keeping with the spirit of Dark Shadows should be far more sinister and complicated than this undeveloped explanation. Die hard fans are only fooling themselves if they find this to be a valid contribution to the Dark Shadows legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Great resource!","review":"I love this book!

I live overseas where OTC meds are not easy to find or to identify, so buying items like this through the US Government mail is my best option. However, being charged postage fees that equal more than the initial cost of the product (and twice what the USPS charges) is not acceptable.

Second, the heel slips off your foot in the back, making them difficult to walk in. Third, there is no cushioning in the forefoot nor is there room to place a gel insert (my feet are narrow and yet they are squeezed under the straps in this shoe).I do wear pumps regularly and have a respectable collection, but these must be the most uncomfortable and unbearable ones I own.

The 2 zippers do not even meet--they end where the velcro strip begins. Also, the velcro strip gets in the way when you are trying to return the camera to the bag.I love the eye-catching metallic blue color of this bag but this is not the right bag for the Lumix.

Many people would clearly point the Dark Phoenix Saga,that is the highlight of the volume. Howver, I also enjoy the X-Men's ordeal with Proteus just as much. Both are tragic on a Shakespearean scale. The other stories with The X-men's battling the likes of Arcade and Wendigo are good too. Cyclops' fight with D'sparye is a good horror story as well. So what if the book is in black and white. That accentuates some of the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"The Marvel Essentials program is a fantastic idea, and a great idea, and here is why.

The set collects Uncanny X-Men #120-144. Buy it! Highest Possible Recommendation. The only problem with this paperback edition is that it's not in color.

Don't worry if you have the 3D Photorealistic Toolkit, this book follows on to show how to create natural environments and many other excellent tricks.Written in Bill's unique and friendly style this is more like reading a novel than a user manual.

It does not discuss materials in depth, or lighting, Global Illumination etc. So a large part of what makes scenes photrealistic is not touched upon. More importantly, his geometry detailing techniques will no doubt add a couple of zillion polygons. No discussion on that either- no scheme is presented to keep a count of polygons, or keep them within sensible limits.Without proper lighting and materials, Bill does not really produce photorealistic results.The description of imaginary worlds and creatures is unimaginative and tedious.The underlying principles are noteworthy, but could be summarised in one page- which i think Bill *has* done: it's there somewhere on the net."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed is a more accurate description","review":"What a waste of money.

Many of the translations are inaccurate, the book is very expensive, and one cannot look up English words to find their translations. Instead, one must first look up the Egyptian word to find the hieroglyphic translation. In addition, when I ordered the book, it came with only one volume of the two, so I now have only 'a- kha' listings without an index. I was disappointed to find so many errors and I was unable to look up any words quickly. This book is only for experts who know where mistakes have been made, and want to take the time to correct them.Note- The second volume is available at Amazon, and probably has an English index.

In this volume, they get a new RX8 and they show you it's strengths and weaknesses. I was surprised by some of it's weaknesses and for that, i consider BMI to have done quite a good job. I found the beginning to be a bit boring-- they are driving the RX8 a bit and relaying how it feels for driver comfort. But once they bring it to the Tsukuba Circuit and have it race against other cars, it picks up from there. This DVD has more than just the RX8 segments though, and is overall very entertaining, and really enjoyable to watch. I don't regret buying this product at all.

It explains commonly used period terms for different parts of clothing, including noting at what point in time the usage of the term changes (if it does). In fact it has helped me understand some apparent contradictions in other sources. As well it discusses other useful things like hairstyles and accessories. The organization is very helpful. It divides men's and women's clothing, as well as dividing the century into distinct periods.

There is a bar across the only area to put something into the basket. Once you finally get something into it, it will drag on the wheels- terrrible design, you think they would try some of these things out before they produced it.

First off, the editting of the bits and pieces of the episodes is terrible. The film jumps from one bit to the next with no apparent order. Secondly, the producer promote this product as being made from remastered prints. That's a laugh! The film looks like it was made to resemble an old Hong Kong martial arts film. The lighting was low and dark and the overall color had a yellosish quality. As for the audio, the editors tripped on this one to! There are scenes with Kato fighting where his yells and kicking sounds are conspicuously missing from the final edit. The Green Hornet is a great TV series! Once and for all, if the distributors of classic tv shows want to please the fans, release this and other great shows in the original broadcast format. Anything less is any insult to the fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest scam to Bruce Lee fans since \\"Game Of Death\\"","review":"The fact that this is episodes of the TV series edited into a \\"movie\\" is insulting, but not the worst part. The fact that the cover blurbs make it sound like Bruce Lee made a series of \\"Green Hornet\\" movies, and never mentions the TV series, is also insulting, but again, not the worst part. The worst part is that they added black bars to the top and bottom of the screen in a lame attempt to make us think that it's in widescreen format. Did they think we wouldn't notice every time somebody's head disappeared off the top of the picture? Additionally, the editing looks like it was done with an axe.

It is quite fun to see Bruce as Kato and brings back memories of seeing the series when I was a kid.

The Green Hornet DID run a full season; there WERE re-runs back then, too. While I like and respect Bruce Lee, watching too many of his movies becomes like being stuck in a revolving door; they start to look too much alike. This was NEVER the case with Green Hornet episodes. I am blessed with the bootleg versions-all 30, including the two 'crossover' ones with Batman.

I did read the review right before this one about the 'F61' error...but of course I thought that was just an isolated case. How wrong I was.I connected my system and speakers exactly as directed. After a bout 30 seconds of music, the receiver reads F61 and shuts off. I tried to adjust anything and everything. Nothing. It just reads F61 for 2 seconds and shuts off. Apparently F61 means there is afault in the power supply or something like that. It was pretty pathetic and there is no way I was about to spend money taking it to a dealer - its a BRAND NEW system. I immediately filed for a refund. Panasonic is also extremely unhelpful with this problem and just say to take it to an authorized repair center.

I took it to the nearest service center \\"60 Miles\\" and it took a month for them to call me back because the parts where on back order from Panasonic. So I went and picked it up got home and hooked it all back up. Plugged it in and what do you know it still had the same error code and would shut off. Still not fixed. A huge hassle and waste of Money/Time. Panasonic's customer care is horrid. They didn't help at all and where rude.

The only issue is that it runs on batteries to test batteries. The unit can test all sizes aaa, aa, c, d and nine volt. It can even test if a light bulb is good. I have used this to effectively test all our batteries in the house. I am moving towards rechargeable batteries since our kids are now burning through double A's like they were juice boxes. I have also purchased what is called \\"D\\" replacement spacers. This allows you to use double A's to run items that require \\"D\\" replacement batteries. They don't last as long but hey, they are rechargeable so who cares. What cheaper. Just let search amazon for key word \\"D spacers\\", without the quotes. Overall great product very solid build"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to be inaccurate","review":"I was looking forward to having a multi-purpose tester. I kind of liked the idea of being able to test lightbulbs too, because we have a few around that I don't know about and wanted to sort and either keep or recycle.In the end, I couldn't get an accurate result on the batteries I tested, and I couldn't even determine how to test lightbulbs. There were no real instructions for it, and every way I held the lightbulb to it got kind of a wonky result. Some of the batteries I tested were known duds, already used up, but the tester was showing them at full charge.Definitely not a very accurate tester, which is disappointing. I don't know if I just got a defective unit, or what... but the unit did match the picture on the product description, so it wasn't just the \\"wrong one\\".

The Howards were the descendents of Chief Bautista AKA Vowchester who was not a Yosemite Indian, but who was afraid of Chief Tenaya and the Ahwhanees. He and Chief Russio were the ones who coined the term \\"Yosemite\\" which means \\"Grizzly bear\\" or \\"Killer\\" and -mite \\"person\\". They also told Savage they were afraid of the Yosemites and would not enter Yosemite Valley because they feared the Ahwahnees.The cover shows a photo of Chris Brown AKA Lemee who stated that he was the last of the Nutchus (Noot-choos). Which were also not Yosemite Indians but signers of the treaties and foothill Indians. In fact the Nutchus hunted down Chief Tenaya for Savage.I agee with the first reviewer.

It was written to go with the recreated Miwok village behind the Yosemite Visitor Center.The interesting part is the text is in Miwok and English.The previous reviewer apparently has an ax to grind.

A Scottish variation on Les Miserables, it sees Ken Stott's typically bitterly furious cop stalking reformed debt collector turned artist Billy Connolly on the mean streets and leafy suburbs of Edinburgh, here shot in such oppressive and dark tones that it looks more like a Victorian prison than a holiday destination. Iain Robertson offers strong support as a hero-worshipping little gobs**te, but by the time the inevitable confrontation takes place without any great revelation you find yourself wondering if this journey was really necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The CD-ROM is Kaplan's strength","review":"I purchased four different GRE preparatory books from four different publishers. In the end, each had merits with the exception of one. From Kaplan, I found that the CD-ROM was its true (and only) strength. I don't particularly like all the \\"strategies\\" touted by preparatory material, Kaplan included. However, the CD-ROM is interactive, fun, educational and well-designed. The book I could do without, but the CD-ROM is a good place to start for a review of test material as well as the test structure itself. Please read my reviews concerning Princeton Review, Barron's and the ETS Powerprep software if you're interested in my comments regarding these materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those who don't study well alone","review":"After reading all the reviews, I purchased this thinking I had found a great study resource. I was very disappointed at how little information it contained. It has a basis for the GRE but oftentimes takes your knowledge for granted and doesn't completely explain answers to the problems in simple enough terms. If you did great in math without teacher assistance you'll have no problem with the book. However, if you have ever required a math tutor you will not find this all that helpful. Not to mention, the book leaves a lot out that you'll need to practice. Verbal wise, it's okay. It gives long lists of words and practice exams for you to do but again you really need to be a self motivator as the book is not at all interesting. I didn't find anything special about the CD rom. It is average, just like you'll find with any GRE study workbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"The CD is really useful but looks silly","review":"I haven't even opened the book yet, but I didn't have the patience and tried out the CD-ROM and was left pleasantly surprised.The first thing that hits you as you open the software is the corniness of it all--childish graphics, sounds, jokes, and worst of all, the presenters who must have lost their jobs on Nickelodeon and were a sympathy hire by Kaplan.But that's where the frivolity ends and utility begins. One can compose an individualised study plan which will stress the weak areas (the analytical part is mine), as well as give realistic practice tests. The latter is particularly important now that GRE's are mostly administered on computer.I still look forward to checking out the book (Kaplan has a proven track record), but I think I made a good buy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will definitely improve your score!","review":"I just took the GRE yesterday, after 2 months of studying. This book and CD ROM will absolutely prepare you for what you will face on the day of the test. The format of the test is EXACTLY like that used on the CD. The strategies outlined for all 3 sections in the book will help you tackle each section in the most effective way. My scores went up about 200 points in each section after using this program, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone, no matter how much (or little) help you feel you'll need. It is true that you have to listen to the annoying intro everytime you start the CD, but the improvement you'll see in your score is worth it.

I even had a second copy sent to me because I thought the first CD was bad. The problem is the CD uses an old version of Quicktime which is unfortunate. I am not about to take off a more recent version of Quicktime just to get this stuff to work. Even when I did take it off it did nothting but mess my system up. So I am sending this archaic software back to the company and will find something that is more up to date and doesn't rely on old versions of software to work.

But if I had known what the CD-ROM was like, I would have bought the book-only version.The program looks like it was coded by a marketing drone who decided to take a few Visual Basic courses, drop some acid, and start programming. For some reason, it installs not one, but two versions of QuickTime (2.12 and 3.02). The interface, which is supposed to resemble a car's dashboard, looks straight out of a Dali painting. The reason QuickTime is needed is for two annoying \\"guides\\" that pop up and talk to you, which is totally unnecessary... why not just let us READ what you want us to know? I find it hard to understand why a program for college seniors and graduates has an 8th-grade mentality.I am debating exchanging this book for the Non-CDROM version, but since I broke the shrink-wrap license I doubt it is returnable.

Either it is completely plagerized or Asa Drake and C Dean Andersson are one in the same. As the \\"Warrior Witch\\" novels are similar I am going for the latter.

The antennas on my units are sturdy. They have AC adapter main power with 3 AA (not included) batteries for back up. This allows one to unplug the unit and move it from room to room, if so desired. They have a separate On/Off switch. The unit can be unplugged from the wall and turned off until needed-think office, shop or some location other than primary. This will allow preservation of the settings and the battery power without drawing AC power. The alert notice area can be as broad or narrow as you wish to program.

Midland offered a new one to me for $15, then the supervisor lowered the price down to $12 upon their decision, but then they refused to honour the $12 offer after another sales rep called me; plus it costs $20 to return it to them and have to wait 2 weeks, so not worth the time and I will buy from another manufacturer by researching online well first.

I checked the SAME code and frequency selector and confirmed they were still correct. The only way to get the radio to receive the weather broadcast is to unplug it for quite a while (without batteries).

I certainly feel it important to get the word out for missing children, but it ought not trigger an audible alert. There is no action we can take at 2:00 in the morning. So in regards to that, I wish that I could configure the unit to only audible alert on certain events.

No idea why they would not provide an ability to filter out certain warnings, but this device is useless.Contacted tech support from midland about this, and never get got a reply. I see how on the website it does state this model can not select to warn on only certain messages.Look for another model if you do not like to be woken up for regular storms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working first month!","review":"Glad we had a back up system. This system stopped working the first month. Tried everything to get it to work again. I know it is programmed correctly because our hand held one works fine. Tried contacting Midland with no response. Already tossed the box so can't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had 2 of these die now...","review":"I had one of these units for 3 or four years, and for whatever reason it stopped working (I think the power supply went out, but I'm not sure)... so I ordered another one in Oct of '11... it is now June '12 - and the second one has died... when I hit the weather/snooze button to hear the weather, all I get is a high pitched tone/squeal sound.I'm junking this one as well - I won't order another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Except For Fatal Flaw","review":"I purchased this model for my parents a year ago, and it worked perfectly for 14 months. Then, as the 2012 storms began to move in, they noticed the radio was silent. When they tried to tune in to the weather updates, the radio only produced a high-pitched squeal. They called me over to look at it, but I couldn't repair it. I did a little research, and discovered that this model has a reputation for lasting only 12-18 months. Apparently the audio chip in this model is prone to breaking. I recommend avoiding this model.I was very surprised to find out Midland had allowed a model they knew was defective to go into circulation. I have other Midland products and have never before had a problem with the Midland brand. I'll most likely buy my parents another Midland radio to replace this one--just a different model!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One annoying storm season...","review":"...and then it died.Storm season here in Nebraska, is very busy for a weather radio. One storm system can bring dozens of alerts to a county. After being woken for countless watches, flood warnings, and other alerts of no consequence to me, I quickly realized that the ability to choose alerts is invaluable. Basically, the Midland WR100 cannot do that. After purchasing the much superior Sangean CL-100, the Midland was exiled to the basement, to bother us no more.Soon after, I noticed that the Sangean was alerting to warnings, while the Midland was silent. After some testing, it was determined that the Midland had quit altogether. It could not receive weather broadcasts, much less alert.To summerize, thirty bucks bought me one Spring of interrupted sleep, and little security. Isn't that what neighbors are for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"I bought this unit at our local grocery store because I wanted one I could program just to receive warnings in my immediate area. I got it all set up and I can clearly get the weather radio channel. I had it for a few months and fortunately, we have not had bad weather. However, I discovered this weekend when we were under flood warnings that the emergency signal part does not work at all. Unfortunately I can not locate the receipt for this item so I'm out of luck as they want twice as much money as it is worth to fix it since I can not prove it is less than one year old. Won't get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD after 2 years","review":"Nice unit when it worked. Just found out it died this week at some point. The only thing we hear now on all stations is a high pitch squeal. Originally we paid the 50 bucks on amazon for this thing. After looking on the net a bit more it seems Midland has a problem with their radios and die after 1 or 2 years with no notice. The only reason I know it died is because no warnings came in last night when hell came through. Thanks Midland!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic FAIL","review":"Bought this last summer. Within 2 months the unit stopped producing warnings. Our other radio, which is NOT a midland, continued to work and still works flawlessly. I have reset it to its factory default and it still will not produce an alarm. The weather station comes in clear, so not sure what the problem is. Threw it in the trash. Will not be replacing with another midland product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am ready to use it for target practice","review":"This unit is enough to make you completely INSANE. If there is a way to set this thing to go off for ONLY tornado warnings I have not found it. This thing goes off nonstop. I am in Kansas right now, about 3 miles from the Missouri river. Between the thunder storm warnings, the flood warnings, the canceled warnings, etc the stupid thing goes off every few minutes during a storm. I DON'T care about the small stream flood warnings, the thunder storm warnings, etc. especially at 3 am. It goes off so much that we often give up and unplug the stupid thing. Currently there is a massive storm outside and this stupid thing has gone off at least a dozen times in the last hour. We gave up and unplugged it. I was so annoyed by the dumb thing I had to get online to post a warning. Make sure when you pick a unit that you can set it to ONLY warn you when there is a tornado or some REALLY sever weather, especially in the middle of the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that \\"SAME\\"","review":"The radio has good reception even though I live in a hilly area, but what I really, really like is the \\"SAME\\" function so I can get some sleep when there are alerts in localized areas a hundred miles from my home. With my old weather radio I would be awakened dozens of times a night even though the storms were nowhere near causing a threat to my area. The only alternative was to turn the radio off and that might have been a hazardous thing to do. Well worth the price for peace of mind and a more restful nights sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"yippee","review":"This weather alert monitor is exactly what I was looking for.

He must have gotten a good one. Works at my home distance around 4 miles line of sight but with static. Display usually shows check reception. It is unusable at my folks place looking out the window directly at the tower at around 6 miles. Do not recommend this product. It will be a real pain to return these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Safety Item","review":"I've had a weather radio for years. The problem is that it would warn of storms that were no where near my location ... making it a little like the boy who cried wolf. The SAME technology in this unit rectifies that problem by allowing me to restrict alerts to only those counties that are close by. The identification of alert types and levels is another great feature. After having one for a few months, I bought one for each of my daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weather alert radio","review":"Works well. Allows you to select the alert areas you need. Loud so everyone can hear it. Gives peace of mind during storms."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING little thing","review":"First of all this radio is so counter-intuitive to use. You need directions to set it up and setup setup requires a lot of button-pressing. In this age a radio like this should be simple. And YES it beeps nonstop! Every time you press a button, it's BEEP BEEP BEEP! You try to set it up, and it wakes up anyone sleeping nearby. Eventually it just crapped out completely, and I was glad to put it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is our second Midland weather radio. The other one was great, but the antenna broke off. This one is a newer and even nicer one. Good product...makes us feel safer just having it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable and Poorly-Made","review":"I received this item as a gift in December 2009. By January 2011, it no longer received radio broadcasts. I know the problem is with the unit, since I was able to get several weather stations on another radio. It still tells me the time, albeit poorly since there is a few minute per month drift.Even when this item was working, it had some annoying design flaws. The volume step levels are way too coarse for regular use. Simply put, there was no level between mute and the lowest volume level setting that wasn't deafening. It also has an annoying button beep that is very unpleasant.Another feature that would be useful is to allow the user to set the types of alerts that set off the alarm. That way, I could only have it wake me up in the middle of the night if there's a tornado warning, not just whenever there is a thunderstorm.From other reviews, it's apparent that I'm not the only person who had a unit fail. Save your money and go with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Stop working after 3 months. Midland will fix it as long as I pay for shipping both ways. Therefore I purchased the First Alert one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is as bad as the weather!","review":"I hate this thing. It certainly alerts you of any severe weather, I'll give it that, but the sound it emits is a nightmare! I'd rather get up and listen to the weather on the TV than that thing! I usually hear thunder anyway and can get up, but sometimes I do sleep through it. With this thing it's impossible to sleep through anything.I live in an apartment and don't want to disturb my neighbors with this radio going off. We have severe weather from April-June here in West Texas and I do need a weather radio, but not one that would scare dead people out of their graves. I'll be buying another type instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA - Try another brand!","review":"No display or ability to program out of the box.

I called the company and they told me that to get it fixed I would have to pay $25. OK...or I could buy a brand new one and not bother with this company.

Programmed it (per instructions) for our county's SAME code. We've had numerous weather advisories and a few watches and warnings since. The radio has failed to respond to a single one of them. No alarm, no light--NOTHING. Emails to the company have been answered, but with rather useless information. Emails to the local NWS officer have produced attempts on his part to verify whether or not the SAME code alerts were, in fact, sent out properly.If it eventually works, I'll be glad. But at this point, it's about as useful as a door stop. Which is OK, since we don't have any fruitcakes to use for that purpose.UPDATE: It never worked, except for responding to one test alert (the monthly test). I eventually got rid of it. Useless.

I know that the problem is not due to our location as I have two other radios with weather band reception (without SAME) that work fine, and I have since purchased another weather alert radio by Oregon Scientific that picks up the station without any trouble.I assume the unit that I purchased was defective, as I cannot believe anyone would positively review a radio that worked this poorly.

I purchased a monitor from Radio Shack with a larger display that can pop up for better reading and I can choose the alerts I want to receive and it has been very good in sending only the alerts that I have chosen to receive. It also scans automatically for the best channel to receive braodcasts which the Midland WE-100B SAME Weather Radio does not. You have to choose your channel from a list according to your county.

Sometimes during the day, sometimes in the middle of the night! When it does this, the lighted dial does not go off, so you have a bright light shining in your eyes in the middle of the night.

These featherweights had little or nothing to do with punk or rebellion--that's why they became popular. A year before this collection was released, I wrote to Rhino urging them to include the following songs: Larry Wallis: Police Car, Chelsea: Right to Work, Alberto Y Los Trios Paranoias: Kill, Molls: White Stains, Users: Sick of You Iggy And The Stooges: Raw Power, Agent Orange: Bloodstains,Unnatural Axe: They Saved Hitler's Brain, La Peste: Better Off Dead, Clash: What's My Name?, Penetration: Nostalgia, Altered Images: Day's Wait, The Table: Do the Standing Still, X-X: You're Full of S**t, Sid Vicious: My Way, Pere Ubu: My Dark Ages, Diodes: Child Star.

I was really surprised to see how small and flimsy the product really was. I actually have an average sized cat, 8lbs. and it wobbles underneath her, there's not much support under the carpet scratching area, so I finally had to use a 3 lbs. weight to weigh down and stabilize the scratching post. Daisy still doesn't use it unless I put her on top of it, even then the scratching post is so small she can only fit half of her body on it. I've tried catnip, toys, etc. but she doesn't really like it.

When I complained that the tool would not work with the watchband, WatchMaterial made a prompt refund with no hassle. I would not hestitate to deal with them again. I would have given them 5 stars if the copy for the tool warned that there are a lot of watch bands that are not compatible with this tool.I would not trust Amazon's pairings.If you are considering this tool (or others), go to WatchMaterial dot com and look at their Education section on sizing watch bands.

The purpose of this being that if you've got a thicker band, you can press down on it to align it with the pin. The problem with this system is that it causes the band to be unstable, and if it slips on the surface of that spring board, the pin will bend and snap off.Also, the pins included with this tool, while longer than most, are the flimsiest item I've ever seen. I realize these pins are supposed to bend to protect your watch under too much pressure, but minimal pressure not only caused them to bend but snap completely! I went out and bought another link remover, frustrated with this one's flawed design, and it worked much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the job","review":"The instructions are thin, but the tool works.

I was able to remove the pins relatively easily. I guess there are more exact an easy to use products but this one worked fine. The hardest thing to do was to put the pins back.

However, I also tried a roller tip pen tip to compress the spring pin and found it was easier and faster to use.

After handling the item, I believe that there is a high probability that unless you have a watch bracelet that is of a VERY SPECIFIC type, something on the tool or bracelet will break or be damaged.

I don't think this would hold up under continual use, but works fine in my circumstance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small bands only","review":"Product is too small for large watches, more specifically larger watch bands. I tried three of my watches and none fit into the work area of this product. Probably useful for smaller bands, but I could not test this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another product.","review":"This tool works but the tip brakes easily when installing a pin/bar. It's hard to position and alight the band because of the spring plate. The shape of the band might also make installation/removal difficult. If the band on your watch has progressively smaller links, it won't be possible to place the band flush against the rest of the tool. If this is happens, the misalignment will cause the pin to break (100% guaranteed). I went through three pins (you get three spares, lucky me!). Also, because of multiple slips due to the tip breaking, the band received minor scratches on it's side. Being careful just doesn't cut it.This tool is NOT worth it's cost. If you're looking for a dependable and safe link remover stay away from this one and other models like it. You are better off going to a jeweler and having them adjust the band for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, works extremely well.","review":"Bought a product like this previously, but it was of all plastic construction. Push pins in the previous unit I had broke left and right. With this unit, I adjusted the bracelet on my new watch in less than 10 minutes without breaking a one the push pins, of which 4 extras are supplied with the unit. More importantly, I did not leave one mark or scratch on the bracelet. Product is definitely worth the small price tag and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine, watch the arrows on your band though","review":"You need to push the pins out in the same direction as the arrows on your watchband.

There were other \\"manual\\" tools that were not as pricey but probably are more durable than this Paylak product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good inexpensive and accurate watch pin extraction tool.","review":"Much better than the blue colored plastic pin pushers you see offered here. Construction is more rigid, and pin accuracy is significantly better. You end up with clean pin extractions and no scarring on the sides of the band links (depending upon the care that you take in using it) as a result. This is due in part to the tool having little to no adverse rotational play as the pin pusher is tightened toward the watchband: a very important aspect that improves the accuracy of the device. I would recommend this watchband tool to anyone with a watch fetish who likes to handle their own seizing processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is the one to buy! Look no further!","review":"Yes, it's three times the price of the other models, but you will go through three of those either because they are so cheaply made or out of frustration, so buy this model! Very solid construction, spring-loaded work plate (genius!), solid pins and just 10x better than the other $4 models. I lost mine so I thought I'd save a few bucks and buy the cheaper model. After two of them broke, I gave in and bought this one again. First time I used it, it was paid for and I wasn't swearing at it! Very simple to use, feels solid, works like a charm! This is the one to buy, folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expect","review":"I purchased the watch band pin remover at the recommendation of the internet. I was only going to buy the watch and then I decided maybe the band pin remover would make it easier for me to shorten the band. The pin remover does not work with the watch band on Seiko SGG709. I didn't return the band pin remover for two reasons: (1) I switched watch bands from one of my old non working watches to the Seiko SGG709 and it works just fine. I didn't have to shorten the band at all. (2) The band pin remover did work on another watch that I had, therefore, I decided to keep it.

Straightforward to operate and does the job fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised and saves you $$","review":"I bought this because I have purchased a few new watches and I'm tired of paying someone to remove links when this little device could do the same. So I bought it and it was delivered as promised and works as advertised. The only think I didn't like was having to go to the website to download the directions but that's not a big deal at all.So, I'm happy to give this 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, just needs to be easier to find instructions","review":"I used this tool to re-size a Citizen Eco-Drive watch. Within 15 minutes of receiving the product, my watch was ready to use, thanks to this tool. My only complaint is that the instructions (which are not provided with the product, but need to be looked up on-line) were a bit difficult to find on the company's web-site. Having read other reviewer's comments, I wanted to make sure I was using the tool properly, so I was determined to read the instructions first. If you do buy this product and need the instructions, go to the web-site you are directed to on the package, and select 'How to size a watch band', then scroll down to where the proper instructions are. Once you read through these, adjusting your watch should be a very simple task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well.","review":"Works as intended changed two links out of my watch very easy and fast.Pros:Since it is plastic where the band lays it leaves no marks and does no damage to the band as some metal tools could do if the person is heavy handed, it also comes with four pins (.85mm)-three extra and one already in tool. Better throat design- the useful bandwidth is 7/8\\" whereas cheaper tools have a useful bandwidth of 1/2\\".Cons :The pin is not the screw in type, but has a flat side notched into it where the set screw goes, the pins are small as is the setscrew so you will need a 1/8\\" flathead screwdriver to remove set screw, which should have been included for this price.I thought the purpose of this review was to actually \\"rate\\" the tool-pros/cons, not to talk about alternative means of removing the pins. Besides if you lack the mechanical ability to use this simple tool it is likely you need to be seeing a qualified jeweler before attempting to use alternative means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Gadget For The Money","review":"This gadget worked flawlessly right out of the box. All you do is line up the pin pusher with the pin you want to remove and turn the handle, remember to push the pin out in the direction of the arrows on the watchband. I removed 3 links in 5 minutes. The key is to line it up correctly, if you turn the handle and meet some resistance then ir's not lined up right. Back it out and start over.Using this Watch Band Pin remover is easier than taking candy from a baby. Great little product that just paid for itself with 1 watch band.Thanks Amazon for the usual prompt delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and quick.","review":"Once you follow a simple instruction to align your bracelet in this contraption, removing a pin is a very easy and safe operation.

And you can adjust your bracelet as often as you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool for most watches","review":"Once I got the hang of it it worked like a charm. I needed to mount a magnifying glass to the table so I could see for perfect alignment. If not perfectly aligned you break pins.

I would buy another unit but seller went to the bank on shipping charges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and easy to use.","review":"I was kind of worrying about this unit because of reading some of the negative comments from the reviews. However, once I received it, followed its instruction to read the online manuals, then went on resized three of my Citizen watches, without any problems. The key is really to read the manual carefully, and to have a big magnifying glass ready for checking the alignment of the tool needle to the pin in the tiny hole of the watch bracelet. Do not apply brute force. Considering the price and the performance, I give this pin remover a perfect score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This thing comes without instructions.I found something on their website with convoluted instructions, which would take more time to follow than simply going to a jeweler.

Too much aggrevation and a flimsy piece of equipment at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked like a charm!","review":"I purchased this tool so I could resize my wife's watch without having to take it to the store and pay some hefty fee and wait and wait to get it back. I just used it last night and was able to remove the links and get it sized perfectly in under 5 minutes. It's a great tool for the price and I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty Little Tool","review":"I purchased this with my recent Citizens titanium watch. I went to Citizen's website before I began and they had a PDF on the instructions for removing the links which was helpful as it had a two-piece pin. The spring loaded floor plate made alignment easy and the tool was very helpful. The reviewer who said that his 22mm band would not fit in the tool does not know what he was talking about as my band is exactly 22mm and it had room to spare. Evidently, he did not back the screw back as far as needed. I thought it was worth the money and obviously, it can be used in the future on other watches as well, and save ajustment costs in store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again","review":"I thought I could save some time by not having to take my watches in to have them fitted by buying this. This is not the tool you need to resize your watchband. The product itself is somewhat cheaply made. I ended up throwing it away after I was done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pin ext2","review":"I'm sure that this would do an excellent job for most bands. Well crafted and rugged. However, it will not work with the watch I have. Not enough clearance for the thickness of the band on my watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional Tool","review":"This tool does just what it is intended for - it removes pins from watch bands.The plastic base is set up with a space where the band fits in between the driving pin and the push block which is notched to allow the band pin to be pushed out of the link.The tool is very simple to use with the only requirement being that everything be lined up. These pins are small diameter and if not correctly aligned they will bend and they will break. Use reading glasses if necessary to avoid operator error.If you need to size watch band(s)and are even semi mechanically inclined, then get one and save the trip to the jeweler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made, doesn't work for a narrow band.","review":"I tried to use it to remove two pins. It was very difficult to keep the needle(pin) straight while using force to push the watch pin. The four pins came with the tool ended up broken before I tried to remove the second watch pin. Now the tool becomes useless without pins. I went to the website: watchmaterial.com to read the instruction before I used the tool. I am a handy man for small repair around the house. I think the tool is just not suitable for its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"Doesn't open wide enough to accommodate my 22mm band.Whoever designed this product certainly wasn't thinking.The shame of it is it almost fits but \\"close but no cigar.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"After using one of the cheap blue ones and breaking it after about five band repairs I purchased this one. I like it a lot better, the tool screws in a lot slower but I think it helps line the pin up better. Also The spring loaded floor of the tool helps line the pin up with more accuracy also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use! works great!","review":"Fixing the size of ur band at home is the way to go! Buying this costs the same as having it done at the shop. All you do is put the watch band on the leverable platform (push down to level the pin with the watch band pin hole). Then rotate the dial so that the pin goes into the pinhole and knock out the pin in the watch band. Easy! Comes with extra pins just in case u break them. Just have good eye sight on the hole and pin and u wont need them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the job","review":"Bought this to shorten the bracelet on a Seiko SNE039 mens solar watch. It did not come with any instructions, but instead a web address for info. This pin remover did the job well & comes supplied with extra pins."},{"rating":"2","title":"It did what I expected it to do","review":"I bought a new watch at a significant discount at Costco and it was way too big. So, instead of taking it to the jeweler and paying whatever it would have cost to remove a few links, I purchased this tool. I was able to remove three links with relative ease, reassemble the band, and I now have a watch that fits and a tool I can use on subsequent watch purchases. So, my hopes and expectations were clearly met."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with any of my men's watches","review":"Bands do not fit into the slot provided.

Will recommend this product highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I opened the package to find that the plastic collar that holds the pin holder assembly in place was cracked, straight from the factory. As most of the stresses involved should be in line with the pin, however, I figured I'd attempt to use it anyway. Unfortunately, I soon found out that the pin doesn't retract far enough to allow for a standard-width men's watch band, making the entire unit unusable for its purpose. The only good thing about the item was that it came with extra pins, one of which I was able to use (simply by aligning it with the watch pin and pressing against a hard surface) to actually adjust my watch band. By far, this is the worst product I've ever received from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the blue version","review":"Before buying this link remover, I had been using the ubiquitous blue version that comes with the cheap watch repair kits. The blue one was obviously pretty cheap and occasionally difficult to use, but got the job done. After the actual metal pusher part broke on that one, I decided to pay a little more for better quality. This grey Paylak tool is superior in every way - easier to use, easier to align the bracelet with the pusher, comes with extra pushers, and just feels better-made overall. Plus it doesn't stain my hands with blue dye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and a bit quirky","review":"Found this wristband pin extractor/installer to function with a few quirks It seems to jam when used to pull pins and the installation of pins is a bit tricky, but functions. The spring loaded height adjustment was useless and only made the job more intricate and complicated. Construction is adequite and it comes with extra pin die extraction bits. Too bad it doesn't include other sizes or a hold-down machanism for the wristband during use. Over priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"DR. KATZ HEAVEN! This box is the DEFINITIVE release!","review":"This 13(!!) disc \\"raised\\" coverart box set contains a booklet, all 48 (44?) original episodes, plus lost episodes, shorts AND a Comedy Central special featuring a REAL LIFE Dr. Katz skit! Damn, is Laura HOT! ;) It was surreal to see the characters in real life doing what they do best. Totally amazing! I'll treasure this box till the day I die! AND don't forget, at this time you can only individually purchase seasons 1+2 on DVD! This box is the ONLY way to get everything ever made in this series on DVD! One of the best, if not THE best, program Comedy Central ever aired! ONLY drawback is lack of audio commentary track for most episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the product, will buy it but...","review":"Feels like a ripoff...they release seasons 1 and 2, then suddenly decide to just stop releasing seasons and give us the whole package at once? Guess I'll be buying seasons 1 and 2 yet again, as part of this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair!!","review":"Ok, I LOVE this show. I already bought the first two seasons, and I really want to own the whole collection. However, I'm not so keen on paying for the first two seasons yet again. I really want all these episodes, but have you checked out the price? Whoever made the decision to release this set before releasing the remaining episodes separately is obviously a con-artist of some kind, and people just don't appreciate being taken. Shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine","review":"Releasing a complete collection after all the seasons are out is expected (a la Seinfeld), however, releasing the first 2 seasons, then giving up and releasing a complete box set is just a slap in the face to the fans of this great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome...But Fragile!","review":"I am a huge fan of Dr Katz, but I differ from most in the fact that I did not purchase the first two seasons beforehand, so technically I have nothing to bemoan. If you are a fan of this show, this collection is worth it. It is a little light on the extras, but the main show is there and that is enough for me. If I have a complaint about this, it would be that the (very cool) packaging is very difficult to replace if broken. I know this should be a given, but be very gentle with this. My box set slid off of something about 3 ft high and landed on carpet (carpet!) and split the discs right at the 6 and 7. That was the only casualty though, so I am grateful. But I have yet to find a suitable replacement case. Oh Well.The book that accompanies this collection is a good read also. Dr Katz is just too funny for me and it was so cool to see the cast reunite on Home Movies, albeit for a few episodes.Get this while it is on sale! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and hilarious","review":"Dr. Katz is a one-of-a-kind series. It has moments of an almost overboard hilarity, while at the same time introducing it's own unique style of clever wit from beginning to end.

It also arrived quickly. Dr Katz was a fantastic series and the only way to watch now is DVD.

The only drawback I had was I should have paid the extra money for the quicker delivery! We are definately enjoying this product, and will for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best compromise","review":"Probably not the best Portable CD player on the market, but this cd player brings an extreme certain amount of quality for such a low price. Sony is famous for their top entertainment satisfaction and this player is a good example of it. With skip protection, bass booster, and crisp audio playback, this player is considered a bargain among other imitations. But if you're willing to spend a lil more dough on better products, I suggest you look elsewhere, otherwise, this little player is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works well","review":"its the best affordable cd player i ever had. i like the gold and silver color on it. it plays music good and i hope this lasts for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a lucky find!","review":"This CD of ozarks outakes from 1972 is a must for fans, although some of the undeveloped demos do not do some of the material justice.For those of you with the original lp release, this is quite a different set, and although it omits one or two gems, there is much to enjoy.I was particularly struck by 'Rainbird' and the extended version of 'Sherrifs coming' and there is a great early demo of 'Leatherwood'. The highlight for me is the majestic 'Someday Darlin' re-produced by Larry Lee with John Dillon putting in a soulful vocal performance.Although these early efforts lack the sophistication of the polished debut release, it's a joy to listen to, revealing lots of good ideas, eclectic material and some great rock/country bluegrass.The history of the band is also fasinating and I learned that both Paul McCartney and Neil Young are fans - quite an endorsment for one of the great underated bands.That's one cabin I would have loved to stay in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how it all began","review":"The 18 songs on the album shed a new light on one of the best coutry rock bands. Not all recordings are of high audio quality. All songs are a worthfull addition to the first official albums of the band in the seventies.Be prepared to find different early versions of songs from these albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent price * could be more stable","review":"This bracket does the job, but its design leaves a little to be desired. It has nothing to keep the bracket from rocking from side to side unless it is cinched abnormally tightly to the wall. It's basically a rectangular prism with a hole through it; I think a flange or some other type of widening on the side that touches the wall would make the bracket more stable. It would be nice to have a suggestion for hardware in the documentation because the mounting hole is rather large. I like the ability make it wider by switching the orientation; it is a handy feature. Also, the picture on Amazon has three different brackets, so it was confusing when I was ordering. The one I am reviewing is the lower left bracket in the current picture (Sept. 2008)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk! Constant static on all channels!","review":"I bought this radio thinking it was a small, compact, lightweight, digital radio receiver with a phase locked loop tuner. Well, that it is. What the \\"editorial review\\" doesn't tell you is that it also has constant static on all channels, no matter how strong the radio signal is. I live in Chicago, and even the strongest radio signal in the country (WLS!) has a strong static in the background. If you like Rock & Roll + static, or news + static, or Country & Western + static, buy this radio because it's definitely for you. I, however, am returning mine. Even my 1980s era analog walkman gets better reception than this piece of junk. Yes, I tried calling Sony tech support, and they were absolutely no help whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my little radio!","review":"I really like this little radio. I use this unit primarily in the house, while I am doing dishes, scrubbing floors, going up and down the stairs. I find the lock function helpful, since I am moving around a lot it gets bumped ~ but stays right on the station. I have great reception with this little puppy, which is great, since I live in a rural area in the woods. I did replace my headset with a smaller set, as I do not like the bulky one it came with. On occasion, I have to move the headset cord (its antennae)to eliminate static~but this is minor. My battery life has been good~just do not let the teen use it! Mine was a gift and I love it. Now I can listen to NPR without my family complaining of its boredom point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reception","review":"I'm used to Sony having good quality, but this was an exception.

But, when I received it and my husband put it together, I knew it was well worth the money. The furniture is absolutely beautiful. The drawers hold everything. The crib is very heavy, sturdy and doesn't shake. I have the James the Giraffe mobile and it fits just fine in the slats. I am very happy with this furniture and am sure to use it again if we have another child.

However, there were quite a few that just didn't do anything for me, but that's just me. There's also a short section in the end of fantasies for men, so it's nice for my man.
