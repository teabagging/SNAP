The disc package should have started with Disc one at the top and Disc 6 at the bottom. I have constanly been having to expand the whole accordian just to get to the first disc. That's it.

It traces the involvement of Easy Company during the entire course of WWII - bootcamp, staging in England, D-Day, their campaigns they fought in.In doing so, there is not one single weak performance given by the sterling cast of 1st Line, 2nd Line and character actors. Gritty, unflinching, and dogged in its portrayal of the WWII experience by American GI's, this series loses the sugarcoating found in many war movies. There's no romanticism here.If you want to understand why so many WWII veterans hate war in any form but the absolute most necessary form, watch these images and try to feel what these simple, ordinary American men felt.At the end, you may have a slightly different take on Veteran's Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band of Brothers Review","review":"This is the best war movie I have ever seen. I was stationed in the Pacific Theatre during World War II, so I was not an eye witness to events in Europe. My knowledge of the war in Europe was learned from several books on the subject.

We owe thier generation our thanks, and so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"World War II buff","review":"Band of Brothers is a perfect gift for an WW II buff. The heroism and the horror of war are no better displayed than in the story of Easy Company, 506 PIR, 101st Airborne.

It should be required viewing for anyone who lives in this country. It shows what sacrifice truly is. What the soldiers went through for our freedom is sobering.

The flow of each episode is excellent and keeps you well entertained.The video and audio quality is excellent for the Blu-ray version.

I think any effort to try and teach people the sacrifices of war and the realities should be reason enough to buy. I'm more into the Vietnam War and bought this because I loved the way Saving Private Ryan was done and I am thrilled with this purchase. Trying to follow WWII and the history and all the battles is hard and complex and this mini-series makes it alot easier. You follow Easy Company through there whole journey of War and you even get the emotions and effects of War not just shoot um up and kill em stuff.

As soon as I am finished with this review, I am ordering the set. This is definitely a keeper! I enjoyed this mini-series more than any other, possibly more than \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". The series follows the book better than any two hour movie could possibly hope to, and the book was excellent. The attention to detail is oustanding. The actors are mostly unknowns,(with the exception of David Schwimmer, (Ross from \\"Friends\\"),who does a great job as the infamous hardass Capt.

If the US did not save Europe who did? Was it the Russians, the French, the German&#146;s? I forgot the German&#146;s where conquering Europe. Ireland, who did HELP save Europe? Any way, I am thankful and grateful for all who fought to free Europe and the rest of the countries in this world. I am a naturalized citizen and retired member of the Arm Forces of the USA, who with out their sacrifices I would have not been able to come to this great, wounderful, and giving nation I call my home. It also shows the stupidity of the leadership of all nations, but most of all it shows the prize that Americans paid for the freedom we have today. God bless all those who fight for freedom.

I figure, if the Easy Company members don't object to any \\"mistakes\\" that are made, why the heck should I? However, if you're the kind of person who can't enjoy a show for what it is, preferring to pick everything apart in search of flaws, you'll probably find lots wrong with this one, too.

It is simply the best movie ever made (it's not a mini-series! Nothing \\"mini\\" about it!)and I don't even really get into war/history stuff. The cinematography, the acting, the plots of each episode, and what I see as very realistic illustration of battle and war, is just second to none. One of the more birlliant, yet subtle aproaches to the writing was how each episode comes from a different angle of the Company. It focuses on different elements that come into play throughout life as a soldier. Very crafty, but not overdone. Sometimes simplicity shines brighter than complexity. No one can do this movie justice by describing it, it is just so well done I don't know what else to say. Thanks to everyone involved in this. What a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best thing to come out of Television, ever.","review":"Everything that it's predecessors do wrong, Band of Brothers does right."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate best war movie/series in the world","review":"I have read all of Ambrose's WWII books, and this mini-series faithfully follows one of the best. The experience of these men of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airbone, was mirrored throughout the many divisions of Army and Marine ground troops in WWII. I feel that this series represents that collective experience in the finest, most forthright manner possible and pays tribute to all of them. The acting, mostly by previously unheralded actors, was superb--particularly that of Damien Lewis (Capt. Winters). Winters had to mature along with his increasing command responsibilities to others as he was promoted to battalion commander."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Own Blu Ray","review":"Looks utterly Fantasic on Blu Ray.... A Must Own.True to the book and true to the men who lived and died to defeat true evil.Talk about \\"Heroes\\" - the most overused, misused term in our language... These guys were the real deal.Spielberg and Hanks put together an absolutely top quality series that is worth watching more than once. INMHO, better than Private Ryan or for that matter - any war movie, period. There are some difficult and gruesome things to watch - be warned. But in context - it is appropriate to tell the true story.After seeing it - I had to get the book.

So when it arrive on Blu-ray, it was a must-buy. High definition greatly benefits the beautiful cinematography. The gritty, grainy look of the series comes across more clearly than on the DVD version.The new Blu-ray exclusive features are well worth the price. The picture-in-picture commentaries--which draw from interviews with the actual Easy Company soldiers that never made it into the previously seen documentary or episode intros--provide insight into the scenes over which they appear. And the interactive timeline feature further enhances the viewing will all kinds of extra information.In fact, my wife and I are enjoying our evenings spent watching an episode, then going back and watching it with the commentaries, then going back and running through the interactive timeline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your own WWII perspective","review":"This series RULES.

I saw one episode on TV and on the recomendation of a friend (ok, of a passel of friends) bought the series for my husband, who was agitating for it. We both like it a great deal. It's something you can watch slowly, with some consideration, and enjoy (in a somber kind of way). It's about the original Airborn units... The interviews with the vetrans make it something very special. This is the last generation that these vetrans will be alive to tell their story, and we should listen and learn from them; they are us, and this war is something different from any war before or since. It's not for no reason it was called a world war. Trnasportation and communication were finaly good enough to involve the entire planet in a conflict, but the tactics and planning were still evolving to catch up with this fact. A lot of firsts, in that war."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of the 506th PIR. The best we had , Americans who fight","review":"This series by HBO, goes right to the heart of the matter.

In the process they learn what every American fighting man learns...the metamorphosis from a group of individuals into a family unit that will die to protect each other is a magical one, caused by the knowledge and expertise of the NCOs who lead them.

The Band of Brothers has special meaning for my husband since my father in law passed away and I was pleased to be able to receive it in time for father;s day. Band of Brothers is a very good movie especially when you know someone who has served in the war.

Not tied to a particular 'scenario'of sorts, the way the scripting and cast meld together so well one actually feels their presence as if you were almost in the trenches with them. When I initially watched the series as it first aired, I found myself glued not only to the action scenarios but to the personal lives of each individual in Easy Company. I personally believe this is one of the best-to-date war time mini-series ever produced. I truly look forward to its future DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This movie was very close to the book. It was very well made.

The film is more about history being written by the victorious, in plain disregard of true historic facts, instead of an objective review. It's another happy ending americana. Proper viewer caution is advised."},{"rating":"2","title":"band of brothers","review":"This is simply the most amazing and emotional World War 2 movie or miniseries ever made. I thought Saving Private Ryan was brilliant in depicting the horrific events that the men encountered during the war.I thought that it would take an extrodinary film to replace Saving Private Ryan as my favorite film of all time. Band of Brothers has managed to accomplished that feat. I had bought the DVD'S about two months ago but I never had an opportunity to watch the film until yesterday. I was completely mesmerized and moved by this great film. Easy Company deserved all the praised and accolades it received. The battle scenes, cinematography, and storyline help make this film an incredible achievement. I found myself weeping during most of the episodes. Although the DVD'S are a tad expensive, I recommend that you purchase this film. I will treasure this masterpeace forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this series","review":"How could anyone watch even just one of these films and NOT develop a deep appreciation for and respect for the brave men who fought in evil times?!

He was there, in the real battle and we mere mortals can only imagine the Hell they went through during WWII. My dad and uncle were there. They had some very amusing stories about the great group of GI's they fought with, but some very grim details about the actual war. So, I want to thank Bob Lefleur and all the vet's that were there. Without them, things might be much different, in this world today. As for the Band of Brother's set? It is THE most realistic series about WWII ever produced. If you want to see how it really was, get this set, as it is awesome to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Umbrella Murderer","review":"Nan Skillen is foremost a journalist who takes her job on the crime beat very seriously.

The murderer could be anyone of number of suspects. Nan Skillen is determined to get the story and find the murderer.Her boyfriend and editor, Tom, is interested in getting the story but more interested in keeping Nan safe.The author, Marcy Heidish, takes us into the world of the homeless shelters' sub-culture.Gruesome at times and very dark, it is a page turner that has to be solved.

I say \\"almost\\" because the only fault I can find is the rather pedestrian wind machine, which sounds more like a vacuum cleaner than a storm during the descent. Otherwise this is one terrific interpretation and performance. Haitink's approach is grand but totally free of idiosyncrasy or bombast that dooms lesser performances. The early digital recording captures the Concertgebouw Orchestra in superb form. All of the major sections deserve praise, with special kudos for the principle oboist.

I have found that Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky seem to be the best. For the stories included in this book, they have either \\"The Double and The Gambler\\" or \\"The Eternal Husband and Other Stories\\".One particularly annoying point is that this version does not have footnote translations for the French phrases in the Gambler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, short works by Dostoyevsky","review":"This collection of a novella (\\"The Gambler\\") and two short stories (\\"Bobok\\" and \\"A Nasty Story\\") by Dostoyevsky makes for a nice introduction to the Russian master's work. The Gambler is a well paced story that brilliantly depicts greed's devastating effect on the undisciplined. Common Dostoyevsky themes of loss and surrealism are presented here in a nice, shorter package than most of his more well known classics. I was also impressed with how well most of the characters were presented for such a short novel. Grand Mama was an especially memorable character with her manic and compulsive personality. She alone makes this story worth checking out.My five star rating is for \\"The Gambler.\\" The two additional short stories are nice to have but add little to the overall value.

I was totally disappointed. The [adult scenes] was done with no feeling whatsoever, it was told very clinically, with no description. What about the tastes, feels, smells, sounds? There is more to [adult scenes] than he put this there and she submitted. Blah!The entire first half of the book is boring history/war type stuff. The maid that is described as her having a thing with is mentioned in one sentence and then never again and not once does she have a \\"thing\\" with her! Perhaps it is a good account of harem life. But that is all it is. An account. It is not descriptive, enticing, or even entertaining. It is written like something from a textbook. Yawn!

Someone else mentioned the several chapters that found the story - good to have, but in this case not written in a manner to catch and keep your interest. When I first read the reviews, I heard it was authentic in its discussion of harem life - after reading it, I imagine that may be factually true, but the spirit was certainly lacking.For something that pretends to be authentic, there were at least three scenes off the top of my head (such as the Egyptian man being raped for impudence in staring at Jenny's lush hind-quarters) that wrote any authenticity to the wind.Frankly, I bought it for story because the reviews promised one, gave up on the story to evaluate it on \\"good\\" sex scenes since the story was flat, and finally put the book down disappointed on all accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Boring","review":"i had such high hopes for this book. my disappointment set in after reading the first 2 pages. this is supposed to be erotica? there's more pages/chapters devoted to describing boring, dry historical/war scenes than anything else. i found myself flipping through all the historical backdrops and just reading the \\"supposed\\" erotic scenes. and jenny got on my last nerve...were we supposed to feel sorry for her? and personally, i dont think there's anything erotic about female circumcision and bloody whippings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insatiable erotic/historical novel","review":"I can't resist erotic and historical elements rolled into one novel.

Lady Jenny Langham hadn't anticipated the sort of fate that befalls her upon arrival to the city of Khartoum on the Nile. When she becomes the captive of Mahdi, her life goes from royalty to one of the most disarming forms of erotic slavery ever written. Pleasure and submission are two of the things that Lady Jenny has accepted with relish. Will she ever return to her old life? And, more to the point, will she want to?This novel reminds me of Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty series.

The protagonist is an afterthought, and the plot is erotic only if you get off on female circumcision and rape. There's an annotated bibliography of white slavery for an appendix, so maybe the author is really more interested in the literature than in getting the reader excited.

That's how much I liked it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and Open Ended","review":"If you're looking for another Midnight in Paris, don't look here. Although billed as a comedy I would say this is more of a drama somewhat akin to the very serious movies Allan produced in the 1980s. It features a elderly housewife whose husband leaves her for a younger woman (a prostitute in fact) unable to cope with her divorce and her dysfunctional family. Allan does not bother to try to tie up loose ends as the film concludes leaving you scratching your head and asking what the point really was. To go into too much detail would provide too many spoilers, and even a stellar cast can't rescue this melancholy offering. If you like Allan's more dramatic and sad titles, you would probably like this--I was looking for a light movie to watch with my friends on New Years Eve and this doesn't suit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just One of Thousands","review":"As just one of thousands who met Mr.Buckley (five times) and got to talk with him it is a pleasure to have the DVD memorial to him.

D.A. Dickens is tour de force, combining realistic and contemporary characters with an unimaginable scenario. Condoleezza Rice becomes President in this novel, and she is soon faced with a horror that no former Commander-In-Chief could have ever imagined. An alien spacecraft is unearthed, and soon world sovereignty is at stake. Dickens presents a scenario where the efficacy and resourcefulness of the world is put to the ultimate test, and I simply could not put this book down. Much better than Independence Day, by far. Bravo, D.A. Dickens! Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem solver!","review":"Boy, does Schier know what he's talking about.

Smith and Wesson would not stand behind their product at all, which is the reason I will never buy another product from them.

After 2 weeks of use, the plastic dial that changes the time broke off, but that did not bug him. he still enjoyed it and would switch time (daylight saving) with my tweezers. after a week he showered with it, and it announces that is water resistant, but the next day there was moisture and sweat inside the watch and it did not work. 2 days after it started working. But today, he was wearing the watch and the needle that reads the seconds broke off and its stuck on the glass, still due to the water damage.

At first glance this watch appears to be very well made. The sad truth is that if you're living in a warm weather state, after a rainy day, the humidity will cause water to buildup inside and behind the crystal. That being said, the watch can't possibly be water resistant up to 99 feet. I have no doubt that if I jump into a pool of 5 feet, this watch will be filled up with water. Now, if the watch runs by H20, that's a different story. Smith & Wesson should stick to making boots.

The minute and hour hands have glow in the dark patches on them but they don't glow very brightly for very long. I don't know if this is also standard issue, but next to each hour it has the army time equivalent for am(?) I thought that was pretty neat. lastly it has a part that keeps track of the day next to the 3 (the white box in the picture), I had a hard time setting this at first as I couldn't get the nob that changes time & date in the right position(about half pulled out from the watch) to move it right away, so when you set the watch, set the day first then the time so you keep its accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"It is good method and experiance to buy from youAnd i will buy alot of things from in the futuer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible watch","review":"This watch was so terrible, i threw it away within two weeks...

The only problem is he's with Drea, her roommate and best friend. The second problem.....Stacey is having nightmares again. These nightmares are too real to ignore and the last time she ignored them a little girl died. Now Stacey is having dreams about Drea. Stacey knows what that means. The psycho killer is out again and this time his prey is Drea. Stacey uses her magic to try to find the killer and warn Drea.

I have to confess, at times I did put it down, but just because I was too scared and my reading lamp wasn't enough, I HAD to get up from bed and turn on the lights.

Especially when considering that everyone's a suspect, including those you least expect...There are so many things I loved about this book, the main one being the Wiccan elements strewn throughout the book.

Most of which, despite their loud/rough/Queen B exteriors (I'm talking about you, Drea!), will surprise you...in a smile from ear to ear sort of way.Blue is for Nightmares is a great start to a really great and original series.

In a complex tale set in a seedy London hotel, Durrell spun a narrative which was to foreshadow his best-known work of two decades later, the Alexandria Quartet in its dealings with time, characterisation, and narrative. Memorable characters and rich prose swirl around the central figure of Lawrence Lucifer. Considered unpublishable in 1937, it did not find its way into print in Britain until 1961.

The book starts with a fabulous essay by Peter Russell laying out a general theory of judicial independence. The rest of the chapters deal with the concept of judicial independence in various contexts ranging from the US, Germany and Japan to post-communist systems and Hong Kong. The most interesting chapter was the Japanese system where judicial independence is constrained by the internal structure of the judiciary.

I do, however, have a BIG problem with the curry recipes. As any good Indian cook knows, it is essential to fry the spices before adding the liquid. You can't, as this book says, add the liquid and the spices to the oil at the same time and expect the spices and oil to \\"separate\\" from the liquid. The spices are more likely to blend with the liquid, not the oil, and not fry at all. This makes for an unpleasant curry.

The first night when I laid down on it the mattress blew out a hole in it and all the air escaped. I weigh less than 200lbs so it should not be a weight issue. I also noticed before that like many of the other reviews this is not really a 'Self Inflating Mat' since you have to finish filling it up with air by blowing in it.

It was not really \\"Self Inflating,\\" since you must blow some air into it to inflate. Still, that would be OK with me if the product worked.My 95-pound daughter used this just four times, all indoors. The bottom seam separated on the fourth night. I do not mean that any pinhole leaks developed - rather, the bottom seam/junction just separated. And, you can see that for inches on either side of the hole that the seam is beginning to loosen there as well.Emails to customer service went unanswered for either warranty support or even repair instructions.

The ending at the climatic point which is before the ending we know of the real story is a rather Japanese thing to do, perhaps, and I have read enough Japanese pieces not to mind this style. Within those bounds, this is a detailed and engaging portrait of the erratic, fantastic course of one fairly wild woman's life within an extreme political climate and a time of huge social change. The heroine is anything but perfect, but her story captured me, and in fact greatly changed the direction of a panel I am presenting on Japanese women authors. Enough to make me seek out other works by Setouchi without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potentially interesting story poorly told","review":"Setouchi recreates a moment in Japan's Taisho period when radical C20 ideas were being first explored - feminism, socialism, anarchism, free love and all the ususal suspects. Taking the feminist magazine \\"Seito\\" as her canvas, Setouchi sketches the incidents, affairs and ideas of its leading members, particularly country girl/coquette Ito Noe. Bizarrely, however, Setouchi writes an introductory chapter which summarises the events of the period she is going to cover, depriving her subsequent story of any suspense or tension. Even more strangely, her story stops before the most interesting incidents she has telegraphed start. Overall, one for dedicated Japanophiles or social historians only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply impossible to translate","review":"The appeal of Harumi Setouchi is her beautiful prose.

TV programs and TV memories are generational, so it doesn't make sense to mix images from the 50s-90s together.Second, the photographs have little impact. The book itself is rather small, and some pages contain clusters of small photos that compete for your attention.Third, there is little interesting commentary.

SPOILERS: The plot is quite confusing, but the worst thing, in my opinion, is how we are set up for a final confrontation between the villain and our hero, BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS. The male protagonist, Train von Rensel seems to be a worthy opponent for the almost super-powered rogue ex-Navy seal. The only reason I kept reading was to witness the clash of these two, only to be let down when the bad guy disappears. Did the other operatives get him? Is he dead? In prison? On the loose? No idea. Almost like the author was planning subsequent novels featuring the same players and left us hanging on purpose (like the ending of the first Star Wars where Vader escapes). Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good procedural with enough action to keep your blood pumping","review":"This is an intelligent procedural touching on how the admirals in the Pentagon go about their attempt to rewrite or conceal an embarrassing bit of Naval history. The principals are attractive and interesting, and there are enough red herrings to make the end not all that predictable. This is a big book offering a lot of conversation and a lot of action, so fans of either should find enough to entertain them for a day or so. One of the principals is a captain who's been selected for promotion to rear admiral, and this prompted my checking the Navy register, where I found that there are about 350 admirals of various levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Be all you can be\\", oops, darn, wrong military branch","review":"Perhaps to someone better versed in navy language referring to a character as \\"the Admiral\\", when there are at least six Admirals in a story, would not be confusing. However, I could not tell who was who, much less why they were behaving in the way they were. What can I say except that the motives were muddy, the plot was moldy, the characters were transparent or opaque, the writing simplistic and the book overall just....boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Kindle conversion I've seen","review":"The transfer of this novel from print to electronic form was done with complete incompetence. It appears to have been performed by a CPU challenged OCR program that confused things like the letter \\"m\\" for \\"ii\\". The Kindle version contains misspellings and concatenated words on virtually every page. I was constantly being pulled out of the story by jarring copy errors that obviously had never never passed a copy editor's desk after at the OCR program spit out this dreck.If Deutermann's publishers can't spend the time to produce a readable eBook version of his fiction, I don't see any reason to buyany more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, interesting read","review":"PT Deutermann did it again. Great characters and development. I really enjoyed his positive portrayal of the Dobermans in the book. Nice job! He got the dog's character down well. Protective, but never vicious. I'd have to recommend this book for any Doberman fan as well as people who enjoy a good action thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I finished the book","review":"This book was horrible. The author's idea wasn't actually a bad idea. However he turned what could have been a good plot into boring crap. The ending was horrible and offered no plot resolution. The bad guy was very shallow. The main characters were boring as well. All the characters did was sit around and have meetings about the murders. It was a cheap read.

The actors and roles in the cast are all distinctively different and they all combine so well for really funny situations. Add to that the great English used (wow.. no \\"like\\"!!) and all you can do during this show is smile, laugh and laugh some more... The humor is from situations, fantastic reactions to sarcasm, which is sometimes really sophisticated and veiled, plus the \\"clash\\" between the social classes, which itself is quite harmless at the end of the day.Bottom line: timeless quality sophisticated humor...

Well done!","review":"I discovered this show on PBS one night and enjoyed it so much, I set my VCR to catch every episode that aired. Now that it is on DVD, I finally bought it. This is a cleverly done show. Innuendo and sly remarks abound to draw the viewer in and laugh out loud. British television doesn't have to be profane or specific to be funny and this is a true example of how they do it.The actors all work well together and one can see the chemistry abound. It is no wonder this show aired on BBC for so long and why it continues to captivate viewers here across the pond, years after its end.This complete collection contains 14 discs that contain all 69 episodes of the series and DVD extras. For those wondering, it does not include the movie or the Christmas special, as the other one for sale on Amazon does, which probably explains the price difference and difference of features between the two. The quality of the DVD's is well done and nothing to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"funniest of funnies!!!","review":"How wonderful it is to have AYBS economy packaged and so affordably priced!

I am so glad it has been made available for such an affordable price. The picture & sound is clear. The collection is about the employees at Grace Brothers Department Store. The employees range in ages. The episodes sometime focus on the employees as well as the owner. Ms Slocombe who is single and is not aging gracefully. Mr Humphries who is gay, however, he never really admitts to it. Mr Granger who is so funny. Mr Lucas who gets around with the ladies. Then there is Captain Peacock who is a bit snooty but who gets about with the ladies & is married as well and so does young Mr Grace.

On December 31st (!) they sent me a link to a return label that had expired (!) and they would not issue a new one. They only threatned me to charge my cc if I did not return the dvd without giving a clear deadline date just saying in 10 days. I am not sure when the count starts, why they sent their request so late and right before the holidays and why they did not send e return label with a replacement set.

I'll tell you: a vampire drinks someone's blood and they turn into a vampire too. Eric Savoisin starts out with an intriguing idea--his vampire, instead of drinking blood, drinks the words right out of books. Mix this with a boy who doesn't like to read, and I was ready for him to turn this into one of those books that celebrates the joys of reading. I was disappointed. The plot is the typical plot of other vampire stories, rather than the clever one demanded by the concept. In spite of many nice touches along the way, the ending was a big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest book.","review":"I would question the stated reading level for this book. I find that it is most suitable for children in Grades 2 and 3. I found the plot to be disappointing. Many of the lines end in hyphenated words which is dificult for sight readers. The use of language is fairly colloquial. The book is not very respectful to children. At one point the vampire calls the child in the book a \\"foolish kid.\\" To quote my six year old daughter, she said, \\"Look, another sentence that starts with the word 'and'. I found the vocabulary level to be quite mixed making it hard for a beginning reader to comprehend and to read, yet a more advanced reader wouldn't find the plot to be interesting enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, big let down","review":"I was excited to read this book because the idea of an ink drinking vampire was intriguing. As I read I became disappointed by the story and the style of writing. The author created an original premise and then fell back on the same tired vampire themes. Why couldn't the vampire live in the library or disappear into the internet? (I don't want to give too much away!) When I saw this book on the Harry Potter \\"people who bought this book....\\" list, I thought I would give it a try. I wonder if the other people that loved Harry Potter were as disappointed as me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick!","review":"Very, very odd story. I didn't like it. I didn't not like it. Just strange.

When I was REALLY little like 6 or 5 I read this book, well actually the library teacher read it to us, and it was wonderful. I LOVED IT!!! Whenever she stopped the book because library time was about to end I was devastated. I felt my heart drop every time! When I was 5 I believe I was in the 1st grade, so 6 was in second or ending of 1st grade. Anyways the book was awesome! It was the perfect book. So when I turned 11 or 12 or maybe 10 (6th, 7th, 5th) I tried to look for that book again. And I did, so if anyone is reading this...BUY THE BOOK!!!It's about a vampire who is allergic to blood, so has to drink ink from books!

Instead he drinks ink, not from a bottle, but letters from books. The Ink Drinker is interesting, weird, drinks books, floats, and is smart. My favorite part was when the ink drinker came in the bookstore and started drinking the letters from books I recommend this book because it is surprising. It is surprising because the ink drinker comes in the bookstore and starts drinking books and because of the part at the end where the boys too starts drinking books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter read this book in one day!","review":"This was a breakthrough book for my 9 year old daughter who loves fairies and is resistant to reading.

Of course, we're not talking mutation in the real-world sense, which would have meant a sickly little thing with perhaps an extra set of legs, but in the bad-movie sense of the word, which means bigger, stronger, and more ferocious. (Hmmm, perhaps we should be feeding radioactive pesticides to our soldiers to increase their fighting ability...)As some of the other reviewers on this page have pointed out, you might get a kick out of this if you're in the mood to laugh at a bad movie. I found it too dull to be even inadvertantly funny. I like star Adam Baldwin, but I was sorry to see him involved with this mess. The rest of the cast is terrible, the creature design is the pits (think Barney with sharp teeth), the plot twists are ludicrous, and I'm running out of synonyms for 'bad' so I think I'll stop right here."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a realy amazing story","review":"This is an amazing story of amazing person who saved many young Israelis in the remote places all over the world.

My children were born during the \\"dark ages\\" when the father was considered the least important person in the birth process. This book goes a long way toward showing that, indeed, the father, as well as other family members can play a vital role in helping the mother bring forth a new life.I gave the book to my 18 year old daughter who is pregnant with her first child. She had been reading many books on the process that touched on what to expect physically but after seeing \\"Giving Birth\\", she began to fully appreciate the experience that she is soon to go through. Reading the excerpts of the feelings that the mothers and dads spoke about, she began to be more relaxed and her fears were lessened.I highly recommend this book to anyone about to experience the birth of a child, personally or in a helping role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable Merchandise","review":"I would have been embarrassed to have shipped this poor excuse for merchandise to anyone. It was so very disappointing to think that anyone would have tried to take advantage of people by placing a nice picture of a lawn mower replica on the internet and then to send out such a piece of junk. It was very tiny and had to be put together and painted and stickers , that were so tiny you could not read them, placed on it. There is no way it would have looked like the posted picture even if you put it together. You can be sure I will never order from this company again nor will I recommend them to anyone.

As it has been out of print for some time, I was delighted to see it offered, even in the cdr format. Unfortunately, track nine on the album is utterly ruined by loud static through most of the selection. The noise actually drowns out the music, so I'm fairly certain this isn't a problem with the master tapes, because they wouldn't have issued the track on the original album. I assumed at first that the problem was with Amazon's transfer of the music in the cdr manufacturing process, but their mp3 sound sample has the same noise and, indeed, I checked out a couple of other download sources for the album and they share the defect. A disappointment. With any luck, someone will figure out the problem and correct it."},{"rating":"1","title":"beatles hits flamenco guitar style","review":"I would give it no stars if that were an option.

It seems like there is something broken as there is no \\"click\\" when pressing down. Up until now, I have been reasonably happy with the mp3 player and have even recommended it to others. I use it moderately, usually only hooked up to my car stereo through a cassette deck adapter. However, 1 year is not the lifespan I expect from a very expensive gift - my Sony Walkman (10 years old) is still kicking. I haven't tried calling the service desk, but since the unit is over a year old, I'm not expecting much. Landfills are full of electronic items that have become useless due to one poorly made part.

It was still playing but the display had burned out.So I returned it and got another one. I had it out twice, under similar conditions, but this time I wore it around my neck with the supplied lanyard. Then the thing just quit completely. No power, no nothing. (Yes, I tried replacing the batteries.)Given their apparently serious quality control problems, plus the chintzy plastic cover/beltclip and the [weak] headphones (I used another pair), not to mention all the aforementioned software issues, I'd say curb your desire (or at least know the return policy) before you plunk down your hard-earned [money].

I tried to contact RCA but there is no support for the basic software package. You need musicmatch to interface with the player and if it can't find it, then it's money down the drain.

Also, the construction of the lid allows water to collect between two \\"layers\\" where it is impossible to wash properly or to dry, allowing mildew to grow.After two years of almost daily use, the push-down mechanism in the lid became completely inoperable and I had to discard the lid as useless.

Don't be put off by the ... phrase 'reader's guide' on the front cover, it's much much better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite inappropriate, Very disappointing","review":"I am a true hopeless romantic, absolutely obsessed with Regency Romances. I have stumbled upon the series of Signet Regency Romances, hoping they would be sweet and tame. Unfortunately, \\"A Singular Lady\\" was nothing of the sort. I was highly disappointed. The characters have zero time to develop before they are immersed in 'scandalous' behavior. The premise itself of a poor and desperate woman seeking a rich husband to save her family only to fall in love with a man whom she assumes to be poor like herself could have been rich and entertaining, but the overall embarrassment of such blushing scenes ruined the entire book. Intense and yet subdued romantic moments between well-explained characters can be a true treat!... But this was not what I found in \\"A Singular Lady.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Personalizing the Chaos in the Middle East","review":"As a suspense author with my debut novel in its initial release, I admire John Le Carre's LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL because it achieves what all authors of such types of fiction hope to achieve. Le Carre takes the complex issues involved in the Middle East and personalizes these issues with an intricate plot and vividly drawn characters. He makes the underlying and conflicting truths beneath this permanent international hotspot comprehensible to all who read his novel. Charlie, a beautiful actress, is lured into participating in a mission to entrap a Palestinian terrorist. Le Carre avoids simple answers and presents the views of all sides fairly. LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL is a terrific book, one I always recall when there is additional senseless violence in that most unfortunate world region."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moral Dilemma","review":"How do you respond to an unjust war being fought for a just cause? This is the moral challenge Le Carre throws to his readers in this novel. Like his naive heroine, we must make up our minds about whether our loyalties should be to the Palestinian people living under Israeli oppression or to the Western authorities who are trying to save innocent people from being killed by Palestinian terrorists. The power of le Carre's characterization does not allow us to make this choice easily or to be satisfied completely once the choice has been made. Just like the real world, the novel allows for no black-and-white decision, no ideal third way out. The honesty of the author makes this wonderful thriller also a true work of literature. A must read for our times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"A masterpeice written by a master. As an Israelian I had special interest in this book, and I really liked it. The plot is thrilling and fun to read and the book is very well written. Yet, the most important thing about this book is, in my opinion, that it reflects the reality in the middle-east: A cycle of old hates and old revenges. No one can remember who started it, and it doesn't really matters. There are no bad guys or good guys because the whole concept of justice doesn't exist anymore. Everybody knows they are angry about something, that they are revenging something, however, does it really matters? Does it right? Does anyone really remember why it all started? This book is recommended as a good thriller and a thought provoking book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bore-to-death book by Le Carre!","review":"Ridiculous plots with absolutely no fundmental logical premises. This book is like written by a college student with lot of imaginary thought-so plots but actually ridiculous with no realistic experience in Espinage or couter-terrorist professions"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambiguous and Ambivalent","review":"All of the Le Carre novels involve the theme of betrayal and exploitation in some subtle manner. This is one where the main character, as actress, has to betray and exploit herself. She - and by implication, we as readers - never know what is authentic and what is artifice in her. Le Carre demolishes the distinction. For this very quality she is taken on by the Israeli secret service, who need to construct an elaborate but plausible facade. Like all Le Carre's other novels there's an ambivalence about what is right and wrong. The characters are complex, ofttimes confusing in their motives and unsure of the efficacy and rightness of what they're doing. What makes this book unusually troubling is Le Carre's exposure of the fakeness and schism in the soul of western man.Is there anything bona fide and clear about us? Is life for us just theatre?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Drummer Girl Cassettes","review":"Excellent seller. \\"The Little Drummer Girl\\" was quickly delivered and the condition was accurately described. I would happily do business again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Drummer Girl","review":"Love this book. LeCarre is the master of intrigue and espionage fiction. He's head and shoulders above the rest. His character developement is so life-like and their humanity shines through. Their weaknesses, their vanity, their conflicted heroism, their pain. Closer to reality and absent of the trite, overused and clich'ed spy novel storylines. Not for those looking for an easy, gratuitous,(and typical)thrill-read. But very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"An anti-terrorist book written by a dreamer!","review":"How could you pick a woman and made her to become the girl friend of a terrorist who you guys wanted to catch? A totally ridiculous creation by Le Carre. I've suffered a serious leCarre syndrome after I've translated this book since there were so may flaws in this book that even the writer himself might not be able to justify. A tedious, boring, dream-like progress of the typical endless English blabblings, totally unplausible, ridiculous and quite unreadable. The movie was also a bore-to-death product. Only \\"THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD\\" is highly recommended. If you want to find the earliest gay complex in the English military-transformed-into-civilian intelligence communinity, you may read his \\"Looking Glass War\\", but unfortunately, it's still a very childish writing and a quite ridiculous story; if all the English intelligence people were all the jerks like what leCarre described, the Soviet already won the cold war"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a golf conditioning book that makes sense!","review":"I found this book very helpful. I understand the golf swing better as a result of reading it, and the exercises make sense! The many photographs make the exercises easy to understand, and I can feel my shoulder turn improving as a result. After working in front of a mirror with the exercises, I am getting into much, much better positions, especially on the takeaway. When I hit balls, I am making better contact, and have gained yards with every club. But the best part of the book for me is the Mental Side section. A practical mental side approach better that any I have found to date. This is a very good resource for any golfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting exercises, but lots' of techno babble","review":"This was really confusing, and obviously not a great deal of time went into organizing this. I found 3 good exercises, the rest was just difficult to understand. The nutrition section which was hyped up in the amazon promo was really poor. Also, the section on cardio training was almost non-existent and I feel that is really important. I should of known when it said spiral bound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow Some, Discard the Rest","review":"I did this program instead of my regular program with some interesting results. My golf was about the same, but my feel in my short game was better, which I attribute to moving in different directions in the program. I might have gotten the same thing from basketball, I don't know. However, after 2 weeks of this, I felt my overall strength and endurance was down from previous. So what I did was borrow some of the movements, added them back to my regular routine of basic weight training and cardio work.

From her expertise in the Vedas, co-author Jeanine Miller offers her insights that help the Vedas come alive for the reader and realize how the yoga of today springs forth from a 5,000 year old tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedtime reading for philosophers","review":"If you like philosophy and get turned by Yoga, this is a book for you.

It is pretty much a concept of the rock and roll lifestyle, and what a cd it is. If you like that AOR sound of the early 80's this is for you. The big hit of this album was the song My Girl with it's awsome vocals. It's one of those songs you might not recognize by title, but once you hear it you'll say \\"I remember that!\\". Great, refreshing cd overall. Has a few surprisingly heavy guitar songs on it. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure!","review":"My wife cringes, but I just grin!

Each time I heard it, I found myself wanting to hear it more and more. As most people, I thought the special music was provided by a mandolin...when it was, in fact, a Chinese Lute.

I'm not surprised! The sound quality and music itself is just beautiful. Put this on shuffle play while you're working and it will calm even the most stressful workday. I'm not crazy about the sometimes shrillness or (seeming)redundancy of Asian music which I'm sure is my own shortfall in music appreciation; but I am trying to expand my musical horizons and appreciate this on its merits and own intrinsic beauty. For something not too \\"over the top\\" I highly recommend either/both of these c.d.'s wholeheartedly.

The only drawback of the book is the small part of Wes Stone's dog; a storyline that I enjoyed in the Nathan Stone books, which showcased a larger part for the two dogs.I also recognized James Drury's review of the book though he chose not to identify himself. His stamp of approval is always good enough for me.

About 23 1/2 hours of Hyacinth Bucket.The Christmas specials are on a separate disk and not in chronological order which may bother some purists. Every disk also includes out-takes plus usually an interview or some other special video to add to the enjoyment.The disk quality was excellent, however several of the shows on the 8th disk seemed of a slightly lesser quality then the rest of the set. Sound and video overall excellent on all of the other shows.We just finished watching them through and are ready to start over. I envision many years of enjoyment with this set - you won't go wrong by purchasing this set of videos.Next to Fawlty Towers, this is my favorite English comedy. N-I-C-E!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Up Appearances - The Full Bouquet Set (Vols. 1-8)","review":"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. No complaints. I watched the whole set and I'm watching it from start to finish again. Many times when shows are committed to DVD they edit them; these are the real thing, minus interruptions from advertisements, and the bonuses, outtakes and bios make the characters more personable. Thanks for offering this product. It's GREAT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Keep A Mother In Law Happy","review":"Keeping Up Appearances is my 93 year old Mother In Law's favorite tv show. It is aired regularly on PBS but usually during the dinner hour in the retirement home where she lives. We gave her the complete set as a Chanukah present and you would think we gave her a gold watch. She watches a different episode each night. I only hope her poor health cooperates so she can finish all 8 discs.

I've never been a fan of British comedy but you can't help but either identify with at least one character or know people like this. Impeccably done and you can watch the episodes over and over and still laugh.I purchased this set from Amazon back in 2007 when my father passed away to try to cheer my Mom up and it's the best present she ever got. She still watches at least an episode a day and it's been a great joy to take her mind off her grief. She loves Hyacinth and I like to watch the episodes when I'm visiting so we can both laugh together. Refreshing to watch true original comedy at its finest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously Hyacinth","review":"What a super collection! Pure delight! With these episodes, one can watch any one at any time, as the episodes do not depend upon previous ones for their story line. I have one caveat for purchasers wanting the full spectrum; if you buy this set, do not buy \\"Deck the Halls with Hyacinth\\"; this (very funny) Christmas DVD is included! Or...do buy it and give it to a friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Patricia Routledge is wonderful as the bossy, domineering Hyathinth Bucket (pronounced \\"bouquet,\\" if you please), set on making a good impression in society--with adverse results. She terrorizes her neighbor Elizabeth and her brother Emmett, the postman, the vicar and his wife, her sisters and brother in law, and even her own husband!All 40-some-odd episodes are presented in this set, with a special \\"holiday\\" disc with four episodes on them. This was the thing I didn't like about the set--these episodes are not in order with the reast of the series. But Keeping Up Appeances is one of the best TV shows out there!The 8-DVD set also includes deleted scenes from the various episodes and a commericial, with scenes from Patricia Routledge's Kitty Monologues. These monologues are just as worthy of watching as Keeping Up Appeances is."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will keep you laughing","review":"A moderate value for the price, this is a great collection of the whole series. Get it before it's discontinued. Even if you haven't seen it before, consider renting it or buying Season 1. You'll probably be hooked. It is somewhat overlooked in the history of British comedy shows, but is not to be dismissed. Granted, it is not as subtle as series such as 'Monty Python' or 'The Vicar of Dibley' but has its own quirky charm. Many characters will probably remind you of people you know. Don't miss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBC Video","review":"Took a little longer to receive than I am used to, but it arrived in good condition.

Quickly becoming my #2 favorite television show of all time (after only \\"I Love Lucy\\"), \\"Keeping Up Appearances\\" never fails to bring a smile to my face and laugh out loud no matter how many times I've watched the episodes. Patricia Routledge is the British Lucille Ball, with her unparalleled talent for excellent comedic timing and hilarious physical comedy.With my local PBS station having stopped airing the show regularly, this excellent DVD set is exactly what I need. All the episodes with great bonus features, it is a must have for any fan of great television, great talent and timeless comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Up Appearances - The Full Bouquet","review":"Even though I've seen most of these episodes I never seem to tire of our Hyacinth, her hilarious family, and her endless social climbing fiascos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment!","review":"This 9 disc set can't be beat - every episode with out-takes, info about the cast, its all here!

Violet, her other sister, who has a swimming pool, sauna, and room for a pony also has a cross dressing husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doing a Disservice to the Unbiased Reader","review":"Doing a disservice to the public, the author of this book--through \\"source\\" quotes without attribution, and with an obvious agenda of his own--perpetrates the myth of an evil liberal bias at a time when the press and TV media leans heavily in the opposite direction (I'm sorry, can we say \\"Rush Limbaugh\\" or \\"Ollie North\\" or \\"G. Gordon Liddy\\"?) I'm sure it'll hold great appeal for those who already accept the loud pronouncements by such as those named above: that readership is not about to object if the information imparted fits the template with which they're already comfortable. For the rest of us, this is just biased misinformation. Yes, without a doubt the members of the press distort the news, and the notion of the investigative journalist is now nearly folkloric. However, Goldberg has depressingly little to add. To paraphrase Paul Harvey, I'd prefer to hear the rest of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS NO LIBERAL MEDIA REPEAT AFTER ME","review":"WOW, I AM AN INSECURE WHITE PERSON(OR A \\"MODEL MINORITY) WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVES THAT ALL THESE LIBERALS CONTROL THE MEDIA WHEN MOST OF THESE CORPARTIONS ARE RUN BY WHITE CONSERVATIVES THEMSELVES.

It comes with a free copy Hooked On Phonics, which you'll probably need first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialist Bias, Not Liberal","review":"There is definitely a socialist bias in most media reporting. Not necessarily a 'liberal' bias, as the views or opinions of neither Anarchist or Libertarians is ever taken into account. It's a shame that people with socialist leanings have captured the term 'liberal' for themselves over the years.Televison in general will always be biased as it trys to appeal to certain advertisers who wish to reach certain demographics. Money talks. Name all the televison shows that portray an 'average' USA family as living in a apartment or tenement. Except for the show 'Good Times' (which predates my birth) even the poorest or 'average' families are portrayed as home owners. Televison news and reporting may have a socialist bias, but the media in general has a socioeconomical bias that favors favors the views and lifestyles of the upper classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the biggest lies told in America today...","review":"The major media outlets are owned and administered by massive corporations, which are inherently conservative. For these corporations to allow any sort of left-wingery into their media organs would be tantamount to suicide. Of course, they don't stop at simply locking out progressive voices. By loudly perpetuating the myth of a liberal bias, they further strengthen their control over the public. It's a simple string of logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Axe Grinding","review":"This book is a ridiculous example of someone being embraced by the conservative right merely for confirming their beliefs, whether they are true or not. In this book, Goldberg takes great pains to attack anyone who wronged him at CBS. His \\"research\\" into media bias is based on his own opinion, no research, or unsubtantiated research. For a real treatment of the interaction between politics and media check out 'What Liberal Media' by Eric Alterman. At least he attempts to research the subject and approach it in a fact based way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews of an unpublished book","review":"The glowing reviews are very intetesting considering that the book has yet to be published.The author gave an interview on CNN and I suspect that many of the comments are based on the interview. I was not impressed, the author came across as a partisan whose real complaint was that CBS was not biased the way he wanted it to be and fell out with his producers as a result.The attack on the media and in particular the phrase 'biased liberal press' is part of a deliberate strategy to introduce a right wing bias. Nobody who watched the 2000 election can fairly claim that GWB was unfairly treated by the media. Nobody who watches Fox news or listens to talk radio can claim that there are no forums that allow the right to put their case unchallenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring stuff by a Rush wannabe","review":"I agreed with some of his points but man this guy can't write. And most of the book is his crying about how CBS mistreated him. Like nothing was ever his fault. Yeah, it was liberal bias against him! Whine, whine, whine. There wasn't enough facts about what's wrong with the media and too much poor me. If you want a good book about media bias just read anything by Rush. This guy isn't the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This book should have been called \\"Bernard Golberg complains about his ex-boss and how he got fired\\".I was expecting a book about how media *in general* creates bias and an atmosphere of fear in the interest of selling more media products.I got a book about the underhanded ways of Dan Rather at CBS.And a lot of bitching by a guy who got fired for going to the press with complaints about his company. The surprising thing to me is, how could Mr. Goldberg think he would NOT get fired after publishing a story dissing his company in a major newspaper!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just some thoughts","review":"Reviewer: Kallyn \\"Kallyn22\\"This review is really in response to the person's thoughts. This indvidual wrote a review of this book. I agree with your ideas almost 100%. However if you and I are correct then should we not strongly suggest that CBS CNN etc are not news outlets. They do not provide that function. They are simply intertainment in the guise of NEWS. At least in this manner the public will not be mislead. To hide behind the banner of a NEWS OUTLET in general is false and misleading. If they drop (CNN etc) the pretense of doing quality news reporting then you and I have nothing to complain about.Would love to hear your comments and others.

If you're a democrat/liberal you probably won't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly Veiled Personal Rant","review":"It's clear that Mr. Goldberg is hurt by his personal and professional troubles with CBS and Dan Rather. It is made even clearer by the fact that he constantly brings it up over and over again throughout most of this book.This \\"book\\", for being written by someone who is outraged over the media bias, is incredibly unprofessional, full of hyperbole, personal rants, and very little decorum. If Goldberg wants to convince us that the media has a liberal slant, he would be much better off keeping his own opinions to himself and write a centered book based on facts. BIAS feels like a personal vendetta against Rather, against CBS, and I suspect that Goldberg had some aspirations for greatness in his return to CBS, was denied, and, in turn, wrote this scathing book as revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad and misguided work","review":"It's too bad that Bernard wants to take sides and pretend that there actually is a fight between the liberal and conservative perspectives shown in corporate media.Bernard ignores the obvious and avoids stepping on big toes at his mega monopoly of a company called viacom. This work is nothing special. Just another quick fix to the alternative independant media that is popping up all over the place because Bernard thinks that media \\"Needs to take a side.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written Thesis of What Most People Have Always Known","review":"The premise of liberal bias in TV journalisim has been recognized for many years. Goldberg's elaboration adds very little to the knowledge of this premise.No index and no footnotes enforce my belief that this book was more of a personal vendetta directed mostly at CBS News and others, rather then a professional documentation of an unfortunate condition.I personnally learned very little from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance whatsoever, don't waste your time!","review":"Mr. Goldberg has some personal issues with CBS, including losing his job. Hardly an objective look at the topic of this book. Don't waste your time reading this one, obviously written because Mr. Goldberg has bills to pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the devil with it!","review":"When I was introduced to Goldberg at a conference a few years ago, the first words out of his mouth to me were (almost a direct quote), \\"See, I don't have horns and a tail.\\" Other than my name and that I am a journalism/mass communication professor, he knew NOTHING about me, not even my politics or whether I had read his book. The man doth protest too much, me thinks. I have read his book, and there is nothing like a completely one-sided book complaining about the mass media being one-sided in the other direction. If all of the mass media companies (which includes book publishers) were one-sided in favor of liberals (other than Fox, National Review, Weekly Standard, etc.), Goldberg wouldn't have been able to get this book published, let alone advertised, reviewed, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Disappointment","review":"Goldberg speaks nothing of the overwhelmingly massive right-wing slant in the media today, the fact that all journalists are just all too satisfied with gobbling up the GOP party line (no matter how unintelligible), and that massive corporations with big investments own the corporate media conglomerate which results in a crippling filter on the dissemination of real information.Sorry, but I would recommend David MacNally's \\"Bodies Of Meaning\\" over this superficial fluff anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the \\"liberal media\\" scam","review":"The right-wing establishment has milked this cow dry. [yawn] You want bias? Fox News and its minions should keep you busy for days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias, Indeed","review":"The only people who'll agree that the media still has a liberal bias are the ones who think that TV stations and newspapers owned by Fortune 500 companies are somehow staffed by radical Marxists. Please.The only true thing about this book is its title. Goldberg displays a tremendous bias of his own, and does an excellent job of distorting the news. If you truly think that Fox News is \\"fair and balanced\\" or that Rush Limbaugh gives reasoned accounts of today's news, then this book is for you. If you have a brain, however, steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cobblers","review":"\\"The code of silence that pervades the news business\\" yea right, everyone in the media thinks they have a bestseller as long as they can find a decent hook. That's why juornalistic ethics gets thrown out of the window in potboilers like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A directionless rant.","review":"I know there's liberal bias in the media. At this point, who doesn't? I hoped this book would provide clear, well organized evidence. While Goldberg's work is clearly thoughtful and no doubt insightful, I found his constant sarcasm and rambling style very tiresome. While the book is full of specifics, there is little direction, and Goldberg's tone reduces his thoughtful arguments to directionless rants."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Sleeper","review":"I heard a lot about this book, so I checked it out of the library to find out what people were talking about. It takes pages and pages of flabby prose for Goldberg to get to the heart of his argument, which is largely anecdotal and mostly unverifiable. Goldberg tells us breathlessly that an unnamed person agrees with him in a two-person meeting that there is \\"liberal\\" bias in the news. Maybe it happened, but why should anyone believe it? Let's see some proof. Right-leaning reviewers love this book because it bashes \\"liberals,\\" while left-leaning reviewers dismiss it as exhibiting right-wing bias. A book so devoid of verifiable facts is probably open to this wide range of interpretation. Most readers will find their own prejudices strengthened by Goldberg's vague indictment. This insider's look at CBS News will intrigue readers of People magazine. However, if you are looking for a good read, this isn't it. Goldberg's book is self-indulgent and poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Removing the mask from media manipulators","review":"Bernard Goldberg displays tremendous integrity and courage by blowing the whistle on the hardcore leftist bias that dominates the mainstream media. Dan Rather likely regards Bernie Goldberg as a traitor. But history has been kinder to Goldberg, especially during the past two weeks. Time will demonstrate that Bernard Goldberg was a prophet who tried to warn the media before it was too late...and was scorned for his efforts. Scorned by media elites, but not by real people who live in the \\"flyover states\\" who have long suspected what Goldberg portrays. This book is an absolute must-read for anyone who seeks a clearer understanding of how news is processed, manipulated, filtered, and \\"reported.\\" Upon publication of this book, Goldberg may have permanently altered the landscape of news reporting...he at the very least exposed the nakedness of the Emperor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The stories are better from the inside","review":"Many, many people have pontificated on the behind the scenes nature of the media elites. But getting one of them to confess is a treat. Surprisingly, it isn't some evil desire to hurt the GOP or Christians that drives the leftists but rather a complete blindness to the existence of the competing views. A unique and interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to expand your news sources, and see international news more","review":"So much of what we think of as news content is really advertising and political messages. That's the main point of this book. The second point is a tendency toward thinking more liberal than the audience, at least during the time of Bernard Goldberg. It's tragic when facts and good analysis gets distorted by the media for whatever reason. I don't truly trust any of the major news sources although I appreciate them when they perform quality reporting."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for truth 4 for writing style.","review":"I just finished the book Bias by Bernard Goldberg its an easy read, pretty short its general premise of left Bias in the news media is really not a revelation for anyone who paid attention to the news the last 20 years. But it is a definitely a worthwhile read; although it confirms what most of us knew about that Bias in the news media; it also brings up some IMPORTANT things that many of us did not about Such as AIDS, The HOMELESS, RACE issues and Women's issues and the way the news media handled and handle these important issues. Goldberg documents just how the news is slanted and why. Its a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"New truths about Liberal, Left, \\"Bias\\"","review":"This book illustarates how the liberal, left, has distorted the way our society is portrayed. We need many more individuals to come forward and tell the truths about the distorted views and lies that we are force fed by the media and special interest groups.Also strongly recommend \\"Slander\\" by Ann Coulter"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for liberals and conservatives","review":"This book outlines how the media distort the news, and how they may not always realize they are doing it. While many called Goldberg a conservatie, he is no such thing. He simply thinks the media shoudn't report with a bias, and he very effectively outlines how they do just the opposite. This is a wonderful book detailing what the conservatives have been saying for years; the media report the news based on their own opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Air","review":"The silliest thing about this book, which panders to Rush Limbaugh fans everywhere, is the fact that the so-called issue at stake- \\"liberal\\" vs. \\"conservative\\" - doesn't exist. Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Bush jr. are are all \\"neoliberals\\", meaning that they favor a laissez faire approach towards corporate capitalism. Goldberg's conspiricy theory that corporations such as CBS, Disney/ABC or General Electric/NBC are somehow fighting against their own hegemony by supporting the left is asinine. Still, if you enjoy oversimplification, or are a libertarian who needs something to read while hiding in your cave until the \\"bust cycle\\" ends, you may find Golberg's whining entertaining. If you want to read something intelligent about television news, try On Television by Pierre Bordieu instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started at five stars, went downhill from there","review":"Five stars -- because writing -- any writing -- is difficult, and one should always give the writer the benefit of the doubt, and not be judgemental at the start.Four stars -- A incredible amount of bitterness that detracts from what I thought would be an objective analysis of American News Media.Three stars -- the incessent use of italics. It's like being at a cocktail party and having a drunk guy talking to you. You listen, somewhat bemused, but after awhile it becomes incredibly irritating and you just want to smack the guy.Two stars -- Instant realization that I could've bought some music instead of paying twenty odd dollars for this tirade that says nothing new.One star -- my guilt -- at being sucked into the wording of the title, like reading a good National Enquirer headline at the grocery store checkout line -- then feeling like you've been robbed because you actually bought the damn thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially good, if it wasn't so biased.","review":"Bernard Goldberg had a great opportunity to write an objective book about media bias toward the left. Instead he chose to use this book as a platform for his personal attacks against Dan Rather and other media elites. In the begining of his book, he compares the media to the mafia and complains that he \\"got whacked.\\" It was difficult to continue the book, but as I plodded through his whine fest, I found that Mr. Goldberg brings up many valid points. Too bad he used a right-wing slant to do so. I for one, like so many people, do not belong to either side of the politics, but prefer information to persuasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a breath of fresh air!","review":"I commend Goldberg for writing this book. It confirms my own observations and worst suspicions, while showing up the big media \\"stars\\" for the cartoons of journalists they are. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the writing style and lack of documentation: too much repetition and emotion; overuse of italics and exclamation points; no references, footnotes or bibiography to show the dates, times, publications, airings, etc., for his quotes, though no doubt he can back them up. I acknowledge being a staunch conservative but believe Goldberg because he is a journalist first and a liberal second. He's kept his own political persuasions out of his professional work, which is the whole point. Our country is better off for this exposure; The self-serving Dan, Tom and Peter have done us a disservice, damaged news credibility and misled the public. Kudos to Mr. Goldberg's courage!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"Good book. Worth reading, if you're interested in insights (and insides) on how the press edits your thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!...an insider speaks out","review":"This book reveals what most of us already knew but never hear anyone report on. The bias in the media is overwelming. To the guy who says that corporations own the media and are therefore conservative....hogwash!...Fox News is the only network who could be labeled as such. Don't forget that CNN is owned by Ted Turner.Goldberg himself is a registered democrat and has never voted Republican...ever!This is an old style newsman who got fed up with being told what to report."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening account of the liberal media!","review":"This book is written so well it drew me in immediately. I cannot agree more with the author on so many points. This nation is in trouble, in fact, we are in a war over the values and policies that have made us a great nation. One could get very discouraged knowing the inflammatory methods the media uses to incite 'HATE' in its viewers. The media is guilty of 'hate crimes' on a daily basis. Prejudicing the minds of millions 24 hours a day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is not often exposed","review":"The truth is not often exposed in such a straightforward manner. Mr. Goldberg's book exposes the reality of left of center bias from inside the world of journalism. What is starkly evident from the unassailable factual analysis contained in Bias is that we seldom get the truth from either print or broadcast journalism. This is especially true when the \\"press\\" reports on itself.\\"Bias\\" will convince anyone who doubts that a left of center bias exists throughout the media. I ordered this book because I had read the original opinion piece Goldberg wrote for the Wall Street Journal criticizing a \\"news\\" story that had been done on CBS News.Mr. Goldberg is now considered by the left as a member of the vast right wing conspiracy. Tammy Bruce has something to say about that in her expose' \\"The New thought Police!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a very important book. It is well-written and reveals a side of the media that we all know about but had no proof existed until this book came out. The only thing I did not like about the book is that the author whines too much abot how he was treated after expressing his view of liberal bias. He goes on and on about it and it can be distracting at time. Other than that it is an excellent book. I'd rate it 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a true conservative this is and excellent read...","review":"We have all known for sometime that the media was extremely bias on their reporting. But to hear it from a former insider is absolutely compelling. To see, first hand, how evil people like Dan \\"Blather\\" Rather, is a must.

Try it... it is well worth it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poorly-written, nonetheless extremely important and gutsy","review":"This book is not very graceful. The prose is childish. Goldberg often uses profanity. And there is not much of a flow to the argument.However, I still think that this book is extremely important - and Bernard Goldberg is a very courageous man. It is true that the media is very arrogant and very tiltied to the left. We've all known it for years. Now, one of the insiders who has personal experience has confirmed what we've all known all along.The book offers a behind-the-scenes look at CBS News. It affords us an extremely important perspective on an important issue of our time. I would recommend it to anyone - conservative or liberal."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"This is a must read for those who believe what they see and hear in the media as being the truth. This book was an eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"View from the Inside","review":"For those of us who have long detected a bias in the mainstream media, this book is refreshing. For people who haven't, it will be thought-provoking.Goldberg points out-sometimes humourously, sometimes sadly-that the media's bias isn't necessarily a left-wing plot. It's just that people tend to see things from a particular point of view. And when you're a newsperson, your point of view may come through, whether you intend it or not.All people have a tendency to assume others think like they do. What Goldberg points out is how that tendency shapes the way our news is given to us. An engrossing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced","review":"I've been looking for someone to finally present a balanced view on news reporting - this is it.Goldberg accurately states that biased, loaded reporting is damaging regardless of left or right slant.I seem to find that liberals are anything but liberal when it comes to anyone questioning their positions. Hold your liberal/conservative rhetoric and give this book a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"An eye opening work written and published at considerable personal risk.

Then most of them kindly point out that there is a conservative bias in radio, so what's the problem? Well, Conservative Talk Shows like Rush Limbaugh or Neal Boortz or even the O'Reilly Factor are not news programs. They are political and social commentary. They are about opinions and interpretations of news events.News on the other hand is not about opinion and commentary. News is about what is happening. It is supposed to be about facts. Television news should especially be about \\"just the facts\\" because that is where the majority of the people get their information. If television news is bias, what will most of the people get?Everyone has the right to his or her own opinion, but that opinion should not be confused with fact. There should be NO bias in news. That is what Bernard Goldberg is after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, entertaining, fails to show \\"Liberal BIAS\\"","review":"People Have praised GOLDBERG'S courage in writing this book. Most of it is not about BIAS in the news, but rather a personal assult on his former-employer Dan Rather. The book tries to show something that is not true, but people like to believe, the media is bias. The author is a demagouge for conservative ideolouges, and has nothing better to do with his time than write.

Perhaps he too was in need of being convinced that the media is \\"liberal.\\" For those conservatives/republicans that see the truth and realize the media is what it is (unbiased) but do not want to be ousted from their fellow conservatives, this is the book for you.

The isssues which are not socially conservative (pro- choice, secularism, gay rights, \\"politcal correctness\\") are often given as examples of liberal bias, but when it comes to financial issues and foriegn relations, the American press is very conservative, favoring big-business. Nowadays the mainstream American press trys to tell liberals what they believe and convince conservatives what politcal stances they should take. Surveying international news, especially financial publications in English, leads one to see that American news exploits both sides and B Goldberg continues this by being entirely self-serving in writing this book.

Bias lies not only in how stories are covered, but in the selection process in terms of which stories get covered. Is there liberal bias in the media? Probably, just as there is conservative bias in the media. Does the liberal bias dominate mainstream coverage? Absolutely not, and Mr. Goldberg presents no evidence to support such a claim.What Mr. Goldberg does do is engage in a lot of name-calling, and telling half-truths and unsourced anecdotes. ... But the best evidence of the lack of liberal bias is the widespread publicity and promotion this book has received in the media.

THIS is not news. The most telling part of the book was the self-serving apology that the author offered up to the fellow at CBS that he dissed.Thank god this book was a best seller and simpletons bought it in droves. I won't worry about Bernie buying his next meal. And thank Amazon for having a 90 used copy that I could buy and read.

Why does the author think that somebody has to pay to learn about this is beyond me. Whatever space is left after whining , is devoted to anecdotal evidence, lacks serious analysis and is surprisingly biased. Mr. Goldberg is a misogynist and doesn't try to conceal this fact.To summarize, we have here a self-obssessed and biased member of the media complaining about self-obssessed and biased media.The old dog can't unlearn the (old) tricks.

It could have been better, but it seemed like most of it was just Goldberg complaining about his old job. To some degree I think he discredits his own argument because of this. When he finally gets around to making his argument about a liberal bias in the mainstream media he has some convincing points. Some of them are true, others are not. While Goldberg makes a few good points, I don't think his book does a good job of proving his case. The one true bias that any media company will have is a bias for profit, and that means selling the story that people want to hear. Maybe Goldberg's next book will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bias? What Bias.","review":"I have to admit just seeing this book felt good, and that was before I even picked it up once! Liberal bias in the media is so patently obvious that it's almost unimaginable to me that there is any kind of debate about the topic at all. It's actually amusing to see the number of Media apologists logging on here to ridicule Goldberg's book...Folks! Can you in all sincerity(and with a straight face)actually claim that there is no leftward bias in the mainstream media? If you believe that then you probably also believe that the Israeli's were responsible for September 11(or the Bush administration),that the holocaust didn't happen,that Elvis is alive and well and living happily in Las Vegas and that Aliens ate my Buick!

On any other subject, Goldberg would be praised as a hero instead of a traitor or right-wing convert. The TV networks operate and spin in the biggest glass house of all.

The book spent more time about how he had a falling out with Dan Rather, which really doesn't surprise me one bit in the slightest. I'm sure that Rather did everything that Goldberg alledged, but frankly, anybody in a position of power, be it a news organization or any large corporation is not going to take well to someone under them writing such a scathingly critical op-ed.

Goldberg is one of the last real journalists with guts and integrity...and this fact jumps off the page at you as he gives vivid, humurous descriptions of his experiences.

Whatever it is, it exists.It's a fairly short book that gets right to the points.The only weakness is that Goldberg spends considerable time on his own persecution at the hands of his former colleagues and bosses.

I'm an avid Rush Limbaugh listener and I have heard him often describe the liberal bias in the media. I looked forward to this book as an insider account of that bias. It turns out that about 1/2 to 2/3's of this book is a rehashing of an op-ed piece that Goldberg submitted to the WSJ.

While it is certainly admirable what the author has gone through to reveal the bias in the news, he does it in such a fashion that I found rather disappointing. The first two chapters of the book are more or less a diatribe where the author rants and raves without really making a point. The more meaty chapters are not as meaty as they should be, with at best two examples of bias in those chapters. In the end, I am gald the author wrote the book because it is awakening everyone to the reality that yes the news is biased. However, my hope is that in the future the author will provide more examples and perhaps use better judgment as far as some of his choice of words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal Bias","review":"Mr. Goldberg complains about his treatment at CBS, and complains and complains. He complains that the media is biased, but he does not base his books on any evidence, other than his own opinion.The weight of the evidence contradicts Mr. Goldberg's thesis that our media is slanted leftward. Because of massive consolidation over the last 20 years, over 90% of the media (print, radio, television) is controlled by a handful of companies. This is a much bigger influence on what is or is not in the media, than the individual bias of the reporters, even the \\"super-stars.\\" They are, after all, employees.I would refer people to the following sources for media evaluations that are based on weighing the evidence:1. ...2.

Just as one is getting into the credibility of a well organized and deliberative case being made by the author about liberal bias in the media, a \\"Dan Rather is a less than nice person\\" example is not so discretely woven into a paragraph. It tended to be so vindictive. In the very early chapters the reader is made well aware of the author's disdain for Mr. Rather. Any further references to Mr. Rather are whipping it to death.

The media is clearly, in general, biased AGAINST liberals and liberal thought, and the author astonishingly provides examples of this.One can surmise from this book the real reasons behind Goldberg's sketchy past in journalism is an inability to make a compelling argument and support it with facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"very inertesting","review":"This book is a behind the scene view of the media's dirty laundery.It's funny how the author refers to the media elites in Abc, CBS, and NBC as the news mafia. This book basically bad mouths every body in the media and accuses them of telling half trueths and not telling the whole story and the reason for falling ratings in ABC, CBS, and NBC is the people just don't trust them and turn to cable news like Bill O'Reilly. This book is we'll worth reading see how the media really is bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check Out a Real Study","review":"Liberal bias in the media? Not so. In fact, it's just the opposite. This is what a methodical, objective study by Geoffrey Nunberg of Stanford University shows. Unlike Goldberg, Nunberg actually did his homework, performing a content analysis to see whether, as Goldberg asserts, the media \\"pointedly identify conservative politicians as conservatives,\\" but rarely use the word \\"liberal\\" to describe liberals. Nunberg found \\"a big disparity in the way the press labels liberals and conservatives, but not in the direction that Goldberg claims. On the contrary: the average liberal legislator has a thirty percent greater likelihood of being identified with a partisan label than the average conservative does.\\" Forget the right-wing mythology and Goldberg's unsubstantiated rantings...."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no Left in America","review":"Need I say more.

I couldn't wait to read this book but DO NOT waste your money. This is a book about a man who has personal problems with specific news correspondents and he's just venting in a book. He boohoos about how Dan Rather gets great treatment and such. All the personal attacks made it hard for me to believe that he is credible and intelligent. Instead, he sounded utterly hateful and childish. I got the feeling that he doesn't truly care about the biased media but the purpose of his book is to vent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical right wing rhetoric...","review":"They say that the pendulum always swings as far to the right as it does to the left. After 8 years of peace and a booming economy, alas, we are now again under \\"right wing rule\\".

It is nothing but finger pointing, blame placing nonsense that should be saved for the school playground. Save your money on this book and deposit it into your savings account. You will need the money much more than Mr. Goldberg when the next Republican inflicted recession hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Bernie fell off the gravy train, and it hurts!","review":"What nonsense! Bernie Goldberg rode the gravy train and enjoyed his limelight for decades. It didn't occur to him to complain then.Now that he's lost his job and has an axe to grind, he's moaning and groaning. That's double standards, Bernie!This writer still believes the news media is a lot more credible than most politicians, liberals or, especially, conservative, because the latter are usually in the pockets of the rich and powerful.Goldberg fell out with his colleagues as well as his employers and, regardless of who was at fault (and, reading his book, one would have to think that everyone else was), he should accept his consequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NICE SOUR GRAPE BOOK","review":"I was, I admit, a bit disappointed in this book. When all is said and done, it is a \\"sour grapes, done me wrong\\" sort of book.Goldberg had an opportunity to create something quite good here, but was so hung up on taking cheap shots at Dan Rather, he missed his chance. On the other hand, I am not a big fan of Dan Rather, feeling that he is a rather arrogant, despicable sort of fellow, so I rather enjoyed the cheap shots Goldberg took. Perhaps this sort of work will hopefully shorten Rather's career and we can get someone who has a better grasp of reality in the U.S. today to digest, report and comment on our nightly news. All in all, worth the reading as it is quite entertaining, reads fast, and is certainly more fulfilling than listening to, or watching the CBS, ABC and NBC Nightly News. Goldberg is a competent writer and this is a rather easy read. If you are looking for something with depth though, you probably need to look elsewhere.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldberg nails it!","review":"Goldberg's work is thoughtful, incisive and well documented. In fact he has done a great job of reporting the bias in the media. Something the media itself won't do.

Although Mr. Goldberg spends the first couple of chapters in what, to me, amounts to no more than a soapbox diatribe aimed at Dan Rather, he does make some cogent arguments and some very surprising revelations in the latter part of the book.I was especially drawn to those chapters in which I consider my leanings to the liberal side of the equation. For instance, many of his revelations concerning the plight of the homeless were very enlightening. And it did cause me to ruminate on ther fact that although I encountered some \\"homeless\\" in my day to day wanderings, I can't think of one that didn't seem to be sober and alert.I think this is a book that should be read by everyone, but especially by those of my stripe, the open-minded liberal."},{"rating":"1","title":"slap-dash effort","review":"Bernard Goldberg's theme is a good one. I'd hoped for support of that theme with heavy use of anecdotal evidence. Some of that is here. Otherwise, its a whine about Dan Rather's cold-shoulder after Goldberg's original op-ed piece in the WSJ. His writing is often exclamatory which strengthened the feeling that he was throwing in emotion to back up weak points. There are often surprising leaps from disconnected premises to, what he would have us believe, are obvious conclusions.The book was not a total waste of time. I believe the idea that our news should be digested while keeping in mind its distribution through mainly liberal filters is important. Mr. Goldberg does present a few anecdotes which demonstrate this in the book but the problem is that there are as many weak ones presented with as much emphasis.I also didn't like the amount of time spent personally vindicating himself. It made me question his motives and his own bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell us something we didnt already know","review":"Mr Goldberg voted liberal his entire life and yet he turned to every Republican talk show to push his book against liberals. In my opinion Goldberg is a traitor to his liberal members and a traitor to his country. The question is...Why did the Republican talk shows all give him a chance to push his book. Thats like giving Benedict Arnold a chance to sell his book to the English on American TV. Utter disgrace! How he can manuever his face in the mirror, let alone on TV, baffles the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Confused Man","review":"Mr. Goldberg appears even more confused than when he was employed by CBS.

Goldberg was playing in the big time network business and had an even bigger ego than talent. He didn't get what he wanted so he went off and made up some stories about how bad he was treated.No market for losing whiners. So it had to be a conspiracy. Those cursed left wingers.The sad truth is that American television networks have let George Bush and the American right wing get away with murder, in some cases literally. They are cowed and afraid. Routinely, just as Goldberg would approve, reporters spout out the latest nonsense from the White HOuse or some other government Agency -- headed by a political appointee. Everyone knows it's nonsense, but no one dares tell the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about bias...","review":"As the title says, Goldberg makes assertions about liberalism in the media and his immense dislike of this bias. The problem is that he completely ignores the conservatism in the media. Most conservatives think the media is too liberal and most liberals think it is too conservative. The idea that liberalism has taken over the media is a myth. The fact is that the media tends to be more conservative because it panders to its sponsors, big businesses, which are almost always conservative. Yes, there is liberal bias, but the reason Goldberg sees this problem as completely one-sided is because he himself is very conservative. The book simply does not address the issue objectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strange Premise","review":"I don't understand the ancient cry of conservatives about liberal bias.Last time I looked,CBS is a large corporation,and by their very nature,corporations are conservative.They need to be,especially in this government's climate,or they wouldn't get such fine tax breaks.I find the conservative bias distorts the news.So,we start with a biased point of view,therefore,I feel that this is a book for conservative readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldberg caters to prejudices without proof","review":"Goldberg offers opinions and anecdotes but no serious studies to support his thesis. Anybody can write a book that caters to people's prejudices, chock full of tales and stories but short on facts, and sell thousands of copies. Has Mr. Goldberg never heard of Rush Limbaugh? Fox News? Talk Radio? Is Mr. Goldberg not aware that the NY Times and Washington Post hounded Pres. Clinton throughout his presidency? They hardly covered up for him, quite the opposite. If you want to know how the conservative Ministry of Truth operates, try \\"Blinded By The Right\\" by David Brock, the guy who made up the \\"Troopergate\\" story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be classified as fiction","review":"This is obviously the tale of a disgruntled employee who claims there is some type of media bias in the news, but anyone who is channel surfing these days can clearly observe the case is quite the opposite. The media is owned by right-wing corporations who gain profits from the Republican policies. NBC, for one is owned by GE who is a defense contractor. ABC is owned by Disney and, we all know about the FAUX Nuisand Channel. Just turn on your radio or tune into any politcal discussion show and it is clear that conservatives get TWICE the air time as liberals, if not more.

It is mainly about like I said, Right, Left, Conservative and other Aristocratic Bureaucrats.

It was somewhat of a revelation to me to learn that the major networks may lean to the left in their reporting of the news. It was, however, very painful to endure Mr. Goldberg's relentless right-wing rhetoric. He uses all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in displaying his own bias.

Even National Public Radio has moved to the political right due to its increased dependence on corporate supporters; a trend that began as the Federal Government began to reduce public funding during the Reagan years.If, as Mr. Goldberg asserts, the media is liberal now, I shutter to think what we will see and hear when he has become satisfied that it has become appropriately conservative. I can only visualize a fascist state. Sinclaire Lewis wrote a novel entitled It Can't Happen Here? When I read it as a boy, I believed it.

Goldberg's conspiricy theory that corporations such as CBS, Disney/ABC or General Electric/NBC are somehow fighting against their own hegemony by supporting the left is asinine.

He blasts \\"The Media\\" for not covering certain stories, and then uses the New York Times and Washtington Post as references for the stories being ignored.

He documents the bias that permeates a media that puts cultural correctness over truthful analysis. He has been on the inside and what he documents is a bias that is utterly unprofessional. The professional journalist should provide facts wherever they may lead even if they offend the people they socialize with and admire. Fortunately, we live in a competitive and free market economy where alternate sources of analysis, taking advantage of new technology such as cable television and the internet, are undermining the monopoly power over information of the major television networks. Goldberg's exposure is an implicit endorsement of the value of a competitive economy that provides such alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Regnery Employ Editors?","review":"Bernard Goldberg has written a bad book about an interesting and important topic. It reads like something that was rushed to print and completely unedited. I agree with his premise that the newsroom has become so insular there's no reason to assume that journalists understand how biased they've become. Unfortunately his hyperbolic style, obvious personal grudges, sloppy writing, and lack of coherent structure weaken his case.

He is known to be a liberal, had to have been a team player, and still was let go from the \\"good ol' boys' club.\\" My disappointment was that it read a little like the check-out stand tabloids. Content was titilating in the table of contents and failed to deliver much substance in the actual chapter.I experienced this same disappointment with Leslie Stahl's autobiography in that it seemed to neutralize content that could have been gossip-column juicy and expository.I imagine with fingers to point and names to name, books like this have to walk a fine line between commentary and libel.It made me intensely dislike a grudge-holding Dan Rather, who has lost the courage and passion of intensely personal reporting, qualities that made him an urban legend during his coverage of the Nixon White House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldberg clearly explains the media's slide","review":"Bernard Goldberg has written a book that explains exactly why (and how) the major networks have lost viewership. The big three (Brokaw, Jennings, and Rather) are so openly blatant in their liberal bias and probably do not even understand their failings. Viewers have switched to alternate sources, such as Fox News Network, for their news and eventually it will send a wake-up call to the major network bosses. The real question is why is it taking so long? Goldberg's book is a thoughtful, not a spiteful, story of the dying of network news."},{"rating":"2","title":"rattling the liberal cage","review":"What can I say. This book was well written, funny, and I couldn't put it down. The author criticizes both the liberal bias and the sensationalism of the media, and he cites many examples to support his claims. The only criticism I have is that the author made too many nasty comments about Dan Rather. I don't think this type of commentary was necessary, and it calls into question his motive for writing the book. But that being the case, I still liked this book a lot and recommend it because he is telling the truth. There is a liberal bias in the media as there is in big business and in academia as well. The liberal mindset seems to be the default political position in the world today, and few ever dare question the core tenets of liberal dogma. Mr Goldberg rattles the liberal cage.

The author has some interesting and factual data, but the writing is hard to read and follow. The author uses an approach full of short stories that are not well linked to the story.

Good approach, bad execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias","review":"Goldberg, if he ever took a course in logic or evidence, certainly shows no sign of it in this drivel. He takes extremely anecdotal evidence and pretends to extrapolate grand themes from it.The author is apparently as lazy as he is illogical. In some instances, definitive information regarding his assertions is available yet he ignores it, either because of personal dishonesty or because he simply cannot be bothered to research. For example, he chose to assert that bias exists because some of the Senators in the Clinton Impeachment trial were identified as \\"conservatives\\" while ignoring the context of the identification, that being a rift between the conservative and moderate elements of the GOP in how to proceed with the trial.The book is filled with such shoddy work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Read","review":"A good read. Perhaps a little unobjective at parts, but informative nevertheless. As with everything else, it should be taken with a great of salt...but Goldberg does present a fair amount of evidence to substantiate his argument (you simply have to read the entire thing). For many he's simply stating the obvious, but he does add some fairly insightful critique.As a sidenote, don't listen to the apparently numerous Chomsky-ites...they most likely didn't *read* the book. Anyone who tells you the media and corporations are in the same bed has a severe disconnect with reality (1 word...Firestone), so you can pretty much disregard their opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book is ridiculous. Yes, there are some liberals in the media, and once in a while they might make a questionable decision because they are biased. But there are plenty of conservatives in the media as well; in fact, the media is largely owned by large corporations and rich right-wing individuals (e.g., Rupert Murdoch). Goldberg spends about a third of the book complaining about how he was unfairly canned from CBS and explaining his hatred for Dan Rather. Who cares?By the way, an independent check on several of the news stories that Goldberg cites in this book indicate that he is not entirely on the level. But maybe I just read that in the biased, liberal media."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIAS- Runs out of STEAM","review":"I agreed with some of Goldberg's points about liberal biasin the media.

I know the type of songs that will really get my kids excited and this is just not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"celebrating wiccan spiritality","review":"this book is also very good for teaching the ways of wicca old and new i recommend this book too everyone interested in folklore spells sacred rites and days of the year,a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a sarcophagus...","review":"No, my golf clubs are not dead. But this case is like a sarcophagus. It will protect golf clubs for a long long time.This case is big enough to hold a complete set of golf clubs in the bag, with a couple extra drivers, and shoes too.Overall I'm happy with my purchase. If anyone at the airport asks what's in the case, I'll make up a story about how I just got back from raiding the tomb of a 5000 year old mummy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case","review":"Great case but I thought it was bigger. If you have lots of stuff in your golf bag and want to pack your shoes in there too, get the biggest one. This case definetly protects your clubs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case!","review":"Great case! The build is excellent and secures my clubs; the TSA lock is a real mental boost for security. The size is perfect for my Bag Boy OCB-14 bag. Other cases just seemed flimsy, but not this SKB case. It's just what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy, but protects your clubs well","review":"the case itself weighs a lot, so when your clubs are packed in it, and a pair of shoes, total weight will be approaching 50lbs. mine weighs in at about 45. this thing is sturdy and showed no signs of denting or scratching after a round trip flight from Chicago to San Francisco. good case, but it's still a bit pricey, even at $185, which is what I paid for it. but it will do its job well. the three clasps could be a bit more substantial- like maybe made of anodized aluminum instead of heavy plastic. I also foresee the spring mechanism in the clasps failing at some point down the line. the spring seems a bit on the chintzy side. overall, its much better than the cheap nylon zipper cases that provide little protection. I've had driver shafts broken before, and it seems this won't happen with the SKB hardshell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golf Travel Case","review":"This travel case is well made, has rollers to help you through the airport, and has an approved lock to help you through baggage security. if you have a large golf bag, it may not fit. The only negative for me is the weight. Nonetheless, it's well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Club Protection Ever","review":"Have used other products but this is by far the best.

The first time I shipped this bag, my clubs were temporarily lost because the handle used when rolling the cart was ripped off. The packing info had been attached to the handle and was lost in shipping. What a nightmare. Based on the reviews, I decided to purchase this particular travel bag. It may have been a fluke, but beware....the handle is obviously not durable enough to handle long distance shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your clubs can still break.","review":"Upon buying this from Amazon, I hopped on a US Airways flight to Myrtle Beach.

Whether it's the airline, TSA, or the case - I wouldn't spend the money again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid case, need a small bag","review":"Purchased because I wanted some extra protection from airline baggage. This is a very solid case, used for about 6 flights (12 segments) with zero issues.It does appear to be larger in the image than it is. The expanded bottom makes it look like it could fit a cart bag, but I doubt it would. I have an Ogio stand bag that is medium size, and it barely fits... as in I have to apply significant pressure to the case to get it to buckle. Often when I get it, a strap will be sticking out and then I know that the TSA paper will be in there. Even with that issue though, the hinges and buckles are holding strong.It also barely fits a 48\\" driver, leaving it in the bag, I have to push it into the foam on top a bit.If you have smaller travel bag, are primarily concerned with protection, and nothing longer than 48\\" (a long putter won't fit), this is a solid case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small for standard CART bag","review":"I read all the review before ordering. All I can say is most of these folks must have some really, really small cart bags. I tried my wife's bag, my bag, an old and very small cart bag I had. I could not even get them in with every pocket empty. Only our lightweight stand bag would fit.

I was dazzled by the exhibit in San Francisco, but now I'm especially glad to have the accompanying book. I rarely find it worthwhile to purchase museum exhibit catalogues, but what I love about \\"Stranger Passing\\" is that I can ponder a given image as long as I like, \\"reading and re-reading\\" it as I would a really good short story. Indeed, many of these portraits seem as laden with interpretive possibilities as a story by Chekhov or Alice Munro or T. C. Boyle. From a grizzled woman selling papers in the middle of a Colorado boulevard, to a solitary New York banker having dinner, his aloneness matched by a single tulip in front of his little bistro table: I found myself deeply moved by the lavish yet subtle artistry Sternfeld has bestowed on these people and places--each one unique yet somehow familiar--that he encountered in this strange and wonderful country of ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"redefining \\"landscape\\" photography","review":"Joel Sternfeld travels the roads of America, and takes pictures with his large-format camera. Although all his pictures include people in various situations (attending a party, selling coffee, hanging out in their own homes, vacationing, promenading, relaxing, observing, working), what he is really interested in, is the depiction of landscapes and soft outplay of the mid-afternoon light. There is an overwhelming sense of loneliness. His composition style is superb; his depiction of quality of light reflections of the industrial surfaces is without precedence. In my opinion, Sternfeld really stands on its own. Not since Robert Frank's \\"The Americans\\" have I seen such a collection. His compositions are best reminiscent of Philip-Lorca diCorcia's; but somehow people are not the center of attention (and sometimes not even of focus), what is important is the quality of landscapes and how they shape human lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangers Passing","review":"I have the original of this book and was hesitant about owning this version, but once it arrived there was no buyers remorse. The printing and editing are much better. The cover photo shows where photographers like Alec Soth derive their inspiration from. So good to have these classic reprints done in such fine form.

Not much of a bargain after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRUCIAL PIECE OF GAY HISTORY","review":"The person who complained about the small print doens't realize that the original copies of this magazine WERE about 8.5 x 6.5--it was digest sized. This 3-volume compendium actually reprints EVERY issue of this magazine, the first overtly homoerotic of the \\"bodybuilding\\" magazines published almost exclusively for gay men, and spurring gay male magazines into (increasingly explicit) existence. The only bad thing is that all the art work on the packaging is Tom Of Finland-type illustrations, which don't relect the contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"Eh, another you get what you pay for. Morticing bits can easily go $150, this was what, $20. So yeah I cheaped out on it. The steel is really soft . Dulls easily, but sharpens easily as well so that's a plus. I have a Powermatic Morticer and it does not fit the bushings as snggly as the Jet and Poermatic bits, go figure they are the same manufacturer.....

The fact is, these demos are almost exactly the same as the studio recordings, minus a little audio fidelity. But the first Shoes album, \\"Black Vinyl Shoes\\" was a superb 4-track demo, so the fact that Shoes makes great sounding demos is no surprise. Potential buyers should just be aware that there is very little new here. Every arrangement, guitar fill, and vocal is the same as on the released albums. I should note there are a few unrealeased songs on here and they do live up to the Shoe's high standard of songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and easy to use!","review":"I love sharing this book with fellow teachers.

I think 15$ will be fair price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I bought this blanket in 2005 for my son (in blue of course). It worked like a charm for him. He used it until he was 5 months old. I just didn't use the foot part once he got too long for it. I bought it again fir my now 5 week old daughter. She will cry and cry until I wrap her in this blanket. Once I wrap her, she immediately calms down. I bought two more since she never wants to be out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"This swaddling blanket was truly a miracle for us! I only regret that I did not try it until she was 6 weeks old. With this blanket, my daughter would sleep for 8-10 hour stretches - it was wonderful! We tried swaddling with regular receiving blankets, but she would always get out of those. Swaddling in this blanket made her calm and relaxed and helped us all to get some much-needed sleep. I recommend this to every mom I know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the miracle I was hoping for","review":"My daughter, at 12 weeks, was able to totally unswaddle herself using the swaddleme that we had been using since birth, yet she still needed to be swaddled to fall asleep. She can't seem to calm down without being swaddled and she claws at her face which wakes her up. Everyone I knew told me to get the miracle blanket and it would solve all my problems. Maybe if we had used this from birth she would have been okay with it. But, she hated having her arms tucked under the folds, screamed like crazy, and even though they were tucked under, she was still able to bring them up and out of the blanket, with the folds still around them. It didn't take her long to get out of this blanket. So we got one hour out of it. We switched to the Halo that she can move her arms around in but still can't get them up out of the fabric to her face."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby HATES this straight jacket","review":"This may work for other babies but my little girl screamed bloody murder when I put it on her.

After the first week or so we stopped swaddling with receiving blankets & just used a sleepsack. Now for some reason we were really lucky & our baby has always slept well from the first night on. We started swaddling her again when it seemed to be difficult to get our baby to go to sleep (once she was asleep she was great for a long time), but the receiving blankets are too small & she'd bust out. This was recommended to me by a mom I met at Babies R Us. It is the best! It is the softest cotton -- lightweight but still warm. Also no velcro, snaps or other additions... After a while it's so easy to wrap her up -- I could do it in my sleep. My favorite part is the morning (after she's slept the entire night) & I unwrap her & she slowly stretches her arms above her head & smiles :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally she sleeps!","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter who had not slept more than an hour at a time since birth.

About the only thing I can praise is the cinematography, which is so outstanding it even shines through on an old VHS tape. Few movies have ever brought bayou scenery to life like this.If I ever watch it again, however, I'll do so with the volume off! The movie is inane, insulting, and cliched. As a LA native myself, I don't see how anyone can call this film \\"realistic\\". Come on! The inbred, mentally-challenged brother? The sexy teen itching to stir up trouble? The nutty bayou widow with the bad fake teeth? The brother who stays permanently locked in the shed? The poor whiny wife whose husband rules with an iron fist? The fish-out-of-water visitors who shine a light on this whole swampy dysfunctional clan??? About the only cliche this movie lacked was a deadly alligator scene.Too bad an alligator didn't eat the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring to the extreme","review":"It gives a dark feeling of a typical Soviet movie.

This book provides an intelligent, engaging and enjoyable perspective of reading, writing and understanding literature. What makes this book captivating is the personal tone of the book, it really has a unique approach to teaching literature and it's very lively copy. Captivating literature choices!!! I really enjoy this book, it not only teaches about literature, it also touches on the life around us and how we interact with that world.

It seems that Freeman had something against ESPN with little to prove.ESPN: An Uncensored History is a tiring read. It doesn't flow and it is full of the writer's slant and opinion, shaping unsubstantiated rumors into a very leaky case. Freeman would be better served writing an article with some of the allegations that have been made, rather than trying to stretch a few innuenedos into an otherwise boring book.Also, it was too full of locker-room banter and crude jokes that he supposedly found. Why couldn't have just told the narrative about the rapid rise of this gigantic sports network?This is a bad piece of investigative work. Don't waste your time with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad, but too much sexual harassment angle","review":"I think Freeman's book is a good history of how ESPN became the media giant that it is (I was born in 1982-- i cant imagine life without ESPN), but the book focused WAY too much on the sexual harassment angle, and it bogs down the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much emphasis on the sexual harassment angle","review":"I am a fan of ESPN and enjoyed learning about the history of the company (channel, network, whatever you want to call it). I particularly enjoyed the first quarter of the book that focused on the original entrepeneur that started the network. However, after that I thought the author focused too much on the bad parts of the history, particularly the sexual harassment incidents. While these seem very serious and should have been mentioned, I don't think they should have overshadowed everything else in the company's history in the last decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the author actually check facts?","review":"How much of ESPN's history can Freeman botch and still publish a book?

Goodman's story-telling balances well between the larger-than-life characters of history and legend, and the human decisions, romance and tragedy behind them.At its heart this book is simply a fantastic story. From lighting striking the Grand Master's sword, to Rhodes' 40-foot-thick walls swallowing cannon balls - again and again I found myself amazed, asking, \\"This really happened?\\" Goodman's writing shows an appreciation of this, an eagerness to tell the story with all its thrills, all its surprises and all its dark moments.The research is superb, with dazzling historical detail. My knowledge of the siege of Rhodes and the cultures surrounding it was very limited, but Goodman's detail paints a vivid and consistently gripping picture.This book is very successful at being both a dark historical exploration and a rousing adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"I was hoping for a good historical novel about an event that had great inpact on the history of the region.

I'm taking time to really discover how I feel about my beliefs around why I'm here, my support system, developing understanding as a new approach to forgiveness, and do I think that one part of my life has to be sacrificed in order that other areas may shine - some of the many extraordinary topics that the author raises.

Written in a clear, concise style, the book is an easy reference to determining IF you are seeing child abuse symptoms, and HOW to deal with the situation if child abuse is present. Written by an M.D., the author is well qualified to show examples of \\"abuse\\" wounds versus regular scrapes and bruises a child would suffer. There are excellent drawings to illustrate those areas of the body which would show physical or sexual abuse. Not only is this an excellent reference for detecting abuse, this book gives the reader good advice on how to deal with the situation, who to contact, how to verify what you are suspecting, etc. I found this book to be the best reference document yet on understanding this most sensitive subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creature Cantina","review":"I just bought this playset, which is over 10 years old, and I think it's great, especially since it's pretty much thick paper and not plastic. I put the current Hasbro cantina action figures on it, instead of the old Power of the Force ones. It's a little trying to assemble it at first, but once you manage to get it together it's actually pretty cool. I think a little kid would really like this, though I may be wrong. It also has instructions for folding it back up and putting it back into it's box, though I imagine folding and unfolding over time would ruin it. Still great playset.

Well the first of the trilogy is more a sad drama (Caroline is VERY good in it)and I did not find any humor. The daughter who wanted to be a son was in no way a comedic plot. The second story with Clunes was, again, a drama and quite interesting. Not much was funny. The final part of the trilogy was indeed funny - although I was a bit put off by the picture on the cover. It worked, it fit the storyline and the acting was good and quite humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"Trois 2 is nothing like the original. The plot is totally unbelievable and silly. It is NOT about a three-some either! The acting is stale or over done as in the case of TAMMY. OK even though the \\"romantic\\" sences are pretty good, they can't make up for the stupid plot. It has an aire of EYES WIDE SHUT, but can't pull it off. The best thing about it is TYSON'S buff body. If you MUST see this move, see it for that alone and he isn't on for long. Over all I was dissapointed. Trois (1) was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not give it to my child","review":"I bought this book to give to my Latina foster child who is 12 years old, hoping to encourage her to read. I had heard an interview with the author on NPR and thought this would be a good way for her to connect to literature. Luckily, I picked it up and read (most of) it. It is well written and pretty engaging. A turning point in the book is when the main character, a 14 year old, goes to a party with the \\"popular\\" kids and takes shots of tequila. That's not something I want to condone. There were no consequences for the drinking (except for a brief mention of getting sick on the sidewalk), the conflict was just with the popular kids and their \\"mean\\" attitude and who real friends were. Important, to be sure, but I just don't want to romanticize the alcohol aspect any more than it already is. If you aren't concerned about your child drinking or avoiding drink, it's a good story about family relationships and friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"This book was not as good as I hoped and expected.

I thought that he was basically evil with no soul or spirituality in him at all.I can only imagine that the Nobel Prize was given to him for his 'heroic' writing during the Chinese repression of intellectuals. Another case of Political Correctness over talent. I am left to wonder who didnt win the Nobel prize that year.

In nutshell it seems that the book itself has a soul, and you are face to face with her.If you have not been to villages, moving among high rise scrappers, concrete jungle, wants to know about the basic human nature, wish to roam in the scenic beauties, wish to be in nature's lap , I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book because it did inspired me.","review":"I like this book because it did inspired me. It showed other dimensions of the world. It recorded the feeling and lives of different characters. It's not about good or evil people and happy or bad ending. Life is much more complicated than Hollywood movies.The reasons that some readers may not get it are:1. The English translation.It has to do with English itself. Many slang and sayings cannot be translated directly. Comparing to Chinese, English has shorter history and less vocabulary. There are many sayings are hard to understand without the knowledge of the native culture and history. No matter how good the translator is, the flavor will lose greatly. Unfortunately, It happened to every English translated Chinese book.2. Few people can climb the high mountain.Few people can resonate with Einstein.

I began reading this book with such high hopes. I carefully read the glowing reviews and the introduction. After the purchase, it was a quick slide downhill. Despite my patience with the book and the seemingly acclaimed author & playwrite, I found myself dreading my trek on Soul Mountain. I scratch my head in confusion each time I look at the front cover imprint for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Was this the result of a bad press run? The book sits on my bookshelf as a reminder that you can't always judge a book by its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different.","review":"...But just because it is different doesn't necessarily mean it's good. There is a thin line between revolutionary fiction (as the author describes his work, in his own novel) and absolute crap. While it may be harsh to say it is the latter, it's certainly very far from the former. It seemed more like a personal diary than a cohesive novel. Dense reading? I agree it was difficult read but you surely do not have to go any slower while reading the book because seriously, you won't be missing much if you didn't. You could pretty much skip pages and pages, and even chapters, of random insignificant encounters and countless dull descriptions of the environments without losing anything if you read every page.Different? Yes. Revolutionary, I strongly disagree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Wanderings of Goa Xingjian","review":"If you've ever felt like grabbing your pack and disappearing into the mountains, then this is for you.Xingjian is a rare breed of photographer, painter, poet and writer who manages to combine his talents to create a classic.Having wandered the mountains of Japan myself, I often tried to jot down my thoughts as I went. A task better left to Goa Xingjian - the master."},{"rating":"1","title":"A laborious journey, with no end in sight","review":"Having seen the glowing reviews and the \\"Nobel Prize\\" stamp on the book cover, I wasn't necessarily expecting an easy read, but a rewarding one. About a third of the way through, I am finding this book nearly unreadable. Much has been made of the different narrative voices used, and indeed the \\"I\\" and \\"You\\" perspectives invite the reader to experience the author's journey in different ways. Unfortunately, the author saddles \\"You\\" with a very annoying companion in the form of \\"She,\\" and has \\"You\\" tell her stories that I assume are adaptations of Chinese folk tales, but don't resonate much with this American reader. I give the book 2 stars instead of 1 because some of the \\"I\\" narrator's experiences are fairly interesting if overly repetitive, and because I suspect that some of my difficulty with the book stems from my own unfamiliarity with Chinese culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very badly translated","review":"I'm an Overseas Chinese and reading this book in English just seemed so weird because the ideas and style in which he writes is very very Chinese. The translator doesn't even stop (or footnote) in order to truely differenciate say between the use of 'Lao Gong' as opposed to 'Zhang Fu'. They mean the same thing (husband) but the subtle differences make a hell lot in such a poetic book. My conclusion is that it's a really badly translated book where all the magic is lost. I can't imagine a non-Chinese person reading it and truely getting the full impact of it. I just hope the Nobel organization did not award him the prize based on this book or translations of such poor quality. Otherwise I can't help but question if it was all just a matter of \\"First Chinese to win the Nobel literature prize\\" card that was behind the decision. Skip this book, you're better off with Nien Cheng"},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey of one's mind written with subtle religious tenor","review":"I read the Chinese version first and found much was lost in English translation. I think Soul Mountain could have been used by the author as a metaphore for the purest unpolluted conscience in everyone's heart because of this old Chinese saying \\"ren ren you ge ling shan ta\\". According to Zen teaching, the more eager one tries to grasp it, the more it eludes one's reach. Soul Mountain remains as one of my favorite books for it was so beautifully written in such a subtle, enigmatic, philosophical, and thought-provoking style. -- Xingzi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Style Yet Disappointing Content","review":"Although this is considered one of the author's best volumes, I was rather disappointed at the lack of literary quality that the book offers. The style used becomes better and better as one advances through the book, yet there are few passages which can be deemed to contain truly remarkable prose. The reader can find it useful, however, to read \\"Soul Mountain\\" because an interesting overview of everyday-life people dealing with the problems of Communism is given. Considering that I was born in and lived in a communist country for a while, I found it relevant to compare some of the social phenomena related to Chinese Communism to those encountered in Europe in the 1980s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this book backwards.","review":"When long novels have a reputation for telling a good story in a compelling way, I allow the first 100 pages to engage me (Shipping News, Remains of the Day). After 250 labored pages in Soul Mountain and increasing annoyance with the author, I decided to read the last chapter in hopes of finding a finite ending or a clue that would tell me I had missed something of import in the intervening pages. I found neither. However, the novelty of reading a book backwards amused me so I read as far as the famous Chapter 72 (or was it 74?) in which a critic decries the writings as \\"not a novel at all,\\" and proceeds to describe the book's many shortcomings. Finding myself in complete agreement, I happily closed the cover. Reading all the glowing reviews posted here has not changed my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one needs Cliff Notes","review":"I thought it was a joke when I found there were Cliff Notes for \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" a wonderful book.

It is what the philosophical implication of the work that baffles me, and probably, many. Instead of being a novel, Soul Mountain reads as if it is made up of 80 short stories (the book is divided into 80 chapters). Call it diary or freelance essays, the chapters don't seem to have apparent connection with one another. I do not quite understand the implications of \\"I\\" and \\"you\\" used throughout the work. It seems to me that \\"you\\" is actually the reflection of \\"I\\". \\"You\\" and \\"I\\" are used in alternating fashion throughout the book. The authorial self is thus (I guess) divided into first-person and second-person perspectives. It seems that the author reflects on his actual trip when he uses \\"You\\". Again I might have to re-read and find the answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work","review":"A man travels the length and breadth of China, collecting stories, folk songs, lovers and experience in a search for meaning.

This translation was not the one the Nobel prize judges read, I'm sure.I would not know where to start with the numerous frustrating issues of the translation. Written in the second person, part of the time and slipping back to first person or a combination of first and third person at other times for the sake of dialog. I tried to read it but it was just too confusing. I kept trying not to be distracted by the poor choice of words and the ambiguous sentence structure but it is all too tedious.

The story begin with the actual attack and goes chronologically through the rest of the night, setting the stage for the rest of the book, including a vivid description of the Seward slashings, until the death of Lincoln. The book then covers the part of the story that takes place builing up to the event and then follows with the manhunts and trials aferwards. It is a thorough and well-told tale with the author providing all the facts in a very informative and entertaining fashion. He clears up many misconceptions while leaving some issues a little cloudier, based upon surviving evidence (such as the true involvement of Mrs. Surratt).

I must agree with the other reviews. After reviewing the first chapter, I found the following issues:1) Simple proof reading errors that should have been caught, both in the examples and chapter problems.2) Inconsistent answer solution detail - some are very detailed (great), while others choose to skip some steps.For example: Chapter 8 - Fuels and Combustion, has virtually no structure in the solutions to the examples. It is almost as if the author is verbally explaining the solution, and a person is writing it down as they go.I hope the 8th Edition has addressed these issues, but I personally do not want to evaluate. In any event, one should NOT use this package as the sole resource. The MERM by M. Lindeburg, and MGI PE Readiness program should be used first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Do not buy!","review":"Just what the other reviews said. I had problems finding the ME reference book, so I bought this one instead because it was endorsed by ASME.

They aren't just mispelled words but wrong numbers used in the equations and miscalculated equations. It has made studying confusing.

They also do strange things like typing \\"3.2174 x 10\\" to represent gravity.I bought the book from ASME's website and have emailed them complaining about the quality.If this book were proof-read and all the errors corrected I would rate it 3 or 4 stars.One good thing I can say about it is that I have gleaned some understanding and useful equations (but it's difficult to trust after seeing all the typos).Buy this book only if you have bought everything else out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine film ruined by dreadful print","review":"What a disappointment this pressing of Ken Russell's wonderful movie this is.

Wayside School was mixed up the day it was built, the school was supposed to be one story high with thirty classrooms in a row. Instead it was built thirty stories high with one classroom on each floor. Each chapter tells a story about each child in the class on the thirtieth floor. They are all hilarious and weird like the time that their teacher turned into an apple. I would recommend it for ages seven and up.Louis Sachar writes very well because he gives a lot of description, and every chapter has a little twist to it. The genre is definitely fiction because none of these events could happen in real life.There are also two sequels called, Wayside School is Falling Down, and Wayside School gets a Little Stranger.

Nothing against Mr. McCauley's illustrations, but I was looking for the version I remember reading as a child with Julie Brinklow's illustrations.

To be more specific, they are the stories of the students and staff of the school. These stories are way weird.I think this book is a great book for people of all ages, especially younger kids. Kids see this book as 30 fun stories that are simple to read. On the other hand, boys (teens), by that age, are less interested in the plot then what it hides. For example, in Sideways Stories, most stories are somewhat twisted but have simple and very important morals. Adults would also like this book for the good morals but would most likely look to more difficult books for this kind of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool stories","review":"I thought the book was very funny and cool.

Occasionally, I've had the Spearmint taste just a little rancid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but system doesn't work well","review":"Well, I enjoyed the book immensely, and liked the author's concept of the Directional Day Filter. Anyway, he bases his entire system on breakouts against the trend. Using my live market feed, I automated his rules to a letter via a homegrown app, and my losses mounted by the day. I implemented his definition of Support and Resistance, and whenever I broke through these levels, and the appropriate stochastic indicators indicated that I buy or sell, I would buy or sell short appropriately, and the stock would invariably reverse shortly thereafter. His mechanism was not reliable at all. To the contrary, you can get some good info from his book, and trade of support and resistance levels by themselves, reversing position when these respective levels are hit. This makes entirely more sense, and will allow you to profit consistently, contrary to what the author stipulates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't you read the signs?","review":"This book is the best I've read out of 20 since Janurary 1st.Mr.Clayburgh starts you out with the very basics, (you might say training wheels) and stays along side of you to the very end....Chapter 8 explains the most important concepts you must throughly understand to be successful with his system. Absolutely no guesswork! I think he has raised the standard in writing abouttrading systems. I gladly await any new material he delivers in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good TA book that reaches beyond TA","review":"Unlike most other TA books that only go into details of certain TA tools, the author tried to post the big picture of TA tools as means of creating effective trading strategies that lead to his so called high probability trades. Adopting a step by step approach, he first outlined and explained a number of TA methods, and then reduced these methods to the four steps of trading success he promoted, which are:-1. Determine the major trend of the day2. Determine the minor trend of the day3. Define an exact entry point4. Determine an exit strategyIn my opinion, this book is really helpful and easy to understand. There is plenty of 1-min graphs elaborating the author’s ideas, primarily for stock day trading. Though the prinicples are quite applicable also for longer term trading, I hope that the author will write another book for those position traders like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"signals don't work","review":"I agree with the writer who programmed Clayburg's signals into his software; the idea of entering a long position in the countertrend simply doesn't work most of the time.

All of the issues are in here: all the various protocols/support programs related to TCP/IP for both Windows and Unix/Linux. And a lot of it is written in the famous light-hearted dummies-style that keeps the book relatively easy going.What irks me is the organization of the book. Some of it is VERY basic (explaining client/server for example). In contrast, other parts go into fine detail, containing exhaustive lists for example. Overall the book left a somewhat unorganized impression, a bit of a gathering of loosely connected issues in no particular order. For me, this made it diffcult to \\"digest\\" the book and remember the info in it.In summary, if you are looking for a book that will allow a beginner to look up some of the jargon, this book is not a bad choice. For an introductory or advanced textbook, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Book","review":"For the beginner or the person who needs a good introduction to IP networking, the book provides some solid fundamentals.

The exam cram for TCP/IP was useful for their practice exams, but this book did the best job of laying out the material in an understandable way.I didn't really know much about TCP/IP until I read this book. It helped me study for and pass the Microsoft Exam the best. Although practice questions really helped the most. For me to get a good understanding and grasp of TCP/IP this book made it happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make peace with TCP/IP","review":"The explanations are well structured.

We've tried the raspberry and citrus flavors. Both are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading this book is fun","review":"You'd better be somewhat geek to get the language of this book. It's a fun book. If you are in the IT industry and have affinity for open source and Linux you'd better be reading this book. One thing I did not like is although I *know* Linus is not such a person to *act* as a hero, he is presented to be so. If the book was named ...accidental hero rather than ...accidental revolutionary, I'd not be buying it I guess. But it made me feel a bit like than. Other than that, a very fun book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Linux biography","review":"Just for Fun is a book that chronicles Linus's life and the birth of Linux. Along the way, it presents a fascinating look at the forces that led to the creation of Linux, the controversies, the proponents, and the opponents. For those who want to understand the unlikely hero who created a freely available open source operating system, this book is enlightening, inspiring, and informative.My only criticisms about the book are due primarily to Dave Diamond's contributions, which thankfully, are minimal. Dave pretty much interjects his own italicized dialog with Linus, in a car, in a sauna, which detracts from the otherwise amazing story, but probably highlights the making of the book.Luckily 90 percent of the book was written by Linus; Linus comes across as he is known to be-- direct, honest, and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for Fun : The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary","review":"A fun book with lots of tongue in cheek, self-defacing, humor. If you want to learn more about Linux skip this one. If you are just Linus groupie and want to know everything about him then this is a great book for you. It is Linus' view on life, the universe, and everything. He starts the book learning to code on his grandfather's lap with a Commodore Vic-20 all the way to buying his new BMW and moving into his new million-dollar house. Great for a rainy day when the power goes out and you can't use your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linus is god and this is his bible!","review":"This book is really great. It's full of funny stories about Linus life, and has a complete history of the early days of Linux. It's even better for me, being both scandinavian and nerdish. A very inspiring book about Linus, Linux and open source.And I mean, who can't love a guy that opens a speech with \\"I am your god.\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scandinavia and California","review":"Like Linus, I grew up in Scandinavia and can easily identify with his childhood. I too as a programmer later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in California. And yup, life has to be lived for the fun of it. I may not always agree with him, for instance about the survival, social order and entertainment stuff that he before his book talked about at UC Berkeley a year and a half or so earlier. But I can certainly recommend the book. It's not just about computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linus Gets On His Soap Box!","review":"Overall I thought this book was a pretty good read. I really recomend this book for those who have yet to delve into the world of Linus Torvalds.For the most part the book is pretty autobiographical, you get some fun tid bits about his life and whatnot; however, a good portion of this book uses some pretty technical langauge, that for the reader who may not be to familiar with basic computer science issues may get lost in the book (Linus suggests for the reader who is not that savy with programming to skip that portion of the book, but that's probably the best part of the book).I think the big flaw of the book is that towards the end it just turns into one big rant... it is fun to read Linus' views on \\"open source\\" which are a bit surprizing.All and all, I'll recomend this to anyone who frequents slashdot."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting and annoying at the same time","review":"Frankly speaking, I'm usually too lazy for writing reviews.Because I was so disappointed by the book, I write one now.The good aspect of the book is that one gets a glimpse of what kind of guy Linus Torvalds is. That's quite interesting - since his regarded as being a kind of superstar.The bad aspect (for me) is that this guy's arrogance and overestimation of his merits is so annoying.The book delivers what you might expect in a biography about a 34 year old operating-system-programming-know-it-all ... but not more."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much as I like Linus...","review":"This book is hastily written and poorly crafted. You may find useful information or get a good feeling for who Linus is, but this is not great literature by any stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"this book has been one the best books i have ever read. it took me exactly where Linus had gone and I could see what he has been thorugh.

I never really understood the thinkings behind open source untill I read this book. This is a great book for those interested in the other side of technology business that is not driven by pure greed. I give it 4 stars because I don't think it might appeal to non technical people. Other than that, it's worth the money. The best lesson I learned from this book is never go for predictable success and lose the chance to achieve really really big sucess. Linux definitely has the potential to be bigger than Windows"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed reading it","review":"Nice reading, several good ideas.Mr. Torvalds deserves what he got.I just hope to use some day Fredix or Diannix OS.Jag gör det!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can i get my money back ?","review":"If you are a Linux user then you probably know everything in this book. very shallow and Linus spends the first part of the book talking how poor he is and the second part about how rich he is. he meets his wife and he goes from meeting to moving in w/ her in a paragraph, meetings w/ computer greats take one or two sentances. no insights and behind the scenes talk from the Linux world. does he like Alan Cox ? Caldera ? what about the new kernal ? why did he release it when he did ? was the work too much for him ? all in all very dissapointed in Linus for putting out such a poor book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely there's more","review":"I have to agree with the less flattering reviews. A well thought out search of some newsgroup and mailing list archives would yield pretty much the same or comparable results. Not that this book is wihtout value - it just would make more sense as an inexpensive paperback to read as a collection of anecdotes while on smoke breaks or something. Sadder still, I've seen enough Linus interviews, public speaking engagements, etc to believe he is a charming and genuinely interesting character, easily capable of populating 6 or 700 pages of a \\"Memoirs so far...\\" sort of thing with worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read! Great to know!","review":"Linus has really put on his Linus law on many books including this one. Wanna know what it is? Get the book! It was a fun read on this one, you get to go on a trip with the author and Linus (and his family) from nothing, to coding, to everything on Linux. A good \\"history\\" book but no boring at all, spent a whole weekend finishing this, and ignoring my Linux box...:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"1 track per CD sucks!","review":"This review is for the ones who intend to buy the CD version of this book. It has only one track per CD. In other words, if you are listening it in your car and you want to eject the CD in the middle of the story to listen to some music, you will have to start it over from the very beggining of the CD. Other than that the story is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, but nothing new","review":"I read the excellent \\"Rebel Code\\" and thought that reading \\"Just for Fun\\" would be a nice idea, to know more about Linux and its author through his own words. The problem is that Linus and the journalist who helped him failed to make the book interesting, so it becomes a sequence of chapters like \\"yeah I needed a new driver for my modem, so...well I did it\\"In one page he's doing Linux version 0.01 alone in his bedroom in Helsinki, 15 pages later he's talking about having 10 million users, and leaves no clue HOW it happened, or who was involved (guys like Dave Miller and Alan Cox, so important to the Linux community, didn't get one single mention)So if you want to really understand not only WHAT happened but HOW it happened, I recommend \\"Rebel Code\\" instead. And it covers not only Linux, but the whole open-source movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting reading","review":"I bought this book for my 12-year-old son, who requested it and he is a kid who NEVER reads. It's like pulling teeth getting him to read, but even though this book is certainly written at an adult reading level, it captivated him. We were in Paris and he brought the book along...instead of taking in the sights, he was walking along the banks of the Seine with his nose buried in this book. Unfortunately he lost it on the plane ride home, but requested another copy for his birthday so we've now bought it twice. Can't imagine a better recommendation for a book than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Fiction","review":"An interesting look at an archetypal geek, amd a man who isn't in it for the money, fame, or power, just wanting to have software that did want he wanted it to do.

Not possible with this one.This book started as a great telling of history. The author really got to know Linus well and I feel he presented Linus as he really is ... the good, the not so good, the learning experiences. It was really nice to hear the history of Linux.

Beryl and this Astanga class are motivating and inspirational. I have studied yoga off and on over the years and cannot get to a class very often.

It is clear that she is an expert and really understands the body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced students","review":"I've been doing yoga on and off for years (mostly during the winter). Every year I seem to be getting more advanced and was having trouble finding more advanced videos that I like. I can't get into Yodney Yee as many DVD's as I have. His style is a bit to rigid and seems just physical. I love Bryan Kest and have recommended that one to many of my friends who just love his DVD (the Power Yoga one). Both guys and girls love Bryan Kest, even beginners and friends who teach yoga as well. Beryl Bender Birch's DVD is awesome as well. The style is very similar to Bryan Kest, but she does sun salutations really fast (for warming up the body) and her asanas are really, really advanced. No music, which I love because I can put on my own music. Her voice and words are matter of fact, no trying to sooth you, which is fine when you are concentrating on your form.After going through so many DVD instructors, I really find her to be the best for advanced students. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Label your product","review":"I am very frustrated with this purchase. NOWHERE on the cover does it even state that this video is not for beginners, and after reading the reviews by others on this website, it obviously is only for the very advanced. The back of the dvd box reads \\"The students on-screen, ranging widely in age and ability, demonstrate modifications\\" ...... LIES!!! To repeat... At least MENTION IT IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. Now I am stuck with the purchase. Oh yea, the claim \\"with detailed explanations\\" is a JOKE. Just read the other reviews. Summary- purposely concealed the intended audience to increase sales to unsuspecting consumers. An HONEST description would have been the ETHICAL way to go about promotion of her product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but impractical","review":"I found most of the positions impossible. It was interesting to see a woman of BBB's age able to do the positions, and also the people in her class; but I don't think the tape is practical for any but those very advance in yoga - or double-jointed spiders. She also says in the tape, it's meant to be used in conjunction with her book. This must be so, because she isn't clear at all in what you are to do, except for spurting out the Indian lingo for positions, and she assumes you already know what they are. If you can do her tape, you'd be making your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the EXTREMELY flexible only","review":"I have been taking yoga classes for almost two years now, and this is the only tape I have ever purchased that is too difficult for me.

With all my other DVD tapes I can follow the workout without having to look over at the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something else! I am so glad I got this.","review":"I have seen the expertly performed Ashtanga primary series videos of Richard Freeman and Doug Swenson. The modified ashtanga videos of Baron Baptiste (I like the music also)and White Lotus Total Yoga - Fire are good. The beautiful videos of Shiva Rea and Ali McGraw are inspiring, especially on days you feel lazy. Some of my yoga teachers have been Bob Smith and Marie Svoboda (his teacher) and Robin Rothenberg until she moved to Fall City and Issaquah to open the Yoga Barn. I have had other yoga teachers and have many videos over the years. I knew I could not do the Ashtanga Primary series but this video shows how to modify and make progress. Very good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast, No backbends","review":"I do not recommend this DVD. I consider myself pretty experienced and I enjoy more challenging workouts (Brian Kest, Eion Finn). This workout goes too far though. She moves so quickly between poses that I find myself becoming stressed out trying to keep up! That is certainly not what I want from my yoga practice. I found it really ironic that several times during the workout she actually preaches &quot;Don't rush&quot;. Ha, that is exactly what she is doing, and unless you rush, you can't keep up with her. There are no backbends such as camel or bow so at the end of the workout you feel unbalanced because your hamstrings are really streched but your front side is still tight. I've tried doing this workout many times just thinking that I needed to improve my attitude or try harder but I've finally given up. I don't think I will ever enjoy this and I doubt many others will either."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for beginners","review":"I have been practicing yoga for only a few months. I am definitely a beginner. I enjoy doing this DVD, because for me it is extremely challenging. However, if you don't have much experience, you may feel a bit inadequate. The students seem to know which poses to do before the instructor even says them. I, on the other hand, had to look at the tv often to see what exactly they were doing, and that made it difficult to keep up. Plus, at 75 minutes, it may be a bit long for someone who is not already well conditioned.If you definitely want to be challenged, and won't mind watching a room full of people doing things to a much higher level than you can do, then purchase this DVD.Beryl is a wonderful teacher, and I'm sure that if you have the patience to keep doing the practice, you will do things you never thought were possible with your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ashtanga primary series","review":"Yes, it is the ashtanga primary series in its entirety. No, there is not a lot of instruction.If you want instruction on yoga poses, look elsewhere, like Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti.

With all this talent, much might be expected. But everyone is just going through the motions. The two principals are incredibly listless (as though they kept thinking \\"Why on earth am I in this movie?\\"); only Renee Zellweger has any energy, in a dramatically unrewarding part.

The ending was also not the usual Hollywood happy ending, which I found refreshing if not a little depressing. If you feel like a quiet, slow paced movie then by all means rent this.

Jude Law had about a dozen lines to say and the rest of the time he spent looking anguished. Oh, but he DID walk a long way I guess. I would probably look anguished, too.

She can't help but notice a young man named Inman (played by Jude Law) but he is shy and they hardly exchange a word. When the Civil War is declared, Inman goes with the rest of the men to fight, but before he leaves he and Kidman share a kiss which foreshadows a romantic relationship. He leaves and the rest of the movie flahses back and forth between scenes of him fighting and then deserting the army and she trying to survive on the farm after her father dies. Renee Zellweger plays a young woman who can work like a man and she helps teach Kidman how to do the same. Zellweger is outstanding in her role as Kidman's feisty sidekick.

Adapted from the book Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier, is a great story. Jude Law leaves his family and friends behind to go to war. With his family's doubts of him coming back of hearing about him on his \\"death bed\\" from wounded from the war. On his journey back to North Carolina's Cold Mountain, he comes accross different people who want to aid and destroy his journey. This is a great film. Jude Law is fantastic in this drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"still disappointing","review":"Perhaps some of your reviewers are not familiar with Homer's Odyssey, on which this movie is based. Cold Mountain tells us little about the Civil War, just as the Odyssey tells us little about the Trojan War (that was in the Iliad, the basis of another recent movie). The parallelism between CM and the Odyssey is lame and stilted, even down to some tacky Sirens! Odysseus finally arrives home to confront his wife's suitors, just as Inman does. The Odyssey tells us little about Odysseus' relation to his wife, so it is hardly surprising that the relationship between Inman and Ada in CM is a blank. It may have seemed a good idea to turn the Odyssey into CM; but the result is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"TORTURE","review":"I can't believe I wasted 154 minutes of my life watching this horrible movie!

One more note to filmmakers: you do not need to keep Nicole Kidman in full makeup and perfectly styled hair when she is supposedly starving."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reflection on our rich past","review":"I like Nichole Kidman and Renee Zellweger so I thought it would be entertaining. The violence was tolerable but when \\"hollywood\\" threw in a disgusting orgy scene, that was too much.

Jude Law was also miscast for the love of Nichole."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moive of Incredible Will","review":"This movie blew me away with its power.

A must own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book, skip the movie!","review":"Charles Frazier's book is a masterpiece and his love of the time and area of the country (Civil War & Blue Ridge/Appalachian Mtns)show on every page. For some inexplicable reason Anthony Minghella chose to change the most basic parts of the novel to fit Hollywood's expectations and pocketbooks. Nicole Kidman shows no emotion, heck she goes thru the entire movie with barely a hair out of place! Renee Zellwenger is better, but I did not see the need to put her in that part when there are so many talented black actresses that could have done as well or better (if you've read the book you will understand). Jude Law is the only main part that comes close to understanding and relating to the novel. Excellent acting. Only a fair movie, very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold-hearted critics","review":"I cannot understand the criticism for this movie. Many have said the love relationship between Ada and Inman was too shallow. I disagree. In a time when cruel war has torn up the countryside, when neither of them has anything or anyone to live for, when the only hope lies in the beauty of Cold Mountain and in the purity of love, why doesn't their passion make sense?Despite the horror and ugliness of the Civil War..historically this was a highly romantic era. I can fully accept that a lonely spinster and poetic young man would be drawn to each other. People have married for less...much less.Many times films and books that later become classics are initally scorned by shortsighted people. I think this film will be a classic..it is that good. Poetry is often misunderstood. This film and the story is in the end poetry... beautiful and profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realism? Huh?","review":"I watched the film and didn't believe a bit of it. Three wildly-beautiful people in a film about the Old South in the Civil War? Nonsense.The actors are too winning to be real- we need ugly ones or at least no-so-good loking ones to be character actors. People like Robert Duvall; not so good looking, but he can act.Mingella loves glamor, loves scope- but this was the wrong subject, wrong time, and definitly the wrong place in history. Stick to the 1950's Jazz scene, Tony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber bayonets and political correctness","review":"This has to be the worst Civil War movie I've ever seen. The bad music and incessant slow-motion during the opening battle scene was downright silly. Plus you can easily spot the prop department's rubber bayonets wobbling as the soldiers are running during the battle scenes. Even the dumbest person knows that bayonets are made of steel and shouldn't wobble. Cold Mountain will probably be a career-ender for it's historical consultants... if there were any.On top of the yahoo Yankees and cornpone Confederates, modern feminist propaganda literally drips from the screen to the point where there is even a faint whiff of lesbianism. And of course the white male is repeatedly stereotyped, from inauthentic southern accents to the vapid facial expressions. If this isn't bad enough certain scenes are downright degenerate and would be more suitable in a softcore porn film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zellweger is fine; but what was Nicole thinking???","review":"Nicole Kidman looks as if she is modeling for some fashion magazine. Her acting is subpar in Anthony Minghella's 'Cold Mountain'. Renee Zellweger is first rate, but is on screen far too little. Jude Law is also fine, but has very little to say, so I didn't really get to know him. When we finally do get to see the payoff, it is predictable and disappointing. Much of the action on screen, though impressive, was far too violent (for violence's sake) and sporadic. The movie was unfocused. Because Minghella failed to introduce his characters properly (even the three leads), I didn't feel for anyone who lived or died, good guys or bad. Donald Sutherland was wasted. It isn't one of the best movies of the year, it's one of the worst. Like Minghella's other films, 'The English Patient' and especially the horrible 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', 'Cold Mountain' left me cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Mountain Review","review":"Dvd was shipped extremely fast and was just as described.

Along the way, he thinks of his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who has fought for sanity and her father's farm's survival while Inman has been gone, even with a brave young drifter named Ruby (Renee Zellweger, in an Oscar-winning performance) there to lend a hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.","review":"The movie is set in the south during the civil war. It showes Ada and Innman meeting and how they awkwardly begin to fall in love. However, the war begins before they really could.When Ada's father dies she is left along with no real skills to speak of, she doesn't even cook. Thankfully, Ruby comes along and helps her get back on her feet and Ada starts to become the woman she really is.While Ada and Ruby are forming a deep friendship, Innman is walking home to her, and running into all sorts of trouble. I won't tell you how this movie ends but I'll say this. You can't help but hold your breath, laugh, and cry. Sometimes all at once.This movie is not so much about the war, (there are very few battle scenes), but more what the war did to people and how they struggled through it. Together and alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this movie","review":"I will not compare this to Gone with the wind, as that would be unfair. I think the story was predictable in places, but some of the supporting cast was superb.

This film is second only to \\"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" as the Best Picture of the Year. Ignore the one star reviewers, because everyone in the sold out theater I was in loved the movie. Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and of course Renee Zellweger are excellent.

My husband and I sat through it hoping that the near-constant scenes of tragedy, brutality and lewdness would be somehow softened by a satisfactory ending... but the last five minutes of the movie dashed those hopes and made the previous 2 1/2 hours a total waste of time.There were moments of humor and tenderness. But the main focus of the movie is not what happens to the characters. The main focus is to drive home to the viewers the tragedy, futility and brutality of war. And the movie's creators drive it home... over... and over.. and over... and over and over again. There is an excellently portrayed battle scene at the beginning which makes that point very well, and they could have then focused on actually telling a fulfilling story, but they didn't.And considering the extremely explicit sex scenes, I can't fathom why this movie wasn't rated NC-17."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"I saw this movie for the first time today and I didn't really care for it. I was bored through most of it and depressed at the end. It was really long, too long..they could have made it shorter with all the parts that mattered.

That is, unless you have insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Melodramatic Tale that Drags on","review":"Cold Mountain did have a great concept but it turned into a melodramatic tale that I was felt went on far too long. The historical details are alright and do paint a roughly accurate portrate of the southern homefront. The unfortunate part is the love story dominates the movie and shows both Jude Law and Nicole Kidman at their worst. The movie went on far longer than most of the audience was interested and the sudden plot twists had no artistic value.If you are interested in the Civil War watch this on video, if you are more interested in romance find something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Mountain - 002-9661097-8220852","review":"Anthony Minghella directs this tale based on the best-selling book about wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) making the long, treacherous journey to his home in Cold Mountain, N.C.

It was not the film that I originally planned to see with my friends, but boy, it was better than anyother. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman gave heartwarming proformances and had onscreen chemistry, however I felt thata Renee Zelweger was the real star of the show, despite not being in a main role and she truly deserved her Oscar. The script was fantasitc, adding humour into the bleakness of the war. My male friends were intregued by the battle sceens, but we tended to warm to the story of the lost love of Ada and Inman.

Compare \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" to \\"Chicago\\" to this and her range is clearly impressive.3) The music is haunting and the cinematography lush.4) The battle scenes have a 'Saving Private Ryan\\" immediacy to them, notably the opening one.A beautifully told tale, which does the source novel proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain too cold for me!","review":"I gave Cold Mountain two stars because of the acting and cinematography.

I know this movie takes place during the civil war and it was a voilent time, but I find it particulary unbearable because of several scenes. I also was disgusted by the sexual suggestions and scenes. I couldn't even sit through it, it was so bad.It might have had a good love story, I mean a man forsaking his soldier days and risking his own life by being a deserter to return to the love of his life, that basis was fine. I'm a Civil War romance lover, I don't mind that.

If you want to know more about the reality of the Civil War watch Gone With The Wind. If it's up to me, I'd give this movie no stars because it gives our troops a bad name.

A \\"transfer\\" is how the picture looks from film to DVD. There are tons of problems with the look of the film, with compression artifacts and such. It looks as bad as a streaming hi-bitrate movie, and while those look OK, it doesnt look well on a DVD. Not at all. Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud!","review":"I love the movie Gettysburg, but couldn't stand this movie. The trailer sold it as a romance between Nicole Kidman's patrician character and Jude Law's humble character, but the movie features violent scene after violent scene. The violence is not on the battlefield, but between those who remain in town and prey on women left on isolated homesteads, and those hunting down deserters from the army to kill them. I wouldn't have minded violent battle scenes, but the rape and torture of townspeople seemed gratuitous. There are better movies out there to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful movie","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out but I decided that I needed to own this film so I also bought it.

The acting is VERY good, I'd say exceptional. I'm fairly easy to please with large-scale, epic-style films, especially romantic ones. When watching this movie, I had the constant feeling that I was \\"missing\\" something, as if I had accidentally skipped the beginning and started in the middle. I didn't get the satisfaction of have a true grip on the history of these characters, and I wanted to see more development of their relationships and to watch it unfold in more detail.

Interesting and haunting film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywoodized American History","review":"Disney could have done a better job. Unbelievable that a movie about the pivotal events in American history wasn't made in America or had an American cast. Civil War reenactors work for free and the real Cold Mountain is in North Carolina. The accents, especially Nicole Kidman's, are atrocious. The script itself was sanitized to make it politically correct (the whole war is about slavery) and Inman is quoted as saying he doesn't believe in the war. (Not in the book) Very poor job. Read the book, skip the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasantly surprised","review":"a surprisingly heartfelt and well-acted (despite the English and Australian leads) film that held my attention until the end. It's bigger on gore than I imagined it would be and is definitely a tear-jerker, as one would expect from a film about the Civil War. It is also filled with humor, love and the struggle of the human spirit.At times it did dip into what I call the \\"Nicholas Sparks\\" sappy factor, but all-in-all it was a strong and enduring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain about us, but not","review":"Horrible. That is the only word I can think of for this movie. If you have read the book, you will be greatly disappointed in this movie. The book was a dynamic tale of the human history/viewpoint of OUR civil war, yet the movie was filmed in Poland, with an Australian actress and an English actor. Jude Law was very good in his part as was Renee Zellwigger (sp.). Unfortunately, these two could not carry the movie. Although I have loved Nicole Kidman in other films, she was pretty lousy in this...no magnetism between her and Jude Law."},{"rating":"1","title":"zellweger nauseates","review":"I had high expectations for this movie and was thoroughly disappointed especially with zellweger's performance (who i usually love)as she was over the top and nauseating with an accent which grated on my nerves. The message throughout the movie of 'war is bad' was repeated about a million times and there was no subtlety. Characters seemed to appear out of nowhere with no explanation and many seemed to have no purpose, I don't know if the book is any better but I have been put off even approaching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right story, wrong movie","review":"Boring.

I am very upset with the reviews I have read here that I see as \\"gotta be a dark movie or it sucks\\" mentality. If you want that type of movie, try an R rating. This movie was never promoted as anything but a Romantic & Action. Why did they expect anything else?For once in many years a romantic movie without explicit sex scenes. For once an action movie without heads rolling and brains across the camera lens. It was a refreshing change from the garbage produced lately. I guess a movie that also shows good values has no value anymore?????????????I saw NO connection to Matrix except maybe tongue & cheek, the motorcycle scene was more a takeoff of Fast & Furious. Why can't a movie be a good movie taken at face value. It was an uplifting movie in the time of terrorism and despair.

Throughout the entire film, the producers had to show every bit of blood. I was expecting a romance about a man trying to get home to his sweetheart in the civil war, but instead got: men coughing and gagging up blood, men swimming through lakes of blood, men frozen to death with blood hardened on their face, and nasty cuts, injuries, shots, and sicknesses.This movie is definetly not suitable for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"THis movie stank!!","review":"It should be rated X in the first place.

I don't remember much of the last 40 minutes or so, but I do know that at about the 1 hour 55 min. mark I started wondering how long this picture was.If you get this film for the Civil War components, don't bother.

From a spoiled young girl of wealth to one who quickly has nothing and has to learn some very tough lessons about survival, she comes through with flying colors.I could feel her pain and the pain of her love who so desperately tries to return to her. Not uncommon, for the bond of true love is strong. Gripping scenes throughout kept my interest. Excellent example of friendship from those whom we least expect it. Renee Zellweger is a favorite and was a delight to watch her in this extraordinary role.But the end was not what I expected.

During the entire film I couldn't help thinking, is it a fake or what? It can't be Mingella's movie! To me, all it does is tries to pretend it's the same kind of movie as The English Patient, with similar storytelling and moments that I can clearly see as 'emotional climax triggers'.But whereas I almost cried each time I saw the latest Swimmers' Cave episode for the first 15 times watching the English Patient, I had not a single moment of emotional agitation during Cold Mountain.Very disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a move, too cold to watch.","review":"Thisi s a poor excuse for a movie. While this flick has some good historic civial war imagery, they're all a bunch of sad moments that make this movie too cold to watch. There is a very shallow story in here despite all of this, its a love story between Jude Law's character and Nicole Kidman's characters who fall inlove but ever truly get to know each other, what makes this worse is tht Law's character dies at the end. This movie drags on and on with sad moments and tells no real story. Despite all of this, the action scenes are good, but they don't make this movie any better.

The story started depressing and ended suicidal! I actually bought this dvd and after I watched it one time, I threw it in the trash. The only good thing about it was Renee Z's excellent rendition of a tough country girl. Only watch this movie if you like self-punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny, godawful disjointed waste of celluloid","review":"Cold Mountain never got off the ground. Its largest problem is the failure of any of its actors to emote, however, given the fact that all of their characters are nothing but ciphers, that's to be expected.We never find out anything about their characters and as a result it's almost impossible to identify with any of them. The Renee character is so much of a country stereotype that we almost expect a banjo riff whenever she appears onscreen. The script also lacks three acts, as the movie is just a collection of short events.None of these events are particularly exciting, and when coupled with the other writing problems, you end up with a film that has you checking your watch over and over again.Now on to some good things: it's shot well. The photography is ok, but that's unfortunately all the positive things this film has going for it. There are far better romantic movies out there for you to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is what ruined it for me: Nicole Kidman looks like she stepped out of Vogue magazine in every single scene. Everyone else looks appropriate for the period, but there's Nicole: supposedly broke, hungry, and attempting to manage on a farm when she has no skills, looking utterly ravishing while everyone else has leaves & twigs stuck in their hair. Poor Rene Zellweger looks like a mac-truck ran over her, having to play opposite Nicole with her ruby-red lips and perfectly coiffed hair. Unbelievable.I think we've become so immune to bad film-making that we'll settle for anything, especially if its packaged as a costume drama. This film contained scene after scene of purely gratuitous violence that served no purpose other than to titillate the audience. The predicaments in which Jude Law's character find himself reminded me of The Canturbury Tales - it was almost comical, it was so ridiculous.

Yes, yes there is the usual dribble about the South fighting for slaves, though fully 85% owned none.

After about five minutes, though, you could predict the outcome which really dragged on. What was personally offensive to me was the depiction of a pastor as a drunk, womanizing hypocrite. While I'm certain that there have been a few of these in history, I have to wonder why Hollywood always depicts them this way?. My question is why we don't ever see a Rabbi being ridiculed?Other problems with the movie include the accents of Nicole and Rene which are almost impossible to understand. Also, the Southern men of this era were raised to be gentlemen. The bloodthirsty killers of Southern Army deserters are difficult to believe. This movie should not be rented or bought. It is poorly written and directed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sllllllowwwwww as molasses","review":"Well, I finally got around to seeing \\"Cold Mountain.\\"----and I'm sure glad I waited till it came to the dollar theater. I love Nicole Kidman and thought she was amazing in \\"The Hours.\\" But Nicole, take a break--you're making too many movies. Poor acting and ZERO chemistry between her and Jude Law makes for an extremely dull film. Rene Zellweger adds a little spark to this overblown and pretty unconvincible southern accent drama. Jude Law is good---but Natalie Portman steals the show as a widow living alone with an infant. The worst of all---the length. I thought it would never end. Save your time and money---rent the DVD(if you must) when there's a discount day at Blockbuster. A BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best movie ever!!!","review":"I saw this movie and was stunned the whole way through! The story was fantastic, the setting breath-taking, and the characters steeped in perfection! Academy Award winning performance was given by Renee Zellweger (as usual). In fact, if she doesn't win for this movie I may never watch another movie again. And everytime they cut to another scene there was another big-name actor/actress playing quirky bit parts like they were leads! I am watching this movie again and again. It was real, just plain real. The events in the movie did, at times, contain sex, violence, and debauchery, but it was not overdone in the traditional Hollywood style. Nothing was too much or too little! If you don't watch this movie then I would consider having your head examined."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exercise In Brutality To What End?","review":"I gave this film two stars, one for Kidman the other for Zellwigger, as for the story itself the brutality of Inman's odysseian journey back to Ada overwhelms their unbelievable romantic attachment to each other. Director Minghella fails utterly in making their love come convincingly to life in the way David Lean did with Yuri and Lara in \\"Dr Zhivago\\", so the viewer is subjected to one horrific episode of brutality after another without the reward of genuine fulfillment at the end, and ironically it is Ada who lures Inman into his journey of ultimate self-destruction with her letter pleading with him to desert and come back to her. At the conclusion I felt only revulsion at the detailed portrayal of the brutalities and emptiness for Ada and Inman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't listen to the Grammies!!!!!!!","review":"It would be unfair to say that the Grammies award winners never don't or never deserved their awards.

At the same time in nearby Llantrisillio, James and Suzie, newcomers to that part of England, find their sylvan idyll brutally and shockingly shattered by the voyeurism of a farming neighbour... Also in Border country, in Birmingham, policeman John Munroe is liaising with his Welsh colleagues on a routine enquiry. But a mysterious death in the area draws him inexorably into an investigation which is to uncover a tangle of dangerous passions running beneath the outwardly calm rural scene. This book unfortunately features a poorly designed plot - to the point of becoming almost unbelievable - as well as an unskilful characterisation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great recipes, needed double-checking","review":"Mr. Flay has some great recipes in here. The combination of ingredients sure makes some delicious food. I've done a handful of these, however, and it seems to me the translation from his mind to the page resulted in some odd results.We made Steak Frites with Blue Cheese sauce. There was enough resulting Blue Cheese sauce to accompany a dozen steaks, let alone four. I made his candied mango butter (serving size in the book: 4) and halved the recipe for two and have over half of it left. One recipe calls for Shrimp stock - six cups. The recipe for Shrimp stock shows it makes FIVE cups. COME ON! By the bye, who has 3 POUNDS of shrimp shells around for this?Perhaps I'm too amateur but do keep a close eye on these recipes. I followed many unquestionably and had some gripes."},{"rating":"2","title":"down home yummy","review":"I like a cookbook that I can use, not one full of esoteric ingredients and recipes with many steps that are many pages long. This book captures the best of both worlds - short, simple (if you're kind of a foodie)recipes that bring glory to regular ingredients. Not another American food goes uptown book, this book keeps the cooking down on the farm, but modifies and combines American ingredients to achieve new and flavorful dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"This is the first review I have ever written about anything. I puchased the Mesa Grill Cookbook being no stranger to southwest cooking. It's my specialaty. I have tried a total of 5 recipes in this book and NONE of them came out according to the directions. I've never seen anything like it. Cooking times are incorrect, some of the methods are questionable. Even as I sit here and write this, I am RE-roasting my cauliflower becuase the recipe for the roasted green chili and cauliflower soup called for an odd roasting method that left me with warm/raw cauliflower after the 30 minute cooking time. The Lamb Shanks were outstanding but the sauce needed some extra help and dont even try to make his dulce de leche recipe. I am really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My husband and I are both accomplished cooks who enjoy flavorful food. We enjoy Bobby Flay on the Food Network and thought that this book would make a wonderful addition to our cookbook collection. We decided to try the pumpkin soup. Generally, the first time I make a recipe, I follow the directions, analyze the results, and \\"tweak\\" the recipe the next time I make it. This was so bad that I don't even want to give it a second try. It looked nothing like the picture, and although the directions stated to add more liquid if the soup was too thick, using the recommended amount(no extra)resulted in a thin soup that didn't thicken up even after cooking for the maximum time suggested. We may try another recipe, but I will definitely have a back-up meal ready to prepare, just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"MaryEmma's Review","review":"Do you truly know what it takes to be a man?

You're going into a dark cave and your clan tells you that there will be a light in the middle of the dark gloomy cave, but there is no light and you are trying to feel your way. Much like Dar tried to find his way from childhood to manhood. His journey takes him from the only home he's ever known to an unknown land where he learns to become a man.I'm looking forward to reading another book likeDar and the Spear-Thrower.

During the crow magnum times they had to hunt for their food now today we can go to the store and buy our food. We get to watch TV for entertainment back then they watch people dance it was probably really boring to us but fun to them. I think the author wrote this story to tell us how hard it was and how we have it easy and to tell us how it was fifteen thousand years ago.The story takes place in the plains with Dars tribe and they are a pretty strong tribe. They are fighting through their problems like becoming a man like Dar had to do. To become a man he had to get cut on the arm with a flint knife.[This book is really good because it teaches you a lot about what it was like) So read the book Dar and the Spear Thrower.I liked the book Dar and the Spear Thrower because it taught me a lot about Dar and his tribe and life was truly harder back 15 thousand years ago believe it or not. So pleas read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL!","review":"This book is great! We are studying Cro-Magnons in our social studies class now and were asked to read this book.

That being said, this book is incredibly difficult to read. For me, each sentence took several re-reads before I could get some type of clue as to what he was trying to say. I consider myself a good reader and this book was way out there with the uppity language. My husband would get a kick out of me reading sentences to him, just because they were impossible to understand. If you like this sort of thing, then you might like the book. I, however, did not like the book. I also did not like how they would describe a work of art in great detail, yet show you a totally different piece from that artist. It made if difficult to visually see what they were talking about. My professor did a much better job explaining the material covered in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little \\"hands on\\" digital B&W photography","review":"This book has very little actual information about producing digital black & white images. Mostly it's a discussion of the author's transition from film to digital, and the benefits/differences of digital. There isn't much actual information on Photoshop techniques and other means of producing digital B&W photos, and what there is is very basic and can be found in countless other books/magazine articles/web sites. As well, the photos are not very inspiring, and certainly do not illustrate anything specific to digital photography. A much better choice for an introduction to digital B&W photography is Barry Thornton's \\"Elements of Transition.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"untrustworthy","review":"The book is full of distorted facts and partial and untruthful analysis. e. g. The author tries to diminish Ilia Chavchavadze's role in Georgian National Identity formation. He writes that during his work as a peace arbitrator and afterwards Chavchvadze's interests turned toward ethnography \\"Politically he became more conservative and dedicated himself to his work in the Georgian Nobles' Bank and the society for Spread of Literacy Among Georgians\\".

The author misconstrues the truth to an extreme extent. Sadly, I have noticed that many Georgian propogandists are striving to do this with their own history nowadays. From examples like denying the fact that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are inhabitated by completely different and separate ethnic groups, from twisting data and dates to suit their purposes altogether, I would highly advise anyone looking to read about this region to take this book and others like it with a grain of salt.

And yeah, that's still in there. And yeah, it's pretty cool. There's not much else for me to like in here though. It's got some atmosphere... some occasionally decent production value... and it certainly isn't hard to see how Jane Seymour was plucked soon after to be a Bond-girl. It's got two stars: one for the kid in me; one for the adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as faithful as people seem to think","review":"Do not let this one fool you. This NOT a faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. The very idea that the Frankenstein creature is decomposing contradicts that the creature was given life. He's alive, not just reanimated dead tissue, that's a major point in the story. It's a disappointing and senseless twist that is completely unnecessary. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the All Time BEST Frankenstein Movie ever made","review":"After about seven years of checking the TV guide hoping that this movie would pop up (I know, I need to get a life), Finally I've found it!

Put together from scraps of The Hand, Dr. Jeykill and Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Tales of Hoffmann (the Olympia episode), and Trilby, held together by the flimsiest veneer of Shelley's story, it even includes a character called Polidori! Zarrazin is simply too beautiful to look ugly even under all the makeup, and the whole enterprise has a decidedly homoerotic component, not surprising, given who wrote the script.

Dogen can be a difficult author, but this is not the book we need to clarify Dogen's thought. Abe's primary influence seems to be Heidegger, and he has contracted some of that philosopher's worst tendencies. He announces conclusions, but instead of motivating them with reasons, he tends to just repeat the same thing in three or four different ways. He also seems to think that abstruse terminology serves as insight and explanation. Another noticeable defect in this book is Abe's apparent lack of knowledge concerning Dogen's Tendai background. He accepts without reservation the hagiographical legend of Dogen's doubt concerning the need for practice in the context of Tendai original enlightenment doctrine, as if no one had ever thought of this before and no answers had been proposed. He also frequently presents views Dogen inherited from medieval Tendai as original and new insights. Overall, a disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight","review":"As a life-long practitioner of Buddhism, I found this book incredibly lightweight and superficial.

He introduces many characters and explains too much about each one, straying the reader from the main \\"crux\\" of the story. This does in fact work well for the description of the society in which the story takes place, and paints a morbid, dreadful glance at the decaying African society for it's readers to interpret. He fails to follow through with some important details, which makes it more frustrating to read. If you are looking for a story which tells the absolute truth of life and the hardships it brings, without any positive resolution, I would recommend this book. Otherwise...

The character offered up as a sacrifice at the end was such a nonentity I had to check back to figure out who he was. And why, if the main character was so anxious to have his friends act as bodyguards, did he have them all too far away to help when he set up a confrontation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten as all later books are","review":"For a long tome the thrillers by Francis have been getting from bad to worse. Allthough for nearly 20 books Francis was on the top og his/her career in thrillerwriting the last ten books have been very bad. Characters are hardly workes out and the plot is not right. When is the editor of the publisher going to tell man and wife Francis that enough is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Jockey","review":"The hero of this one isn't a jockey. (You didn't think glassblowing was a manly profession?) The villain is one superviolent lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass is Mass","review":"A Dick Francis fan from the starting gate, SHATTERED was a bit on the low side. Plenty of fast action, nice guy hero, a romance and the baddies with an intriguing profession for the hero.Most Francis's have racing twined among the spooks and this one is no different when the owner, the trainer, the jockey and his friend arrive at the racetrack for disaster. Martin Stukely, the jockey dies after having made a videotape of fixed races. Gerard Logan, a glass blower by profession, was the last person to have the tape.And the hunt is on for the villeins to recover the tape and Gerard to stay alive long enough to find the missing tape and a killer. A page turner with flaws, but then that is why Dick Francis was awarded a Grand Mastership by Mystery Writers of America. His low hits are better than the highs of lesser authors.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day AWAY from the Races!","review":"SHATTERED is different from the \\"horsey\\" books in that its main character is an artist in glass, who just happened to befriend a jockey. Martin, the jockey, is dead in the first chapter or so, but Gerard, his glassblowing friend is left with a mystery, new enemies, and a potential new love. If you are looking for a book that has characters that will hook you, then reel you in...this is your book! It is so easy to like Garard, root for his new love Catherine, enjoy the \\"rough\\" characters who are out to get information from Gerard that he doesn't have! Great characters! Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kept me entertained","review":"I would give this three and a half stars for the story and one-half star for the bonus of learning a little about glass blowing. I enjoyed the book, but was a little confused about why he didn't have the police arrest the ones that he knew who assaulted him. It would have saved him a lot of trouble, but, I know it's just a book. Never the less, I did enjoy the book. It was just long enough that I could read it in one sitting and it moved right along. The main character's friend dies in a freak accident while riding in a horse race. The friend leaves a tape for Gerard and before he can watch it, it is stolen. Other tapes have been stolen from the home of the victim and more of Gerards. Solving the mystery of the tapes leads to many adventures that keep your interest until the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth fast read","review":"Another great read from the master.Not terribly original but a comfortable mix of glass and horses that is perfect for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattered","review":"Gerard Logan is a glassblower who has befriended a jockey named Martin Stukely. Gerard accompanies Martin to a race, where the jockey falls to his death. Logan is given a videotape which soon disappears, and several thugs accost him thinking he still has it. Logan is motivated to recover the tape before the thugs do, although at first he doesn't know what the tape contains. He travels around the countryside accompanied by a rag-tag group of \\"bodyguards\\" and slowly begins to solve the puzzle of the tape and where it came from. There are interesting details about glassblowing and dependable Dick Francis spins another interesting tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Illusions Shattered","review":"So very unlike the Dick Francis I have come to expect.

Dick Francis is human after all. The plot moved around so much I thought the story was about a moving van. At times it was interesting but then Gerard Logan would appear in the third person and the theme went every which way. His thoughts and theories were scattered. It never made me think. It is no where near what Mr. Francis is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish the 'race'.","review":"I have read all of Dick Francis' books and was so eager to read his latest but was shattered by the dull pacing, the even duller characters and the unbelievable villans - especially the female character! It was such a poor read, especially the conclusion, that I threw the book down without reading the last few pages - Francis never reaches the finish line in this book - if he were a horse, someone would need to put him down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Kindle Edition","review":"My rating is not in relation to the contents of the book (I haven't been able to read it yet), it is just a warning for others to NOT buy this book in its Kindle edition.Being a technical book, it has a lot of mathematical symbols, which are not displayed by Kindle!! only a little square is displayed instead of different symbols (less than, greater than, etc.). Also while using my computer to read it (Kindle for PC) NONE of the Figures are displayed!With no figures and no symbols in a technical book, this kindle version is useless. I'm returning it and buying the paper version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not wild about this book.","review":"I'm a math teacher and this is one of several books that I purchased for reading during my summer vacation. This book would have benefited greatly from short descriptions or annotations to go along with the proofs, most of which I've seen elsewhere. If I had thumbed through this book in a store I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A relaxing mix of multicultural soundscapes","review":"Being a strict fan of synthesizer-based new age music, I wasn't sure what to expect from the Buddha Lounge series. Most world music tends to be too windy and quiet to spark my interest...but these compilations seem to have a more powerful alure than the jazzy atmosphere of most music of this type. Buddha Lounge 3 is a relaxing mix of all kinds of world and new age music elements, and is an enjoyable experience from beginning to end. The only drawback is that it lacks the epic excitement of works by artists like Yanni, Enya, and Vangelis. However, this is good compilation to use if you're in the mood for something non-dramatic and mellow. If that sounds like your cup of tea, definitely check out the other two in the series as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"News for Yoga Fit instructors","review":"I used this CD for my Yoga class last week and loved it.

It is about 2 3/4 inches tall, and comes with a backpack and gun. The backpack is difficult to get on, and when it is on, Anakin cannot stand up because the backpack is too heavy. The gun doesn't fit in Anakin's hand. The action figure itself is the only decent part of this set. You get what you pay for with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller does not disclose that you need chip reader that is not included","review":"My daughter is happy with the action figure, but very disappointed in what appears to be a bait and switch. The description indicates that the product comes with a Comm Tech chip and a Talking voice chip. What the seller fails to inform the buyer, is that for those chips to work, one needs to buy a COMMTECH Reader. Very disappointing to an 8 year old who was eagerly awaiting the delivery of this action figure.

Written by award-winning authors Rochelle Alers, Donna Hill, Felicia Mason and Francis Ray, each tale has as its nucleus a Harlem beauty salon. Unforgettable characters include 57-year-olds Elaine and Louis, who find love again after being widowed; and self-centered Chauncie, a 30-year-old aspiring actress who drops her high-and-mighty persona after losing her heart to Drew, a blue-collar contractor also in his 30s."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy-to-read anthology for the young and the not so young","review":"I was asked to review this book for the Meda P.

The librarian wanted a selection for February and thought that this might be appropriate for the ladies.I found the anthology appropriate and an easy book to read with a messasge for living carefully woven through the pages of each story but was not \\"preachy\\". The ladies of Meda P. will definitely enjoy this book. If you are a widow, widower, under thirty, over fifty, blue color, white color, male or female, you will see yourself in one of these four stories. No story was predictable; two of them had a twist that was not revealed until the last page. The authors not only did an excellent job of describing New York, Harlem and the surrounding area. You also knew that they were all familiar the happenings in a beauty shop.Read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to get my 'DO' done here!","review":"I loved this book. I love the dedication that the employees had to the shop and to Rosie's memory. I love the way everybody fell in love. I felt like I was in the shop and I was watching everybody become beautiful. I thought it was good to read a book by a black author that is not about everybody getting dogged. It was fairy taleish but I loved that even more. The book gives us love to dream about rather than a place in the dumps where we have already been. There is something for everyone, young love, middle aged love and the one that touched me the most, love after we have lost the one we love most."},{"rating":"1","title":"book for 40+","review":"the storyline is this book is good if you are over 40 and can relate to the characters.Its about a bunch of middle-aged people trying to get their grove back.

One gets the feeling this is more a vocabulary book rather than an in-depth study on this complex subject. Cases are one-page long each and take you too rapidly to a conclusion without detailed arguments and facts. The \\"Value Dynamics\\" framework proposed by the authors does give you an approach for the orderly incorporation of often-ignored drivers of value such as culture and structure, but again the book is more focused on the \\"what\\" rather than the \\"how\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea -- poor execution","review":"This book is not for someone who wants to understand what it takes to understand and implement an eCommerce business plan or channel.

This CD set is vaugely reminiscent of the \\"Best Of Techno Trax\\" compilations in the early '90s. That is to say, very electronic, fairly simplistic, without much layering or polish. This set comes with a third \\"Surprise CD\\", which in my case was LCD's Hypnotic (I think you can get this particular album independently... look for \\"Ender Fun\\"). If you find this in a bargain bin in some dusty old record store somewhere, it might be worth having in your collection. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

The pictures for ROA LOA were wrong and it went over fetal monitoring minimally.I guess it is an easy read when almost every topic has a bulleted list. It makes select all that applies pop up every where...The pros... it was a decent size - not nearly as big as my med surge book.My recommendation?

The volume is divided into 4 parts: Changing images of the ideal home; Betwixt and between: homes in transition; Anxieties and risks: homes in danger; and Changing perceptions of home. The first part, changing images of the ideal home, focuses mainly on British homes and British attitudes towards home. Much of the remaining material, however, could easily be generalized to cover Western attitudes towards housing and home. Tony Chapman's paper \\"You've got him well trained': the negotiation of roles in the domestic sphere is a particularly well-done exploration into sources of social attitudes towards sharing housework.

Here's a book full of ideas lifted from analysts and magazines, written solely to cash in on a trend. Perkins thinks so little of his advice that he did not follow his own suggestions. His magazine, The Red Herring, is a textbook example of dotcom excesses, bloat and \\"what goes up must always go up\\" thinking. Long after publication of the first edition, he was blithely making the same foolish mistakes he warns against in his book. As a result, the magazine went through a series of layoffs and downsizings and continues to teeter on the brink of insolvency.Tony Perkins is a master of getting invitations to events in Silicon Valley and sucking up to the insiders.

My book has tape all over to keep it together and now that I am unable to work I prefer to live in my books and especially my side of the mountain. I would love to make a movie that follows the book more closely and I believe that it would make the greatest weekly show for small ones and big ones like me.

It contained nothing of the charm and magic of the original story. It was as if the filmmakers decided to use the name of the book to draw in its fan base and just did their own movie that had very little to do with the original.

I can't tell you how much we loved the book! Jean Craighhead-George does a remarkable job of taking the reader deep into the wilderness of the Catskills, complete with reference to Washington Irving's Rip VanWinkle. We were delighted by each and every page.Why in the world any screen write would change such a marvelous creation is beyond me! The movie wasn't even close to the novel, and we felt like it was a complete waste of time to watch. I can only wonder what the book's author must have felt watching a washed and clearly faded rendition of her creation. She must have been deeply disappointed.The book itself would make a wonderful screenplay all its own. We truly hope that someone will resurrect the story and put it on the screen in all its glory.

This video is watchable because of the breathtaking scenery; otherwise, the messages sent to the viewer are downright bizarre. Made in 1969, and reflective of the era.Here are some of the film's messages: A) If you're a 13-year-old aspiring biologist and your parents just don't understand you, then you should run away from home to live in the wilderness (No!). (B) It is okay to deliberately set fire to an ancient tree (No!) (C) If a burly guy discovers your secluded campsite, you should invite him to stay and share your sleeping quarters (NO, NO, a thousand times, NO! Good grief, what were they thinking?!)

And what's up with Sam taking a microscope into the wilderness so that he can \\"conduct algae experiments\\"? Killing off Frightful was an unforgiveable departure from the \\"real\\" story. If ever a movie needed to be remade, and properly, this is the one! One good thing ...

Doctors, therapists, anyone who studies alcoholism but is not suffering from the disease themselves can only understand alcoholism in theory; they will never have a true grasp on the disease itself, no matter how close they are to someone who does. I believe the author has done her homework and indeed her statistics bear this out but unfortunately, to truly understand the terrible grip of addiction, one must be suffering from it. This is an illiness that is most successfully treated by counselors and therapists who are in recovery because they have been in the trenches and know the path we walk and the struggles we face. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is new in recovery and is looking for a guide to follow. A good addition to your collection if you already have a head start with some basic beginngers books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkably good historical writing","review":"Let me start by saying that this is a long book, a very long book. As it should be. Starting with the \\"roots\\" of the war, specifically the fallout over Truman's so-called \\"loss\\" of China, Mann takes us through every twist and turn of political thought and action behind the war, covering the period from the late 1940s to April 29, 1975. The great value of the book and its length is that Mann frequently makes wonderful connections between events of different times. This is the best pure political history of the war, and as such should be a must-read for anyone wishing to understand why it unfolded as it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Political History of the War in Vietnam","review":"A riveting narrative and an encyclopedic source of information regarding how we became involved in Vietnam, including who made the decisions each step of the way, and why they made them. Unprecedented, definitive and indispensible to anyone interested in both politics and the war in Vietnam. Although the book has been criticized for leaving out other subjects relating to the war, such as its impact on the U.S., and the details of the fighting in Vietnam, those topics were properly left by the author to be treated elsewhere. A true masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another unfortunate representation","review":"As much as America needs a real understanding of the Indochina conflict, this work falls drastically short. The sources sighted are the typical biased rationalizations void of depth and understanding. Anyone with an elementary wish to finding truth in mid to late twentieth century Indochina has merely to check whether actual primary participants were used in the construction of this work. Clearly, they were not. As an examination of American political decision making it may have certain merit. It is however impossible to gain a full understanding of the decisions without knowledge of the depth of the situations. This book does not do that. Clips taken out of context from the FRUS (Foreign Relations of the United States) compilations are not a substitute for scholarly research.

The recipes can appear to be long, but they are filled with little hints that make baking easier. I have made several of the desserts and they have all turned out great. The book has recipes for basic pies and cakes and recipes for more complex desserts. My only complaint about the book is that I wish it was on a spiral binding so it would lay flat while I'm using it. The biggest complement for this book is that my mother-in-law, who is a great cook, couldn't wait to get her own copy after seeing the desserts I prepared from it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I too was lured into purchasing this book because of the over-the-top recipes but that actually proved to be the downfall.

I made the Carrot Cake twice and it ended up just falling apart both times when I took it out of the pan. And this was after about an hour & 1/2 in the kitchen. Other things like the Flourless Fudge Brownies were way too sweet & rich and made me a little sick to my stomach.

Okay, I must admit that the raspberry cream cheese coffee cake was beyond fabulous, and I have made it repeatedly, even in a triple batch for a large crowd at an official function. However, I have had more disappointment than satisfaction when trying other recipes in this book. The yellow cake, for example, was absolutely horrible. My husband and I each took a bite or two from our first (and only) slices of that cake, and promptly threw away not only the remainder of our slices, but the entire rest of the cake as well. Also, I did not like the blueberry muffins. I have tried literally dozens of blueberry muffin recipes over the years, searching for the perfect one, and this recipe ranked low on the list. I found the shortbread recipe only mediocre.

The cover says \\"easy-to-prepare,\\" but these recipies are so poorly written that they require the cook to figure out a strategy. For example, the carrot cake doesn't mention that you need to prep the carrots, apple, yam, and pineapple ahead of time. Your batter could sit for 1/2 hr while you prepped these ingredients. The recipies are also wasteful. I threw out 2/3 of the oversweet frosting, which took 40 minutes to make and called for 2 pounds of confectioner's sugar.

Ms Jones spends too much time delving into the undoubtedly unsavoury backgrounds of Loveless and Tackett, yet shamefully devotes precious few pages to the victim, Shanda, or her family, and what little space that is devoted to Shanda depicts her as a twelve year old tramp who deserved to meet the horrific fate that she did! A much better book about this case is \\"Little Lost Angel\\" by Michael Quinlan. Skip this book written by Ms Jones and read Quinlan's book instead.

I don't think this ever would have happened if not for the toxic combination of the personalities of Melinda Loveless and Laurie Tackett. While Melinda had an intense hatred of Shanda and definetly wanted her gone, I don't believe she would have regressed to torture and murder if not for the influence of Laurie. Laurie was just plain evil. She didn't even know Shanda, but used Melinda's desire for revenge as an avenue to satisfy her own desire to torture and kill someone. Both of these girls had horrendous childhoods, but that is not an excuse for what they did. A good lesson can be learned from the other two girls involved - Hope, and especially Toni.

I believe that many things motivated the action that the three girls took towards Shanda and we may never really understand why this death occurred. The book does look at the three young girls and the victim anddoes justice in its approach to the motivations in the crime.I will write again after reading the book for the second time and relate a better view of its' value. I believe that Toni has been released from the In.Womens' Prison. This could happen in any community, any where and does happen. Sad but true.

This book did not answer that question. It is a sociological study of meth addicts from the LA area with attention to their social background and potential for violence. It has some interesting statistics, but it comes to some unwarrented conclusions, namely that methamphetamine did not make people violent if they were not already violent for some other reason. This conclusion is based on interviews with the addicts. Nobody asked the wives and girlfriends of these addicts whether they were violent or not, and only 6% of the sample was incarcerated, which is NOT representative of the meth abusing population.

From the grass growing in the middle of main street, to the cell phone falling out of Peter Sharaykos robe pocket, this amateur-like, low budget film lacked any attributes associated with a western drama. While the costuming is the redeeming factor and well done (except for the pointy toe rodeo boots), the dramatic gunfight scenes look and sound like a bunch of little boys with caps guns.

It was written after the Marine Corps had dropped the LINE system as not preparing Marines for the demands of the modern battlefield and before the creation and adoption of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). It was also written before any lessons could be learned from the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. It is a very simple book with a set of basic techniques that may not be the most important to learn first.The rest is simply my opinion so take it for what it is worth. The Marine Corps is full of very tough people. They are not tough because their hand-to-hand combat training is good. In fact, I would argue that their hand-to-hand combat training can be pretty crappy and the average Marine will still be pretty tough. This manual falls into that catagory.If you want to be tough like a Marine, join the Corps. You will certainly not learn how to fight like a Marine by practicing the techniques in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Basics","review":"I am going to write an open and honest review.

Then it takes 6 months to learn that one technique. The throws and ground fighting are good, despite what some have written on the net(trying to sell their product over this one). What you need to remember is the illustrations are single example movements. No one knows what is really going to happen in a street fight. One recommendation.

I also found a surprising side issue: the theatrical version of Mario Vargas Llosa's La Fiesta Del Chivo (The Festival of the Goat) is in production by the well respected Repertorio Espanol and has an accompanying Study Guide done by Iliana Fuentes.

Its a very simple device with no instructions needed other than common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"Powers off automatically and doesn't remember tare setting, so for constant monitoring it is a major pain.

At first I thought this was a pretty accurate scale, but when I took the puppies for their first exam and weighed each puppy on the vet's scale, this scale was actually not accurate at all.I know it is meant for a postage scale, but truly, a scale is a scale and should be accurate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loose Change from Mozart","review":"Relatively speaking, this disc contains Mozart's most inconsequential piano concertos from his decade in Vienna: K 413 in F and K 451 in D Major. In a letter to his father and sister, Mozart ranked the latter with the contemporaneous B Flat Concerto (K 450) but posterity has not shared his evaluation. The best thing about the F Major - an unambitious work - is the graceful finale with its pianissimo close. Yes indeed: the Ancien Regime stands firm with nary a cloud on the horizon.Again, I once possessed these recordings on LP and made the hyper-jump to CD. Brendel plays with a narrow percussive tone that is not unsuitable. He is stylishly accompanied by Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Field. The recording is somewhat metallic with a hint of digital glare. This disc is not going to change your life. If however you are a latterday Quintus Aurelius Symmachus and besieged by mechanisation and barbarism on all sides, it will becalm you with civilisation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash course in astronomy","review":"Plenty of good information especially for teaching astromomy.

This is a simple review -- okay, simplistic review -- of the universe, but I was barely 8 when I last had any formal instruction about the vastness of the heavens. I have managed to be successful in my life in spite of this dereliction, but now in the comfort of an easy chair with a cigar and glass of cab for company, I can finally learn that some guy in 300 some-odd BC calculated the earth's circumference to within a couple hundred miles. My kids knew that, of course -- probably from some video game -- but it was a wowie for me. So what if Davis doesn't know how to spell Polish names. I am not trying out for a spot on the next Mars mission.

Kind of like - here - let me tell you about this stuff I'm going to tell you about, when I tell you about it eventually.... By CD #2 I gave up. Lots of ridiculous trivia.

Here is a possibility that could make it all possible. Not likely but who knows. The ramifications of quantum non reality allow for the possibility of our existence being some sort of program running.

A few \\"so-called\\" financial advisors recommend it highly, yet I found it rather weak. I also work in finance for a living and have done so for much of my life. As for the reader who says if financial people all knew so much, they'd all be rich, he's right, many of them are. But not because of following the advice in this book. Probably because a few of them have you buy a poor written book, link you to a dubious website, and cash in membership fees...It's so bad, it would seem that the authors are either writing their own reviews or having their friends write them. I found myself mortified to have bought this book, save your money and search the web for real-world advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unravels the mystery","review":"Everyone who has been granted stock options should have this book. It is relatively easy-reading on a subject that is typically perceived as very complex and mysterious. The authors set out a \\"Critical Capital\\" strategy that provides a foundation for making decisions about when to exercise options and when to sell option shares. I looked at the companion website...and thought that it was very handy and helpful in supporting the decision process. As a CPA, I will strongly recommend the book to all of my clients who are involved in stock option programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful... half a star.","review":"As a Senior Financial Advisor of this country&#65533;s largest brokerage house, Registered Investment Advisor, and previously a University Professor for over 20 years, I found this book purely dreadful. The \\"Five Steps to a Successful Exercise Strategy\\" and Case Studies that Mr. Ungar and Mr. Sakanashi wrote were worse than some turned in my by my first year students. \\"Your Employee Stock Options\\" may have helped a minority of the readers (some very suspiciously skewed reviews here) who lacked the good sense to call their accountant or financial consultant. And for &#65533;Chicago&#65533; who suggests cashing in their options &#65533;now&#65533; rather than when they might have had some value? Does &#65533;absurdity&#65533; mean anything to you?Do a search for &#65533;Stock Options&#65533; here on Amazon. You&#65533;ll find many choices, all better than this one.

It came via UPS and very quickly too. It was packaged great and all the pieces were there.The pieces are very well defined and durable and also have a good weight. My hands are on the large side, so a bigger board with big pieces was more what I wanted.The board is essentially a mirror and the edges are not rounded. I think that's the only real reason I'm giving the durability score a 3 out of 5. While this is beautiful as a showpiece or as a game that you'd play in your home provided you don't move it alot, this is not a travel game at all. As I intend to collect more than one board, it's not a problem for me. I would recommend this game for someone with a maturity level over the age of ten.Overall, this set is beautiful and a joy to have. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprofessional and presumptuous. Save your money!","review":"I found Robbins to be crass, unprofessional and arrogant. He strikes me as an amateur counselor who has been propped up by lots of marketing. The first DVD is just a long commercial about the guy. Then the next DVD you have to wade through more preview stuff (how great he is, how many lives he's changed, how he's basically a savior for all mankind), then when you finally get to the meat of it, it starts with him pontificating and putting down some poor couple in front of 4000 people, with him using foul language. That was enough. My husband is returning it to the store today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is exactly what the title says it is.","review":"This book discusses what needs to be done to ensure success in the workplace. Including a hands-on working assessment; providing structure all day; one on one training. It explains what must be considered; what does, or can the person do; what do they enjoy doing; do well; what is available to work at; what behavioural problems exist; what motivates the person; what kind of support will be needed. A much-welcome book on a subject about which good information is very scarce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but check it first","review":"I purchased two sets for two different bathrooms. The first one worked well but the second had a broken mixer valve in the hot water side. My plumber checked it before installing it.

This one does an excellent job of outlining basic erotic core or beginning moves for the upper and lower body. Also, I really enjoyed seeing the women do their final dances on the end segment. It's great to see amatures give such sexy performances.Additionally, Susan gives good tips on clothing, props and how to create an erotic environment in the home. This tape is geared to women who have never done erotic movements and is not for women who are looking for advanced erotic movements. Also, this tape does not cover basic floor work or pole work. I highly recommend this dvd for women who want to quickly learn how to give their lovers a sexy, erotic treat!

It just isn't as good.Yes, I was disappointed.

Most do not make sense. Webkinz technical support offers no support. It basically just blames any problem you are having on your ISP or that your Flash Player is not working (even though it worked yesterday and it will work again tomorrow).3) It sometimes logs your child out right in the middle of a game.My children have simply stopped bothering with Webkinz and have lost interest in their stuffed Webkinz toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter loved","review":"My granddaughter loves webkinz.

If it wasn't for my fantastic instructor, this series of courses would be a total nightmare.The chapters dealing with force, energy, torque, momentum, and angular momentum are among the worst that I have gone through. The optics section is also pretty weak.

The examples are terrible and don't help you at all with the practice problems. Most sections are just an explanation of how each equation is derived; there are no clear explanations behind the actual topics. Rarely they include actual information in the chapters, although it is usually way too vague and can't really be applied to any of the problems. None of it speaks to specific problems or situations, they clearly assume that the reader knows physics already.

As I am currently working through this text, I may be a bit closer to home than those who have completed the task.I am seriously less than fond of this book. There doesn't seem to be enough background in the material to handle the problems. This is most noticeable in the middle chapters. There are problems which are flat out insoluble if you utilize only the material in the book. There are problems are so far beyond the examples given in the body of the chapter as to leave you swimming for a method to solve them.I am presently searching for secondary companion books that will present the material in such a fashion that I don't have to count on blind luck intuitive leaps of logic to solve the problems, but rather on solid problem solving methodology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honors problem anyone?","review":"This book is straight to the point.

It isn't Morrden's fault necessarily since if you haven't read the other works, his would be quite fresh, and his characters do illuminate the nuances of relationships, be they gay or straight, more subtlely and more touchingly then those of most other writers. Still, one comes away yet again with the feeling that gay men can't be anything but \\"bitchy\\" although, at least, Morrden's aren't as shallow as most. Those who enjoyed Holleran's \\"Dancer From the Dance\\" shouldn't miss Morrden's version of the legend (included in this collection) of a man with god-like good looks who vanishes without a trace."},{"rating":"2","title":"made me the fag hag I am today","review":"I read this in high school. This was one of the first peices of gay \\"literature\\" I ever read and I fell totally in love with it (and what I imagined gay culture to be). Elitist, warm, fun and fantastical. I'm re-reading it now and I'm on Amazon looking for more work by the author. I hope I find something just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits and misses","review":"I recently re-read this book for the second time after reading it when it first was published, almost 20 years ago. I find that this book is both entertaining and interminable. This is a collection of several short stories, and the first to feature stories about the \\"Family,\\" which feature the characters of Bud, Dennis Savage, Carlo, and Little Kiwi (Virgil). Those stories are the finest in this book. The other stories are a mixed bag -- the final entry, \\"The Disappearance of Roger Ryder,\\" I couldn't even finish (and I TRIED!). I'm looking forward to \\"Buddies,\\" and eventually the rest of the books about the \\"Family.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating at 200m.p.h.","review":"This was without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read. The secret meetings and the billion dollar deals, the corporate struggle that raged over Chrysler, TAKEN FOR A RIDE instantly captivated me and kept my eyes glued to the pages. I just couldn't put it down. You always see the unveiling of the cars and the execs at the auto shows (especially the Detroit Auto Show which I always attend), but you never hear about what and who are behind the cars and the fancy execs with matching sunglasses. TAKEN FOR A RIDE is definately the best book I've read in a long time, I'd probably pay $50 for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Barbarians at the Gate\\" meets the Keystone Kops","review":"The management of Chrysler right now must be wishing they'd never heard of Bradley Stertz. No one comes off looking like a genius in this account of the DaimlerChrysler merger, but the American executives are the most obviously inept. The Germans look smarter, but end up being hapless integraters and managers, as shown by their recent performance.Stertz has a fine eye for detail, and his research is exhaustive. In order to keep his book to a reasonable length, he sometimes moves along at an extremely quick pace, and I found myself constantly reviewing earlier sections to make sure I understood what was going on. But none of this detracts from the guilty pleasure most readers will get from watching this slow-motion collision between two completely incompatible corporate cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"The story caught my eye since I love business books, but when I started to read this one my eyes just glazed over. Why? Because I already know this story since it has been plastered in every newspaper and magazine for some time now. I was hoping for some new information that would justify the purchase price of the book, but I was disappointed. I guess you could say that after buying it I was taken for a ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"CORPORATE CHESS!","review":"What goes on inside the corporate boardroom? Who decides how business is really done or undone?Authors Vlasic and Stertz offer a juicy, spell-binding no holds barred look at the recent machinations of the Daimler-Benz/Chrysler merger. Missing only is an account of the impact of this hi-jinks corporate chess game on those employees who were down-sized or dismissed. What about them? Although the book focuses on mammoth Chrysler, it brings to mind another colossal entity slowly dismantled . It finally ceased to exist. Remember Pan American World Airways, Inc ? Wasn't Kirk Kerkorian around for that one too?If you are intrigued by mergers, re-structuring corporations, how to build a new empire over the bones of the old entity- then you may enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Behind-the-Scenes look at how Chrysler capitulated","review":"An excellent and captivating look at the behind-the-scenes machinations that would ultimately result in Detroit only being a domestic Big Two.The book is slightly lopsided, with perhaps excessive exposition on the Kerkorian takeover efforts and ending with somewhat compressed detail on the post-Daimler acquisition troubles.Ranks with \\"Comeback\\" and Car\\" as recent great reads about the people and events that shaped and are shaping today's automotive landscape. A good read read for general readers and plainly wonderful for auto industry enthusiasts and/or professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"And what a spellbinding ride!","review":"This book is excellent reading more like a thriller than a business book about a megamerger (oops sorry, a megatakeover). Wonderfully written and well researched, the authors keep you spellbound for the whole book which I read practically in one sitting as it's that good. Get it and strap in as you wonder in amazement the BS that happens the closer you get to the top of a corporation. You can see a lot of the Enron culture at Daimler."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling ride","review":"If you're fascinated by the auto industry or just by the high-stakes games big companies play, you won't be able to put this book down.

Rather, an avid reader who \\"can\\" appreciate a beautifully written novel when presented with one. I found the situation very true to life with multifaceted characters with which a reader can really get involved. I think I would easily recommend this book to my gay AND straight friends for a real glimpse into a world that perhaps they've never encountered. The character of Vince represents a modern day \\"Peter Pan\\" - abandoned, unloved and unable to love in turn. One of the lost boys that unfortunately populate many of our big city streets.

However, long-time fans of tradional and country styles might derive more benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth it, what a disappointment","review":"Entirely apart from incorrect facts and dates, this documentary has very poor picture quality and is obviously extremely biased. Whenever Hitler speaks, they put it into slow motion so he sounds like a monster. Do we really need this kind of propaganda? All the quotes are taken out of the context for which they were intended. Much seems to be lost in the translation as well, especially in quotes. Any serious WWII fanactic will hate this box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitler (sort of...)","review":"The best thing about this series is having the majority of all the best Hitler film footage in one collection. But its not exactly a completely neutral re-telling of the story, so beware. Using a combination of many interviews with elderly Germans who say - in effect with 20/20 hindsight - \\"we knew he was evil, we just couldn't put our finger on it at the time\\" - and the technique of slowing Hitler's own recordings down to half speed to make him sound like Satan himself. This is really a piece of propaganda no less than anything Goebbels ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like a Great Set!","review":"I received the item quickly, and it looked like it was in great shape.

Maybe this set will come out as a DVD set sometime.Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rip-off of a documentary","review":"This highly touted video disappointed me. Their commentary on Hitler's art work was simpleminded, silly. Of course, being a loser, Hitler's art work had to be trashed! Had he been encouraged into going into art as a career I am sure all of us would have applauded especially after seeing what the monster did to the world as leader of Germany. Also the quality of the video images is poor. The Germans were master photographers in black and white photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an uninspiring picture book and nothing more useful","review":"If you're looking for lasting decorating ideas, look elsewhere. If you want to wanly leaf through a coffee table picture book and read brief captions, borrow this from the library.

As a graphic designer, I find this music inspirational. Once I started playing it, I've found it hard to do without. His new release, Inspire, is equally as wonderful. In my humble opinion, Smooth Water is a must have for anyone who enjoys piano music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrongly Marketed to Children","review":"My rating of one star isn't based on the quality of the movie, but on the fact that it is marketed to young children. I watch horror films for research and even now none of them have the power to upset me like this movie does. This is one of the most dark, depressing movies I've ever seen, and while I suppose it shows the negative consequences of seeking vengence, several scenes could also be interpreted as being literally Nietzschean in their depiction of the strong preying on the weak, and may send a fatalist message that some people are destined to be victims no matter what path they choose. This is definitely NOT a message we want to send via children's cinema. This is an adult film and due to its dark themes and conclusion, I think it should have an R rating. We all know that life is filled with harsh realities, but there are plenty of high quality films out there that teach life lessons via more age-appropriate storylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Forgotten","review":"Like most of the people in here, I saw this movie in elementary school, second grade I think, and I have never forgotten it. I remember it being emotionally stirring (something you dont typically get in sugared down childrens movies)... but not disturbing, the message was received and never forgotten. Even though I only ever saw this movie once, I remember the story.I have been seeking this movie ever since, only remembering a movie with a lamb raised by a wolf, and that the movie was maybe called \\"Bell\\".Highly recommended for the young and old"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you feel better","review":"There wasn't anything that I thought was revolutionary here, but since I tend to get really stressed when my son doesn't eat (especially since he's pretty slim) this book helped and continues to help me relax some about it. I understand that my pushing food on him is a bad tactic in the long run. So, I'm glad I have it. Two unique things: a focus on our own \\"food legacy\\" that for some may ring true but for me was just not really an issue (I didn't have overly involved parents pushing or preventing my food habits) and two-a stronger focus on OVEReaters (reasonable in this era of obesity but far from my area of concern).It may give you some peace of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Customer Service Confirming/Shipping product:(","review":"I ordered these mats based on TV exposure.

However, I greatly disagree with the ease of writing order. For example, I can make a \\"ma\\" and a \\"ya\\" MUCH easier than I can make a ku, i, or he. Also, the book needs to dedicate about 10 pages of text to a passage of any kind (short story or series of poems) that is written strictly in hiragana for reading practice. It's one thing to recognize symbols and be able to write down a sound in a different writing style, it's an entirely different thing to read at even a first or second grade level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I purchased this book to help me learn Hiragana.

According to Peter Michas, mankind will recognize the coming Messiah on the basis of theories derived from the legends of these unbelieving rabbis and the Hebrew Roots misinterpretation of Scripture. Bottom line is the false teachings in this book are setting readers up to receive a false messiah, the Antichrist, during the Tribulation period.

Richard, on another hand, was not too well portrayed, his distrust and stubborn attitude towards Diana lingered a bit too long in the book, hence made the ending a little too hastily done for reader to enjoy.

Watching this film makes one think that all kids are rude, disrespectful and one nasty comment away from killing themselves. I beg to differ; it seems to me the real problem that film makers need to be addressing is teenagers addiction to technology and how that is affecting their ability to successfully interact with others. Also, this film makes it look like all teachers have terrible lives outside of school and that their jobs are simply an extension of this awful they live. Not true.

Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tough film worth watching.","review":"Rented this from Amazon Instant video the day of limited theatre release, 16 March 2012; well worth the price because it's not a film you really need to see on the big screen and have to pay the movie-house prices for.A tough film worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"for a thoughtful viewer","review":"Ok, i always preface with the fact that i rarely feel moved to offer my opinion, but every now and then i randomly come across a movie that blows my socks off.So for a somewhat thoughtful viewer knowing nothing about this film, watch it. if you're a teacher, or work with the public, watch this film. if you like to walk at night and think, if you want to FEEL something in return for your movie watching time, watch this film.This film leaves little left to say, so i won't try to add anything unneeded. for those who need a comparison, \\"a single man\\" but without the glamorous casting and wardrobe......well even that's off. the kind of movie that doesn't nessecarily offer you hope on a platter, but it definately shows that it's behind one of many doors, and leaves the choice to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similar to Bob Dylan","review":"Cary Swinney has the lyrical content of Bob Dylan with simple melodic passages. He expresses deep philosophical comments on society in the ironic tone of an outside observer. Swinney's comments will make you think and a little uncomfortable as you decide which side you're on. The only thing better than listening to the CD is seeing Cary in person and experiencing the music itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HEAR, Listen over and over","review":"I have been a Cary Swinney Fan for years now and was lucky enough to get a copy of this album with a personalized note from Cary to Rodger? in it.

Full of brilliant symbolism, this book employs some fascinating literary techniques. Laurence's use of Morag's \\"memorybank movies\\" is so realistic that you really feel as you read that you are growing up with her. Her discovery of herself and acceptance of her flawed loved ones, such as her adoptive parents and her off-and-on lover Jules, is one of the best aspects of the book. Her realization that not only can she deal with but she is also proud of where she comes from is something I love to read about each time. It's a great book to study carefully, after you've read it once. If you just skim the surface, you miss so much. Great regional flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, I've now read it twice","review":"This book remains, to me, as one of the top-five books ever written by a Canadian, and probably the most beautiful book written about the prairies. Morag Gunn haunts our memories: she's a stern, creative, strong, industrious woman who survives out west and thrives out east. I can't describe the story to you; you must read it yourself to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Novel, but not for required reading","review":"After viewing a film, \\"Taking Liberties\\", I decided to read THE DIVINERS because part of the story line involved it being banned from a high school English class. I cannot imagine why anyone would suggest this novel to a high school English class and I am a high school English teacher. The novel centers on a woman in her 40s and I believe that you need to be a mature reader to appreciate this novel. It is marvelous! I highly recommend it (read the other positive reviews for details). But reading reviews of THE DIVINERS and other novels by Laurence here at Amazon leads me to believe that many young Canadians are being turned off by Laurence because they are not ready for the themes and even the subjects of her novels. Some works need to be read later on in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diviners","review":"Laurence was able to create characters of great depth, all diverse in their personality traits. Morag Gunn carries the story through reflection of her life, skipping back and forth from present time to past. This book takes place in Manawaka, a legendary town in Manitoba. Some secondary (as well as central) characters are also present in Laurence's \\"The Stone Angel\\", giving the reader a greater appreciation of the close relation between the books and the characters. A very involving read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I didn't like this book much. I found it confusing and boring, with little character development, and sort of a meandering story line that gets lost in a few places along the way.I found that the story meandered and stagnated a bit, and didn't get caught up in any of the characters. I was not the least bit interested in what happens to Morag, and I must have tried five times to finish the book before finally getting through it.As a Canadian, I've been told all my life that Margaret Laurence is one of our greatest treasures, and a quintessential Canadian author. Funny thing is, I *didn't* read this because I had to for school - I bought it at a yard sale. I personally feel I should have saved my quarter for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a waste of paper... save some trees and don't buy it...","review":"Well, another novel written by Laurence about some old woman going on about how tough her life was, and how terrible things always were for her... I don't think that Laurence was really all that great of an author if this is \\"One of her best\\". The book was dry, and very boring... not at all interesting... The reccurent use of the whiny old lady plot line is really getting to me... A note to all English Teachers out there, we don't enjoy this kind of stuff --- So please stop making us read it! (I've had to read 3 of her books this year)"},{"rating":"2","title":"War & Peace 1967 from Amazon","review":"Upon receiving the sealed 3 DVD set, I discovered Disc 1 was severely flawed.

They'd love to have the original screen aspect ratio, high quality sound and picture. They link to their past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dated production","review":"I wish I had not purchased this film.I find it difficult to watch because the languages are treated inconsistently. For example, there is considerable dialog in French but it's not translated in any way.What the makers did to Russian is worse. Sometimes it's dubbed-in, in English, but sometimes even in the same scene the origial audio replaces the English while subtitles appear. This has the effect of dramatically illustrating the difference in voice between the dubber and the original actor!The end result is too much overlapping of audio tracks and subtitles. In my opinion it would have been far better to leave the original Russian audio intact and simply use sub-titles throughout. What we have here is confusing and difficult to follow.Then there is the issue of mid 1960's dramatic over-acting. This I think was the final straw for me.I'll just have to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruscico War & Peace DVD is horribly defective","review":"ZERO STARS. What a dissappointment! The film randomly switches between English and Russian and French dubbing ---sometimes in the same section--- and the subtitles don't always come on in English. I tried it on 2 DVD players so it is quite defective. Judging from some other reviews, other people are experiencing it but for some strange reason they find this acceptable. This is the first DVD I have ever seen which was this screwed up. Too bad----a great movie which I still have only on Beta (Kultur version)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ragged","review":"It's easy to see why this movie rated such interest when it came out, it's huge is so many ways. There's the length of about 8 hours, the outdoor battle scenes starched for miles at times, and the extras counted up to over one hundred thousand. But once you get past that you realize this is one ragged movie. The DVD made no effort to fix images so that even within a single pan the lighting, focus, color, and clarity shifted. The language of the film was a mess with Russian and French being spoken while occasional English voiceovers were heard. You really have to work at it to keep up. Lastly, the DVD kept hanging up leaving me stuck with a frozen frame. By that time it almost seemed appropriate. How sad that the epic movie of all time became an epic disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"feeling stupid","review":"I feel a little stupid doing this because I haven't been able to review this product.

Today is September 3, 2008 and I purchased the discs on July 30, 2008. So far, nothing has happened. I am at a loss for words and I feel very stupid ordering from Amazon.

I thought it would be a very sweet DVD with new stories of Ariel for my 2 year old to watch as she loves the princesses. BUT, I found the Ariel story of Wish upon a starfish to be very frightening for a 2 yr old. The DVD did not have a rating on it (like G, PG, etc) and there was no description on the back explaining the story had monsters and frightening scenes of thunder storms in it. I feel it would have been better if the DVD had listed a short decription of the story on the back and a suggested age should have been printed as well. I would say this DVD is good for age 9 and up. But definitely not a toddler. I just wish I had enough information ahead of time and I would not have purchased this DVD.

For years, my workout routine consisted of walking and Tae Bo and was in phenomenal shape. I veered away from him and did traditional-style gym workouts for the past 9 yrs. I decided to give Tae Bo a go again and bought this DVD. NOT for people with any level of endurance. I barely got a sweat and the short bursts with long breaks was counterproductive for a solid workout. Basically, if you're able to run more than half a mile comfortably, I would say this video is not for you.

The game itself was great with wonderful graphics and easy maneuverability via the mouse and keyboard.Getting the game to load was a different problem. I bought this game to give to my brother-in-law, who is in Iraq. Little did I realize you need to have an internet connection in order to play it.I first tested the game on my PC. After I installed the game and tried to run it, I received the following message: \\"Steam.exe(Main Exception): Unable to load library steam.dll\\". A little research revealed that the \\"steam.exe\\" that came with the disk was bad and I needed to download a newer version of steam.After about 3 hours of work, I was able to play the game in off-line mode.

Don't buy anything from valve too much hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"*WARNING* DO NOT BUY USED!!","review":"I gave this game a low rating, not because it is necessarily a bad game (I wouldn't know because I can't play it), but because if you buy a used game that has been registered on \\"Steam\\" then it won't let you play it. And since you have to register with Steam to play, then all used copies will suffer from this. My only option now is to go through the red tape that Steam customer service web site said I need to go through, in hopes to get the cd-key reset. I followed the instruction and still have not heard a thing after several days. I have bought many new games and have never had a problem playing them. The whole Steam client is a pain, even for the games that do work. It's just a long, un-necessary process to go through when you just want to fire up a game a play for a while.

She writes sympathetically about the Israelis, their plight, their dedication to their country, their hardworking modesty. She captures the spirit of another time.

The reseller for Amazon, Antonline, was unwilling to refund the purcahse so I appealed to Amazon which gave me a full refund - a class company.

And I never felt especially sympathetic to her: I guess we were supposed to assume that her sick crewmember was fine after all--her relative lack of concern was off-putting I thought. There are so many good novels in print on fishing and fisherman--I would rather spend my time with those than with this true story. Next time she should get a ghostwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a blast.

I will never again eat swordfish without thinking about the amount of hard work and the risks that sailors take to bring that food to my table. A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda Greenlaw is an empowering treasure !","review":"Greenlaw is as empowering to her crew as she is to the reader - Readers of The Perfect Storm got a glimpse of a skilled (female) fisherman, readers of THE HUNGRY OCEAN will be inspired by the passion she brings to life, the peacemaking skills she brings to labor, and the pride she recaptures in the fishing industry -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing...a GREAT book","review":"Greenlaw writes so well, I read this book in one sitting. How wonderful that someone who is so skilled as a fisherman turns out to have such a gift for prose; the combination of talents has produced a unique book...it was truly an armchair traveler's trip to sea. But the title is a bit misleading, since the focus of the book is not on the awesome power of the ocean to take, but rather the tenacity of the fishermen who take fish from it. Altogether a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent primer on longline fishing and a quick read","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely, and perhaps a bit better than Perfect Storm.

Linda Greenlaw has written a truely superb account of working offshore.

However, read as the journal of a fisherman who happens to be a woman, it kept me engaged from start to finish. It is an easy read, and I don't read quickly. Thus, for the more proficient reader, this can easily be read in one day or over a short weekend. I have a cousin who is the innkeeper of a B&B in a New England port town. I'm forwarding this hard-cover edition to her so she can add it to the library at the B&B. I think her visitors would enjoy reading this while visiting a New England fishing town."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, flat","review":"I read this book because my 25-year old son is a commercial fisherman. He left school at 17 to go salmon fishing in Alaska. I still remember his descriptions of the glorious sunsets and the thrills he found in the day-to-day exposure to nature at her best and worst. I felt this book was very flat, all the boring day to day details with none of the excitement and special exposure to nature that fishermen are drawn to. Why else would they put up with all the negatives of this lifestyle?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hungry Ocean - Unabridged Audiotape","review":"Linda Greenlaw does a fine job of reading her terrific, gripping story of swordfishing off Newfoundland with her five unique crewmen. In a mere seven hours one can hear rather than read this book about commercial fishing and all of its exciting twists and turns. Greenlaw expertly weaves background details about herself into chapters that she fits among the main story chapters, calling these contextual pieces, Mug-ups. She successfully conveys the excitement and anticipation of awaiting the outcome of a day's fishing, life on the boat, including its many hardships, the crew's problems and virtues, and her love-hate relationship with her boat's owner.As a former summertime mate on a party fishing boat, all I can say is \\"What a book!\\" I can almost feel, again, the continued rocking on dry land I used to feel following a day at sea.I plan to listen to this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great world. A poorly written chronicle.","review":"This is a book riding on the high on the interest in the Perfect Storm. It's a fascinating world to write about but Greenlaw writes like a fisherman.

Let us do our jobs. You can just read the books.

We will stick to what we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drunks and Swordfish and Sharks; Oh My!","review":"This is by far one of the all-time best fishing books on the market today. Linda Greenlaw has what it takes. The story is enthusiastic, interesting, and technically well written, but you don't have to be a longshoreman to understand it. This is man against nature at his or her best. After being somewhat disappointed with THE PERFECT STORM I was leary to buy this book. Glad I did, it was worth every minute. This is a text that any water enthusiast should read. It is by sheer providence that fisherman and fisherwomen should own this book as a guide in difficult times. I know when things get hairy for me I ask myself; \\"What would Linda do?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit among the fishermen of Newfoundland.","review":"Perhaps the first and only book to get it right. Fishers of the world unite.Greenlaw gets the tedium, danger, misery and ecstasy of fishing on the North Atlantic.

Being an Alaskan, and an adventurous soul myself, this is the best book I have ever read. I love the actual feeling that she gives a reader. Its almost as you are part of the daily tasks. She really pours out her soul into the book. Her book is one that will be passed on down as one of the greatest adventure books in my mind! I just hope she writes more of her adventures! They are so captivating. I could not put the book down. If you read the Perfect Storm, you MUST read The Hungry Ocean. Thanks Linda!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, at best","review":"After being encouraged to read this book by a sailing friend, I picked it up with hope. I am disappointed. It's tedious.

So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book. I was less than impressed. I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story.This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was \\"Anyone who loves the sea will love this book\\" I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was hungry for more","review":"I went on vacation looking for some solid, entertaining reading pleasure. I was left unfulfilled with The Hungry Ocean. The story never took off and was bogged down with details only a fisherman would relate to. If you are interested in commercial fishing, I'm sure this book could be quite satisfying. However, if you were turned onto this book due to the film version of The Perfect Storm, keep rowing along because it doesn't even compare. I bought this book for my father who enjoyed it immensely (or so he said) but i was sinking into boredom when i undertook the task of reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"This book was a quick read. I grew to seriously resent the captain and her crew for their callous and inhumane handling of the freshly caught [live] fish. Most disturbing was the hanging of the \\"blue dog\\" (shark) from the rafters, where he was stabbed repeatedly by the crew while thrashing and then doused with lighter fluid and set afire while alive. Why? To teach the sharks a lesson because they were being caught, instead of swordfish. She had surely become desensitized to the sufferings of animals, but having said that, I do believe she never was sensitive to begin with. I'm glad she has \\"retired\\" from the sea and and so are the fish I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hungry Ocean-Greedy Fishermen","review":"This book is a direct capitalization on Jungers book.It is also a poor facsimile of his work. I kept waiting for it to grab me in the way The Perfect Storm did. However much to my dismay, it never did. It leads me to believe that if The Perfect Storm was never written, this book wouldn't have been either. Miss Greenlaw fails to explain how the Atlantic longliners are decimating the billfish population.That is,the depletion of the swordfish and other game fishes are a direct result of their lack of concern. This viewpoint of my did not however influence my opinion of this book. I was very disappointed with this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous, capitvating, and spellbinding","review":"I looked forward to Linda's story every night until it was all gone. I was a little crestfallen that it was over and wish she would come out with another story in the near future. She opened a world for me of an exciting and dangerous profession that few people knew much about and described the intense relationships that the fishermen depend upon to survive and thrive. Fishing is in their genes and doing anything different is not good enough. Linda writes as well as she can catch swordfish. Please Linda! Give the world more of your talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A KEEPER! LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"I'm a woman and love to go fishing. I loved reading this book. Couldn't put it down. If you love boating, fishing, or just plain old outdoor adventure, you'll enjoy this book. I just wish Linda had told us how to get around getting sea sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Where's the story?","review":"After reading this I wondered why a publisher saw fit to make Greenlaw's tale into a book. It would have been better suited as a long magazine article. Sebastian Junger told us all that we really need to know about swordfishing -- and he wrapped his technical details of fishing, weather, and ocenaography around a gripping tale. What Greenlaw needed was a story -- this book is little more than a fluffed up practice in expository writing. It's probably worth the 11.43 or so that Amazon is getting for it, but don't pay full list as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hungry Ocean","review":"As with all of Linda Greenlaw's books I found this book GREAT!

Having spent 2 years on a Coast Guard Icebreaker in the North Pacific and the Bering Sea on search and rescue I understand the demands on fishermen however Linda did a poor job of relaying this message. I think she needs to stick with fishing and leave the writing to others. This book was a real waste of money.

I bought copies for my mom and one of the brothers (he's been trying to get our mom to read \\"Storm of the Century\\" but she doesn't want to read about danger).I guess some folks were turned off by: a)language OR b)perceived \\"anti-environment\\" attitudes OR c)technical talk. Well, I've been hearing it all from my brothers for years, so none of that bothered me. Fishing can be both the most exciting and the most boring job there is. And for those people who do it, it's the only job around. I would love the chance to have a cup of coffee with Linda. My mom liked it too. No hesitation, 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I went into this book predisposed to like it. Wrong!","review":"I found this book interesting, especially the \\"Mug-Ups\\" until the author describes how crewmates on a previous trip once took revenge on a string of bad catch days. The crew was sick of catching sharks instead of swordfish, so they decided to lift morale by retailating! One offending shark who had the audacity to bite onto a baited long line hook was hung over the water by a noose, knifed and set afire while the crew cheered its thrashing and suffering. Sicko city. The author seems to have little empathy for animals or humans. It was torture to read about the crewmate who was so sick he could not get up, while the author waxes nostalgic about how it was so important to get the boss's praise by filling the hold with fish, whether the crew was sick or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writting,entertaing and educatinal!!","review":"There is not one page in this book that is not exciting, entertaining, educational. Opens a new world of an important part of the New England human experience that most of us are totally unaware off. I found the book complemetary to \\"The Perfect Storm\\" adding the very personal human experience of the individuals involved. Ms. Greenlaw is an excellent writter and she should continue to do so. If I run into her while I sail off the coast off Isla Hout I will tell her personally. For those of us who like to adventure out at sea this story is so pertinent. How far they go and how hard there job is!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible grammar, okay story","review":"I am listening to this book. Greenlaw has made the mistake of reading it herself. She's a terrible reader. She swallows words and stops in the middle of sentences. Plus her writing ain't the greatest. I don't mean her storytelling, which is good. I mean that her sentence structure is awful and if I hear her say \\"lay\\" once more when she means \\"lie,\\" I'll scream.

It's very informative when it comes to how fishing actually is, but it comes out sounding like just another day at the office. Some illustrations would have helped because they whole leader, haulback, beeper stuff was way too confusing.If you really want a good book, stick to the Perfect Storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Flat, yet technical","review":"This book could not be more technical without being a how-to-do manual. However, I finished the book and wondered where the story was?? I'm not arguing it isn't a perfect account of what goes on on a fishing boat. Nor am I arguing that it wasn't well written. It was just plain boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUNGRY OCEAN SATISFIES APPETITE !!!!","review":"After I read Junger's book, \\"The Perfect Storm\\", I thought I had hit the jackpot. I am an Ocean Fishing fanatic. Loved Jungers work and then saw that Greenlaw had her own tale to tell as well.This book fills in the details(WAY DETAILED) that Junger left out. Great rituals, humorous anecdotes and great character descriptions make this book a \\"must read\\" if you liked \\"Perfect Storm\\". It reads like a Captain's Log, rather than a real \\"Page turner\\".Loved it.Tim Heyer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished it in one day","review":"I enjoyed \\"The Hungry Ocean\\" and I did finish it the day I started it. It becomes obvious that Linda Greenlaw has little writing experience. Swordfish are the ultimate gamefish and the average size of the Swordfish gets smaller every year. Although I love the taste of Sword - I refuse to eat it; the reason being there are very few Swords around these days. Thank Linda, her long-lining pals, and the people who eat Swordfish when this fish is completely decimated in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A geat book from start to finish","review":"I enjoyed the book because Linda tells the story of life a swordfishning boat and what it is really like. She doesn't try to glorify her job or the jobs of her crew. She gives the reader a great taste of what it like to work on one of these boats and how hard it really is. I felt she was very honest in the fact that to take a boat out like that for a month at a time can be very demanding. It also lets the readers know that life on one of these boats is not a party. For those of us who have thought about running off to become a fisherman on the seven seas it shows us just how tough it could be.Good luck to Linda and I'm sure whatever she decides to do in the future she will meet with great success."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Life","review":"Of course, I am quite a fan of Linda Greenlaw. I respect and admire her struggle to reach the top in a profession traditionally dominated by men. One of her major accomplishments,(among many)is spinning a good yarn.

Greenlaw holds your attention with a combination of stories about past experiences and a typical outing on the Grand Banks. The book also talks a bit about her experiences with Captain Tyne of the Andrea Gail and his death in the Perfect Storm. Humorous and at times moving this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was both riveting and inspirational","review":"After reading The Perfect Storm, I wanted to read more about this way of life. I received The Hungry Ocean as a birthday gift from my son and I found it very difficult to put down. The book was very inspirational. The fact that she was able to not only captain a swordfishing boat but to become \\"one of the best sea captains, period\\" was amazing \\"for a girl\\". I enjoyed every minute of this book and hope Linda writes another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good look at the fishing industry","review":"A good read.

It was a great disappointment. It is full of fishing and technical terms and descriptions without a singe diagram to explain what is being described. I also did not like the exploitive nature of the entire book. I have fished all over the U.S. and outside of the U.S. and I have come to release all of the fish I catch with few exceptions. I know comercial fisherman must keep what they catch, but I hope someone is monitoring the swordfish fisheries. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding Jungers coat tails","review":"Greenlaws book does give one a sense of what it's like on a longliner, but clearly she is not the writer Sebastian Junger is. She starts a story well, building to a climax then leaves you flat. She tells of tension building between crew members, asks one to stop tormenting another and his reply? \\"ok\\" and that's it! I simply expected more of a book so long on the NY Times best seller list.. The perfect Storm was what I like to call \\"a ripping yarn\\". This was flat and only mildly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hungry Ocean","review":"I would say I enjoyed this book alot . I rated it four stars because the book was really interesting to me . It was cool to learn new stuff about fishing and it was cool to compare it to the stuff I already new. This book was also very funny too . It was funny to hear the characters speak.There language is that of a sailor which if you dont know what that means very foul. It was funny because they had like a sware word in every sentence and that is how they spoke and it was like second nature to them. I also liked the book because it was non stop action every page something was happening and thats what you need to keep me interested so thats why I was able to read it so quickly. This was probably my favorite book and i suggest you read it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting...","review":"Linda Greenlaw at times sounded a little 'phony' at times and the book (near the end) becomes slightly disturbing, but that would probably be my only critisism. Her obvious love of fishing is quite aparent and the lives of her crew that she intrically weaves into her story are quite interest too.

Some of this book might be useful, and most might be interesting, but it lacks basics and dwells on the esoteric.White spends considerable space with barrel machining, which most of us cannot do, and suppressors, which, though interesting, are marginally legal, require federal registration, illegal in many states, and beyond the machining capabilities of most 10/22 owners.Things we CAN do are generally ignored, especially installing new barrels and stocks, which are easily within the capabilities of most 10/22 owners and given only passing mention in this \\"Ultimate\\" guide book. There is NO mention of procedures for checking inletting on stocks, barrel floating, or determining allowable contact points between the receiver and barrel and stock, all critical to the 10/22 owner who might purchase a \\"100% drop-in\\" barrel and stock combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment...","review":"Actually, more than a bit. I was looking for an authoritative reference manual, but I got a summary of tweaks and idealogy about silencers as a great idea for pest control.Reading this book was clearly influenced by my having read \\"The Gun Digest Book of .22 Rimfire\\" by James E. House. There is simply no comparison between the two books. Admittedly, the House book is more general in that it covers a wide range of rimfire firearms and does not go into great \\"tweak\\" detail. That focus was left to House's new book \\"Customized the Ruger 10/22\\" which I should be receiving from Amazon on August 25, 2006.If House's book on customizing the 10/22 is anywhere near as complete and smartly written as his \\".22 Rimfire\\" book turned out to be, then buying the \\"Ultimate Ruger 10/22 Manual and User's Guide\\" will be less valuable than it turned out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh.","review":"Although there was quite a bit of technical detail in the book, only about 10% of it would ever apply to a normal, everyday 10/22 shooter. This is not a book for a person who just bought a 10/22 and wants to get the most out of it right out of the box; it's more geared towards an advanced user that might have several and a lot of gunsmithing equipment and know-how. The author spends inordinate amounts of time discussing the various barrel metals, drilling cleaning holes in receivers, firelapping, and on silencers, which most of us could never afford the fee for anyway. The book's tone is also slightly condescending, I thought, towards anyone who doesn't think exactly as he does.

I'm slowly changing my kitchen to one that is organic and healthy and I must say, this book is neither of those. I was surprised that they recommend white flour, white rice, salt , baby food and even canned cream of mushroom soup! Veterinarian approved? Who are these guys kidding? These recipes have very little nutritional value and I would be concerned about feeding my dog this way on a regular basis. I don't feed my family this stuff and I certainly wouldn't feed my dog this way. I'm waiting for another book to arrive and until then I'm modifying these recipes with healthy ingredients that I've found through research on the web - things like brown rice, flax seed, barley and the like. I use the recipes as guides to give me an idea of the percentage of meat/vegie/whole grains I should combine for my dog's food. Other than that, this book is a joke. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Flaw - no serving sizes.","review":"Some good treats in here, but if you want to feed your dog from this recipe book, you'll need to prepare a meal, then burn it in a calorimeter so you can find out how many calories that meal has - then you'll need to find out how many calories a day your dog needs. The best way to find that information would be to look on the side of a bag of dog food I guess.Seriously, how can you make a cookbook for dogs and not include suggested serving sizes for the recipes based on the dog's weight and age?Ultimately, that makes this book useless for anything other than novelty treats and an occasional cooked meal.

According to one author, dogs can even have seizures from too much of some of these ingredients-even salt. By the way, I also know birds are allergic to some of these ingredients-as well. Apparently, smaller animals are effected the most immediately and seriously by these foods. Unfortunately, the first recipe for dogs (in the intro provided for free on Amazon) uses garlic and 1/3 cup oil.

The author encourages using the receipes in the book AND kibbled dogfood. Also, there is miss information regarding serving raw food and bones. The author suggests rawhides, as oppose to raw bones. Rawhides are a leading choking cause for dogs. Not to mention, some are not made in the US and contain unhealthy meat products. If you serve bad meat to you dog, of course they will get sick. Dogs do not have the same digestive system as humans and we should not impose the same principals.

The idea is that this vibration will encourage whatever powder you place in the top to fall through the screen, mixed and seperated. It's performance, however, was laughable. Install the single AA battery, add some powdered sugar, press the button, and watch in amazement as the device buzzes and rattles like an electric sander while one-by-one the grains of sugar drop into the waiting bowl.

This, on the other hand, is just a recording of the MIDI soundtrack to the game, with some added sound effects and a splash of reverb. That's it.

The other author is a writer who decided that these techniques could also be useful in dealing with an uncooperative ex.I can't say they're completely wrong about this - after all, good communication comes in handy anywhere. But this makes for a very shaky premise. There's no research behind it, and they don't even bring any clinical experience with using these techniques in this situation!(Plus, don't let your kids see the title.

However, even casual fans should recognize Bonfa's most well known piece Manha de Carnival (Morning of Carnival), originally written for the movie Black Orpheus and recorded countless times by legions of interpreters.Bonfa is not only an incredibly talented composer, but a guitarist of great artistry. Jobim said of Bonfa, \\"...his guitar is a little orchestra.\\" Here Bonfa is joined by Brazilian percussionist, Cafe, and on three tracks by American guitarist, Gene Bertoncini.All the songs here receive the most tender interpretation possible. While soft and gentle, the performance is filled with passion. This is a lovely and evocative album.

Luiz Bonfa is one of the greatest guitarists I've ever listened to, and this is one of my favorite of all the recordings that I own. Bonfa has a few tunes that have become jazz standards, but he has many other great compositions some of which appear on this recording.Bonfa, Cafe, and Gene Bertoncini (who plays second guitar on a few tracks) create a unique sonic landscape that is further enhanced by the terrific sonic quality of the Chesky production. Each piece of music tells a little story, and it's amazing how much music Bonfa can make with such basic instrumentation. Bonfa is such a master of the guitar, he makes every note sound effortless and plays with such a tremendous amount of nuance.I can't reccomend this one enough. A zillion stars.

While I enjoyed \\"Coffee Will Make You Black\\" b/c I'm a sucker for coming of age stories, I did not have the same satisfaction with this sequel. I understand the point Ms. Sinclair is trying to make with how even as adults we are all trying to find ourselves in this big world and while that's all well and good I could have done without the details of the love scenes and other encounters. For example, the scene where she's finger-f***ing some other woman was a little unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was disgusting!","review":"As founder of a book club, I try to be fair and let everyone have a chance to select the books that we will be reading. So, when my turn came around, I chose \\"Ain't Gonna Be The Same Fool Twice\\"-only to prove that I was the fool. I had no idea that we would be reading something like this. The sex scenes were much too descriptive and it made me sick reading it. I have read several of E. Lynn Harris' books and although they are about the gay lifestyle, he does not make you feel gross. Needless to say when I went to bookclub I was truly embarresed, because everyone was wondering why I would select a book like that. I had to explain to them that I had not researched the book thoroughly like I usually do, so this was my mistake-but believe you me, I won't be a \\"FOOL TWICE\\".

Away from home, she is able to find herself and BE herself. In the first novel, she questioned her sexuality. In this one, there's no doubt about it. Although, Stevie finds that a relationship with a woman can be just as trying as one with a man; that being yourself means having to defend yourself while maintaining who you are--to please yourself, not other people. Of course, finding herself means she has to be truthful with others (read: her family) in order to fully be comfortable with who she is. I'm not gay myself, but I find this tale of stumbling across one's homosexuality more realistic than E. Lynn Harris' work. If you are liberal--and not squeamish about homosexual encounters--then this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"The title alone is a winner. This book offers a look from the same sex point of view. Love is love no matter what gender is the meaning that I received from the book.

If you are a fan of science fiction, or The Lord of the Rings or something a little off-beat spiritually, and you also like golf - then this may indeed be a very good book for you.

However, the book does fail to give it's readers any knowledge or in depth understanding of how the eastern front and the war in the middle east occurred either with or without a live and let live system. Still, one can receive first hand accounts of the lives of trench fighters during the every day to day routines they experienced while not actively engaged in major battles of the First World War.

Short but with amazing insight!","review":"Realistic characters (all human this time), genuine suspense, a strange and oddly familiar view of religion and a really well handled twist at the end - for those reasons A Maze of Death is one of my favorite Philip K. Dick novels. It's a short book, but packs in a lot of insight about perceptions, the shifting nature of reality (of course), human interactions, paranoia and hopeless cases. I notice that the tone here is more dismal than Philip K. Dick usually offers, but (as always with his stories) reading it is an eye-opening and memorable experience.While many authors have expanded on themes in this story, written in 1970, I don't think that anyone's improved on his presentation of them.

After reading a few of his works with bemused admiration, this was the first of his books I really enjoyed.SPOILERSA Maze of Death is genuinely readable; most PKD is a little shoddily put together, but this one is perfect. It is a wonderful allegory of loss of faith in God. These people create a world with a virtual reality machine. A world where God exists. The trouble is, when they get out, they can't face reality any more... This is indicative of Dick's own religious confusion at the time - this was prior to his \\"revelation\\" of 1974.

WOW...am I glad I didn't succumb to any of that nonsense... I placed my faith in PKD, knowing full well that I would eventually be thrown for a loop. Er...several loops. Eventually, I got my wish. When this one starts to build, it just takes off.All in all, this book is so loveable because it succeeds in capturing that late 1950's - 1960's classic Sci-Fi style... but, still completely packs the reality-altering PKD whallop that we all come to expect from his works. I'm sure that this book completely blew minds when it came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Maze of Death by Philip K. Dick is a spooky sci fi mystery and a great read","review":"A Maze of Death, Philip K. Dick, (1970) 7/10. Husband and wife get transferred to another planet, after husband is visited by the Walker-On-Earth (a Jesus-like figure). Things on new planet are a mess, and everyone starts getting killed by fantastic beings, such as little robot insects, and bizarre icons, like tiny models of buildings. Their religion is explored in it's complexity, which parallel many current religions. The religious foundation of the novel provides great depth to the story, somewhat akin to The Lazarus Effect by Frank Herbert and Bill Ransom. God has been proven as a fact in this world, but somehow the things that are happening can only be partially explained by their beliefs. They can't figure out what's happening, and the story becomes a spooky and dangerous murder mystery. The characters must unravel the truth before they all die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"Maze of Death was a fairly good story, 14 people are on a strange planet with no way off. Many are there simply because they prayed to God - via the electronic prayer system that is basically God's email. Each of the people on the planet is deeply disturbed, and have a great deal of emotional baggage. It is only a matter of time before someone or something starts killing them. Then, once the horror begins, the tension builds until the truth is revealed. The first 90% of this book is three and a half to four stars, as I have never been that impressed with Phillip Dicks Writing style, however his ideas are always amazing. The last 10% of the book is more that five stars, as it blew my mind. This story is short, and is worth reading for the great ending alone.

It affords us direct insight into the Dr. Strangelove world of ego tripping generals with Ozymandias type titles like Supreme Commander. It serves up Orwellian excuses for imperial intervention and the systematic bombing of civilian targets under the guise of humanitarian intervention. Waging Modern War is ultimately only an updated version of the same old doctrines of military callousness and the dehumanizing language which refers to slain civilians as \\"collateral damage.\\"Tacitus would have had the perfect rejoinder to this exercise in military egomania: \\"They make a desert and call it peace.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"words of a war criminal","review":"Clark ordered the use of cluster bombs over civilian areas, used depleted uranium bombs and presided over the terror bombing of cities (bridges, electrical grids, power stations, TV stations, hospitals, etc.).

He's a certified monster and this book serves as the certificate. In this book, Clark extols the virtues of unrestricted warfare, strategic carpet bombing and the absolute, undivided power of military brassdom. In a very biased manner, he blasts NATO for not giving him full license to commit wanton slaughter. This book largely serves as an apology for his murderous strategy. A strategy so morally repugnant that the Russians had to intervene to stop it. Even then Clark tried to start an armed conflict with Russia when he ordered an airborne assault on the the airport in Pristina. Thank God his orders were refused by General Sir Jackson. Clark is a raving lunatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Bought this book for a project I was doing on modern warfare and it's a very tough read.

Great songs like \\"Monkey Man\\",\\"Beast Of Burden\\",\\"Before they Make Me Run\\",\\"Live With Me\\" (guest vocals: Sheryl Crow !) and quite a few others deserved to be kept for this release.Hopefully the awesome HBO Madison Suare Gardens concert in January 2003(40 Licks tour) will be released uncut like the Babylon DVD.Still, what remains is a good looking concert, and shows the Stones proving they can keep up the pace post-Steel Wheels.

Instead, Alanis seems fully aware she is \\"stoking the starmaking machinery behind the popular song,\\" as Joni Mitchell once famously sang, and with Alanis the comparison to Joni is apt. Like Joni, Alanis grows as an artist with each record, using her prominence and position to expand the horizons of both her and her audience. This is an album for the adventurer, the dreamer, the optimist, and the mystic -- it is not to be listened to casually, but must be drunk in, absorbed, to be appreciated. The first single, \\"Everything,\\" captures the mood of the record -- very optimistic, spiritual, and loving. It's also a great song -- let's hope it doesn't get lost among the Aguileras, Britnes, and Avrils out there. This is music for the soul -- buy it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alanis Had Done Better Works Before!","review":"I will give two stars for her effort, but this work is not great like the ones before.

Go back to your good sense and great poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather poor","review":"OK, in my opinion this album is basically a flop. Very little stands out. Much of it just flows along with nothing terribly interesting. Lyrically it leaves a lot to be desired. U.R.S. at least had some real good songs on it. About half the album was really good. And S.F.I.J was absolutely her best album. I'm beginning to think it was her peak back in 1998. It's stupid for me to think I can restrate what's been said in 80-some reviews before me, so I'm keeping this brief. Many of the reviews below give it 5 stars. I don't know why. I think this album is very poor, and was a waste of my money. I expected much more from an artist whose proven she has a lot to offer. In my opinion, just pretend this album was never released, and listen to her past two studio albums. But then, that's just my opinion....."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Called Chaos just not the Alanis I was hoping for...","review":"I've played the heck out of Alanis' former CDs.

Clearly, after 2002's overly avert Under Rug Swept, Morissette had something to prove. She's done that with the ten gems on this, her fourth album, and has found a fine balance between angst and bliss. By all means, a great disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great effort!!!","review":"WOW...I have been waiting for another Alanis CD to come out, and I was not dissapointed...so why the 4, instead of the 5??? Well, here is reason:So-Called Chaos is a great mix of rock and ballad...she has really toned down her music from the days of \\"grunge, and 'I hate everything\\" music and turned into something that some ppl can relate to. I think that this recording has shown that she a grown as a person and as an artist. I think that with this album, she is likely to keep most fans that she has had since the beginning in 1995, which at that time, I thought she was going to be a \\"one hit wonder\\" ok, maybe two. But I was wrong. I think that she is also going to reach a new set of fans as well. Most of the songs on this CD are great, so, go out and get this CD....listen to it...twice if you have to really understand what she is saying, and just enjoy a new and improved Alanis!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Liked Being On The Pill, You'll Love Chaos","review":"Thank you Alanis, for staying true to yourself. You have been consistent with your material in terms of overall sound and emphasis of your values and beliefs woven into your lyrics. Even at the times, when it's almost ridiculous, I mean it's very Sesame Street to name your song Bees Knees. But, I get it, and it plays. So, congratulations on a job well done. It's always a pleasure to hear new anthems for self esteem for young women, (if that's how I choose to interpret Excuses). Also, some of the orchestration is simply slammin'! I look forward to great remixes of these sounds coming out of the clubs in NYC. Please continue to stay true to your craft and yourself, and your fans will continue to see themselves reflected in your songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best - but it still ain't bad","review":"Mr. Juliard (who wrote the review just before this one) may be more musically educated than am I; but perhaps Juliard has simply made him feel guilty for enjoying an unsophisticated thrill. Is there something inherently wrong with an easy listen? So Called Chaos certainly does not break any new barriers and loses some of the edge that made Morrissette's prior albums a unique and enjoyable experience. Having said that, I don't think Alanis is ready to retire to the halls of mediocrity. Songs like Doth I Protest Too Much and Spineless provide some redemption.Perhaps the cover art is the real problem. What the hell? Is she trying to take over where Amy Grant left off?Perhaps my review is unnecessary. A music fan from Virum, DENMARK Denmark (several reviews below) summed it up very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis gets her groove back","review":"It has the strength, pain & anger which Alanis is so familiar with. So called Chaos has the similar feel like her debut album. My favourite song is \\"Doth I protest..\\" The lyrics & the music makes me hit the rewind button again & again. I thought she will fade away after Feast on Scraps & Under Rug Swept. But she has bounced back & creating chaos again.I would definately recommend to buy this album as it has all the songs you want to listen without skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed......","review":"I'm a big Alanis fan, believe me. It's just that this record is so sub-par. The whole stream-of-consciousness thing is nice, but now it's taken over and makes the songs totally unmusical. They've completely lost any good lyric quality; it's like reading from a psychologist's notes on a narcissistic manic-depressive patient - in a bad way. She could've made up for it, though, with good, unique melodies and such, but all the melodies are so plain and boring and predictable and poppish that even the great production work on this record can't save them. \\"Spineless\\" is a pretty good song, but \\"Everything\\", the first single, just sounds like every other song by washed-up 90's bands trying to sound cool on the radio. It's so embarrassingly typical of modern rock-pop. I really do love Alanis, but this has definitely got to be her worst work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Right Direction for Her","review":"I loved JLP, SIFJ and Unplugged. I think she stepped down a notch with URS but SCC is another step down from that album even. The album flows from one song to the next without any real change in gears. One song isn't distinguishable from the next. With her amazing voice and clever lyrics I think she can come up with something better than this. Compare this album to a Sunday drive..comfortable yet all too familiar. Get back on the highway, Alanis!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"She does it again. Its sad that Jagged Little Pill was such a success because it seems critics can't give so much praise to one artist anymore, which is why they seem to condemn every offering she has released since her debut.

Check out Not All Me - it's a beautifully melodic and meaningful track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"This is her 2nd best album from her behind \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" In my Opinion!The album has great song's and Alanis sounds great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Called Chaos","review":"Come on everybody -- give Alanis some credit for growing spiritually and artistically! I thank her for continuing to reach out and sweep us along on her journey. And Amazon, I would like to disagree with your editorial review -- the track \\"Doth I Protest Too Much\\" is not about a woman with Zen-like serenity. On the contrary! Revisit the lyrics! It's about a woman in agony as she PRETENDS to project calm detachment. (See the source of the title: \\"The lady doth protest too much, methinks\\" from Shakespeare's Hamlet.) At least Alanis is trying, and that's progress.

I believe this to be her best record since her 1995 release. Although, there are no real songs of anger and hate, like the 1995 release, it still has a quality tat makes it shine through. My favorite songs are \\"Doth I Protest Too Much,\\" Excuses,\\" and \\"Everything.\\" If you have never experienced an of Alanis Morissette's other albums, you should definetly give this one a chance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"This album was a disappointment. I don't think Alanis is capable of producing a bad album, yet they keep getting worse and worse. Jagged Little Pill, of course, was her best. SFIJ was her second best. But with Under Rug Swept, you see the beginnings of what has transpired on this record: as the years go by, her music keeps getting more and more over-produced, and her brilliant lyrics are underscored by cookie-cutter music she puts them to. This album just sounds too perfect. On almost every song, the chorus overlaps with the end of the verse, and we all know that would never happen if she were in concert. I just don't like how perfect and produced it sounds. It takes away from her voice and her lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lyricist","review":"I have to be honest - at first listen I was slightly dissapointed, as I was expecting the greatness of Under Rug Swept.

There is very little new to be found here, and it seems to lack drive and inspiration. If you don't have the other 3 albums, buy them first - especially Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which is her absolute best. Maybe she has become too happy in her life to write the really excellent music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"just aight","review":"it wasn't that long ago that Alanis Morissette ditched the Paula Abdul early Musical offerings that she first came out with.but she has been Mellowing&Mellowing more over time&while that is cool in spots something about Her Musical presentation over the years keeps falling off.she seems at a Crossroads as a Artist&can't get out of the Rut she is on.she still gives you a Moment or two here&there but truth be told unless She truly changes Her Stylings up a bit then her albums will continue to go down as Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointment","review":"I just don't like it, it doesn't appeal to me. I am normally blown away by her work but this new album couldn't be any more grey and boring. Her voice appears more whiney than usual, and is not complimented by the backing tracks, she sounds too harsh! Not a pleasurable album \\"who is whining now?\\" you are alanis."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak album..","review":"OMG, this is just another weak album from Alanis. I enjoy Japped Little Pills and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie but not the latest two. And I doubt why so many reviewers here like this album??? Looking at the US billboard chart, this album doesn't sell well and drop very rapidly. Even Avril's new album does much better than Alanis.Alanis, it's time to make a more serious album or next time your album can't debut even in the top 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Death of Rock and Roll began with Alanis Morissette","review":"I saw Alanis Morissette on TV performing with her band during some concert someplace. At the time, I thought she was a joke, something not to be taken seriously.At this point I've come to the conclusion that Alanis Morissette is part of a marketing effort by record companies to categorize different target audiences. Alanis Morissette has absolutely no sex appeal. Therefore, her main appeal will be to young chicks. Very few guys will even care.To be honest, this isn't a terrible album. I gave it two stars, because anything's better than listening to that b*tch Vanessa Carlton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music for people who don't care about Music!","review":"This, like the rest of her crap, is boring garbage designed to hit whatever market might be hot at the moment. When Nirvana cracked the mainstream with some vicious riffs & basically started the big \\"alternative\\" scene, this neverwillbe got her wimped-out aldult contemporary inoffensive snooze-a-thon played on alternative/avant garde programs, and people actually went for it. All hype.You probably aren't up to listening to anything with any balls, or really any true feeling, anyway. That's why you're checking Alanis out. So buy this. It's so light and poppy! I would rather find something for a straight man to listen to.Last piece of advice-just read this review over and over, and save your money. It's much better art than the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same nonsense from Alanis Morissette","review":"Alanis Morissette seems to be in denial of her 30th birthday on June 1. Morissette continues to write lame 8th-grade-style songs about past lovers while being backed by equally lame music. Morissette has failed to offer us anything refreshing since 1995's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" masterpiece, which I think is proof Morissette has grown tired and boring after just one album."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the number one CD...","review":"it doesn't say much for the music industry these days. I listened to a song on Real Rhapsody and thank God I did. I wouldn't pay 2 cents for this garbage. UCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Lets get this straight at the outset - I LOVE Alanis.Her first album was without a doubt one of the most powerful female debuts ever. Her follow up album (Supposed former blah blah), was to be quite honest - dirge. About 18 tracks, 5 of which had any tune worth humming (ironic really, considering it spawned the stunning Thank You).Then came Under Rug Swept. A happier, more commercial and brilliant cd. Nt as angst rideen as Jagged little Pill and not as innovative, but a great album non-the-less.Which brings me onto this, her 4th album (excl. the Canadian releases).This is NOT a good album. It lies somewhere between the 2nd album (remember- the dirge) and the 3rd. Half of it is virtually tuneless, the other half is 'nice'.She always has so much to say for herself - sometimes Alanis, LESS IS MORE!!!!A big disappointment. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Only three songs","review":"I could want to listen the following three songs more than once1. Eight Easy steps2. Excuses3. Knees on my bees.Did anyone hear the sessions at AOL version of Excuses, it is 10 times better than the original. She should invclude it as a regular song in her next CD just like she did with hands clean.She should also bring that out as a single.The eight easy steps of Sessions at AOL is also good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Alanis?","review":"Unfortunately, with Alanis, she was exposed to TOO MUCH success from the beginning, and has failed to live up to the reputation ever since. \\"So Called Chaos\\" is a collection of dull, boring, poetic based songs, that Alanis has sung about far too many times before. It's like she's recycling old lyrics to new music. The music is dull, no feel to it, and Alanis, while her voice still sounds good, just fails miserably at making it work this time around. This is her 4th or 5th studio release? I haven't seen good work from her since the mid 1990's."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS","review":"i got her CD jagged little pill when it came out years ago and it was my personal anthem... I had to replace it about three times and counting. Even still when i hear her orginal CD on the radio I drop everything and go to a standstill. with that said I cannot be the only disapointed in whats happening to this artist. This crap is solid bubblegum. Its way better then her last few CD\\"s IN A WAY. she seems so SELF INVOLVED to me I seriously dont understand this progression from her First CD to what \\" has become of her\\" in all the music released since'.I AM STILL WAITING for a REAL CD from this woman.... like everyone else. Instead of this CD purchase some cool new music by someone just starting out IN the SPIRIT of what alantis almost WAS \\"ALMOST\\"... as i write this my 12 year old daughter just shut off this new CD \\"Chaos\\" saying \\" UGH GAD THIS IS TOO ANNOYING\\". .. and she ADORES Jagged little pill~!(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So called rip off!","review":"What do you call a CD publisher who neglects to list the CD time length on the outside of the pkg, so you only find out that it's only half a CD after you open the pkg and are out the bucks, a rip off. At only 41 mins. and with only a few good songs, sorry but I feel burned. And whats with Alanis pimping AOL? Releasing this 41 min. CD seems like a giant step backwards in terms of giving value for the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"so called crap","review":"I bought this for my young teenager and decided to give it a listen. I own her first and second CDs (not really, but her first & second post cutesy pop CDs) and still enjoy them. Seems like she is trying to grow as an artist and performer, but it just comes off appearing self absorbed and seeking pity. Don't waste your money, evidently she has plenty already and it will probably just make her more unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Alanis purchase","review":"If the lyrics were removed from this album I challenge anyone to tell when one song ends and the next begins. It's very much a typical Morrisette album full of 50 cent words and plenty of \\"spoken\\" lyrics. Under Rug Swept was at least salvageable with a few gems to make it worth the purchase. There is nothing catchy or worth saving on this cd. It is simply boring. I think I liked her better when she was depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY UNORIGINAL","review":"Alanis' video for \\"Everything\\" is a COMPLETE rip-off of latin singer Jarabe de Palo's video for \\"Bonito\\". I could not believe my eyes when i saw it. This totally lowers my expectations for her album and for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"Alanis' has yet to disappoint on the albums she has put out, and So Called Chaos continues what was started with Jagged Little Pill - and offers a collection of lyrically poignant and introspective commentary on relationships and love, to memorable hooks. Stand out tracks include 'Excuses', 'Doth I protest too much' (excellent!), 'This Grudge' and 'Spineless' (where does this woman come up with these brilliant lyrics?) This is a CD you will play over and over, in your car and in you home; you will sing along to it, laugh to it and cry to it, it is Alanis at her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't call it a comeback","review":"But it is definitely better than Under Rug Swept.I just bought the album, so it is still sinking in.The title track SO-CALLED CHAOS is awesome.More reporting to come...I think I like Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie more, but the jury is still out."},{"rating":"1","title":"so called disappointment","review":"I'm running into Best Buy thinking how great the new alanis album will be...and then...wham...reality check...I don't like song 1...or song 2...ok I like song 2...kinda...then so on...no, no, no, don't like, don't like, don't like. So here I am upset. What happened to the timeless hooks of Supposed Former? What happened to the massive choruses on Under Rug Swept? Sure, Under Rug was eh compared to Supposed, but it still rocked. All I wanted was one \\"Hands Clean\\". Just one little \\"Hands Clean\\". But no...I got \\"Everything\\" else and wasn't happy about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This album is my favorite since Alanis's 'Jagged Little Pill'. It is very melodic and upbeat and has her usual great lyrics. She is not experimenting with as much weird musical stuff as in a few of her past albums which I consider to be good. It speaks to my heart in a deep simple way (which is the hardest music to write). My favorite songs from the album have been changing as I pay more attention to the later tracks but 'Eight Easy Steps' has always remained at the top of my list. Overall, this is an album worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Not what I was expecting , but it still is better than elevator xmas music ....

I think the detailing is very good and there are many ways you can play with this toy for hours of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"For kids only","review":"I remember getting this and being quite disappointed. The figure sculpt isn't nearly as good as the original Darth Maul figure. The \\"fighting\\" action when you press the buttons is pretty unrealistic. Also, because the arms are so loose to allow that \\"action,\\" you can't pose the figure without the lightsaber hilt. Overall, I'd only recommend this to young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just get the Tatooine Maul instead","review":"I got this Darth Maul first because the Jedi duel was sold out everywhere.I guess that the figure is OK. The action is good, but you have to be careful with the arms if you remove the elastic from around the lightsaber- it's like he has no bones.As for the lightsaber flicking action, well, that's kinda corny, but I suppose it appeals to the kids.Get the Tatooine Darth Maul- the best version, in my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"A paean to what once was","review":"I saw her dance once, and I still dream of that night. Balanchine was at his peak, and Allegra Kent was more than his principal dancer - she was his muse, his passion, his nemesis. And her dancing was incredible. Once a Dancer, Kent's autobiography, chronicles the strange world of famous ballerinas, plagued as most of them are by anorexia, domineering stage mothers, vulnerability to dance gurus, plastic surgery, and a long, long series of self-destructive behavior. Wonderful sketches of other luminaries from her era are included, plus photos, but it's the end of the book that one remembers: the poignancy of someone of Allegra Kent's talents looking back on her life and appreciating in retrospect all that she once was, is heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, wise and whimsical dancer's candid biography","review":"Ms. Kent is brilliant, playful and constantly explores the internal and external worlds in which she lives. This was evident in her dancing, and it's evident in her writing. At times, it is almost too painful to read her candid accounts of her own self-doubts, fears and hardships, but she leavens them with such humor and whimsical philosophy that you end up smiling through your tears. This book, unlike many books written by dancers, explores not only Ms. Kent's evolution as an artist, but also as a woman. I'd recommend it to all who have an interest in learning to live their lives to the fullest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very insparational book","review":"I was such a great book to read. I've read it twice so far. Sometimes when I didn't really want to dance I read a few pages of the book and it inspired me to go out and try as hard as I could. I am not much of a autobiography person, but this book was so enyoyable. I think I will continue to read ot over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"Not only is this a wonderful look into the personal and professional development of an incredible dancer, it is also an honest, beautifully written portrait of an artist's life. Allegra Kent is not only one of the most magnificent dancers of all time, she is also a very talented writer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once a Dancer - By Allegra Kent","review":"excellent product. came in perfect condition and quickly too! This was a GREAT book! It was hard to put it down. So glad I made the choice to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Allegra","review":"I first saw Allegra Kent perform with the New York City Ballet when I was five years old, and it was in large part her performance that turned me into an instant ballet fan. The beautiful Ms. Kent--whose autobiography is an entertaining and sometimes poignant account of life in the competitive, back breaking world of professional dance--was one of George Balanchine's celebrated muses, and one of the most brilliant ballerinas of the 1950s and '60s. She could be alternately lyrical and funny, frightening and sensuous, ethereal and earthy; her pliant, stretchy body and dramatic flair made her a fascinating purveyor of the Balanchine style. Her life story, complete with the ups and downs of family life, motherhood, a rocky marriage, and the intense pressure of working with some of the groundbreaking dancers of mid-20th-century America, is presented in unsparing detail...making it an engrossing read for all balletophiles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex for my children","review":"My 9 year old son loves shakespeare, he is starting to learn shakespeare in school.

Unfortunately the Ramones test this premise on 'Acid Eaters' with mixed results. This is a Ramones cover album of 1960s tunes. Some songs like 'Substitute' work very well, and others -- like Bob Dylan's 'My Back Pages' simply don't fit the fast and loud transition. The Ramones have always chosen their covers well (Their version of 'Needles and Pins' may be the definitive one), but the selection of songs here is a let-down. If you could choose only one Stones song for the Ramones to cover, would you have chosen 'Out of Time'..?

I use it daily in my car and take it with me on business trips. Battery life is OK with regular CDs and excellent with MP3 CDs. One of the reasons I originally bought this instead of the Slim-X is because I can use AA sized NiMh rechargable batteries. I bring along my recharger and AA batteries for this and my digital camera. You can find a charger and batteries on sale for about $15 - $20 and up depending on the charging time. Although the lid may seem \\"flimsy\\", the player has held up well despite many plane and car trips. I take it everywhere.The sound quality is great, I have yet to find a disc that it won't play and the remote works fine.

This book focused more on Niccoleta and less on David Parker. Mr. Romkey made it a point to show just how evil and depraved she really is. If you're a David Parker fan, you'll be a little disappointed. He's not in much of the book. The David Parker in this book is a shadow of his former self. He's pretty pathetic. But, I think that just shows how powerful Niccoleta really is. Even David agrees that he's no match for her. I would love to see another book where David Parker goes up against her. That would be a hell of a fight. The whole cruise thing is kinda over the top. There are so many characters that it's a bit hard to follow at times, especially the part about the voodoo priest. What's that all about?? I really recommend the book, because you get a feel for Niccoleta.

The only thing the same from Martin Cruz Smith's works are their high level of excitement, interesting characters and plot development. Havana Bay lives up to Smith's past work. What he does best is gives the reader an insiders' view of a society totally different than what the audience is used to. Whether it be Cuba in this novel, Japan in December 4th: A Novel, or the Soviet Union in Gorky Park, with his characters on the verge of an exciting adventure for the reader to be a part of.Another fun read from Smith.

As Arkady Renko slides in and out of ruined buildings and the murky pollution of Havana Bay so too this novel evokes the destruction of greed and the loneliness and depravity of the soul.That this most Russian atmosphere is set in Havana, Cuba in the bright glare of the tropical sun is Martin Cruz Smith's statement of the enduring and universal nature of human depravity.But the heaviness of the novel is offset by the brilliance of detail, the writer's descriptions of Havana and its inhabitants, and of the sociology of life under the reign of Castro. The seduction of the small love story and the unravelling of motives, actions and consequences make this a most worthwhile investment of a reader's time and imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuba without the crisis","review":"I thought \\"Stallions Gate\\" was one of the best books I ever read. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this book even though I have always liked the character of Arkady. It can't be the shift to warmer weather when the typically morose detective can't generate more than a yawner of a climax to the who (or why) done it. Choose this one if your main interest is a current description of the sites and sounds of Havana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant insights on Cuban culture","review":"Havana Bay is the first Arkady book I've read, and it really makes me feel like I've been missing out on something great. The quality of the prose is so much better than most books of this type, and the authors rendering of time and place is phenomenal. I've been to Cuba and spend a lot of time absorbing Cuban culture through music, dance, reading, etc. Havana Bay is without a doubt the most comprehensive and knowledgable treatment of Cuba in a popular novel maybe ever. P.S. If you liked this book you'll love Outcast by Jose Latour, a Cuban writer and practitioner of 'Cuban noir.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense Plot, Turgid Pace Make for Sloggishness","review":"HAVANA BAY is a complete waste of time. Worse, it wastes the vitality of Smith's wonderful creation, Arkady Renko. True, Smith has never been one for pace and fluid plot mechanics, but his latest is so bogged down in uninteresting facets such as Havana's detailed history and a muder investigation with absolutely no immediacy to it that it turns banal and boring, with ridiculous, overreaching delusions of grandeur. The pits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Havana Bay weaves a spellbinding tale ...","review":"... that challenges your willpower to put the book down at the end of the day.A solid read written in such a manner that you can feel on your skin the soft breezes coming from the open Bay and the sweaty air of the close quarters in Havana, in your soul the characters' pains from the circumstances in which they find themselves, and in your mind the belief that you too are under the ever-present, watchful eye of the Bearded One as you follow each character through the Cuban venues so vividly illustrated by the author's words.This story starves you to read or re-read the author's other works that allow you to follow the steps of Arkady Renko."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disapointment","review":"I loved Polar Star, Red Square and Gorky Park, but this book was a real disapointment. The plot was ridiculous. In the middle of this \\"thriller\\" I was trully bored. This is a mere shadow of Smith's earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Tired of Arkady","review":"Either Arkady is getting *extremely* tired or I'm tired of him. He seems to go down hill with every book.What really annoyed me about this book is the Spanish which is not translated for those of us who have a language \\"deficiency.\\"Arkady may be Mr. Smith's bread winner, but \\"Stallion Gate\\" and \\"Rose\\" were much better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Unhappy","review":"I have never received this item nor have I received any communications about this item from the vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather too put-downable...","review":"Hasn't any one noticed? This book is supposed to be a thriller. But it's slow. An interesting setting is one thing, but when it overwhelms the action, then you're not getting a thriller any more, but a travel book. I'd rather get my hard information on Cuba from a non-fiction source, thank you. In short: not enough fun in the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"If you love Arkady and his unique style of investigation, then the rich detail of Cuban life and politics this book is one gigantic plus. It is a great read. I just wish Mr. Smith would write them faster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Novel....Great Look at Havana","review":"The story is a good one, although I spent most of the book trying to figure out just what was happening and where the story was going. But not to worry....it all came together very well at the end.The real strength of this novel, however, is the feel one gets for today's Havana. The ancient automobiles, the decaying buildings, the miserable economy, the corruption and the post-revolutionary/post-Russian mindsets of the people are all described in wonderful albeit depressing detail.This book has been on my \\"to read\\" list for some time. I am glad I finally got around to it. It is a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy sequel to Red Square and Gorky Park","review":"I enjoyed both Gorky Park and Red Square but was immensely disappointed by both Polar Star and Havana Bay, which follow these books respectively in the Renko series. Whereas GP and RS tended to be fast moving thrillers, I felt bored by the over descriptiveness found in Havana Bay and by the lack of action. The suicidal Renko character in this book is no help either. Putting a Russian character that doesn't speak Spanish in Cuba was a huge mistake that Cruz-Smith was unable to overcome. In short don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Havana Play","review":"Smith captures a romantic notion of Havana from both the late 1950's (pre-Castro) and the early years of the Special Period. Readers familiar with Cuba now will be a bit disappointed with the slightly outdated descriptions of Havana and Cuban life. Current conditions on the island are not as desperate and erotic as Havana Bay would lend one to believe. Also the Cuban secret police seems to be notoriously lax and I can't imagine how Arkady Renko made it past immigration and customs at Jose Marti. Nonetheless, those looking for a post-Cold War novel brimming with intrigue and suspense will not find better material. Unlike Le Carre, Smith seems to have adjusted well to the New World Order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Gorky Park and Red Square Instead","review":"What was pivotal to Gorky Park and Red Square is casually dismissed in the first 30 pages or so of this book. The other novels were, in the end, love stories with a rock-solid backdrop of intrigue. Better this was left as a trilogy. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"John LeCarre move over!","review":"Cruz Smith's best since Gorky Park. Protaganist, Arkady Renko, wounded though he is, manages to rise to the occasion in his pursuit of identifying a fellow Russian pulled from the waters of Havana Bay. Set in today's Cuba, with its beauty and crumbling decay wrought by years of communism, our hero teams up with a beautiful Cuban policewoman and becomes embroiled in a world where Russians are despised. Throw the rituals of Santeria into the mix and you have a recipe for murder, deceit, and perhaps reasons for Arkady to get his life back on track. A wonderful read with great characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from such a good writer","review":"Although the writing, characterizations and creating of atmosphere are flawless in this book, and demonstrate how much talent Cruz Smith has, the most important element of any work of fiction is a plot. A plot that can be understood by the reader. This is where this book fails terribly. At the end, I still wasn't quite sure what went on. Perhaps this was the author's intent, but I like to know what a story was about by the time I finish a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I found the plot of this book boring and very slow moving. This was no thriller as in the previous 'Renko' books - I struggled to get through it, hoping that it would improve but was disappointed when it didn't. Renko was worn out and it showed with this dull book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruz Gets Some Serious Religious Matters Wrong","review":"I was looking forward to reading HAVANA BAY because Havana, the musics and the many religions of Cuba matter a great deal to me and my friends.I was shocked and disappointed that not only once, but several times, it is announced in HAVANA BAY that the Abakua religion is from the Congo region of Africa, when even the most elementary book on African Diaspora religions will inform you correctly that the Abakua come from the Calabar region of what we now know as Cameroon, close to present-day Nigeria. Cruz also wrote about the religions as if they were some sort of cheap Hollywood horror venture; nor, despite putting so much of this in the novel did it actually bear upon the plot.This is not the best book that Cruz has written. It reads too much as though the author was plugging in his research to fit his plot template, rather than having the plot emerge from something he knew well, and respected, if not loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in a Rut","review":"Mr. Smith has a beautiful gift with the use of descriptions to paint mavelous pictures. His plot,at least in this book, takes a loooong time to take off and by that time I really didn't give a hoot about Havana or the Bay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! A page turner that finally gets Cuba right","review":"As a frequent traveller to Cuba I have been put off by any novel that uses Cuba as mere background. Martin Cruz Smith's characters, whether Cuban, Russian or American- are as richly rendered as Graham Greene's. Inspector Arkady is fragile yet effective. Present day Havana is felt on every page- the faded colors, the changing light, the evocative scent. Havana Bay is a novel full of surprises- it returned me to Cuba and well beyond. The author's brilliant portrayal of Fidel Castro in the climax is both riveting and revealing. -Al Gowan, author of SANTIAGO RAG, a novel of the Spanish-Cuban-American war of 1898, also available at Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich on atmosphere, but the plot is a mess","review":"I liked the descriptions of Cuba -- evocative and interesting. It was a good idea to put Arkady in Cuba, a country that is connected to Russia in its shared history, but is its polar opposite in culture and climate. I was frustrated with the story because it meandered, confused and, after plodding through it, the ending was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a nice place to visit -or live there","review":"Smith uses his elegance with the language to capture both the corruption and corrosion of today's Havana - and he does it with an intriguing story that's totally believable. Humour, too, adds to the story-telling, as does the hyperbole (the potholes on Havana streets can be seen from the moon)all of which keep you riveted until the final page. Great stuff in the tradition of Graham Green and John LeCarre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Martin Cruz Smith","review":"A good detective story and a view of Cuban life which is rare. Arkady Renko comes through again. An entertaining read, well written of course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape garbled","review":"I found it difficult to follow this book because the third tape was defective and I had to skip it.

Where it says PA, PA never sung a word on that Born Into The 90's album. MGM did. After R. Kelly & MGM won big break Jive Records signed R. Kelly & MGM. In 1991 R. Kelly & MGM completed Born Into The 90's album. Shortly after Jive records silently replaced MGM with PA. R. Kelly went back into the studio and redid the lead vocals by changing the MGM wording to PA. They kept MGM's vocals on the album. This is a fact as I have R. Kelly & MGM's Why U Wanna Play 12\\" single and vocals are the same as that were on Born Into The 90's album. Also Marc McWilliams from MGM told me that MGM did the album. I then checked it out by listening to their single from 1990, then Born Into The 90's album and Marc is 100% right."},{"rating":"2","title":"R in R&B Collection 1 by R.

The story is very mature, and I thought it was a fresh take on gay relationships. It is also very funny! One of my only criticisms is that the production budget seemed very low - maybe that's why the scenes sometimes look stiff and the acting feels a bit staged. Despite those flaws, I really had a great time watching this movie. Oh, and the young actor playing the lead is gorgeous - with a beautiful body and totally adorable smile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had never assumed that \\"low budget\\" would be synonymous with \\"low quality\\" until I watched Angora Ranch","review":"Horrendous acting, poor cinematography, uninspired dialogue, and the list goes on. I had never assumed that \\"low budget\\" would be synonymous with \\"low quality\\" until I watched Angora Ranch. On a scale of 1 to 10 (in ascending order), I would give \\"Private Romeo\\" a 10 and leave Angora Ranch at 1. The theme of Angora Ranch that age is no barrier to finding true love was somewhat sweet, I will give it that. The execution, though, was, in a word, deplorable. I didn't enjoy watching it and I certainly wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute storyline, but the final product is poor","review":"After I had read the summary of the story I was really happy that there was finally a gay theme movie about relationship with an age gap in the background.But then I started to watch and realized in a blink of an eye that the final product is quite miserable.The low budget factor is visible in every single minute of this film. But it is not the worst. And it is not the reason I give it only 2 stars.It is the acting.It seems as if 95% of the crew was cought in the street and set in front of the camera...The last 5% is reserved to Tim Jones who portrayed Jack's father (btw, he past away year after the film was released).Unfortunately, it is hard not to notice that he was too young to play a 60 year old pa (check out the scene where he appears chest naked - hottie).Well, I would lie if I wrote that I didn't enjoy it. But I wouldn't book for it a place in my dvdteque neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great....too many flaws to mention","review":"Poor production values, a lame script and some heartfelt but otherwise lacklustre performances all contribute to drag down what could have been a good story. If the characters were any more one dimensional they'd be cardboard. The whole thing is so over simplified in the set-ups and then the acting doesn't help the story's credibility at all. Truly a shame.With a different cast and a better screenwriter this story may have had a chance. It wants to be The Sum Of Us, and it ends up not adding up to enough to hold a movie together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet spirit, but unwatchable","review":"This movie's intentions are SO good that I really wanted to like it, but everything about it is SO bad that I just couldn't. The story is okay, but the dialog is maudlin and unbelievable, and the acting is painful to watch. The problem isn't lack of money, it's lack of talent. Many good movies have been made with no money, but this isn't one of them.The only good thing I can find to say about it is that both Thomas Romano and Paul Bright are attractive and likeable men. But neither of them can act, and the other two actors are just unwatchable. Angora Ranch is about as excruciating as any movie I've ever seen. Its spirit is sweet, and I wish its makers well, but I can't recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad acting","review":"The actors and the dialogue in this movie are very very bad.

The acting,if one could call it that, is beyond amateurish,it's cringe inducing. The heavy handed and wink-wink, oh so cute script is truly terrible. That someone would actually provide funding for such a piece of dreck is beyond reasoning.If you want to see an excellent gay film, purchase \\"Shelter\\" it's flawless!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing waste of time and money","review":"Too bad . . . this movie has narrow market appeal and I like to support such efforts, but I am ashamed to own such a feature as this. Low-budget isn't an excuse. It took four minutes for me to realize that the acting by the small cast, not to mention the silly screenplay, were abysmal. An utter disappointment.

My friends and I just shook our heads in dismay when we watched this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"The only good thing about this movie is the plot.

I had been laboring under the impression that Throwing Copper was the debut album, and what a debut! I put this one on and thought, Yuck! What the Hell happened to these guys?

Listening to this album again, which I went back and bought after the bizarrely sublime The Distance to Here, I realized that I should give Live some credit, because they've come a long way from the lyrical inanity and pinheaded instrumentation of this substandard release. It's a good thing Live set aside or at least toned-down their half-baked Eastern philosophy and self-righteous preaching and posturing for their next two CDs, \\"Throwing Copper\\" and \\"Secret Samdhi,\\" which both thankfully explore darker and more compelling themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live was good before they got famous","review":"Live was a good band before they got famous. This is their first album and their best. The other albums are a bunch of junk that tries to be deep, but the songs don't many any sense.

The songs are simple and honest and shows what the band was before they got pretentious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The foundation for what comes later, solid as a rock.","review":"I ran out to buy this the moment I heard the first released track. I wanted something new so bad. This album delivered a band that hadn't been corrupted by money or fame yet.

Buy it and you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best LIVE ever made ...","review":"This is the best album Live made up to now.

I'll admit beforehand, I did not get very far. What I want to comment on is the growing trend in games that in order to celebrate the detail in the graphics, the behind the player camera angle is so close it takes about 15 minutes of play before vertigo sets in and your checking to see if a barf bag is handy. The new Dawn of Mana game is one of the worst offenders of this. The Mana series of games have been some of the best, but I am putting this one up on Ebay and selling it. It is just unbearable.I suspect the over zealous game reviews on games like this are nothing more than the efforts of pre-game launch hype. I am dissapointed that Square Enix did not deliver. As I remember the first in the series \\"Secret on Mana\\", a very hard to find game I might add, I wonder why they struck out so bad on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"After my seventh viewing...","review":"Simply one of my favorite movies ever. A Grimm's fairy tale cast from the shadow of the Spanish Civil War. The more I watch it the more it's flaws seem to girder it's strengths. This movie will make you squirm--the realism adds depth to the fantasy and vice versa--each fairy tale told reflected in the 'real' world of the story. More so, Guillermo clearly tips his hat to at least two other great movies: \\"The Shining\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Echo* indeed.*A rather obscure reference to the word Ofelia calls out as she descends the staircase in Faun's lair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shame on me for not watching it sooner!","review":"I purchased this movie months ago and it sat on a shelf. The first time I tried to watch it, I realized it was in Spanish with English subtitles and I quickly returned it to the shelf to save for a rainy day.Shame on me.Pan's Labyrinth is a magical tale of heartbreak, pride and resurrection. A spectacular film with beautiful cinematography and effects, superb actors and a magnificent audio track combine for one of the finest films I have seen to date. It's a shame that I did not watch it sooner.Do not let this movie's language discourage you. It is well worth your time to read every bit of the subtitles.A fine addition to any film collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful in Nearly Every Way!!","review":"I won't waste your time outling the plot of this film, since so many reviewers before me have done that so well. What I will say is this is a truly remarkable film that effortlessly fuses a beautiful fairy tale with the harsh and foreboding realities of Franco-era fascism in Spain. The hope of humanity is pinned on the discipline and curiosity of a young girl as she discovers her magical past as a luminous princess, and earns her way back into the immortal life from which she came. The parallels to Christianity and the resurrection of Christ are pretty obvious, but do not impair the magic of this wonderful tale. A highly recommended film, but probably not suitable for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"ofelias story","review":"i got my movie in meant conditions its a great movie i loveeee it. its a must wacth.this is an amazing fairy tale seems so real in spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the best movies of recent years","review":"The NTSC region 1 blu-ray looks terrible. too much noise reduction smeared it's colors and contrast completely and created ugly artifacts...Get the pal region 2 version. it's way better than this crap.5 stars for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense subject matter","review":"This was the most emotionally wrenching film I've seen in a long time. The extremes of storytelling are all presented here - the madness of war, abusive relationships, violence on children. And yet all of these components are very deftly woven to tell this story without scaring off the audience. You genuinely want to see a fruitful ending to this nightmare. Whether or not you get it is, I suppose, the point of this tragic tale. In any case, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is tired of the typically watered down, antiseptic, hollywood trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sort of Fairy Tale","review":"This is on my top ten for all time faves. I love the story and the acting is brilliant. My favourite scenes are those with the faun and the little girl and the \\"enchanting\\" secret world only she can see.

A girl whose mother marries a Spanish fascist tries to cope with her stepfather's brutal personality, a servant's assistance to the resistance and her mother's poor health. The magic helps project a world that is much safer and comforting than the real world. A very moving movie and I just love it.

I really disliked she didn't even go into the \\"other realm\\" more then 3 times. Unfortunately throughout the movie there is torture and a LOT of gore. Most of the story line is about the little girl's horrible life and how she tries to cope with it. I actually hated how they ended the movie and disliked how I suffered through the whole thing WHILE paying to watch it.All in all, don't watch this if you have a weak stomach, dislike drama, and very dark tales. This is one of those I don't recommend to children under the age of 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I did not know that this was in Spanish with English subtitles. Had I known, I would have never purchased it. Just trying to read the titles was a distraction other than that, it was probably a good movie.

Very very disappointed about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Piece of Crap","review":"When I came to this site to review, I was NOT SURPRISED to see 54 one star reviews already. I stopped the movie at the first brutally violent (and totally unnecessary ) scene, with the intuitive knowledge that there would be repetitions of this kind of sickness. I see from the other reviews I was correct. I wasted my time and money, and got my expectations up that this would be along the lines of a well made fantasy... it had all potential to be... i for one would like ratings for violence and cruelty in movies from now on!

IT'S IN SPANISH!!Other then that the popcorn was the only good thing about the evening"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Fairy Tale","review":"\\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" may have won many Oscars, but it is gory, overly detailed and just depressing to watch. It shows sadistic behavior and painful situations over and over. This is not my idea of entertainment. The setting is Spain in 1944 and a little girl's belief in fairy tales in a grim and stark time. She has lost her father, her mother is pregnant and very ill, and her stepfather is a brutal Fascist officer. He is only using her mother to have a son to pass on his name and legacy. He could care less about little ten year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). How she finds any happiness at all is what the story seems to focus on. It is just a sad, bad movie that tries to be deep and meaningful. It depresses and fails to strike a chord of any redeeming value.Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Overrated","review":"I suppose the director of this film thought that if he put in some magical special effects, it would make this movie something special. Unfortunately, the main story is filled with characters who are two-dimensional stereotypes (the evil man, the saintly mother, the housekeeper with a secret). Although little Ofelia's fantasies are quite amazing and wonderful, they don't make up for a film that is brutal and dull at its core. This was a great disappointment to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare for nightmares.","review":"VERY DARK! My husband and I were both excrutiatingly disturbed by this film. We stopped watching after 20 minutes. It started sweetly, with moody images of a lonely, little girl on her voyage to the country and discovery of an old stone carving and deserted stone labrynth. PLEASE BE WARNED that there is a VERY GRAPHIC MURDER SCENE about 20 minutes into the film. We had to stop the DVD because it is SO DISTURBING! I don't know WHY ANYONE would make a film like this, and how others find this entertaining. VERY DARK! VERY DISTURBING! I have had nightmares, and can honestly say that this is the MOST DISTURBING scene I have EVER scene in a film. It should NOT be associated with the term \\"fairy tale.\\" It is a HAUNTING, HORROR story disguised as as entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fantasy part seems totally irrelevant","review":"I'm amazed at the good reviews this movie got. It was a really long, dull journey for me. I wasn't convinced at all by the fantasy part and didn't see how it was linked to the real world. At times, it seemed almost irrelevant and cheesy. Did the director just forget to develop the fantasy world? He did a poor job tying all the elements and telling a good story. The little girl also can't act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Even if this film was meant to be an \\"adult\\" fairy tale--it was still way too violent. There was a lot of unnecessary violence, such as the murder of the hunters/farmers. Yes, they had to be killed for the purpose of the story, but did the son have to be killed that way? I'm sure the point still would've come through. It was just gratuitous violence. Plus, I found the characters to be one dimensional, especially \\"mean\\" Capt. Lopez (Ofelia's stepfather), \\"obedient\\" Carmen (Ofelia's mother), and even \\"defiant\\" Ofelia herself. The only character who had some depth was the housekeeper. In my book, this was NOT the best picture of the year as some critics are making it out to be. That would go to \\"Little Children.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...","review":"Weak. Very weak. This movie is such crap. The director has done some decent films and this isnt one of them....This movie isnt watchable. Its 2 hours of your life you will never get back. The cast is all unknowns. The story is such hogwash. Its just thrown together for a movie. They spent their beer budget for a few parties to make this film. Even the special effects cant save it from the storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, but poor quality","review":"I love this movie. It's 5 stars. But the video on demand quality was horrible, so let me be clear that that's what I'm rating. The audio was very low and the video quality was even worse. This was the first time I've rented a movie from Amazon. And unless I figured out what the problem was, the last. Just to make sure it wasn't the laptop, we put in a blu ray movie from redbox and it played beautifully. May have been the free hotel wifi that had something to do with it, but I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea: Give me more, please!","review":"Overall, despite being a foriegn flick with subtitles, this was an incredibly captivating movie, both story & visually. I was surprised because it was good enough to have me glued to the TV.This is not a fantasy movie for children, with its dark undertones. This is an adult movie, even though the story is focused on a young girl .The girl, I think about ten or so years old, must weave her way through surreal and dangerous tasks that have been set before her to complete so she may be reunited with her REAL father and not be trapped on earth (trying not to give the whole story away).Visually, a stunning movie, great acting, interesting characters, solid story. Though I felt the ending was a little weak.I would purchase this movie for my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting story","review":"This is a cross between Alice in Wonderland and Lebrechaun with a tiny touch of SAW. It is set in the time either during or the ending of of the civil war in Spain for the territory of the Basque Country. With hidden treasures and lessons for a little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"pans labyrinth","review":"Great story, ready to follow. English subtitles helped alot!! This its the first time I sat through the whole movie, and I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant And Original","review":"Despite not usually liking fantasy, I watched this on a recommendation. Previous reviewers have already provided more than sufficient analysis and I agree with most of the praise given. I would like to point out, though, that the DVD is worth buying for the extras alone. Guillermo del Toro is an engaging character and his interview, background knowledge, beliefs and film making techniques made a second viewing of the film even more enjoyable.One note of warning. Parents may be lulled by the cover and marketing into believing that this is a straightforward fantasy film. It isn't. It contains a few scenes of extreme, quite shocking violence. That apart, great film, worth several viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Horrible horrible movie...","review":"Just watched Pan's Labyrinth. I really don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. It was violent. The fantasy aspect was destroyed by all the ridiculous amounts of blood and gore. It seemed really... well... gratuitous. Seeing the gore didn't advance the plot. It was just a spectacle of yuckiness.Don't understand why all my geeky fantasy-loving friends were so adamant about it being freakin' awesome. The director is so whingingly emo that I would be eager to help him cut himself while crying bitter tears of blood, poetically smudging his khol-black mascara, lipstick and nail polish. Yeah."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles","review":"I was so upset to find that this was spanish with english subtitles. None of the most helpful reviews tell you this, so be sure to pay close attention to the information that amazon does supply. You just have to read it for yourself. I want this movie in english sooooo bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a very good movie to me","review":"This movie was billed as a fantasy movie and as it turns out is about 10% fantasy and 90% war. Truly this was unnecessarily violent and brutal at times. I don't think any of the characters were that interesting either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish language with English subtitles","review":"Wow, what happened? I ended up with a DVD with Spanish language and have to read English subtitles. This is very annoying and distracts from enjoying the movie. The info on this movie says it is in English language. Am I the only one with this problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic, magical, and historically inaccurate","review":"As riveting as a car wreck. Sometimes you struggle to look away. One of only three foreign language films that made me forget I was reading subtitles.However, it made the Spanish Civil War seem to be a war between good and evil, when we know it was a war between two evils. Those commies (and their anarchist brethren) were just as brutal as the fascists. Nevertheless, see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful depressing movie","review":"I like the fact that they have made a fairy tale with a darker plot. I'm tired of these popcorn Disney fairy tales as much as the next guy. The movie itself was beautifully done, and was a visual feast. The acting was amazing. But I watch a movie to be entertained and all this one did was depress. From beginning to the very end i kept hoping the movie would have maybe a couple of cheerful moments or that maybe something good would happen for the main character and no such relief was ever at hand. I'm sorry but if i want to see someone tormented for two hours, I'd at least like something good to come of it by the end of the movie. For those of you who feel that it deserves five stars I really got to ask, are you tormented yourself, or just really into pain?"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like it","review":"This is a morbid and pretentious film. A fairy tale that champions brutality under the guise of condemning it.I can understand del Toro has no love for the Phalange, but to cloak his politics into a morbid tale serves (at least as far as this reviewer is concerned) no purpose.i give him an extra star for sound effects, tho'. And for the sheer eeriness and unpleasantness of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"gratuitus and predictable","review":"As a lover of fantasy, I was disappointed in Pan's Labyrinth. The faun wasn't a faun but a cross between a faun and a minataur. No faun-like revelling here.Great special effects if you like to see graphic violence.Completely predictable plot. Of course you MUST believe in life after death to be able to consider it remotely worth the uncomfortableness of watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Not the worst film I've ever seen but certainly the one I hated the most.I don't remember too much since I erased this despicable garbage as much as I could from my brain, but I'm convinced there is no good scene in this entire thing. Logic is completely absent, the monster ist stolen from a Tool video, the only likeable character DIES in the end.I will never watch another del Toro film in my life. All the dvd copies of this disgusting garbage should be bought up and destroyed, along with the source material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak Horror Story Masquerading As Fairy Tale","review":"After reading the rave reviews this film received, I was eager to see this fantasy film. What a waste of two hours. Instead of watching an inspired fable, I was subjected to scenes of graphic beatings, tortures, and shootings. This was not a dark fantasy with realistic war elements; it was a brutal story of inhumanity with small doses of fantasy thrown into the mix.I'm no prude - I can stomach violence and gore if it serves the overall story. In this case, I could find little to redeem the explicit violence and bleak storyline.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To LIE When Promoting a Film","review":"What was billed as a children's fantasy was actually a bloody and horribly sadistic tale of Fascist Black Shirts torturing and murdering resistance fighters.Only 20% of the film takes place in the girl's fantasy.A more truthful cover for the dvd would be of a bound guy having his hand snipped apart with a pair of cable cutters.Incredibly depressing film. Skip it and drink the potassium cyanide instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad","review":"I freely admit that I must be missing something in this film. Really wanted to like it, but I couldn't draw much out of it. There wasn't enough fantasy and the real-world scenes were heavy-handed. Nothing epic about another cliche story of good revolutionaries versus bad facists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely & Misterious","review":"From the lovers of fairy tales & the thirsty followers of the history; it is an extraordinary mix that reveal the precise explaination, that the pure inocence of a child, still bursting of imagination, gives to the end of the spanish civil war. It was not the braveness of one side or the other that was figthing. It was the desire to find their dreams of this little people that was in between what gives this end to the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem.","review":"A young woman escapes her unhappy life into a fairy tale.

He really enjoys this movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal but well worth it","review":"I felt moved to review this film. I am an avid fan of all things fantasy, and am not afraid of violence, but I have to warn you: proceed! But proceed with caution. This tale is so beautiful but it's a tale of a child in horrific and violent circumstances.That being said, it's a fantastic journey. The cgi and/or puppetry is amazing. And really, it's the creatures in the film that allow the girl so weather her brutal environment. This is like an old school fairytale that's not afraid of the dark. Really though, life is full of darkness.NOT for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"European film at it's finest","review":"I cannot adequately review this film in cohesive sentences. I can express how this film affected me...Charming, brutal, whimsical, mysterious, enchanting, vicious, beautiful, suspicious, pitiful, terrifying, gut-wrenching, heart-wrenching, and above all BRILLIANT."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MAGICAL AND HAUNTING FAIRY TALE FOR ADULTS!","review":"Most of you who read my reviews know I don't watch many films that are subtitled. I know, I know, I'm lazy, but it's really not that I'm lazy, it's that I find it a bit distracting. Fortunately this film is well worth reading subtitles for. For those of you not aware of this*** THIS FILM IS IN SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!***This is a very well made film and beautifully told story. It has a nightmarish quality that will stick with you long after watching it. The film is nothing like I thought It would be and that is one of the reasons I put off watching this for so long. It's really a fantastic film and should not be missed by movie lovers.The film is definitely not for children as it has some graphic violence and it can be scary at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but bizarre film!","review":"Okay, I don't know about the rest of you, but I was left with wanting Ofelia to discover more of the labyrinth and deal with more evil, shady characters. To be honest, my attitude towards Pan went from skeptical to acceptance. I honestly, thought Pan was out to get Ofelia as if he were the Devil incarnate.I give it 5 stars because it's truly an original and imaginative film, but I was disappointed we didn't encounter more ghouls and ghosts within the labyrinth and see more of the labyrinth. The story focused too much on the captain and his brutality rather than Pan's labyrinth.It was 2 stories within 1 film. On the one side, you have Ofelia's step-dad, a cruel Spanish captain, and on the other hand, you have Ofelia, a young, innocent child who is trying to escape the terrible events that surround her at every corner.This is an interesting film, but not for the squeamish. As one reviewer asserted, \\"This is a fairy-tale for adults,\\" so true.Jason"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Movie","review":"This movie took me by surprise. I did not expect it to be of such excellent quality. The cinematography, lighting, acting...everything was perfect. The movie is excellent, and kept me captivated. Although it is a fantasy, it seemed believable, from a historic perspective. The music is hautingly beautiful, and I find myself humming the lullaby sometimes. I just loved this movie, and look forward to watching it again. It's not scary as some people think. It's not a horror movie. It's a very entertaining fantasy, and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 07","review":"Brilliant! Pan's Labyrinth was my favorite film of 2007. I've been a fan of the director, Guillermo del Toro, since he blew my mind with Blade II. But that film nor his flawed but good follow-up, Hellboy, did not prepare me for the sheer excellence of this film. Visually stunning and emotionally devastating, del Toro has set a new high-water mark for himself and fairy-tale films here. The performances also transcend the language-barrier, especially the brutal and chilling Captain. The film is too intense for young viewers, but I think a new generation will grow into this film and continue to find new layers of it as they grow older. Movies this transcendent are rare, so don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"an extraordinary masterpiece","review":"Spain. 1944. Ofelia, a girl fascinated by fairy tales, is sent with her pregnant mother to meet and live with her new stepfather, Capitan Vidal, a particularly sadistic character. One night Ofelia meets a fairy, is told she is a princess and encounters the faun Pan. To prove her royalty, she must execute specific albeit gruesome tasks.Sergi Lopez as the Capitan is excellent, as are the two leading actresses, Maribel Verdu (playing Vidal's housekeeper, Mercedes) and Ivana Baquero (Ofelia). The faun is magistrally played by Doug Jones.An intense, brutal, beautiful, magical world is what makes this movie A MUST SEE, for it is quite the masterpiece, visually and artistically. The film definitely deserved its Oscar for best cinematography: Guillermo Navarro used wonderful lighting and techniques.Brilliantly directed and masterfully written by Guillermo Del Toro, this is a movie FOR ADULTS.(Warning: English subtitles only so far available on the DVDs.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"el laberinto del fauno","review":"necesito el envio de esta pelicula ya que la facturaron a mi cuenta y no la e resibidoespeo su respuesta gracias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Imagine 4 Star Rating for This!","review":"Outstanding film all the way around. I must admit I am surprised to see the 4 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but..","review":"This is a great movie but the only thing holding it back from being amazing for me is the lack of English dubbing. The story was perfect the acting was perfect and the visuals were insanely great so why couldn't they spare a few extra dollars to pay for some voice over actors.Don't get me wrong, I generally don't mind watching movies with subtitles but sometimes I just want to relax my mind and just watch a movie instead of read so dubbing would have been a great addition especially for those who are visually impaired who like to listen to movies.Other than that this movie is a very strong 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I was not sure about this movie when I rented it, but WOW, was I glad I did. This was wonderful, one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. I agree with the other reviewer that fairy tales today has been squashed by censors trying to protect the young and I am so glad that this movie was not one of those. Even though it was brutal, bloody and often scary it was an absolute joy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This was one of the best movies I have seen In a long time. I don't buy very many DVD's but this is one that I will buy as soon as it comes out. Do yourself a favor and see this movie, you will not be disappointed. The only thing I should mention is that this is not a movie for kids as it has very graphic violence. I can't believe this movie did not win best foriegn film oscar, it is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I was surprised when I saw that I would need the English subtitles to watch this movie. Of course it was on the product info but who really reads the fine print? LOL. Turns out to be a very interesting storyline and one that I would want to watch again. If not to see if I missed something the first time around. Good characters to like & hate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie...","review":"OK. This was a creapy poorly planned movie. It was similar to so many other movies, but presented a common story in a very poor way. This is certainly not for kids...

More hype than substance. Hardly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"English, Please!","review":"The reviews were great but no where did I find any idea that my DVD would be in Spanish. I thought perhaps someone made a mistake and put it on Spanish until I went to the menu and tried to change it to English but the only English availabe was the subtitles. Either someone made a mistake in packing or this should have been advertised as being in Spanish with English subtitles. Special effects were great but not everyone could keep up with the subtitles and do not like spending time trying to read and miss action in the movie. I only gave it a 1 rating because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labyrinth's Pan","review":"Not sure what movie everyone else is talking about, but I fell victim to the hype as well. But PAN'S LABYRINTH is far from a masterpiece. If you want to see brutal violence - some of it directed against children - along with some horrific gore (including a Rambo-esque scene where one of the major characters sews up his slashed cheek with a needle and thread) then this is the movie for you. Forget what other people have written about adult fairy tales and whatnot; this is not an entertaining nor enjoyable fable. Nor film, for that matter. Subtract the special effects and there's not really much of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language is Spanish","review":"Sure could have been better explained. I would never have bought it had I known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing movie","review":"With out a doubt, this has to be one of the darkest movies ever made. Once you get past the woodland creatures things, that were very well done, the movie gives you very graphic scenes of blowing peoples brains out, to torturing individuals that was also very graphically done. If you enjoy the horror of human suffering and pain, then this is the sick movie that you have been waiting for.Hope you enjoy watching a movie all in subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"How I Dislike Subtitles","review":"The movie would have been great, if it was in English... I hate subtitles. It detracts from the essence of the plot. And it was in Spanish - a second boo-ha-ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This movie is so bad, I don't know where to start. The previous reviewer obviously likes disjointed, nonsensical and farcical tales that make absolutely no sense from beginning to end. This movie fails on all fronts. It is a horrible \\"Fairy Tale\\" and a just as bad war story. I like some of Del Toro's previous work, but this is a horror to watch. Stay away, far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"I watched this movie expecting to be blown away based on all of the 5 stars and award nominations that it is getting and I was very disappointed. It's an average movie that, while good, is not the wonderful thing that I expected. Based on all of the raves of it's \\"fantasy\\" nature, I expected a lot more of that side of the story. Unfortunately, the fantasy was sadly lacking. I don't want to put in a spoiler, but I will say that I definitely hated the ending. I was ok with the rest of the movie and would have given it 3 stars except that the ending knocked it down to 2 stars.Also, the DVD quality is lacking - the English subtitles stopped appearing around scene 18 and it took a bit of button pressing to get them to show again. And the directors commentary cut out around scene 19 and I again had to do a bit of button pressing to get it back.And am I the only one that was annoyed with the amount of scene transitions that the director put in? It got to be very monotonous."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I knew from the start it was going to be dark. But not only was it dark it was really sadistic. The \\"rabbit\\" scene was so horrible that I really don't think I've ever scene anything that bad. To think this is a \\"fairy tale\\". I don't know who would tell this even to an adult as a fairy tale. And as Mr. Guillermo says a night time story. Yeah, if you want someone to die of a heart attack or have life long nightmares. I'd hate to see what he calls a horror story. Sorry I even had to give it one star. I give it -*****."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED AS A HORROR MOVIE WITH A LITTLE \\"ARTISTRY\\" MIXED IN. HATED!!! IT.","review":"When I watch a film, I look for story content above anything else. IT WAS A GRUESOMELY VIOLENT, ASSAULT ON MY SENSES. I can't believe I sat there and watched the whole thing. I can't believe that some very average special effects and some \\"artistic\\" way of coloring the film, passes for a great movie. In respect to story content, I have to give a very tiny bit of credit to the writer, who at the end, i guess, tryed to express that good ultimately triumphs over evil. However, I think most sane people probably believe that already and it DEFINITELY wasn't worth sitting through the better part of two hours of SICKENINGLY VIOLENT, DARK, TEDIOUS, DEPRESSING CRAP, to get to those few moments. PEACE, L."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and Very Warped","review":"I wasted my money on this movie and will probably just throw it in the trash where it belongs. I found it to be extremely sick and warped, showing the most hideous and ugly sides of humanity and cruelty. First, it's in Spanish and nowhere on the DVD case did it show the movie was in Spanish with English subtitles. Second, it's very warped and the product of a very sick mind. I'm capable of enjoying complex and deep plots and can recognize quality acting, direction, and cinematography. A lot of fine production talent was wasted on this piece of trash. Unless you really get a thrill out of sick movies like this, recommend you avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No!","review":"A primary purpose of reviews is to help others decide whether or not to buy a product. By all accounts, this is a dark, cruel, violent movie. Isn't there enough violence in our world without seeking to immerse ourselves in more, and calling it \\"entertainment?\\" Beware! Your eyes are the windows to your soul. Those who think they can participate in such violence (yes, viewing \\"IS\\" participating) without being negatively influenced by it are living in a TRUE fantasy world. Please, do yourself and the rest of humanity a favor: When it comes to such \\"entertainment,\\" just say no! Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"scaring brutal","review":"I never need to see this movie again. It looks lovely, but it is beyond brutal and scaring. I'd rather watch Schindler's List again. All of the lovely beauty and fantasy is ruined by the excessive violence. This is NOT a fantasy film it's a war movie with creepy dream sequences.Try Ledgend, Labyrinth, or Mirror Mask for better fantasy with a similar look.For better war films try Bridge Over the River Kwai, Das Boot (subtitles), Mash, Glory, Midnight Clear, and Lawrence of Arabia. My navy seal father-in-law liked Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, and Letters From Iwa Jima (subtitles)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"FIRST - there should be warnings to folks that it's subtitled and I don't see that anywhere - Pretty much everything on the DVD and descriptions are in English except the movie itself. It might be a good movie for stylist, process enthusiasts, or people who enjoy tragic tales, but for some one who is an escapist, or just like to actually enjoy a movie, this is not the one.I'd call it a perverse exploitation of darkness and depression - choices only of one evil or another - reminds me of that disburbing feeling I got when I read le malentendu in high school. From reading the other reviews, I guess I'd have to say this movie was just too far above me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children or adults young at heart. For cynics.","review":"I was disappointed in the movie. The hype, and trailers made it into a fantasy, comparable with Lord of the Rings. It does not remotely come close. The movie, is how the big bad captain, maltreats everyone in his family. He is also a terrible sadist, fighting the republican partisans still in the hills. This all happens years after the Civil war ended in Spain. The Captain is a caricature of a cold, brutal, sadist. Clearly, you see the bias of the film, if you pay attention. The big problem is that the depiction is one sided. The Republicans had terrible atrocities on their side as well. This is a war movie, war movie with a fantasy side story. This flick was bloody, humourless, biased and a real bummer with small sprinklings of fantasy. The acting was good, script was bad, and the plot was a failure. This movie is not for kids, or adults who are kids at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic film! LOUSY DVD PRESENTATION!!","review":"You'd think a big money making hog like New Line could get their **** together and release such a visually magnificent piece of cinematic art with AT LEAST a watchable dvd presentation.

I loved this movie this much. I did not play this disk until 5 yearss after...I don't spend a lot time watching movies. After 5 years I wanted to play the movie...with my son who is older and more mature. The problem was that the movie without been played even once, would not play. My ps3 would not play it...my desktop that is at least 4 years old would not play it...not even vlc. 20 dollars And i did not even get to play it once. The default program would make the hardware go haywire.Do not buy DVD or blueray...these are old tech stuff....studios are so desperate to steal money that they will sell you obsolete crap...as long as you can watch it the first two months they don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtitled","review":"This is subtitled, not dubbed. The language is Spanish and there is no spoken English available.They may have done this to prevent an outcry about it looking like a vid for children when it gets quite bloody and violent.This is a fantasy for adults, not a fantasy for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairy Tale that Preys On You","review":"I was reluctant to watch this because of the subtitles. But after the first few minutes, I was so rapt in the story that I no longer noticed them. Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale in the true meaning of the phrase--a story filled with all the ugliness and beauty of growing up and not made for children or the faint hearted. It will linger in your mind afterwards. And that perhaps is the trademark of a really good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent movie that has to be viewed with the appropriate approach and attention it deserves. The girl constructs a fantasy world in order to escape from the horror and misery of the war. The thing is, if the realistic scenes are so harsh and sadistic for you, well... then YOU live in a fairy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite an Amazing Achievement","review":"The magic of storytelling is alive and well in Pan's Labyrinth. What starts as a simple fairy tale becomes an enjoyable and darkened experience for the viewer. Although it is a fairy tale, it's not yourPeter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)/Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)type fairy tale.If you do not like subtitles, I suggest that you do not even think about watching this movie. There are subtitles. It is not distracting at all. You will be missing out on one of the best movies of the year.This 2 Disc edition features the same commentary and video prologue as the single disc edition, but adds some featurettes on the second disc, including a look into faun, the fantasy world, and a making of featurette.Must Have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie but Kinda Frustrating for One Reason...","review":"The story is well-crafted and thought out. The acting is good. The special effects and settings are good. This is a polished movie except for one thing: there is no English soundtrack.If you do not like to read subtitles because they reduce your enjoyment of a movie you will be frustrated. Every time your eyes have to move from the acting to the subtitles you will be pulled out of the story.It seems to me that if the producers want to market this DVD in the United States they will get a lot more buyers if they hire a few English speaking \\"voice talents\\" and re-release it.Perhaps in the re-release the producers will explain their reasons for not providing the English soundtrack in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE MOVIE","review":"For those who didn't understand it, listen to the Director's Commentary and you'll begin to see the depth of this movie. Then watch it again. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I admit it is not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic!","review":"I first saw this film at the cinema and although impressed thought it was a little long for its purpose. I'm so glad I decided to get this for my collection because the more I see it the more I get lost in details that flew by the first time. The Spanish language only makes it more lyrical. Legendary escapism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"A masterpiece! This movie is amazing!\\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" is one of the best movies I've ever seen!The 600 plus other reviews here will tell you the same!The story is thrilling, exciting and enchanting!Do not pass this movie up because it is in Spanish, you'll regret it!Wonderful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a simply bizarre & amazing film...","review":"Very few movies come along like Pan's Labyrinth that really make you sit back and enjoy EVERY FRAME!!!We are all too often blown away by special fx and crazy action scenes and to a point, yes it's all good fun, though it can get a bit repetitive.This movie is built on a great story (very strange at that) with some shocking scenes, however it's the package of cast, fx, scenery and story that really makes this one of the best films I've ever seen.Will watch it again and again, a MUST SEE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pan's Labyrinth","review":"Stunning - one of the best movies of a year of great movies. I adore Guillermo del Torro"},{"rating":"2","title":"tragic yet beautiful","review":"I reccommend this film to EVERYONE...it is not just \\"the years best\\"..but my new all time favorite film. I went to see this for the FOURTH time yesterday, only to find it was gone from the theatre, I will have to wait to wear out my dvd on the 15th, sad, and dark yet inspiring tale of innocense and the resiliance of the human spirit, obvious nods to Alice in wonderland, The wizard of Oz..etc, a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!!","review":"I enjoyed every mesmerizing and horrific minute of this film. Watching Pan's Labyrinth delivers the joy of seeing a well-made film and a darkly beautiful fantasy brought to life. This film, created totally from the imagination of del Toro, feels like it could have been adapted from some classic literary work. Furthermore, the cinematography, music, costumes, sets, makeup, and special effects are all top notch.I can't wait for the DVD release so I can focus on the visuals and less on the subtitles. Thank you del Toro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and interesting movie!","review":"Pan's has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Del Toro is a genius when it comes to movie themes. Not only does he mix drama with fantasy, but he thinks through imagery by using color and numbers for effect. This movie draws the mind into thought of a reality that could occur and maybe does occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fairy tale truly touching the senses love and fear","review":"A fantastic fairy tale Grimm-like (for adults, be great if they could make one rated for children) with superb cinematography, hauntingly wonderful yet sad music and brilliant set design and creatures. A sincere and brave young girl Ofelia, follows a fairy into a labyrinth (like Alice chasing a rabbit and fallen into a hole) and finds she have to follow 3 tasks to return as a princess who once left her true home (I had a dream as a child about being in another realm wanting to see the surface world which is why I can relate to her character) a long time ago to see the surface world. They are not easy tasks a child can perform and even an adult might have a hard time of it. The movie made me wishing and made me cry and the story itself is solid with very good acting from all the performers. Doug Jones {silver surfer} portrays the creatures with such realism and Ivana Baquero is such a darling with her performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars Not Enough","review":"How can anyone think this film is less than a five? What wasn't simply perfect? Direction? Acting, especially by Ofelia? Fascinating, intertwining plot? Special Effects? This film was genius, far surpassing The Departed, or any other film in recent memory! Those of you who gave fewer than five, watch it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see!","review":"While I am not a big fan of foreign films, I highly recommend this to everyone. The effects are tremendous and keep you on the edge of your seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done!","review":"This little spanish gem is part fantasy tale, part war story. Witness a little girl go through a series of mythical missions in order to reclaim her alleged title of Princess all while trying begrudgingly to live day to day with a cruel fascist captain who fancies the little girl's mother. Worth it alone for the cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, dark fairy tale","review":"This movie is excellent. The world that this director has created is pure imagination. I love the fact that the imaginary world that the young protagonist creates is not of butterflies and pastel fairies. The world that we see through the eyes of the young protagonist mirrors her fears and uncertainities as she and her mother embark into a new family dynamic and future. I love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"magical and scary as hell","review":"I think Sergi Lopez should never play a good guy. He is just to good at being evil, like in Dirty Pretty Things. Only in this case, the story is more real, based on the brutal Spanish Civil War. There is untold cruelty, both physical (as in the torture scenes) and psychological. To me the movie portrayed so well the mind set of fascism! Somehow, the girl's escape through fantasy is also a escape for the viewer, bringing sporadic, beautiful relief from the 'true' story as it unfolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This film had a strange effect on me -when I saw it the first time i thought it was way to brutal and it depressed me deeply-I could not stop thinking about it and oddly after a couple of days the impression that stayed was one of beauty,depth and hope....I can't really explain why - the characters and actors are extremly good,the story very well directed and the brutality sadly very real so maybe its the mixture of it all that provokes another level of perception.... definitely is worth seeing and unforgetable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematagraphy nice","review":"Beautiful in high def, the movie was pretty cool; however, just not as imaginary as I would have thought. This review probably is a little harsher due to not meeting expectations. It was a good movie and was more to the point of the one girl's struggle in her situation rather than the 'fiction' and fantasy of her escape. The escape sequences (her imagination) were a little hoaky."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A movie that tells two fascinating stories equally well, with invention and creativity and great performances (Sergi Lopez's Vidal has to go on a list of all-time villainous villains) and never a dull moment, Pan's Labyrinth is easily one of the best movies to come out in the last decade and also easily one of my favorite films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pan's Labyrinth","review":"A thoughtful and most enjoyable movie. At first, I was turned off by the need for English subtitles, but the pace and message held my attention. The sound and video quality in Blu-ray enhance its message."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film of 2006! An inspired DVD edition!","review":"In my opinion, the best of 2006. Del Toro's blending of brutal reality and terrifying but redemptive imagination was by far the most original, fascinating, best crafted, and profoundly moving film of the year. And this DVD is just chock-full of features that will deepen your understanding of the director's purposes in making this beautiful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie. acting is great, story is great, visuals fantastic.","review":"excellent job on this movie. dark and violent, but high quality storytelling and film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful film, excellent acting","review":"This was a fairytale for adults, but not in the way most would probably think. The \\"R\\" rating came from some scences of graphic violence and language.I think the best films are made from common and simple themes that have been known for a very long time. What makes this film great is that it told a story in a very creative yet simple way and sent a message which has been given in countless films before it. The message I got out of it was that this is a very cruel and unforgiving world. The main character in the film, Ofelia invented her own reality in order to escape from the cruel world around us. In the end, did her \\"invention\\" benefit just her or anyone else as well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGLY!!!!!!!!!","review":"This review is going to be short. This is horror-not fantasy. Brutal and ugly just about sums this film up. Want to hear something really scary? A 12 year old recommended this to my 13 year old. I am glad I watched it first! I'm not letting my child nowhere near this bloody mess. Find you garbage can if you spent money on this movie-your gonna need it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"This is a film that appaled me the first time I saw it, and just thinking about it brings back unpleasant memories. I feel it's because of the attempt to mix childhood fantasy with adult violence (sorry, the two don't mix). The brutality is unbelievably gross, and the entire film needs to be reclassified as being in the \\"horror\\" genre. I'm sorry I saw this, and am trying to forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING AND VERY CORNY!","review":"THE MOVIE HAS A COUPLE GOOD SCENES. 95% OF THE MOVIE IS CORNY AND BORING AND A WASTE OF TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAN'S LABRYNITH","review":"This had to be one of the WORST movies I have ever purchased. It is in Spanish & has English subtitles. The story is dark & violent. The father is nothing but a murderer. There is nothing remotely good, or kind about this story. Don't buy it if you have children. Very graphic. A horrible, horrible movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"I was truly disappointed after watching this film. Del Toro is a master storyteller, but there was no sense of urgency here, hence the film dragged on, rather than flowed. I also have to say that graphic violence in this film didn't belong. We already know, you're going to kill a man, so why do we need to see it in graphic, bloody detail? That was another thing that took away from the movie. I felt as if I was watching Apocalypto all over again, dreading extreme violence at every turn. I am sure, I would've liked the film more, had it not had all this blood, and had it been faster paced. Hopefully, Del Toro's next film will be up there with Blade II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I have seen in years!","review":"We saw this in the theater and I was not aware this was in spanish! But there was not that much subtitels. This DVD features lots of extras. Just make sure u push subtitels on ur DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good, but I will never know!","review":"I purchased this DVD because my husband wanted to see it. We put the movie in the DVD player, and there were subtitles on the screen. I thought at first that this was only going to be at the beginning of the movie. I don't know about anyone else, but when I want to read a book, I buy a book. Anyway, we were both disappointed that this movie was only available in Spanish, and we have stubbornly refused to put the movie on again as we were so disappointed. I don't want to watch a movie that I have to read and lose some of it in translation... I tried to return it to the store we bought it from but they of course refused as it was already opened... I feel that I was misled by the packaging (all in English) and would love a refund!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Would the movie critics out there please STOP with the gushing reviews of a movie that makes no sense. If it makes no sense, do not assume that it must be really deep and meaningful - maybe it JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. OK, so she is some kind of princess - cool - how does that benefit her or make any difference in the story? She needs to complete three tasks - she messes one up - BTW what the hell was that thing? Some tiny hint or explanation about it and the food might have been nice. - BUT, she gets another chance - good for her. The rebels, the general, the maid, the brother - no clue what the heck any of it had to do with anything -The faun was cool - that does not make a good movie - really disappointing - shame on the critics and the academy - call it like it is - a confusing disjointed mess"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to it's hype!!!!","review":"This can't possibly be compared to Lord of the Rings. I'll give it some credit for making such a visually attractive movie with a dull story line. Even Narnia is better than this. I hate the fact that it is all in Spanish and the DVD cover doesn't make it very apparent at all. Don't let you kids watch it because my wife could hardley stand the brutality of the psycho dad in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was wrong about my initial review","review":"I must be in the minority of not caring much for this film. Don't get me wrong:I like horror films, and fairy tale adaptations-Snow White:Tale ofTerror, included. But this film just did not sit well w/me, it wasn't the director or the actors, it was the story itself. The ending was a major letdown for me, because it wasn't very good. The best aspect were the effects.I'm not sure what else to say.Jan. 24, 2011)Well, now I realize I was wrong to criticize this movie the way I did, I just watched it for a second time and overall liked it. This time around, the story made alot more sense. I've always liked Good vs. Evil stories, I'm not sure how the director came up with this, but he's got one hell of an imagination. When I can afford it, I will own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Teeeeny Little Problem....","review":"This movie is rich in substance and imagination. The only problem?It's in Spanish only!Okay, so the subtitles are easy to read, they do go by a bit fast; but with today's technology, why can't we get it in English? Call me a cultural bohemian, but if I'd wanted to read, I would have caught the book. How can one read and watch what's going on? They put the commentary in English, why not the movie?It's a small gripe, but perhaps major for those of us who went to public schools!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like Language.","review":"This movie is listed in English format in all its adds. But it is actually Spanish and you have to read the subtitles in English.This should not be listed this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something?","review":"The blurb on the cover of the DVD I have indicates that this film is in the tradition of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. What an insult to the great master. I found the mythical characters so poorly depicted as to be ludicrous. The guy with the eyes in his hands is so ridiculous as to be truly laughable. The story is fine and the acting of the 'humans' fine also. Overall I see nothing to rate this picture four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan's review","review":"During the years of Fascist oppression in Spain, young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) moves to a creepy mill in the countryside with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) and violent stepfather (Sergi Lopez), who is a military officer hunting rebels in the surrounding mountains. Ofelia discovers that she has a powerful connection to a grotesque, wonder-filled world of magic and fantasy and undergoes great drama as events come to a head in both the realms of magic and reality.Director / writer Guillermo del Toro has established himself as one of the premier fantasists of cinema. His distinctive visual sense is used to great advantage here. This fairy tale is not so much for children as for adults who may have forgotten the horror at the root of all fairy tales in this Disneyfied era, as well as their mythic connections to real world events. Del Toro remembers and incorporates this understanding in his powerful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"pan's labyrinth-review","review":"Good vs. evil with a fantastical element. Good wins but not without consequences. I particularly liked the fact that in this movie a strong moral peasant female character bests the stereotypical German amoral Nazi officer. But what appears to be a loss at first, turns out to be an affirmation of all that is good. Not your typical movie but well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but definitely not for children!","review":"I loved the movie, especially Ophelia's fantasy world. Her stepfather's killings, however, were pretty brutal. There are several instances where I cringed from the brutality.

I could rant on and on about how amazing it is but I'll spare you that. This DVD is the two disc edition which has an extra disk filled some very interesting things.

The size chart is exactly right-on; they did fit, but they twisted around on my dog's feet with every step she took. Unfortunately, however, the boots literally fell apart within a week. My dog did NOT chew on them, as she is not a \\"chewer,\\" although she does tend to lick her feet sometimes, which is why I had the boots on her. We never even went for a walk in them; she only wore them in the house, and only while I was there. I'm thinking that if dog saliva ruined these so quickly, then they probably aren't going to last in \\"extreme\\" weather conditions as is implied in the name of the product.

Unfortunately, the people who populate this group border on stereotypes( the ice queen, the shy accountant ready to blossom, the forceful therapist with a deep secret)whose imminent struggles are predictable and anti-climatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but disappointing","review":"\\"Group\\" just didn't cut it for me. The concept was terrific. I couldn't wait to read the book. But I found the author's writing uninspiring. and the people's stories just weren't all THAT fasinating. Several of them suffered from drug and alcohol problems so what they had to say was almost predictable, especially if you've ever been to an AA meeting. I WAS surprised by the shrink. He seemed to keep the group under control and moving forward. I actually thought he earned his fee. That HE turned out to be a drunk was stunning, especially since neither the author nor the self absorbed participants gave any indication they cared two hoots for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"a guilty pleasure that resounds with humanity","review":"the cover of 'group' reads like dominick dunne goes to psychotherapy. what the book actually does is move beyond the superficial 'fabulousness' of this hand-picked group and explore those very human pains that cause these 3-dimensional people to do irrational and destructive things. as the members 'take on' their lives, their experience becomes a universal experience. solotaroff gives us the opportunity to feel compassion for all seven of the people (therapist included)even though you as the reader, and perhaps solotaroff himself, might not even like them. and he transforms the idea of group therapy from the arena of psychobabble self-absorption to a place that answers a primitive, human need to express oneself and to care for others. i felt like a participant in the group and found myself rooting for each member as they attempted to reactivate. it read like a 'whodunit' but it was more like a 'who's going to \\"just do it\\".' it was very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great one","review":"this movie isn't the sort of movie you really understand the first time. it is thought-provoking and even though it jumps around a little, it has a very good story. i like all of the different themes that are brought into this movie. and despite the serious tone it seems to carry, there are many points of good humor thrown in. i would recommend this to pretty much anyone who has always wanted more for their lives, but we're just afraid to get it. this is an inspiring film once you reflect on its meanings. if you haven't seen this, you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Park Day","review":"Love this movie.

I hoped that I could read ROSEY THE BABY KILLER and not have the nightmares I had when I read HUMAN SHRAPNEL.

This book bored me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal Truth Uncensored","review":"Bill Shields tells it like it is. Rosey is no exception. Having read almost every word of his writing, searched the internet and beyond for more, the main constant of his writing is brutal honesty. While many are quick to point out that his work is a horror show of pain and suffering (which much of it is) I see a strength to it, a man who has faced more demons than most of us will ever experience and lived to tell the tale. In my opinion, there are very, very, few writers out there today who can hold a candle to his talent and power. Nothing is watered down or left to chance - what you see is what you get, which is something you hardly see in contemporary poetry or fiction anymore. If you haven't read Bill Shields, you haven't read anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rosey-cheeked baby killer - Bill Shields","review":"The strongest in a line of books by Bill Shields released by Henry Rollins of 2.13.61 Publications, \\"Rosey the Baby Killer\\" is Shields' most compelling work to date. This man is obviously tortured by memories and deeds that few of us can imagine.

But however difficult it may have been to grow up under the control of a gifted but mentally ill father who was so often out of control himself, Brandon has not come to the reader with unresolved grievances. She asks neither for compensation nor pity for the anguish her family endured; she does not let blame or bitterness intrude. Instead, from the calm center of the storm that was her upbringing, with the distance that comes only with the passing of time, she weaves together the memories, voices and artifacts of her youth into a compelling, multidimensional narrative. It takes courage to tell such a deeply personal story so openly and honestly, and skill of the highest order to do it so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the more boring Christmas albums I've ever heard","review":"First, I should say that the vocals on this CD are pretty good.

It's very pretty, it's nice and heavy and conducts heat like a champ. Unfortunately EVERYTHING will stick. Not just a little bit either. Scrambled eggs, pan cakes and omelets are impossible, meat darn near requires a chisel and even a simple trinity requires actual scraping. Cleaning the pan invariably requires overnight soaking and 15 minutes of cleaning the next day.After working with it for a month and thinking it just has to get better I just put it in the garage and bought pan from a different brand.

Frankly I don't even like it when authors create male soldiers that are Rambo-esque, but Amy, our plucky, motorcycle riding mid-shipmen (shipwomen?) from the Academy has more moves than Bruce Lee.Although the story is, once again, loaded with cowering males who stick like glue to their resourceful, strongwilled, ninja-trained, death commando female counterparts, I found the plot, about the hijacking of the Pentagon, to be interesting.If the husband, of this wife-husband writing team, would put the pants back on, I think these guys could write a believeable story.

At the University of Alabama Huntsville learning about Lebesgue integration is key to advancing into graduate studies in mathematics. The natural follow-on course after Calculus I and II, etc. is Real Analysis. This book, using Lebesgue integration methods, is a good sequel to Lebesgue calculus.I purchased this book, after reading about it in the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). For autodidacts like myself, it is a good first introduction to the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unpleased with this product!","review":"I had used this product in the past for years.

I love indie films and gay and lesbian films.. but this movie is a shade better than a home movie.. the cinematography is decent, but the acting is terrible and the audio sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom... everyone delivers their lines like they're reading them right off a cue card.. their timing and delivery is horrible... the actors have no life and their on camera presence is lifeless and boring. The dialog seems like it was written halfway and the actors were asked to improvise the rest. As I said before, the poor sound quality would be distracting if there weren't so many other bad things going on. The \\"looks\\" of the actors are mediocre, so there really isn't eye candy to make up for everything else bad in this movie... definitely not worth wasting money or time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN OK MOVIE","review":"Movie had decent looking guys.

There is nothing good to be said about this so-called 'movie' - not storyline, not cinematography (despite the picturesque locale, which was missed entirely), not cast, not dialogue or anything else.

The book is out of standard with most of O'Reilly's rich text and exhaustive detail and real world working code blocks and monitor like diagrams, but this book is nothing but fill and a terrible disappointment. The book is listed at Amazon as having 400 pages, not true, do not believe it, the book actually has 600. I suggest for the critism that Sedgwick gets, his Algorithms in C++ Parts 1-4 is truly the most detailed book on algorithms and data structures there is and it is the best to be a guru software engineer in problem solving and algorithm and data structure mastery. The next book to read that may be better than Sedgewick's is Sartag Sahni's Algorithms, Data Structures, and Applications in C++ by MacGraw-Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or money","review":"To be fair and honest, I have not read this entire book and that is because I've read far better ones.

True, the cats and other mutated animals are pretty much like people, but that makes them easy to identify with... and since when was fantasy/scifi real anyhow? The storyline is very tight, and Norton does a wonderful job of painting the picture of an original and unique future earth - one unlike anything I've read anywhere else. Not a deep book, but that's not her style. One of her better works in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it...","review":"Long after the dreaded WWIII, humans have finally returned to the earth they destroyed. The animals, however, had to live there. Something magic in the air, i guess, but our 'domesticated' animals developed greater size, sentience, and culture. Rats, Cats, Dogs, and Pigs vie for supremacy in a world reborn, wondering what secrets lie hidden in the ruins of the cities.Do they remember humans? Oh yes. They remember the Demons who tried to kill the world, and they're not exactly happy to see them return."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had it with \\"evil humans, wonderful nature\\" sf","review":"When I was in high school, I loved this book. But then, back then, I wrote high school science fiction in which humans were evil and bad, and the Earth was better off without them. That is the whole point of this book. There's nothing at all of any interest in the mutated-Cat culture of the future other than how they deal with the evil Human race that has returned after a looooong absence - only to begin to wreak havoc and devastation yet again.I'm heartily sick of such stories, now that I'm an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares about cats?

If there's one thing i've learned after reading books where the main characters are animals, is that i don't care about them- they seem so fake. While reading this book i had to keep reminding myself that these \\"people\\" were mutated cats, but they were basically just human-- the author just made them cats because she has some sick fetish with cats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fred Szabo Doesn't Deserve To Be Called An Author","review":"This book is useless.

I find the Divine Light Invocation a positive influence, even in events like world conflict, where I would otherwise feel helpless. The practice also helps me stay focused and centered.

Ahh, the Mine Train ride, the 20,000 Leagues walk-through, America Sings (some of the animals from that are still working in Splash Mtn!), Country Bear Jamboree!For anyone who love the history of Disneyland, or is a old-time fan, the book is a must get. It's a super trip through memory lane, one that is extremely well written and lovingly assembled for us.Disneyland the Nickel Tour: A Postcard Journey Through a Half Century of the Happiest Place on Earth - also includes some few attractions that were ballyhooed but never launched.It's actually worth the $200 or so you might have to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing let down","review":"After reading and adoring Tam Lin, I rushed out to buy Juniper, Gentian, & Rosemary, but after the first few chapters I was bewildered, and finished the book out of duty, hoping it would take off. The literary references in Tam Lin inspired me to check out things I meant to read in college but never got around to, where as the references in Juniper, Gentian, & Rosemary just seemed pretentious. ( I guess one expects references from a university crowd, but not from young high school students) I kept waiting for something intriguing to happen, some element of Faerie, but when it revealed itself I was alternately relieved that I had finished the book, and disappointed that there was nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious, but tedious, too","review":"A passingly strange book, this. As a look into the life of a young teenage girl, her family and friends, this is an interesting tale. As a story that falls between the slats of horror and/or science fiction/fantasy, though, it leaves a lot to be desired. The story starts out compellingly enough; the author gets you interested in her characters and their quirky lives... sibling rivalry among the eponimous characters is well done and quite realistic. When it comes to resolving the mystery that she's somewhat awkardly developed through the tale, though, Dean becomes absolutely ham-handed. It's as though she could hear the music for the final credits already rolling and needed to wrap it up in a hurry. As a result, it barely makes sense. No, it makes no sense. And that's a pity, because with another 100 pages or so, she might have had a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating.","review":"I adored Pamela Dean's TAM LIN, but aspects of her writing (focus on characterization, leisurely explorations of philosophy) that were strengths in that novel occur at the expense of pacing and plot in JUNIPER, GENTIAN, AND ROSEMARY. Dean doesn't seen interested at all in her own plot -- girl beguiled by demon -- and largely confines it to the last 30 pages of the novel, as well as leaving myriad loose ends (Why does Dominic move in next door? What does he hope to accomplish with his time machine? etc.) Instead, we spend lots of leisure time with Gentian and her friends. While they're charming (like Janet and her friends in TAM LIN), the plot payoff at the end doesn't counterbalance the 300 pages of indifferent setup. Finally, Dean includes stuff -- such as a near line-by-line reading of two acts of Julius Caesar -- that feels wholly self-indulgent. A frustrating, disappointing read from a writer who can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"The headline is my teenage daughter's one word review of this book. I thought she was being unfair until I tried to read it myself. No wonder she didn't like it! There was nothing and no one in it she could relate to. My daughter and her friends are nothing like the girls in this book. Sure, it's supposed to be a fantasy, but shouldn't the characters have more than one-dimension? And shouldn't something interesting happen? I have to echo my daughter - this book was BORING."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rite of passage.","review":"This is a terrible book that I have read four times. Some books seem to have a character that are not quantifiable by the credibility of their plot or the fickle nature of their characters. Although dealing with fantasy this story is not in essence fantastic. The warmth of friendship, both within and outside the family, is the factor that first comes to mind when thinking of this book and it is this that has provided the impetus for my repeated readings. It is not a book that sits comfortably within known genres, on my bookshelves it sits alongside \\"Franny and Zoey,\\" as a great book to read when you are ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"got knocked unconcious from all the name-dropping.","review":"I think the book averaged about 2 literary references per paragraph.

I don't get that. How can you love TDFH and not like SS??? They are the same sound. I think all four of Live's albums tie them with DMB for the label of most creative and best band of the 90s!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A completely underated masterpiece","review":"I am an avid Live fan. I have all their CD's and I love this album. This was an unhappy period in the band's \\"life\\", Mental Jewelry was Live's worst album, but it played a vital role in molding the Band into what it is today. It is the same with Throwing Copper and Secret Samadhi. The Distance to Here was the band's first album as a \\"complete\\" band. their first three albums molded them into \\"completeness\\". Secret Samadhi is just as Great as TC and TDTH. It has the same meaningful lyrics and briliant music: \\"let's out a hellified scream into the night, crying where did I go wrong?\\" Yes, i admit there are no \\"Dance with you\\"'s or \\"pilar of Davidson\\"'s on the album but it is a masterpiece none the less. If you listen to it, you will see that \\"turn my head\\", \\"Gas hed goes West\\" and all the other songs are sung in true Live spirit and should most definatelt be given a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live's Best Album","review":"I consider this album to be Live's best album. It has the strongest songs with the richest meanings. The music has a really special unique atmosphere, which is the reason why Live is great. To those who are fan of Live, this CD is a must bie! Especially with Lakini's Juice in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever felt despair? Ever HEARD despair?","review":"\\"Underrated\\"? I couldn't agree more. This is a wonderfully powerful album and without doubt the most emotional of all of the band's works, definitely my favorite. The songs don't rock as hard as other Live tracks, and things like \\"took the water from the toilet\\" or \\"we came to the earth to graze\\" may sound mighty strange to most, but if you try singing along with the album (I said try, because I have yet to meet anyone who can actually do what Ed does with his voice), then you'll feel the sound carving into your mind. You'll get this weird, though not funny at all, feeling that you desperately need something, and you cannot tell what it is. Never before had I heard music with such deep emotional content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Live's Best","review":"I am a huge Live fan and though I didn't enjoy Secret Samadhi as much as I enjoyed their other albums, I still liked it.It definetly has a different style than Live's other CDs. It's much heavier, and the lyrics are much more grim, and very disturbing compared to Live's other albums.Unfortunatly, it's just not as good. The songs aren't as wonderful as those of Throwing Copper, and the lyrics aren't as powerful as Mental Jewelry's.But the CD was still fun and good like the rest of Live's albums, the best song being \\"Lakini's Juice\\". Hell, I'll give it 4 stars just for being by Live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live delivers memorable singles, but not memorable album","review":"Live is one of a handful of bands who still have some meaning in their music, but unfortunately it seems theyre just not getting as much recognition for it. Their latest, Secret Samadhi doesnt measure up to Throwing Copper, but it does contain a few songs that still hold Live's power and scripture-like, poetic words. When I first heard \\"Lakini's Juice\\", I was blown away. Its a great song. Period. It was as accessible and sticky sweet as any of the other hits of that time. Another dynamic single is \\"Turn My Head\\". Whew. A live fan couldnt ask for a better pair of tunes. They just make you forget its not a great album like Throwing,but its worth getting for its great singles. Very underrated, but very essential for any modern rock or Live fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think of Secret Samadhi","review":"It seems like I am the only person in world who failed to fall in love with Throwing Copper. I admit that Lightning Crashes is a pure classic, and a few tracks like All Over You and Stage have some angst appeal to them...but overall to me Throwing Copper is way too rough and raw, kinda like Mental Jewellary only more grungy and less passionate.OK now to Secret Samadhi...it's no classic...but it's more likeable than Throwing Copper. Lakini's Juice is as awesome as Live will probably get (juding by The Distance To Here album). Graze and Ghost are slow, but both are atmospheric and have really good choruses. Freaks is funny!As for the lyrics...well havent they been SLAUGHTERED by all of you! OK so the lyrics arent passionate, emotional, thoughtful etc...but so what? Ed sings them well...thats what matters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emptiness","review":"I was very dissappointed with this album. Except for likini's juice and Freaks, the songs are ho-hum. The whole album left me with a empty feeling. Not their best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is crap-tacular","review":"I have to say this is the worst CD I have ever bought. The songs were so wacked up it was irratating to listen to them. For instance they would be singing normal lyrics and then throw in \\"I can smell your armpits\\" or \\"puke smells like beer\\". Is this something you want to pay for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I pick zero stars?","review":"When I first got this album, my friends and I decided that it was all a big joke. Ed was trying to write the lyrically worst album ever written. Well, if that were his goal, I think he succeeded, but I fear that, in fact, he takes himself seriously. Mental Jewelry is one of the best albums I know of, but as time goes by, Live gets worse and worse. Musically, this album is average, but the lyrics are SO bad that I have to give it 1 or fewer stars. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Live Drops a Bomb","review":"I bought this CD with high expectations after Throwing Copper, and what a letdown it was. I have to wonder if Ed Kowalczyk was sniffing glue at this point in his life, because the lyrics are just that bad. To compound the matter, the music is actually good, but the CD is rendered unlistenable by the aforementioned Mr. Ed. Look them up on the internet, I'm not exaggerating. They include the most horrible rhymes, have little discernable content or value, and aim for knee-jerk enlightenment by invoking a few Indian words and Hindu Gods. You will not be enlightened by listening to this CD, however, you may have a few good laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing follow up to Throwing Copper","review":"I was dissappointed with this CD. The raw energy, lyrical depth and beautiful arrangements of 'Throwing Copper' are not there. But then, that album was a hard act to follow. If you want to hear the best of Live buy 'Throwing Copper'. Maybe they can re-invent themselves with some new themes down the track. Maybe the boys have found nirvana after 'Throwing Copper' and just aren't angry about too much anymore. Their earlier album is slightly better than this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Is In A League All Their Own.","review":"This album is an excellent album of them, although not their absolute BEST. Look in my other reviews to see which one is their BEST. But, nevertheless, this one deserves mention. The songs are all very rocking, flow very well together in order, and Edward knows how to write great, alternative lyrics, at the same time, with deep meaning. In other words, he knows how to drop it down! Another thing of note is the band, itself. This has got to be the TIGHTEST band out there. The members are VERY DEVOTED to staying true to the music and staying together. They are one of the, if not THE, best alternative rock band ever. LIVE will live forever......."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKES ME SCRATCH MY HEAD AND WONDER","review":"This is one of those albums that just made me get so pissed off. Lives previous two albums were real favorites to me(especially mental jewelry). Instrumentaly, and vocally, this is a very good album. But lyrically it just plain sucks. Ed used to sing about such cool stuff. Well, i guess most of the population who dont even listen to what lyrics say, and they just want somethin that rocks, or is pretty. they'll like it. But as for me, when im reachin for a live album, my hand is gonna go right past this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good variety in the sound","review":"I think that this cd is great. All of the songs sound different unlike many new bands around. All the songs have some heavy guitar in them which is very good. The best songs are Rattlesnake, Lukini's Juice, Graze, Ghost, Unseathed, Turn My Head, and Freaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is great but only after many repeated listenings","review":"Hi folks -- I loved Throwing Copper and bought this CD despite the lukewarm-to-bad reviews it got. I immediately taped it and made it my car tape of the month. I was really lukewarm on it myself for the first many repetitions but I can tell you that now that I know it better, I love it.

The songs on this one are shorter and have less good lyricism and much less complex music than \\"Copper\\". The songs also sound a lot like the ones on \\"Copper\\", but not as good somehow.

If you liked \\"Throwing Copper\\", you'll probably like this one too, even though Ed K.'s vocals and lyrics aren't as meaningful and emotional as the ones on \\"Throwing Copper\\" and the music is a bit darker than the music on \\"Throwing Copper\\". Anyway, buy this album after you buy \\"Throwing Copper\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live's follow-up to Throwing Copper Passes","review":"Live's 3rd CD release \\"Secret Samadhi\\" was anxiously awaited especially after their previous effort(Throwing Copper) went big time platinum: Well it didn't dissapoint! Don't get me wrong this isn't as good as \\"Throwing Copper\\" but that wasn't the band's aim, The band looked to mature it's sound & did with more darker, heavy songs such as the 2nd cut \\"Lakini's Juice\\" & Bass-Driven \\"HeroPyschoDreamer\\" but as always Live threw in a few lighter songs such as the radio-fave \\"Turn My Head\\". Lyrically this album left something to be desired but still a decent effort after the major success of \\"Throwing Copper\\". They definitely didn't pull a \\"Hootie\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blade, cool mechanism","review":"This is a great knife from a company well known for good quality. The blade had a very good edge on it when it arrived and it has held up quite well with just a few brief sharpening sessions. The sliding mechanism to open the knife is a unique and surpirisingly ergonomic approach to a lock blade knife (just watch where you put your index finger the first few times you open it). Although the blade does seem a little loose when the knife is \\"closed\\" it is pretty solid when the blade is locked. Granted, it is by no means a rival for a fixed blade knife as far as rigidity goes, but for a relatively slim and light \\"every day knife\\" i am pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makita 18 V Tool Set","review":"The tools have exceeded my expectations.

However, I didn't find anything new here. I feel it would be a book more suitable for high school students who are totally unfamiliar with that year in baseball. I was immediately suspicious with repeated misspellings of \\"Ebbetts Field\\". This would be an easy thing to check. Also on Page 129 I shuddered when I came across the name of \\"Johnny DeMaestri\\". Joe Demaestri, of course, along with first baseman Kent Hadley (neither mentioned) were acquired by the Yankees along with Roger Maris following the 1959 season.

Well this isn't Rubinstein, but it's always nice to hear a different take on great music, and Chopin's Waltzes are certainly that. The early CD production quality of the Decca \\"Weekend Classics\\" series leaves a lot to be desired, not to mention non-existent liner notes, but the performance is what matters the most, and this one was quite nice. Katin deserves wider recognition, and reissuing and remastering too, but unfortunately will most likely never receive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More then one would expect","review":"This is actually a rather good album in the technoish popish trancy area, I am fond of Control and Fallen Angel(Although the Paul Okenfold mix on the Virtuosity sound track is better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I never really listened to Techno-pop before, and I thought it would be more of a stripper tape, or such.

Unlike most techno albums, Lords debut goes beyond simple rave standards and packs an album full of meaningful energy and alot of feeling. It starts off with the hit single 'Control' (from the film \\"Mortal Kombat\\") and takes you into a virtual dance wonderland. The songs inculde hardcore pieces ('Good n' Evil'), soft ballads ('Distant Land'), and even campy tunes ('Okey-Dokey'). Every track is a winner, not one fails to loose your intrest. A standout piece includes 'Father's Field', an emotional account of a painful (and true) experience that happened to Lords. Her openess in this song is amazing and reveals a vunerability that isn't very common in techno. Lords has established herself as a true artist, and proven that there's more to a \\"Melrose Place\\" star than good looks. She's a Madonna for the 21st century!

This DVD medium for presenting classes is great becuase you to skip and play again and again the parts you need. No need in stoping a class in session of 30-50 people. The advantages of the DVD Medium don't work out well in this DVD. First Al is just to much into trying to make you laugh at slap stick humor. If I try to skip it, I have to fastforward which makes things annoying becuase the bad humor is at the begining of a new step. The moves in this DVD aren't many. I'd have to say the DVD is made up of 70 % moves and 30% useless humor that is old the first time around.Bottom line: I don't recomend this to anyone looking to get their bang for their buck.

Collins was my church history prof at seminary. He has written several books on Wesley, and is one of the \\"new lights\\" in Wesley studies. The book avoids making a stained glass saint out of its subject while at the same time demonstrating a genuine respect and reverence for this great Christian leader. All of the major events of significance are covered but with a readability that is backed up by scholarly research. It is sometimes hard to find a book on a major figure in church history which doesn't give in to the temptation to gloss over the \\"real\\" person. Collins has written a book which shows that this \\"real Christian\\" was also a \\"real person.\\" Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Christian = A Real Biography","review":"Collins provides the reader with a wonderfully concise and through biography of John Wesley. Though Collins places significantly less attention on some of the prominent emphases of Wesley's theology, mainly the perfecting of holiness in the believer, and choosing instead to shift attention to Wesley's lesser (and more ambiguous) emphasis on being a \\"real Christian\\" in substitute, the author still maintains a historically intact overview of Wesley's theological journey. The reader should certainly approach this book as a biography as opposed to an exaustive treatment of Wesleyan theology. A rewarding read, I found Collins' style both engaging and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had it for six months and haven't used it.","review":"Turned out you can't use this thing with jacketed bullets.

The identity of the murderer is obvious from chapter 2 -- even before anyone has been murdered! With their identity so clear so early on, you don't need any clues or sleuthing, which is a good thing, because there aren't any. When the showdown comes and the murderer's identity is \\"revealed\\" to anyone who has bothered to read this far, whopping great loose ends are left hanging around, leaving you asking \\"But why -- and what about -- ?\\" The setting -- a bookshop -- could have been interesting but little is made of it.

Aside from the \\"hidden track\\" history, does \\"Spiderman\\" exist on this CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life's a gas, oh yea.","review":"This was The Ramones last studio album. While not as good as their classic early albums, it is a fine album in it's own right. While there are a few songs here that aren't that memorable, most of the songs are good. My personal favorites are \\"I Don't Want To Grow Up\\", \\"The Crusher\\", \\"Life's a Gas\\", \\"Cretin Family\\" and \\"She Talks To Rainbows\\". Oh, and I can't forget the great hidden bonus track, \\"Spider-Man\\". This version is better than the one The Ramones recorded for theSaturday Morning's Greatest Hitscompilation. In conclusion, this album was a fine capper to The Ramones studio career. Recommended to Ramones fans of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Ending to a Glorious Run","review":"The Ramones couldn't have written a better send off to their career than Tom Waits' \\"I Don't Wanna Grow Up,\\" which sums up over two decades of Ramonesmania. But the band was pretty much at the end of their rope, and Joey's yet unannounced cancer was slowing the band down. \\"Adios Amigos\\" gives us a heartfelt and punchy goodbye, and as far as the Ramones' later-day output goes, a good disc.The other highlight here is \\"She Talks to Rainbows,\\" which features a superb vocal from Joey. It proves that the band was capable of more than the cartoony punk many non-fans believed the Ramones were only capable of (or \\"The Crusher\\" and \\"Scattergun\\" might lead detractors to believe). And speaking of cartoons, the hidden track from \\"Spiderman\\" sneaks in after the disc officially ends, and it is a great bonus gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful history of California environmental degradation","review":"This book beautifully chronicles the damage that has been wreaked upon the California landscape in the last cnetury and a half. Particularly interesting is the commentary about the miner ethos that has prevailed not only among miners but also among loggers, agribusinessmen, and developers, leading to the pillage of the land for the gain of a few. However, the book was also weak here when it contrasted this ethos with that in Italy which has resulted in the preservation of the countryside. It seems only fair that the weaknesses of the Italian system, including the negative impacts of a slower economy and weak central government on the people's well-being, be at least acknowledged here as well. However, all in all the book is still very worthwhile. I will now never be able to forget what this state might have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on the Demise of California","review":"This book taught me a great deal about the history and culture of California and it's environmental demise.

Certainly the Beach Boys doing \\"Help Me Rhonda,\\" The Righteous Brothers powering through \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\" and Barry McGuire's \\"Eve of Destruction\\" are steps in the right direction. Opinion is more diverse regarding \\"Wooly Bully\\" and pretty much anything by Sonny & Cher. As every one in class knows, the rule of thumb when judging a greatest hits collection is whether you find five or more songs you would love to add to your music library. Depending on how extensive your personal collection happens to be right now, this one has got a good shot at passing that litmus test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billboard 1965","review":"Brings back memories to a certain demographic slightly predating mine, but I cannot help liking the music, even though fans may be disappointed with the exclusions of British artists thereon.Good CD to relax to, or work around the house, garage, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouse Trouble","review":"This KVM works as expected except for two problems. Sometimes the mouse will stop working for me as if I was to unplug and the replug the mouse from the machine. I guess there is a slight glitch in the electrical connection when the KVM switches between computers. It's really annoying because when this happens you must reboot the computer to get the mouse functionality back. Also, this KVM beeps a couple of times when you switch between computers. I have not been able to turn this feature off and I would rather just have a silent KVM switch. But, it isn't a complete piece of crap. Most of the time it does it's job ok.Also note that the KVM does not come with a power supply. Theoretically it can draw all of it's power from the PS/2 keyboard connection of the computers. But, in practice I've found that not all computers are able to deliver enough power. You may have to buy a 5V-9V DC power adapter of your own, I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival","review":"Purchased this product from Fry's and their recommended power adapter. Connected it all up; no lights no nothing.I selected this unit primarily for its $15 price tag which was the least expensive unit at the store and it came with cables. Thanks to another review (the only one at the time) I recognized that the $10 power adapter might be necessary since my laptops don't have PS2 connections. The clerk at the store confirmed that when he opened the instructions. Note the instructions also say not to touch the keyboard or mouse during startup to prevent glitches.I'm returning this product and will try a manual switch this time. It is the same cost, but requires no power. I didn't select the manual one initially, because it didn't clearly state the supported resolution, and had no cables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information; ridiculous price","review":"I read a lot of books on market analysis, and from the first few pages this seems to be a good one.

We found it to be novel - wowee, I can flip monkeys into the air and they will stick to this board! But it didn't hold our interest. It takes minimal skill, and you don't have a lot of control over the \\"flipping,\\" so it's not like you can employ a strategy. I can see how it would be fun at the Thanksgiving event another reviewer described, where kids don't have their own toys. Or with kids who don't play together often (like the reviewer with kids who are not close in age).

They say \\"what's that?\\", and if they do I just turn the wallet over and say \\"what are you talking about?\\" That actually works! Overall, it is a good idea to make a wallet with such functions.

I couldn't wait to buy it when it came out and I was thoroughly disappointed. Ramones shows are very quick and have a fluidity to them. This album takes away all of that by mixing up the play list and only putting in half of the songs. If you must buy a Ramones live album (and I heavily suggest you do) go for Loco Live or It's Alive. They each grasp the full spirit of the band and better convey what a real show was like. The Ramones were one of the best ever live bands to see and Greatest Hits Live was put together so poorly that I almost wish I hadn't bought it.It does get snaps for the couple of studio tracks (R-A-M-O-N-E-S was unintelligible before this) and because the songs themselves are so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya wanna know why I'm the first one to write about thisdisc?","review":"It's because it's a totally redundant contract-filler.

The extra reach afforded by this bit holder (as well as its slender profile by contrast to locking and sliding bit extensions) has rendered it invaluable in tight quarters. After moderate to heavy use in an impact driver nearly every day for the past several months, it continues to hold up superbly.On one occasion the magnet did fail, causing a driver bit to become dislodged from the bit holder; I no longer rely upon the magnet when positioned upside down. This poses a minor inconvenience, however bits continue to remain securely in place during normal usage or when resting horizontally.Though it has proven tremendously useful and resilient under pressure, I am hesitant to offer a completely enthusiastic recommendation of this product at nearly double the price paid just ten months ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Fish Is Awesome!","review":"Love the fish/crustacean combo and the teeth are wicked! wonderfully done toy... beautiful painting espescially on the antennaes/feelers.

If you knew BAD back in the day, you're probably wondering \`What the heck happened to BAD?' It's inexplicable, perhaps Mick Jones is simply too old to rock and roll. The album is summed up well by the track \`I Turned Out A Punk', which is as unpunk a track as you can imagine, although it purports to be a statement of purpose. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a joke, sadly, it is not.

You get the feel that the author is trying to \\"talk\\" to you, but it is unconvincing. On top of this, there seem to be logical flaws to the story being told by the author (which he claims to be true). One of the flaws that stands out in my mind begins with a character in the book who is recalling a past life. The character is speaking through this past life persona in the first person, yet refers to the year as some date with a B.C. attached to the end of it. How would \\"someone\\" living in this era ever know to refer to the year as B.C. Nice try Weiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of tripe","review":"Wow. This book was really something.

I bought this book after finding my own soulmate, seeking answers to powerful, otherwise inexplicable connection we have, and got even more answers and profound insight than I bargained for. I never was certain if I believed reincarnation was real or not until I began reading Dr. Weiss' books, and now reincarnation is a matter of fact in my life, and in my perspective on everything.

Weiss shares his techniques and his discovery in this real life love story of two strangers who sought the same psychiatrist for treatment but ended up reuniting with the one soul their souls have subconsciously been searching for. No telling if this therapy is truly legitimate, but given Weiss following and success, it is surely intriguing and provokes thought on the subject of reincarnation.Only Love Is Real is definitely worth the read for those who've had the \\"I feel like I've known you forever\\" feeling when meeting someone for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I found I couldn't put this book down when I started reading it. It answers many questions and is very thought provoking. Both my husband and I felt when we met that we were soul mates and after reading this book I truly believe it. What other explanation can there be when you meet someone and find an instant connection, a bonding with the person? Why else do you finish each other's sentences, know exactly what someone will say or do even shortly after meeting them? Since reading the book we are now both highly interested in past life regressions to find out exactly where we were together in past lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a nice, clear overview of the past-life regression theory and practice. I enjoyed the quotes from very notable historical figures at the beginning of each chapter (they lent even more credibility to the subject). I particularly appreciated the \\"revelations\\" from the Masters that are sprinkled throughout the story. I even enjoyed the author's opinions on psychic abilities and other delicate subjects. If it wasn't a library book, I would have highlighted several important passages.I would not say I'm totally convinced that the characters actually lived and remembered past lives. The book was sort of fluffy and ethereal as are most books on spiritual/New Age material (they are very hard to translate into day to day reality). But definately something to ponder."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK OFFERING DATA ON PAST LIIVES","review":"While Dr. Weiss's first book, MANY LIVES, MANY MASTERS, was a watershed on the subject of past life therapy, I was most impressed with ONLY LOVE IS REAL.I would be giving away the ending by explaining my rationale, but in this wonderful, quick read, Dr. Weiss has pushed the envelope of synchronicity beyond mere anecdotal, meaningful coincidence and closer towards scientific evidence of life after death.That he performs this feat in the context of a love story is sublime!

Mehta writes in a manner that is clear and not intimidating. The pictures are beautiful and the suggested yoga routines (each based on a theme such as stretching the arms and legs) are well thought out. Co-author, Krishna S. Arjunwadkar, adds yoga philosophy throughout the book - giving the reader an insight into the deeper mysteries of yoga.For those of us who have been practicing for quite some time, there is still much here to appreciate.

In that way this cd is sort of like jazz only in a Celtic and bluesy and folksy way. You can probably hear Dan's roots more in this cd than in his later ones, \\"Plaids\\" and \\"Melodies/Improvisations\\". It's neat to hear where he came from a bit more. These tracks each have a couple of guitars interacting with each other (actually, there are a few solo tracks and sections), I love to hear how his mind works with multiple instruments. Trust me when I say that you need to listen to this over and over because there is always something new that you've missed before."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY?","review":"This is the end of one of the best series ever writen.

With Anja Gallendro's growing addiction to andris spice she decides to steal Zekk's ship THE LIGHTNING ROD to go and get more spice from Kessel. Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, Lowbacca and Zekk decide to go after her to stop her spice addiction and get Zekk's ship back. When they get to Kessel they learn that the administraitor has had a assasination attempt on him and Anja has left to Mon Calanmari. Leaving Jaina & Lowbacca to watch over the administrator. When the rest of the gang arrives at Mon Calamari they meet with the Jedi healer/ambassador they meet Anja and decide to destroy the evil Czethros (who smuggles andris spice) spice hideaway under the ocean. But Czethros has landed troops on Kessel for a takeover,and only Jaina & Lowbacca stand in his way! The book is exciting with lots of action. I recomend it to all Star Wars readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End...","review":"Overall, this was an exellent book,except for one problem-there wasn't enough meat in the end,especially because it gives you no clue whatsoever what is going to happen to Jacen,Jaina, and all their friends.I mean,the authors can't just leave devoted readers hanging in the balance like that.An epilouge at least would be nice,wouldn't it! Otherwise, this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finesse and Style - Women love it","review":"Most of the moves on this DVD are not \\"hard\\", but they look great and it will separate you from everybody else. When I do some of these at the clubs the women almost always smile because they are having fun. They think I'm really creative but the DVD is providing all the raw materials.Very few guys use these techniques as the best dancers primarily use them, after they have mastered a series of tough moves. I use these techniques and women think I'm much more advanced than my current level. These are for guys wanting finesse, style and moves women at any level can follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"You have to read this book.

I just watched this with my wife and had to keep looking over at her to see if we were really watching it. I just felt like it skipped from on disconnected slapstick skit to the next.

The jokes were not funny at all. Adam Sandler keeps telling the nanny to study, oh yeah, get out those books and study for the big test. It wasn't funny the first time, so why would it be funny the fifth time?It's very lame to see: a child drink milk from his mother, have children say stuff just for shock effect, have people fall or crash into buildings, the hot daughters, etc.The plot of the movie is family, keeping the family together,etc. You just have to trudge through very lame jokes and bad acting until you finally get to the plot. Yes, I admit, there were a few GREAT laughs though, but just a few, very few.The movie was just a weekend in the life of a bunch of long-time friends. Overall, wasn't funny or exciting or interesting, but in the end, it had a good \\"message\\" to tell its audience about appreciating what you have in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Believe the Reviews - Good, Clean Humor","review":"I loved this movie.

One of my friends stated that after watching this movie, she left the theatre with a very happy feeling. What's wrong with a little crazy humor? I think we need more of it. Every one that I talked to who saw Grownups. shared the same feeling. I have seen most of Adam Sandler's movies and did find the humor in some of them to be too simple, but not this one. I can be anywhere, think about certain incidents, and break out in laughter. Can't wait to own it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a a very dumb movie!","review":"This is really a BAD movie!

The main problem is that it's so poorly written. My wife and I sat through the entire thing, and neither one of us laughed once. We did emit a considerable number of groans, though, at the lame attempts at humor and poorly contrived dialog. But, come to think of it, Spade is still trying to live down \\"Joe Dirt,\\" Sandler hasn't done anything really funny since \\"Anger Management,\\" Schneider is a constant embarrassment, Rock has never lived up to his potential, and James is just that annoying guy on \\"King of Queens.\\" Maybe it's not so mysterious after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt embarrased watching this","review":"Really?

The lady at the video store told me this was a great kids movie. I went into this with high expectations and thus I was disappointed. I had my kids watch it with us and I was upset. During the movie the busy mom confesses that she is the tooth fairy and will put money under the pillow for her daughter. I had a lot of explaining to do. Luckily I have The Rock to thank for building up their beliefs in the Tooth Fairy. This movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be, but it was entertaining. I would rate it average, but because of the language and the tooth fairy comments, I am rating it only at two stars. I would try a different movie rather than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had been wanting to watch this movie for sometime and was excited to rent it. The 1st 15 minutes into the movie I knew something was terribly wrong - it was the script. They tried so hard to bring the laughs but it falls very very short - not even close. With such a star studded cast packed full of hilarious comedians you would think it would be full of humor - they struggled to even get slap stick laughs. Even Spades smart ass remarks were just annoying. I dont see how anyone sober could find this movie funny. Don't waste your time or money on this one kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Could not make it past the first 30 minutes","review":"I expected a movie with such an all-star cast of comedians to be really funny, but it was anything but. It was boring with weak attempts at humor. I expected the guys to be doing their own thing, but the movie includes the characters families as well. The movie is aimless and uninteresting. It is fun to get together with old friends and laugh about the past, but the movie fails to capture that feeling - although it tries. It would have been better to film the guys hanging out for a weekend as themselves and see what happens. Adam Sandler started out his career brilliantly with SNL, his comedy CD's, and movies like \\"Happy Gilmore\\" and \\"The Wedding Singer\\". I'm not sure what happened since then, but this movie is not funny, it has a terrible story, is another Sandler dud, and I highly do not recommend it. What a waste of time it was just to watch 30 minutes of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful waste of talent","review":"This is a terrible movie that completely wastes the actual talent of a few of the actors.

I can just tell they are trying so hard to make it funny. This movie is so horribly written, everything that happens has a setup and is so obvious, even the 'dramatic' family stuff.

You would think that with all those comedians in one movie that they could come up with something that was more funny then a fat man squashing a bird.

In Grown Ups they obviously enjoy hanging out and making each other laugh since that's all the movie is about. They might as well have just recorded themselves unscripted hanging out and released it as a movie.While the funny Kevin James is just wasted in all these Happy Madison movies as their new fat clumsy guy. Don't get me wrong, Chris Farley was hilarious, if you don't believe me, watch his SNL skits. But even he would have been wasted in this movie, even though he would have enjoyed hanging out with his buddies. The material is just flat though and these guys made each other laugh, more than they made me laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote the jokes for this movie??! Not funny at all!","review":"Who wrote the jokes for this movie? The jokes were like written for the 1920's or something. Very banal humor. I think whomever wrote the jokes were high or giddy (or both) and thought they would be funny because they were in such a giddy mood. If you like smart, zingy, perverted, or witty humor...then this is NOT the movie for you to watch. I guess they put all these \\"funnymen\\" together and thought the laughs would be handed to them. No wonder they were pushing this release so hard with all the actors promoting it on talk shows and NBA games...because it was a desperate move. Don't even rent this movie....you won't be able to get a laugh through the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing.","review":"So disappointing.

They couldnt stay with one storyline and make a strong movie. This movie totally sucked. There was only like 4 or 5 parts that made me laugh. They couldve done so much more with the 5 main male characters bonding at the lake house and go from there. Salma Hayek was awful in her role. BAD casting. She had no chemistry with Sandler or anyone else. Very random choice. The kids were cute though. The part at the end with the basketball game rivalry was retarded. It also didnt make sense that they were all so into their coach that they would take his ashes from his niece and scatter them. I ve never seen anyone that close to their coach.

First of all, the movie was not funny. period. Also, it showed the stars as kids for probably one minute. A bunch of old friends get together to mourn the death of a basketball coach they had when they were like ten years old. Sandler and the gang go out and camp in the woods in honor of their coach - a character that the audience has no clue about and isn't developed on at all. This movie is so bad, it just proves Sandler's career has gone down the crapper. I was literally begging for this movie to end, but it just kept dragging on. This movie thinks it has some kind of moral to it, but its just flatout stupid. It tries to act like it has a moving story, but it doesn't. Very, very bad movie. I advise you not to see it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sure glad I didn't pay for it...","review":"My wife and I found this on-demand through FiOS last week. What a HORRIBLE movie! It is not funny, drawn out and is complimented by an atrocious script written by Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf. Thank you god we didn't pay for the viewing - it was free and I now understand why! I would have been so mad if we paid $50+ to go to the movies to see this garbage. The funniest (and this is a stretch) part of the movie can be found 10-15 minutes in when Kevin James busts through the side of his pool. It is all downhill after that. Save your money; don't purchase this horrible, horrible movie. You will be much better off purchasing Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and/or The Wedding Singer. Sandler's career takes a sharp down-turn after these films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"With such a great cast, how could you not like it?Right?Wrong!!Less than 10 minutes into the movie,we wereso disappointed and it only got worse.Nothing about it was funny, gross jokes,nothing new or original.If I had been at a movie theater, Iwould have walked out and warnedanyone else coming in to go seesomething else, anything else.This was a waste of time, and even more sadly, a waste of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. I was told at work that this was a very funny film, and I was excited when it arrived in the mail. The film opens with the men as boys winning a basketball game. This scene was actually pretty funny, but the movie quickly turned south. As the men grew up they all went their separate ways. I found the characters to be disgusting. There wasn't a single one that I actually liked. The humor was stale. Plus, all the jokes were based on the humor of ripping on each other (meaning making fun of your friends by saying things that friends really shouldn't say to each other). The lines were delivered as if they reading off a cue card.This movie had all the makings of being a great film. Great cast, a funny group of men to write the thing, and a plot that afforded a lot of humor filled moments. Unfortunately they couldn't find the funny.Don't buy this film. Heck, don't even rent this film. It is time that you will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"This show starts out with a few laughs, then turns inappropriate for the young, and cliche for the experienced. Included is a breast feeding 4 year old? Multiple threats and requests to kill a family pet and a seemingly unending string of derogatory remarks about someones wife who is supposed to be older than him (though the difference is hardly discernible). Suffice it to say the script is well beneath the capabilities of the participating actors.

The singing is not at all mellifluous in any way whatsoever; it is rather a droning monotone (think the female equivalent if Howard Cosell took up music), the piano chops and overall atmosphere of the record is moodier than I can stand. I like moody when it's good (David Sylvian's \\"Secrets of the Beehive\\").I'll give them credit for one thing, they've managed a classy name for themselves.

There were very few actual sex scenes, and the ones that were there were distracting with all the contraptions. When I order a book of this type, I want something to fantasize along with, something that can \\"get me in the mood\\". This fell far short. It actually angered me. I'm not a prude, and certain sex acts don't turn me off, just because I don't involve myself with them, but one story actually spent paragraphs discussing the dental dam & other \\"safety\\" accompaniments the characters used.

Having the impact tool seemed like over kill but I thought I would try it, and it was my birthday. Turns out that the impact tool is very easy to use, great low speed control, and works well even with small screws. The body is small, and gets into tight corners easily. The drill is great too, the chuck is hand tightened, and has internal ratcheting that can easily hold any drill bit without slipping. The shift from drilling to driving without losing the clutch setting is very nice. The tool case was not made to hold the Impact driver, so I had to modify the plastic with a knife, and move the foam padding to stop the tools from bouncing around. The case does have plenty of space for two sets of bits and a third battery if I get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen","review":"I found Just Jaeckin's \\"The Story of O\\" and \\"Emmanuelle\\" to be erotic masterpieces, and bought this DVD on the strength of his past work.

If your buying this for any reason other than to see a young Kitaen nude you will be disappointed. There's lots of nudity with a spattering of sexual scenes. Her friend, Zadou, has a nice, but plain face, but a great body.The DVD is presented in a plain package; a picture of Tawny on front with the title, Gwendoline, and a picture of her on the back in one of the uniforms from the movie. This looks to be the French version dubbed in English except for the English characters, but I could be wrong. The titles are in French.It's been a while since I've seen the movie on cable, so I don't know what makes this \\"Unrated director's cut\\" special.If you're interested in Tawny's acting, get Witchboard or Bachelor Party.

Jane Fonda's role in Barbarella comes to mind. This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend.But the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen (cast as Gwendoline) apparently balked at doing girl/girl scenes (this was 1984, after all), and so the producers obligingly didn't force her to do any, and as a result this one turned into a very bland, weak, and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's not a good adventure film, and it's certainly not erotic.There's a little nudity, and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics, but overall this one was a disappointing bust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gwendoline movie","review":"This movie was every bit as campy and good as I remember it, I have been looking for it on DVD for ages.

I just loved anything that had to do with babies, as well as the witty Amelia Bedelia. When I heard of this book it sparked my interest. As usual you can't help but smile when you read about Amelia Bedelia's literal view on life. One of my favorite parts of the book is when Amelia Bedelia is reading her baby-sitting \\"to do\\" list and it says to apply powder after bath time. So then Amelia powders herself instead of the baby. Amelia is touched by the thoughtfulness of Mrs. Lane(the baby's mother). This book is altogether clever and enduring. Amelia Bedelia and baby Missy will definately find a place in your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Baby","review":"Amelia Bedelia doesn't know the first thing about child care. In fact, she functions as a child herself! Naturally, the bumbling maid takes every written instruction literally and of course, you can count on her to bake something. When the child's parents return and see what a mess Amelia made of their place, naturally the wife goes ballistic. The husband shuts her up by shoving a wedge of strawberry tart down her throat. Once pacified with food, they relent and Amelia, drawn by a different artist and wearing a weird looking hat is back in their good books. Why? And did you ever notice that it is always the women who are silenced with food? You can be sure Amelia kept on baking as that was guaranteed to keep her employed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Amelia Bedelia","review":"This is a wonderful, entertaining book from the Amelia Bedelia series. I have read all of them to my four year old son, but this one is one of the best.Amelia Bedelia has never babysat before, and takes everything literally when she reads from the list given to her by the baby's parent. Her limited interpretation of the list is hilarious, and kept my son laughing through the whole book. It is a wonderful story, and one that surely any parent would want to have in their home for their young child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelia and the baby","review":"In this book a wacky woman who does not have much common sense baby-sits.

Thankfully Billboard has my favorite Christmas songs on one cd on their \\"1955 - 1983 (or \\"present\\" as it is noted on the cd packaging). As for the rest of the cd, I liked most of the songs however I can so live without hearing that tiresome novelty track \\"Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer\\" which has been satirized one too many times over the years, and the equally obnoxious \\"Nuttin' For Christmas\\".

Oh for a radio station ready to present and promote WORM DRINK, ARMY OF BONO, or SPLEEN MERCHANT!It's neat how listening to a Clutch album, especially this one, doesn't make one feel depressed or empty of energy.

When I finished listening to Blast Tyrant, after inserting it into my CD player for the first time, I was stunned by this masterpiece I just listened to. When the CD stopped playing I just sat there amazed and in compete awe. The experience was burnt forever into my memory. I was that moved by this album.

This is not a preview of the vocal craft that Shirley Manson would develop as a result of Garbageman Vig's and (the boys') excellent arrangments and production. But Angelfish does feature a few flashes of brilliance that prove Manson's power is hers and was there all along, just waiting for the right musicians.Angelfish isn't them, however.This cd is surprisingly mediocre.

I never grow tiered of listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Endeavor","review":"This early arrangement is largely popular because of the fame brought to it by Shirley Manson of \\"Garbage\\". This is the album that gained attention for her incredible vocal talent and writing ability. While in itself, the album is best described as a cookie-cutter 80's style rock, it still manages to pop to all who listen. Throughout this compilation, Angelfish takes you on a brief trip through your spirituality, instilling a very unique feel that can only be described as a revelation to oneself. This albums sound is noticeable as a great influence to the future of Manson's career with \\"Garbage\\". The flow of this album is so well done that one hardly notices when a track changes, easily listened to from beginning to end, giving this unsung treasure a 5 of 5 rating.

Garbage is unique because of Shirley's unique voice. Angelfish likewise is Shirley. If you like Shirley in Garbage, you'll like Shirley in Angelfish. Just like Shirley was great in Fox's Sarah Connor Chronicles.This really deserves only 3-stars because of the roughness of the band - being their first release - but Shirley's sultry voice and come-hither looks get an extra star. I love Shirley. This will add a unique element to your Garbage collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Garbage fans who want more","review":"I found this CD after being a Garbage fan for some time. Angelfish strikes me as sort of a stripped down, raw prequel to what we would hear from Shirley Manson later on with Garbage. Standout tracks include \\"King Of The World\\", \\"Dogs In A Cage\\" and \\"Heartbreak To Hate\\". \\"Suffocate Me\\" is a nice companion track to later effort \\"#1 Crush\\" (Absolute Garbage), a track that takes obsession to a whole new level.Early Shirley, and highly recommended for longtime fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Front to back, awesome album","review":"I have owned this album for YEARS!

The problem with the Classic Girl fit is that a size Large tank fit like a size Small with a shorter length. I kept the two CG tanks since these were bought specifically for the gym, the price is excellent, and snug is ok there, but I would never wear them as streetwear. I like the American Apparel tanks for the gym especially because the front neckline isn't too low and the wide color range offered.Be aware that it's a crap-shoot for the customer, you won't know what 'fit' you are getting until the garment arrives in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for more...","review":"There are only a couple of good songs out of 10...

Just try fry an egg on it and you will see what I mean. Calphalon deceptively do not mention this sticky feature in their description.

If you call them, their CS will send you a DVD to tell you how to use their wok (pure PR BS not helping at all, wok still sticks). They will tell you that they cannot do anything for you.However, they also have a non-stick version of this wok. If you still like to spend heftily on the cookware, non-stick should be more proper.

This talks more about nursing a toddler than any other book out there. Nursing a toddler is a VERY different experience than nursing a baby. Toddlers bring so many new challenges to the table that having a book that validates how you are feeling each step of the way really helps empower the mother to make changes and create reasonable limits with love. You have to take care of both of you to be able to keep nursing for a long time.

I got pregnant with my 3rd when my 2nd was just four and a half months old despite the fact that I was nursing on cue and taking birth control! I realize babies so close together is not as common, but it does happen. A lot of the problems I anticipate just weren't addressed. The fact that such a comprehensive book barely touched on it, is making me feel like it might be a bad idea or just too difficult. There is also no info on nursing twins. There is still some useful information, but not enough to be worth buying it unless you will be nursing a toddler with your newborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful, not inspirational","review":"The is the bible for tandem nursing.

I think if I had read this book I might have been a bit better prepared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info","review":"Reading with a toddler is a bit of a challenge, so I haven't quite finished the book yet (very close!) It is a great resource for anyone nursing while pregnant and/or planning to tandem nurse. I was able to be prepared for some of the changes in the nursing relationship with my current nursling before they occurred. I feel like the book set realistic expectations for what may happen once the new baby is here, and offered suggestions for dealing with issues. Though I am a stubborn mule and will tandem nurse no matter what, the book does talk about weaning and doesn't portray it as a failure. If that is what you need to do for your family, the book offers suggestions and information on how to maintain the closeness of your nursing relationship with your first nursling without actually nursing them. There is a great section on positions, with real photos, which is one of the things I was most curious about. Overall, a great resource. I'm glad I ordered it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for Tandem Nursing","review":"I LOVED this book. Not only was the information wonderful, helpful and supportive of nursing with two or more children, the pictures of families who chose to Tandem nurse were touching.

The music isn't that different from some bands that are getting airplay with similar styles (maybe Foo Fighters) which makes it surprising I've never heard them on the radio or in clubs (NJ/NYC area).If you like this album, you should definitely get your hands on the first. Though \\"Universe\\" has less of the flowing guitar workings of \\"Radioactive,\\" it makes up for it in pure energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Innovative Look at Overcoming and Preventing Cancer.","review":"I am extremely grateful to [Dr Cilento] for having dedicated so much time and effort in writing this wonderful book.

Unfortunately this movie is just dreadful. The only character that is at all interesting is the one played by Edie Falco. The rest of the characters are all minor characters given major screen time and the result is just SNOOORRRRRREEEEE....ZZZZZZZZZ.Please avoid this travesty at all cost or just fast forward to all the scenes with Edie Falco and her family. It's films like this that illustrate why Halle Barry got the Oscar and Angela Bassett never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but preachy","review":"This is an excellent film in many ways. The acting is particularly impressive (check out Edie Falco and Mary Steenburgen). There are five stories going at once, and they are treated with delicacy and depth. The pace is brisk and the script is tight. The plot is described in other reviews.The movie is marred by Sayles's usual leftist preaching style. All of the corporation executives are evil, town officials are corrupt and rude, all of the blacks are good (two hold doctorates), and there are some strong and at times muddled statements about civil rights. Preaching aside, there is a melodramatic aspect to the film that may turn off some viewers. The golfer scenes with Alan King defy explanation, although they are mildly amusing.Still, on the whole, this is a first-rate film that deserves a lot of attention. It gives one hope for modern films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Florida born and raised","review":"We loved this movie, and have bought many copies to give to FL friends and relatives. Scenes of FL as it used to be, as well as scenes from FL as it is now. Great fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Recording in Coliln Davis's Berlioz cycle","review":"Truly a bravado performance totally underseving of the very negative review the recording has unjustly recieved. French opera is not always accessible on first hearing. French opera is often very subtle and doesn't grab the listener immediately. I think Berlioz and Wagner have one unforutnate characteristic in common, you either get their music or you don't.This score sparkles from beginning to end especially under the baton of Colin Davis. Nicholai Gedda remains one of the finest interpreters of French music and here, as in the \\"Damnation of Faust\\", excels with beautiful tone and delivery. His French is impeccable. Edda-Pierre is not to my personal taste but she is excellent. Bastin, Berbie, Soyer and Massard sing their roles with vocal aplomb and dramatic involvement. A wonderful set! If you like French opera, and Berlioz in particular this belongs in your collection. A valuable addition to the catalogue. Buy if before it disappears."},{"rating":"1","title":"gasp!","review":"I admit there may be others, but is McFaul the worst Moscow-based Western journalist around?

I am an avid sci-fi reader and the description on this book had me excited. Interstellar travel! Alien artifacts! Colonization! These are all subjects that I enjoy the heck out of. But I couldn't get past the very explicit sexual references in this book. And coming from me, a self-professed pervert, this is a resounding denouncement. By page 20, I had been confronted with at least 5 explicit images that would give a trashy romance novel a run for its money. But unlike a romance novel, most of these images were dark, disturbing, and fairly pathological. I'm the last person to want to sensor a book, so if you're into filthy, detailed descriptions of sexual vice, this is the book for you. But if you'd prefer a good story that provokes thought and doesn't rely on shock value, steer clear of this not-so-great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's \\"sexuality\\" and then there is porn","review":"I did not get beyond the first 50 or so pages of this book and that is very rare for me. I still hesitate to write a bad review, but i am becoming convinced that the author could have done less extreme sex and more plot in the beginning at least. I don't think the child sex, the weird sex and whatever sex was warranted, regardless of the \\"point\\" that was trying to be made. I love Sci Fi, and there WERE parts of this book that seemed interesting, but - well, call me a prude - I just could not get beyond the distasteful sex acts in this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad","review":"This book could have been so much better had the writer taken the time to acualy have a plot. The story in this book is great. I love how he portrayed the future, I like how the characters were differant and had different morals then what we have and how there backgrounds were also different. What I did not like about this book was how it took me almost 300 pages to actually start to like what I was reading. The ending could have been better, I've never read a 400 page book that sums the whole thing up in 1.5 pages"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope The Mission Doesn't Compromise The Sex","review":"I hate to sound like a prude but GOOD GRIEF! The authors seem to have missed the lecture on pleasures being best enjoyed in moderation. This book fairly wallows in sex. Can you imagine Neil Armstrong spending his first 5 minutes on the moon lost in thoughts of his first sexual encounter? The first humans to reach another star system and this is what fills their minds? Unbelievable! Beyond this obsession, the book is devilishly hard to read. I didn't make it through the first 50 pages. I sure miss real Sci-Fi writers like Jack Vance. Doesn't anyone write good science fiction anymore?The back cover says, \\"Barton and Capobianco are a team to watch out for.\\" I couldn't agree more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling Book","review":"I was expecting a sci-fi book. I was not expecting the graphic sexual nature of the book. I was so appalled by chapter two that I returned the book to the store. This book should have a warning on the label about the graphic sexual content. I also consider it to have depictions of child pornography. Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute filth","review":"Just do yourself a favor, and stay away from this book. I made it through about the first 80 pages, and didn't just trash it, I shreded it because I was afraid someone else may find it. Brutal, graphic details of the rape of a child. Sex sex sex. Characters all have such huge character flaws, they never should have passed their psych tests to be allowed on this flight. Poorly written. If I could, not only would I give this book zero stars, it would have a negative score. Years later, and I am still scared mentally from the filth in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what has sci-fi become???","review":"When I bought this book, I was looking for something interesting to read, since I enjoy sci-fi books with passion. I went to my nearest market and looked for the most interesting title I could find. So I bought Alpha Centauri, and regreted it. Since I started to read this book, I found myself submerged in a very unorganized and many times boring story. The manipulation of sex and its explicit detail grew more and more until it was unbearable. I decided to close this book, never to open it again. If I wanted to read a sex book, I would've picked up a love novel widely sold on supermarkets. I'm very sad bout the intentions of the authors of getting our attention by means of sexual overload, sci-fi is not that, it is pure what may-be science. When I compare this book with the one by Dale Brown, \\"Silver Tower\\", Alpha Centauri seems as a cheap, vaguely tought novel.In all of my life, this is the only book I have never finished, and I have read some bad literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, don't walk..","review":"..away from this book.Its been some time since I read (or attempted to read this book). However, I thought that I would do my good deed for the world and warn others away from this book. This book is indescribably bad and is possibly the only sci-fi book that I have ever stopped reading without finishing.If it was possible to assign a negative rating I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interminable...","review":"There is some interesting sci-fi in this novel, but not enough to push the (rather gratuitous) sexual themes into the background. When I read a book about the moon landings I don't expect an extended treatise on the astronauts' sex lives. Ditto for a trip to Alpha Centauri. Unfortunately, that is about all this novel boils down to. Also, it is so cynical and depressing in its view of human nature that the reader just may be tempted to join another species, perhaps even another phylum (I'm not sure the authors' haven't done so already, to judge from their obvious unhappiness with life in general). While I didn't get much sci-fi pleasure out of this reading experience, I did get a practical demonstration of Zeno's paradox: the more I read this thing, the farther I seemed to be from the end (and what blessed relief when it did arrive!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Intruiging premise but the end was a letdown (yes, I did finish it, in spite of the fact that I got fed up with the gratuitious sex... found it mostly unnecessary to the story). I felt it usually interrupted and intruded on the story, probably a way for the authors to pad it out. I'm not a prude, but I found most of their behaviours completely unrealistic in keeping with basic human nature. If you like weird sex, you'll love this book. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexual obsession and high drama.","review":"I know there is an excellent science fiction tale lying somewhere deep at the core of this novel, but it is really so hard to wade through the piles of sexual dramatics. And it doesn't matter if it is straight, gay, multi-sex or a-sexual -- it just bogs down the storyline to the point of excess. There are good scientific extrapolations, interesting conflicts and some interesting philosophizing, but the tale felt as if it couldn't decide what it really wanted to tell the reader. Stylistically interesting; a story of great promise, but the execution just left me a little cold. Recommended, but be warned it's a challenging read"},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Barton to date.

As other reviewers have noted, it bogs down in sex (and sexuality, and gender roles), and is hopelessly complex. It's trying to deliver at least a half dozen political messages at once, and is so laden with them that it fails on all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly plotted, badly written and a complete waste of time","review":"I bought this in the airport hoping to have something to read on a trip to New Orleans. Crediting the authors with writing a distrubing but failed vision of the future is simply too generous. I assume they sat down and said well let's see, sex always sells and if a little is good a lot is better, also it should be as kinky as possible. Since this is science fiction we need aliens and wouldn't it be brilliant if the aliens had 4 sexes and if they were also vampiric by nature because (don't you know) vampires are always related to sex. Now to finish the book we only need to craft a shell of a story around the sex scenes, and if it's confusing and far-fetched, well it won't matter because our readers are only going to be interested in the sex scenes.Wrong!! Save your money.D. Fitzgerald"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"Book written entirely in blunted sentences and sentence fragments. Like this!

However, these 50 pages were enough to convince me that this book is waste of good paper and belongs in the trash can.This is not a SF book, it belongs in the porn section. There is nothing but sex in this book, unjustified and sickening.I don't care what point the authors were trying to make (and I have read the other reviews so I see the point), there is simply no justification for descriptions so horrible. I am sure the authors could have chosen another way of proving their point.Avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't give it a zero","review":"Barton & Capobianco have to be the worst authors of Science Fiction I have ever read, or more correctly tried to read.

Though it is a useful tool in presenting all of the complexities of the English verb, as a practical tool for ESL students I cannot recommend it. It is needlessly complicated in its format. The book contains unusual and infrequent English verbs, such as \\"to cleave\\", \\"to yes\\" or \\"to be hemmed.\\" It even provides two conjugations for \\"to hide,\\" one meaning to conceal and one meaning to beat. However, this difference is noted only at the bottom of the page. These sorts of verbs permeate this book. It seems that English has plenty of high frequency verbs that make inclusion of so many bizarre and passive voice verbs unnecessary. This book bears little resemblance to its excellent cousins in the series: 501 French or Spanish verbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Grammar","review":"My friend bought this book to help teach English and not only has it got some very strange verb formations in it, but ones that are totally wrong! We're surprised it has made it into the shops in fact. For example, it contains the verb 'to stink' and as one of its formations lists 'to be stunk'. We are both English and we have never heard of this, so it's misleading to someone learning English. There is even 'I am deep frozen'! This seems unnecessary, as it would surely never be said? It is thorough, but unfortunately much of it is wrong and would teach a foreign person to speak very odd English."},{"rating":"2","title":"501 English verbs","review":"I learned French and Spanish using their equivalent... 501 French and 501 Spanish verbs....and now I buy this book and give it to new learners of English when I teach them. Gaining a command of English, or any language, depends first upon your mastery of the verbs as presented in such a book. Sure, no more information is conveyed about the structure of the various forms than could be conveyed with 50 verbs, but it is handly to have the extra verbs defined in a single reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic resources for teachers of Spanish","review":"Having been a bilingual or Spanish teacher for the past twenty plus years, at times I have needed a book just like this one! Unfortunately, a year ago, it was lost! I loved the book.

It is definitely a *5* star resource for teachers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Only Useful for ESL Beginners","review":"When I bought this book, I was expecting that I could refer to many usages of 501 verbs. However, the content of this book was just presenting various verb forms, like \\"I, we, you, they forgive\\", \\"he, she, it forgives\\", \\"I am forgiving\\" and \\"we, you, they are forgiving.\\" If you learn English only for a couple of months, you will know these things.

I can honestly say I belive the authors forgot to include that section in the book.The information provided is repetetive, it points out how our culture views single people, how much pressure they receive and from which direction the pressure comes from. If you are single none of the information in this book will be a revelation to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book . Empowers single people to enjoy their lives","review":"This excellent book empowers single people to maximize the quality of their lives, while striving to develop intimate relationships. Intimacy is shown as life-enhancing, but not a necessity to being happy, healthy or whole. This important book allows single people the self-esteem they deserve, after all, we are all single at some time in our lives! It contradicts the common societal fallacy that self-worth and respect are contingent upon being in a relationship. The authors clearly show that the most satisfying relationships develop when both people are content, if not delighted, with their lives, and their union brings together two full lives. They then show how cultural stereotypes prevent many single people from achieving this fulfillment. The practical hints for dealing with people who are unaccepting of those in their lives who are single are quite helpful, as is the compassion, understanding and wisdom of the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of Al Martino","review":"This CD should have been remastered.

I finally was given a vhs copy bought off the internet (this was late 90s; the option hadn't existed long and things weren't quite as easy to find - even today the video isn't common). I called a lot of publishers before that though. I learned that the reason it was unavailable was that the rights had been purchased by another entity in the 90s and the film was then put in moratorium (which basically means a company sits on a title until further notice).

As many films in there library the shadow also was in widescreen in laserdisc also maybe in the future universal will start producing more titles in there widescreen products. Even more studios double dipping these days thats what i call a re-release of a film special editions blah blah better late then never right or trying to make the ppl spend more money when they double dip or dont wanna spend the extra time and quaily and money even bad movies get nice transfers look at the newly released gymkata geez. But universal its 2007 jump on the widescreen bandwagon from all the older release you've released from the beginning twins,timecop,the shadow,kindergaten cop,i'm putting faith in you now give the ppl what the ppl really want thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie For Its Type","review":"I think that for a movie that professes to be nothing more than what it is this movie rates high. It is pure science fiction, action. escapism. Nothing more - nothing less. It is pure entertainment. All right so its hard to understand Jean-Claude all the time but they gave him a superlative supporting cast of actors, especially Ron Silver who is always good, who basically carry the movie. The martial arts were kept controlled to the story line and there actually was a story. This movie was not meant to explore the deeper meaning of life. For that go see \\"The Big Sleep\\" with Humphrey Bogart. For pure entertainmentget this one. In my opinion Jean-Claude's best movie, through no fault of his own. A great flick. For those nay-sayers out there GET A GRIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cropped Pictures YACK!","review":"YES!I agree with the other reviewers!This is the one VanDamm movie I LOVE and when I found it in my one used shop I was so extatic I never looked to see screen format! I never though that it would be Full Screen@!#!*!%!!!!!Ye Gods!it totally ruins that wonderful sceen in the kitchen of him doing the splits!Hey ya I'm a red-blooded female...and I can go OUCH at that scene too! that stunt hurts to do and man.....Whistle.....Looks very nice!The cropping really really ruins the impressive impact of that scene and I've not see the picture since it first came outit was really a Disappointment when I saw FULL SCREENCome on UNIVERSAL!!!WE WANT WIDE SCREEN!FULL PICTURE!!!!this is a fantastic action picture and a crying shame to see it in full screen only!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"when i first saw this i was expecting another predictable, timetraveler movie, filmed entiarly in the present time. i was wrong. it was spred out, throughout the past, present and future, and left you guessing till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun!","review":"Alright, first things first: this movie is by no means great cinema. The plot holes will make you nuts if you think about it too hard and the acting is, well, it's a Van Damme movie, so you know going in that there are no award winning performances. That said, the movie is a whole lot of fun - the action is great, the one liners are cheesy fun and Mia Sara is stunning.The HD has a good picture, definitely a major improvement over the old standard edition DVD. The old DVD was pan and scan, the HD version is 2.35:1 1080p. The sound is much better as well.If you've seen it before and liked it, I recommend picking it up. The price is good as well - I expect with the format war nearly over that more HD DVD prices will drop, allowing those of us who took the plunge to at least score some discs on closeout."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD won't play","review":"The DVD wouldn't work, not on any DVD player. And the number to call was one of those that you can't talk to a live person. Soooooo I lost my $10, not a big loss, but I did want to have the movie. Not Amazon's fault; the sender ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought it used but its in excelent shape","review":"I have always liked this movie so when I saw that the manufacture had discontinued it I thought that my only choice was to buy it used. The price was more than reasonable so I figured I wasn't out much if it wasn't in good shape. When I received it and watched it I was very pleasantly surprised that there was no skipping or any problems. I think I have always seen this movie on network TV, so I was surprised by a couple scenes with nudity. I looked away and pressed \\"FF\\" until it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"one is for no widescreen version","review":"Once again, we're stuck with a full screen version of a movie that deserved better then what it got. As with \\"The Shadow\\", this is a decent little movie. It's not going to win any awards but it will certainly keep you entertained. Nice premise and decent Van Damme presence (I don't want to call it \\"acting\\"), but once again the studio decides to go on the cheap and not even give us a decent letterboxed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why No Widescreen DVD?","review":"I own a Video Casette Timecop and ordered a DVD thinking it would be in the same widescreen format as the original video casette--what a disappointment. There are a number of scenes in the original widescreen format that cannot be duplicated in the full screen format which, as I found out, is the ONLY format offered on DVD. This Video company blew it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Much a Classic","review":"For Future Films this is a good one. Pretty much a classic. Van Dame is as good as ever and the show is great on DVD. The story is great - trying to take over the Country through time manipulation. What more can you ask for ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Van Damme film - excellent story.","review":"\\"WHY ISN'T THIS IN WIDESCREEN?\\" they all shouted.I picked up this DVD movie at a clearance sale for $10. Best DVD purchase I have made so far. But why, why, why is this great movie not in Widescreen format? Unacceptable.In my opinion, this is Van Damme's best film. Peter Hyams does an excellent directing job. This movie is on a par with RoboCop and Total Recall, if you liked those.The whole 'time loop' thing can get your head spinning trying to figure it out. Other than that, there are some great martial arts scenes. Mia Sara is enchanting. Van Damme has some great lines (\\"see those two red spots?\\") I also liked the Matuszak character, and Ron Silver is convincing as his two different selves.The ending is great, as Walker (Van Damme) rights the wrongs and the bad guy is turned into a pile of squishy stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"What were they thinking!","review":"I just viewed my DVD of Timecop. I love the story, and the action! But I couldn't believe it when I saw that it was only in full screen! If there is any facet of movie buffs that LOVE their Widescreen, original format - its Sci-Fi fans! For Universal to only release this movie in Pan and Scan format shows that they have no grasp of what their audiences want. Now that that's said, the movie itself is FANTASTIC - Great plot, great action, and great special effects. I would have given it 5 stars if it had been in Widescreen or Dual-layer formats, but it is still definitely worth the time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his better flims","review":"VAN DAMME all the way,good fight scene's with good acting...you can watch this over and over it never gets boring..Ron Silver plays his part well.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timecop","review":"This is the cropped or crap version. The top of there heads are cut off. I just didn't like the quality of the dvd. It was frustrating to watch. It's to bad because this is my favorite Van Damme movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected!","review":"The movie is a somewhat typical Van Damme film transplanted into a realistic sci-fi world. Regardless of the quality of the movie (which was not that bad) the quality of the transfer was exceptional! For a '94 film I was impressed with both the audio and video quality. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie","review":"Most of Van Dammes movies have some aspect that gets on my nerves as being hokey, but this one is an exception. It looks more realistic in the fights that everyone gets the crap beat out of them, yet add some good special FX. It's worth a look to decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time travel with the muscles from Brussels","review":"Pretty decent flick, I actually give it 3.5 stars. A nice, quick sci-fi b-movie with some good action, decent f/x and some subpar acting(of course). Great villian in Ron Silver and Van Damme tries but the film could have been upped a notch with a better lead. Some lapses in logic but are forgivable due to the fact that no one knows what kind of results would be reaped when playing with time. All and all a fun adventure if looking for a quick flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a rip-off","review":"This isn't Stephen Kings work! No matter how much they claim these movies are based on Stephen Kings \\"SHORT\\" story Children of the Corn. The story is only 28 and a half pages, and they've made 5 movies based on it? The closest they've come to being like the story is part 1, and it wasn't very good. It's a bust, why do they keep trying? These movies are alright as far as horror movies go, but they should take Stephen King's name off of them, and in the future, they should make them change the names. I wonder who came up with the name for this one, this is one of the corniest names I've ever heard for any movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"the same old thing!!","review":"the 5th installment in this tired series is not any worseit's just not any better. do your self a favor and buy part 1.they have got so faR from the story it's not worth seeing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequel","review":"Okay I'll admit it. The first was hands down the best movie in the seires. But this film is the best sequel in the seires so far... part 8 is on its way. This one wasn't just and excuss to make a gory cut em' up movie like 2 and 3, and wasn't pure cheese like part 4, and part 6 and 7 where just hands down confussing and boring. If your a fan of the original this is the one sequel you need to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful movie!","review":"This was one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.

Its boring, the plot's stupid and only 5 people die in it. 5!!! Utter trash.P.S. Its so stupid that the heroine can destroy the \\"evil hell-fire\\" with some petrol and a few old sacks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now they are just getting carried away.","review":"Ok...I'll admit it. I like the first Children of the Corn, I also like the second one but not as much. The third one was ok because they threw in a new twist with the kids being in school and living in a large community. I thought that is where they would stop but oh no, why quite well their ahead... Thank god I didn't see COTC4 available anywhere but online or I probably would have ended up renting or buying it.And then of course COTC5...Why go this far?This movie blew. It did have a good plot with the kids being grown up now but I must say that in no way was this movie scary or entertaining. Don't buy it unless you are a super huge Children of the Corn fan and need to have every one of them. It is a complete waste of time so avoid it at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fight the Fire With the Fire...'Kay, I'll Just Burn the VHS Copy of the 4th Sequel.","review":"Viewed: 8/12Rate: 28/12: Because it has some energy, Children of the Corny V: Fields of Terror is better than the last two sequels. Since I've rated it as \`2' out of \`10', it's not saying much. What's with nonsensical scripts getting approved for a picture? How do these people get paid doing it? Do they have connections in Hollywood no matter how rubbish something looks? That's what happened with Children of the Corny V: Fields of Terror. That little boy with the big ears, I would have loved to see him getting a huge atomic wedgie, so he can run and cry to his mommy's bosoms. That would been a funny sight. All in all, why are they still making more sequels for Children of the Corny series? What's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all regions","review":"I was very dissapointed that this region 1 disc doesn't play on any of my all regions DVD players/recorders.

It's much larger than the basic model but that was perfect for me, as the basic feels a little small on my wrist. It was very easy to program and set up, am currently wearing it. However, the band feels like it might break a little easier than the rubber ones and there's no information about if it's waterproof or not.

In this world of smartphones, etc, if it's stolen or lost, you've lost all your key Phone numbers and codes, as well as schedules and alarms. Granted you have to use thumb nails to enter data into a Databank, but how different is that from Texting ? And who looses their watch or gets it stolen? The only reason I replaced my old Databank is that the \\"pm\\" button stopped working and most of the frequently used letters were faded, so I couldn't switch out of military time and it made new entries difficult. The only thing I miss on this Databank is that it doesn't have a Timer. They don't make a \\"Ladies\\" Databank for obvious reasons, but this size watch fits just fine. Get into the more expensive ones and it will really stand out. It's a good backup to your phone as long as you don't mind entering data twice. I hope they continue making then. Amazon delivered mine in record time. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Watch Customer","review":"Very happy with the purchase. Great price at $25.48!

To all of you people who think they sound the same as all the other up and coming bands i completely disagree. Maybe you don't like the genre as much, but that doesn't mean the band isn't talented. When compared with Linkin Park I'd say this band is farther towards rock on the rap/rock scale (I know linkin park isn't rap, but they have more rap than third strike). The music brings out emotion and energy from within me and I don't get sick of the music, which in my opinion is ideal music. It's really too bad they only made 1 CD, although as with most bands they probably would have made 1 CD (at most) on par with this one before going downhill."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},R={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-498c683e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/23.md","filePath":"glossary/23.md"}'),H={name:"glossary/23.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
