The authors teach in the traditional way with Zen stories to lead the reader toward an inner experience.

I have to admit I'm far from a being a fan of merengue although this album does have two somewhat enjoyable tracks \\"Bebiendo sin banarse\\" and \\"A pesar de todo.\\" It also includes a medley from his days with El Gran Combo. \\"Villaran Cuenca\\" and \\"Mi Otro Yo\\" are solid tracks and you can clearly sense a similar musical style to his former Combo band mates.

Strange cage devices were strapped on boy's penises to prevent them from masturbating, and some women were made to wear a \\"Chasity belt\\" to ensure fidelity. That was the era Crowley lived in. Then he came - doing what he wilt :-) which means holle raising (in more ways than one), man and womanizing, and so on.At the same time Sigmund Freud penned his psychosexual development theory and shocked the world.Despite how interesting Alister Crowley was-the book was unusually wordy and BORING. I mean COME ON it was a terrible struggle getting through the first few chapters. DRY uninteresting reading with a complete lack of sources.****YAWN**** over and over again ***YAWN***"},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced and Enlightening","review":"A compelling, balanced and thoroughly enlightening read. The biography of Mr. Crowley for the ardent fan and the generally curious alike. Mr. Sutin's argument concerning the conflict between Crowley's powerful self-conception as a proper English gentleman and his homosexual desires is persuasive and does address much of the extremes to which Crowley put himself.Highly Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly-written biography...","review":"Mr. Sutin has taken as distasteful subject as you could wish for and turned it into an entertaining and very learned piece of literature.Crowley was a spoiled Victorian-era bisexual who's intensive studies into far-east mysticism, occultism and religion in general has influenced every one from Charlie Manson to Don Henley and the Beatles.Lucky for us, Sutin gives Crowley a very level-handed treatment. Not ignoring Crowley's massive faults but rather explaining Crowley's reasons for his demeanor.It is clear that Sutin spent a lot of time researching this book and his effort shows. This is a must-read book for anybody interested in the development of cults in America or even the oft-overlooked fascination that Victorian culture had for the occult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"Sadly, while it will make many Thelemites happy by being nicer to AC, this book is a simpler version of Symond's \\"Great Beast\\".

With one exception. I did what \\"I wilt\\" and returned this to the library after 50 pages. The book starts out very slowly and stays at a \\"snail's pace\\" page after page. Very little is revealed about the occult & magick aspects of Crowley's life. If you really need to know about Crowley's life this book is really the only one available, so I quess you could consider it a must read for that reason alone.."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a despicable man","review":"I admit, my over arching dislike of this despicable man makes it almost impossible to do a balanced review of the book. The book does take us from the beginning of Crowley's life to his death and provides the sickening details of his \\"magik\\" progress. That alone would be sufficient enough to make one ill, but the author makes Crowley's perversions and mental illness sound like an everyday, ho-hum normal kind of thing. How a psychotic man like this ever got a following is beyond me. The author does do a good job of detailing Crowley's life and interactions with others, as well as his desire to elevate himself in his \\"craft\\". It seems to be a solid, true to life biography of a man who will make your stomach turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unexpected result","review":"Somehow Sutin manages to make Crowley boring. This is a dull, patchy uninteresting book with a confused narrative. A more intelligible introduction is to be found in Martin Booth's 'A Magick Life' (at the time of writing UK only, but available from Amazon.co.uk), though Booth, too, tries a bit to hard to be kind to his frankly deplorable subject. Best of all, try John Symonds - not 'The Great Beast', but his lesser-known updated version 'King Of The Shadow Realm'; if you can find a copy, that's the book. Sutin has some good photos, though not enough of them, but his text is so turgid. Do what thou wilt, indeed, but I recommend that you avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"New light on the beast","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book, it is objectively written neither glorifying Crowley or reviling him. As at least one other reviewer has pointed out it is not as entertaining a read as Symonds' \\"Great Beast\\" but it does shed a bit of new light on aspects of Crowley that others have neglected. His mountaineering and bisexuality for instance. I particularly enjoyed the final chapter deling with his last years and showing his influence on subsequent developments in Magick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is basically a chronicle of the places that he lived,the women and men he was with and his finacial problems;with only a most surface account of his magical practices or his philosophies.

It avoids the idiotically sycophantic efforts of I. Regardie, K. Grant, R. A. Wilson ( some of those who believe the destructive, egomaniacal, blood and dope drinking Crowley to be the avatar of the century at least and of all history at most) and similar occult/psychology true belivers while steering clear of the opposite cliff, the naive dismissals of Symonds, Hutchinson, Colin Wilson and the kinds of hacks who write entries for those ridiculous encycopedias of the supernatural.

In other words, treat them like a traditional cast iron skillet.Try innovating:Half banana and a bit of vanilla blended in, a few pecans over the batter before closing the top. Incredible.A few cranberries, blueberries and a dash of cinnamon.

Because the characters she creates are rather shallow and lifeless, the emphasis veers toward the history...which she informs us at the end of the novel that she's *changed,* for the purposes of the book. That's one big problem. There is also an attempt to balance the physical passion of the couple with a strong attempt to make the heroine's Christian spirituality a major presence in the story. That doesn't quite work, either. If the reader isn't Christian, it's simply an annoying distraction, like a commercial for the same product that keeps interrupting the show.Religious agendas have no place in this product.

Clark Gable was brilliant in this, actually I think it was his best film, it seems there was quite a rapport with him and Ms Day. Gig Young was also right for the part and the nightclub scene was extremely funny. The one thing you can say about this movie is that it really hasn\`t dated in it\`s appeal with it\`s sharp wit.

If you love a good romantic comedy you'll definitely love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERVALUED FILM ON JOURNALISM","review":"While anyone seeing a film with Doris Day and Clark Gable can reasonably expect a comedy, most will get a bonus for their viewing pleasure: a contest between the \\"old\\" journalism and the \\"new\\" newsroom. Gable represents the old and Day teaches the new. An amalgam here is welcome, and in the process we learn something about how to research and write a good news story and feature.The relationship between Day and Gig Young is humorous and provides additional conflict for the story, but as usual, at the heart of a George Seaton film is really an important lesson of life. Seaton was one of our most udervalued writer-directors.

In case you're wondering why Cooper does this, I should probably inform you that _Period_ is meant to give closure to his previous novels, much as a period provides closure to a sentence. Actually, in this case it's more like a stake through the heart.The big news here is that George Miles reappears from Cooper's first novel _Closer_, and is marginally more interesting this time around.For such a tiny book, _Period_ is crammed to the gills with impenetrable incident. There are pseudo-satanic murders, body doubles, radio call-in shows and cyberchats, isolated teenagers shouting to the dark, rumors and rumors of rumors about a minor novelist, and a generous dollop of smoke-and-mirrors postmodernism just in case you think you might have understood what just happened.Not that there's any reason to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mix of enjoyable music","review":"This is a shared album with the great Mana and Enanitos Verdes in which both bands have a half dozen tracks entrusted to them.

Throughout the book, the style is entertaining and easy to understand, and unlike some other sports autobiographies, Harkes does not spend all of his time reminiscing about his accolades. He speaks well of individuals he meets along the way, and describes highlights of his career, such as playing at Wembley with Sheffield Wednesday, with an honest, child-like enthusiasm. This book is worth reading both for fans of soccer, and for individuals who are curious about the sport and one of its more famous American participants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...2010 reveals...","review":"Let me start this review by stating that I have not read this book. As a soccer fan, it has always been on my list as one I would like to read, but after looking over several excerpts, particularly about the World Cup omission, something struck me as strange and very negative in his story, and I just never clicked the purchase button.This week Coach Steve Sampson and teammate Eric Wynalda revealed publicly that Harkes was dropped as both Captain and from the World Cup squad as he was having an affair with Wynalda's wife. I'm quite certain this was discussed with Harkes, along with other issues, as his reason for being dismissed. His confussion on why he was removed is uncalled for. Looks like time has shown Sampson and Wynalda to have taken the high road in what at the time could have become a complete embarrasment for Harkes.If you're going to write your autobiography, be honest, even if it doesn't show you in a favorable light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies","review":"This product should be reclassified as \\"fiction.\\" When the most important part of the book is recorded with a complete disregard for the actual facts, it calls into question the veracity of EVERY sentence of this book.

In this book, he spends so much time whining about how the coach but it turns out that Harkes himself was the pig all along. And what gets lost in these pages is one very basic fact: Harkes was never close to being a great player. Everyone in the US soccer community knows it: he was mediocre at best. He always had a great work rate (and was good for a laugh or two) but his skills were never anything remotely special. High work rate is why he fit well with the English type of game. But as for skills on the ball? Watch old tape of Tab Ramos. Ramos was the most talented American (although not by birth) to ever touch a ball. After Ramos, there were probably 100 players at least who you'd choose based on ball-skills before Harkes. But all that's just conversation now, isn't it? What's not, what lasts forever is character.

If you want this genre called fusion, stick with Scott Henderson and John McLaughlin. There is absolutely nothing compelling on this album and it's easy to sense MacAlpine's total unfamiliarity of playing in this sort of a jazzy context. Yeah, all these guys can play, but so can a lot of others. And the ones with lesser chops normally stuff that is more compelling and listenable than this. The tunes are lackluster and the interplay just not happening.

I was hoping for a marked improvement but it seems this genre in itself just doesn't have room to grow. The musicianship is typically superb but dry and clinical. There are no real melodies to really speak of, just your typical disjointed fusiony lines that showcase musical \\"discipline\\".

I'm a middle sister with one older and one younger and can relate to everything in this book.

It's a story about how family relationships mold you and your soul. in response to the other harsh reviews about the \\"unbelievable\\" characters- I think Weiner exaggerated their personalities to emphasis her point- that sister's are the same but different at the same time. This isn't a romance novel- it's a novel about coming of age and finding yourself. I haven't read Good in Bed so can't compare there- but I can say I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as Jemima J by Jane Green or Welcome to the World Baby Girl by Fannie Flagg. In Her Shoes is a great beach book but I think stuff literary types would hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frenemies.","review":"In Her Shoes by Jennifer Weiner is a very interesting novel from the \\"chick lit\\" goddess! In Her Shoes was also made into a movie in 2005 which starred Toni Collette and Cameron Diaz. I saw the movie when it was first released and loved it and then got around many years later to reading the novel. I thought the novel was missing something, I like this book and Weiner's effortless writing but I felt the movie lacked more depth and promise. In Her Shoes is timeless tale of sibling rivarly to the max! Rose and Maggie have nothing in common expect their shoe size. Something happens that tears their relationship to shreds but in the end, they find their way back to each other and learn some family secrets along the way! Fun read and rent the movie as well, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't have a sister-you might not like it.","review":"I'm sorry, but I couldn't get into this book at all, maybe it's because my only sibling is a brother? And he wasn't too interested in my shoes...There are no likeable characters in this novel-except for maybe Simon. I couldn't stand the main character-Rose. She is sooooo spineless! And her sister, Maggie is way too selfish to be real! And Rose finds any reason to excuse Maggie's horrible behavior. It's positively frustrating.I usually keep my books after I read them, but I sold this one Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When is the next book?","review":"I really loved this book, coming from a family of sisters and female cousins it intrigued me from the moment I picked it up. I could not put it down until I had finished it, I cried at the right places and I laughed at the funny parts. I never wanted this book to end. Rose is likeable, as is Maggie, I loved reading this book and so did my firends whom I passed it on to. I wish that Roses fiance could have been developed a bit more, I got a little lost when I found out that Rose had not told Stein about her family history etc. and he would just let her leave to go to Miami. When it came to that part there seemed to be gaps that werent really filled enough. Other than that I loved this book and have read it so many times since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as its predecessor...","review":"This book was good, not as good as 'Good in Bed' but well worth the money and time to read. I liked watching the characters develop and enjoyed seeing how Maggie grew throughout the book. All in all another success for Jennifer Weiner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chore to get through","review":"I forced myself to get through this bore of a read because I kept thinking SOMETHING would happen to tie it all together! Unfortunately after trudging through this boring, go nowhere book I was left absolutely unfulfilled and disappointed that I had wasted time and energy on this. I usually like to save books or give them to friends, this was so bad I purposely left it in an airport, I couldn't stand looking at it! I apologize to anyone who found it and read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Payless at the library","review":"I have thought about what it is that bugs me so much about Weiner's writing, and I think it basically comes down to two things. First, it's not even bad enough that's it's so bad it's good; it's mediocre, and in art, even chick lit, there's nothing so bad as mediocre. Second, I can't help feeling that Weiner has disturbing envy issues that come through via her characters. It is just not true that all thin women purge and that overweight women are generally smarter and more humorous. I can only think Weiner has gotten this far by striking a chord with obese and disgruntled women. I read in one of these reviews that Cameron Diaz was being cast as Maggie in the movie adaptation. That fits because I don't rate skinny Diaz either...just to show I'm an equal opportunity reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisterly Conflicts Explored","review":"I bogged down part way; perhaps the sisters' estrangement was too harrowing. Picked it up again after the holiday and zipped through to the end. This story of two sisters and their resentments starts out strongly. The abrupt career change of Rose from lawyer to dog-walker after being crossed in love was interesting. Maggie's evolution from unemployable dyslexic bombshell to homeless at Harvard to darling of the geriatic set stretched the imagination.This had a lot to recommend it, but also drawbacks in its writing. The incidents, dialogue, and interpersonal relations captured the modern problems confronting today's contemporary young women in an urban setting.update 1/28/05: I just finished Good In Bed by Weiner. Enjoyed it much more than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's been done before","review":"I loved Good in Bed but this was too close in story line and not nearly as clever. I had a hard time finishing this book because I kept feeling I had read it before. In her fist book, the main character had a life changing experience and then walked her way (literaly) to a thinner, healthier women with a child and a husband who was right there under her nose from almost the beginning. This story has 2 sisters (of course they hate each other...mostly due to envy) Both have life changing experiences and find a way to change. One of them even walks her way to a thiner, healthier women with a man who was right under her nose the whole time. Sound Familiar? I thought so. I don't know that I will ever read another one of her books for fear that I will already know the story...beginning, middle and end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weiner gets ambitious and succeeds","review":"This is a fun read about some very serious issues -- mental illness in the family, what learning issues to a person's self esteem, how estrangement from family can eat at someone's soul for years. I love Jennifer Weiner novels, they are fun to read, but with this one, she earned my respect as a writer. I especially enjoyed and appreciated her fully drawn portraits of the older adults, they are full human beings with power, passion, and even guile when necessary, a real break from the stereotyped treatment of older adults often found in light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing. Sympathetic characters. Not your typical chick-lit read.","review":"Some chick-lit books are empty on plot - and even characters. That doesn't happen with this one. The two main characters (sisters) are very different from one another. One's smart, heavy, and unlucky in love, and the other is the complete opposite. Just as you start hating Maggie, the one who has it easy getting jobs and men, Weiner emphasizes a hidden dimension of her character that allows us to empathize with her and realize, that maybe, she doesn't have it so easy after all. This is not just a good chick-lit novel, it's a good book...period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Saw the movie first and loved it, which often means I don't appreciate the book as much. This was a definite exception. I loved this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try \\"Little Earthquakes\\" instead","review":"If you like Jennifer Weiner, bypass this one and turn to \\"Little Earthquakes\\" instead. \\"In Her Shoes\\" opens with Maggie, one of the two \\"heroines,\\" having drunk sex in a bathroom with a stranger. How is a reader supposed to root for her throughout the book when she's utterly unlikeable from page one? And Rose is more than a bit of a dud.The book covers a long time span; but it leaves out a lot of important day-to-day details that would provide valuable clues to the characters' motivations. I'd give plenty of specific details, but won't at the risk of revealing plot points. I just get the sense that even the author didn't care about these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic, at best","review":"\\"Good in Bed\\" was decent escapism, but this book is formulaic, at best. Maybe I am looking for too much in a beach book, but neither sister is this dramedy is likable, the run-in with the main character from \\"Good in Bed\\" is completely self-indulgent, and the story lines are predictable and tedious. You can find my copy of the book in the nightstand at the Maui Marriott next to the Gideon Bible and the Book of Mormon if you are looking for something to put you right to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"Why is Maggie the beauty in this story? She is 76% of her body weight at 5'6 and 106 pounds, which is anorexic (under 85% of your body weight). A healthy weight would be 130 (100% of body weight). But yet the author declares she has a \\"perfecT\\" body along with guys drooling all over her. That's truly sick. what is her sister, 120 pounds, the \\"plump\\" one?I would have read this book if not for that. That is sickening-our culture, this author, saying that Maggie's body,an emaciated body, is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A literary snooze fest.","review":"One word: boring! When I pick up a chick lit book, I can usually expect to read it in a few days, one week max... Sadly this was not the case here, as I had it in my possession for about 2 months and just could not muster up the strength to pick it up time and time again (although I was able to get through several other books in between). Long story short, Maggie messes up, tries to make it up, gets frustrated, messes up again, attempts something else, messes up again, you get the picture. Grandma Ella reminisces a lot, and does a good bit of staring. To Weiner's credit I say Rose is a humble, likable character. As is expected, all ends happily ever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic, funny read!","review":"\\"In Her Shoes\\" is a wonderful, funny and charming book. I loved Weiner's first book, \\"Good in Bed\\" and was worried that the second book might not measure up. It did measure up, with laughs to spare. \\"Shoes\\" offered lots of fun twists, including a cameo appearance by Cannie from \\"Bed.\\" Weiner is witty and charming, and I couldn't stop laughing or crying through the entire book -- sometimes simultaneously. This is my favorite book this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"Sorry, I just could not like any of the characters, but especially not Maggie. I invite anyone who has read the book to answer the question, \\"what motivated Maggie?\\" Nothing she did made any sense whatsoever in light of the information we were given about her (sadly, that holds true for most of the characters in the book.) I don't think her biggest problem was a learning disability, but rather one heck of a personality disorder. If you want a bad girl you can learn to like, read Ain't She Sweet by Susan Elizabeth Phillips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me at hello","review":"I did like Good In Bed not only because it was finally a good book about a fat woman in love, but for Weiner's writing. It was flawless and as natural as a river flow, with carefully selected words. But In Her Shoes \\"lost me at hello\\". It looks like it's written by another person: cookie-cutter characters (smart fat girl, dumb pretty girl, nasty stepmother, etc.), clumsy sentences and a story so far stretched that it is tearing apart. Also for another book trying to make a point that \\"appearances are not important\\" there is too much paper and ink spent on actual descriptions of the looks, shoes and dresses. I give 2 stars only for the portrayal of Golden Acres senior community - it was the only part of the book that was close to real life and actually funny.Good In Bed felt like it was written from a heart (and this is why it stood up), but this one was made only for the money. I think I'll pass on Weiner's next creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow-Up","review":"I read Good In Bed and was instantly hooked. When I got my hands on this, I admit I was expecting the same kind of basic rhythm. It is different, but still great. The relationship between the sisters is detailed greatly and needed to help explain where they are in their lives. You find yourself pulled into their lives and rooting for one and despising the other. While it is not as funny as Good In Bed, it shows that Jennifer Weiner can move into other areas of fiction. I do admit that the moment where Rose meets Cannie seemed a little forced, but it was nice to see her attempt to cross-reference the characters. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loved her first book. It is not the same, but still quite good. I realize some people were disappointed by this follow-up, but anytime the author gets you pulled into a book, the have earned their paycheck and this book does just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun Read....","review":"In Her Shoes is a great follow up to Good in Bed. I think that some of the negative reviews have come from those readers who don't like that it doesn't follow the chick lit formula (Gal's hunt for Boy), but this is one of the book's strengths. The other great strength is the author's fantastic sense of humor and her gift for translating her wry take on the world with a good natured turn of phrase. Written with the intelligence of \\"literature\\" but with a flair for comedy that the more snobbish lit types can't handle at all. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in Bed was GREAT, I fell out of In Her Shoes!","review":"I loved Weiner's Good In Bed. I was excited to read her next book In Her Shoes. What a disappointment! It has taken me forever to read and I haven't even finished the book. I began reading it in September 2003 and have not picked it up since. I have about thirty pages remaining but I just do not have the motivation to complete the book. It is very unrealistic. The writing is good but the characters are not appealing and interesting. I just was really disappointed with the book and am sorry that I wasted my time reading most of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"In her shoes","review":"The first 2/3 of the book is really good and believable. The writing still is not impressive, but I read 2/3 of the book in something like 2 days, and I was very amused and entertained. But the ending of the book was way too cheesy for my, and I really had a hard time believing in the book (it's like the 3rd Lord of the Rings movie... the last half an hour should also have been cut out). The book became so bad in the end that it toke me 2 weeks to read the last 1/3 of the book. And I did not enjoy reading the end at all... A shame the ending was so bad, because the book really had potential! 4 starts for the first 2/3 of the book and 0 starts for the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant read","review":"I really liked this, I haven't not seen the movie.Not my favorite book ever, but what a wonderful read! Author has a way . . . And I did cry at the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"This book was a great read!! If you are into fashion, success, drama, playful humor and you have sister that is totally opposite from you. You will hands down love this book!! I loved everything about it and could not put it down. It was so fun to read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked \\"Good in Bed\\" you probably won't like this....","review":"I cannot tell you how dissapointed I was with this novel. I was looking forward to this book and it let me down on ALL levels. It really is not worth your time. Please do not purchase this book just becuase you liked Good in Bed. It is not even in the same league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more indepth and therefore better than the movie","review":"Since seeing then reading Circle of Friends I have always made a point of going out and getting the book prior to seeing a well reviewed movie. At times it has been a rush to read the book before going to the movies with friends, but in this case I am glad that I did. I always get frustrated with books to movies that most of the time dramatically changing stories to reduce the length of the movie. Or make them hollywoodified i.e adding or beefing up romance story lines. If you loved the movie do yourself a favour and read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick-Lit fun","review":"This was the second book by Jennifer Weiner, and I purposely did not watch the movie until I finished the book, and as usual, the book was way better. The story of wild Maggie and plain Rose and the chemistry of sisterly love/hate was well written. The way that Ella is brought back into their lives and the Father and Step-Monster were a natural flow. All in all, I would recommed this as a light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"It's hard to beleive that this book is even written by the same author as Good in Bed. The only thing I can figure, is that she was under the gun to get something out FAST in hopes that it would ride GIB's coattails. I was so annoyed with the characters by the end of the first chapter, that it's a wonder I went on. I'm so sorry I didn't wait for paperback. I won't even pass this one on to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"can I take theses shoes back? please?!","review":"I hate this book! Such a disappointment! I liked her first book, Good in Bed, so I was looking forward to her second. It is too bad, because I think she is a good writer, but this is a bad story. The characters are not well developed at all....they are cardboard, and actually way too mean to be remotely believable. Maggie, the perfect looking younger sister is borderline psychotic she is so mean to her older sister Rose. I just had a hard time feeling any sympathy for either of them, and the storyline with the grandma is just too out there, seems like it was just plopped in to try and make the book appeal to an older market. I am about 2/3 of the way through and feel like tossing this across the room. I will not be buying her next book in hardcover, that much is certain! Save your money on this one, wait and see how she does with the next..."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful shoes","review":"I loved Good in Bed. I hate In her Shoes. Can't believe the difference between these two books. The story is choppy and nothing new or fresh is here. In fact, the main characters are downright unlikeable. Rose is not a character that we really get to know or care about, and Maggie is about the most horrid sibling ever. She goes beyond the point of redemption, and walks all over Rose to the point of ridiculousness. The book just veers way off course as it goes on, getting more and more unbelievable and cliched. The storyline with the grandmother does not work...seems like she was trying to appeal to as many demographics as possible and it just falls flat. I skimmed through these pages because they really didn't move the story forward. Overall, a big disappointment. I think this writer is capable of a lot more. Hopefully, her next book will be better, but I won't be buying that one in hardcover! Save your money on this book....not worth the $20!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written for what it was","review":"This was my first attempt at the now commonly called \\"Chick-Lit\\" genre. I read it because I wanted something quick to read over my Easter holiday and I really enjoyed the movie.The movie was adapted really well so there isn't much in the book that wasn't in the movie. This genre makes for an easy read so I completed the book in a little over a day. Not something to read if you really want to get wrapped up in the story as I usually like to do.If you haven't watched the movie yet, I would strongly recommend reading the book first so you're able to enjoy it more. I would consider reading more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"Did Publishers Weekly really call this book \\"witty and original...a must-read\\", as the book jacket says? I find that hard to believe. I liked Good in Bed, but this was a waste... Completely unbelievable and thoroughly unlikeable character of Maggie really doomed it. Ugh. The writing was much poorer than in the first book. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the shoe stinks....","review":"All I have read so far in the reviews of In Her Shoes are comments about how good Ms. Weiner's first book was, which should be very telling to any potential purchaser of this second one - the author seems to have borrowed a lot of credibility from her initial triumph. If you believe an author, even of light lit and formula fiction, owes a reader a certain amount of polish to the finished piece, don't bother reading In Her Shoes. This book desperately needed more time in the oven and a couple of re-writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summer reading, a chick \\"flick\\" in print","review":"I recently finished Little Earthquakes so I decided to give the author another try. In this book, the sisters clash, bond together, clash again and then finally find their place in life. I didn't enjoy it as much as LE, probably because it was as believable. A high-paid lawyer giving up a monsterous salary to become a dog walker? The other sister \\"hanging out\\" at a prestigious college for months on end, just \\"sitting in\\" on classes? If you don't think too hard about the circumstances... you can get an enjoyable story. Perfect for the summer when you're not looking for something overly intellectual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in Bed","review":"This is GREAT chic lit! Comical, touching and sad. I can't wait for the movie to come out! I highly recommend this-especially if you like Jennifer Weiner's other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good!","review":"i loved this book so much! at first i thought omg, how am i going to finish it during the time I had for myself? but I kept reading on and on. however, the ending of the story did not satisfy me. everything seemed to happen really quickly in the end and each incident that occurred didn't attract me as the rest of the book did. nevertheless, it was a great book. i cried in the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Another Opinion","review":"First off, I'm not the reader type, so when the chance comes around that I actually enjoy a book, it has to be good. Although, my sister and I are not as close in age as Rose and Maggie were, I still found relation in the clothes sharing aspect. I thought the book taught morals which gave the book a good personality. I really enjoyed reading this book and found myself fighting to put it down. I thougth the introduction to the book was the best, because it got me hooked from the first page. I don't think that the story line or plot was drawn out which kep tmy interest alive. I'm very excited to start a new book on Jennifer Weiner beause her writing style is very unique. I would defintely recommend this book to any one. I would suggest it to be a chick book. I enjoyed the happy ending in comparison to the rough beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"This is a much better book than Good in Bed. Not only was the writing terrific, but the story and people were so real that I felt I knew them. The author paints a vivid picture of a pretty disfunctional family and has characters change in realistic ways. It sounds trite, but it made me laugh and made me cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!!","review":"I found this book ridiculously trite and predictable. The only character that was well thought out and represented in a believable way was Rose (not surprising as it seems that this author can only convincingly write about female characters that are based on herself). I was consistently annoyed with the characters in the book and more often than not my attention was drawn away from the story by the awful descriptions of the clothes the women wore (who wore a catsuit out of the house after 1992?) If you want to read a book that deals with sibling relationships in an original an entertaining manner, I suggest The Savage Girl by Alex Shakar."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I didn't really know a lot about Jennifer Weiner or I.H.S. I just kind of picked it up and read it. It took a while to get into it, but once I did, I couldnt stop reading. I read most of it in about 2 days. The only time I put it down was when I really had to do something. I got a friend to read it and she loved it and she is going to get all the other J.W. books. I recommend it to anyone with a full day on their hands. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than impressive","review":"I anticipated this novel to have some of the spark of the other chick-lit books I've been reading lately, but I ended up feeling disappointed. The writing was mediocre and I found myself questioning the believability of Maggie's character- she was like a charicature of what most women would like to believe beautiful women are- excessively hare-brained, manipulative, greedy, stuck-up. The book was a really fast read, but at many times during the readings I felt like stopping, and wondering if I should continue. I wasn't sure it was worth it to continue because I didn't feel very invested in any of the characters. The characters were kind of flat like soda that has been left out for too long, the writing full of cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"More whining by Weiner","review":"More shallow 2 dimensional characters from Jennifer Weiner. The only interesting person in the book is the grandmother who acts as a sounding board for the messed up dyslexic whoring younger sister. I was not the least bit interested in the heroine nor her problems. COmpletely unsympathetic and uninteresting.Read Lynda Currnyn for much better chic lit with a tone of discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Weiner is the chick lit genre's best writer!","review":"I believe that Jennifer Weiner is doing a lot to elevate the \\"chick lit\\" genre above its current pulp status into a legitimate form of literature. Her strength by far is her amazing skill at characterization. You get inside the heads of every character in this book---from the main heroines Rose and Maggie to the many supporting roles. Like an Oscar-caliber movie with a good ensemble cast, Weiner draws you in and makes you care deeply for all of these characters---even the scummy ex-boyfriend Jim, who dates Rose while bedding Rose's sister Maggie---by exposing the dark reasons behind all their personal flaws.Also, when it comes to mixing dark, poignant emotional tragedy with flippant humor, Weiner can't be beat, and IN HER SHOES is no exception. This was the first Weiner book I read, and she has found a fan for life. I will be sure to follow every book she releases from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Really good read! I could really identify with the characters in the book, and loved the author's writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Her Shoes A Great Read","review":"Fans of Jennifer Weiner who have despaired of her latest literary offerings should go back and read \\"In Her Shoes.\\"This novel revolves around two sisters Maggie (sexy but dumb) and Rose (overweight but smart) who love and resent each other in equal amounts.When Maggie does something truly unforgivable to Rose the story really picks up and then we go back and forth between Rose and Maggie until the end of the novel.I really loved this novel since it was not to my mind a typical chick lit book and everything was not wrapped up in a tidy little bow."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Her Shoes - great!","review":"This book was fabulous! I love Jennifer Weiner! I bought the book after seeing the movie (loved it) and it was the same! It is an easy read and you never want to put it down. I am really picky about my \\"chic lit\\" and this one was right on the money. You will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Her Snooze","review":"This book was well-written, but a disappointing read. I never got a sense of the pain felt by Rose and Maggie over losing their mother. I found it unrealistic that their grandmother would have not made more attempts to stay in contact with her grandchildren. And I found the details of the main conflict between the two sisters - cheating with the other's boyfriend - ridiculous. If a guy were to sleep with his girlfriend's sister in that sister's apartment when he knows that his girlfriend is on the way home, it would be a quickie session that didn't involve taking off clothes and lingering in bed. I also find it hard to believe that a woman obsessed with shoes would own a pair of Payless shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good In Bed : Part 1 1/2 ?","review":"Weiner's sophomore effort should not disappoint believers of her debut novel, GOOD IN BED. She plays it safe - very safe - by even as going as far as bringing in the Cannie Shapiro character from her first novel, to let readers know she (Weiner) hasn't strayed from her formula. And that disappoints readers like myself, who enjoyed Weiner as a writer (America's Maive Binchey ?), but didn't love the plot. As with her debut novel, IN HER SHOES once again comes across as a good idea for a network sitcom - saccharine sweet, lighthearted, inoffensive, uneventful, and rather brain numbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see a Trend here","review":"This writer, who also penned \\"good in bed\\" about a fat girl who whines her way through life, has done it again with this book.

This book is my least favorite of them all. I am actually surprised this book was made into a movie before \\"Good In Bed\\". In this book, I didn't feel the characters were given enough depth. The story seemed to move along too quickly. I like to know more details on a character than what was given. It almost seemed like Jennifer Weiner was rushed in writing this book, like she had a deadline to fulfill. I was left wanting to know more about what happened afterwards, and wanting to know what happened to some of the plot lines in the book that seemed to just fall off. The writing just didn't seem complete. I would recommend her other books over this one, and it is probably the only book of hers that I won't be likely to read a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing it safe","review":"Man,this guy's stuff has sure left me flat over the last 10-15 years.When he collaborated with great R&B singers(some of the names escape me now,but Audrey Wheeler was one),Manhattan Transfer,and The System back in the 80's,he was a top funkasizin' son of a behotch.He's either sold out and went Kenny G,or he's just uninspired.Case in point-my favorite tune(might not be yours,but I hope it's up there) from this one is the title track,written with the amazing Robbie Nevil.I think he should get back to producing other artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milk Toast Jazz Lite To Fall Asleep By","review":"5 Stars?

It's easy to install and is fairly sturdy, although not as sturdy as some metal gates I've seen. The problem is that it's a hazard to pets. Rather than jumping over it, my cat squeezed through the bars and just barely made it. Squeezing through the bars like that could cause him to strangle himself in the future. Also, the door closes and latches on its own only if you open it all the way then let it go, but even then the latch doesn't always catch. The door slams shut with such force that it could injure any pet or small child that gets in the way. I'm returning it today...definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Summer's Best Gate","review":"This gate does not feel sturdy and doesn't close automatically as easily as the Parents Infant Deluxe Walk-Thru Gate.

No brand will work the same for every person who ingests it.NO Shotgun V3 left me with a feeling of \\"unwellness\\". Seriously, I do not know how else to describe it. It didn't give me much energy or pump, and I always ensure my sleep, calories (especially carbs) are high, and I am well-hydrated at all times. Usually that's enough for a pre-workout to work for me, but this one still didn't cut it.I didn't like the taste or the aftertaste. I felt okay during the workout, but I didn't feel well afterward.

I was unable to get through more than one glass of it. Even diluted to 3x the amount of water, the taste was still rather unappetizing. I could not get past the flavor of this product to continue using it. Other people, however, may like the taste.

The bottom of the grill gets pretty warm, so be sure to place it on a heat-proof surface.One other note - not a complaint by any means - use the MINIMUM cooking time recommended.

With bone in meats you can cook them with the top open and it will hold twice as much but will take much longer to cook. It makes great grilled cheese sandwiches too.

I shipped it to my local service center for warranty repair, but they told me it was not repairable and T-Fal would be sending me a replacement in 3 to 6 weeks. Not that terrible, but not exactly very impressive service either.And one wonders how on Earth anybody manages to manufacture an electric grill that can't even work 6 months without breaking down; we're not talking cutting-edge electronics here!This grill deserves a 5 star rating... when it works. Unfortunately my recent experience (which seems to be corroborated by at least a few other reviewers) indicates this is not a reliable product, and warranty service has room for improvement. Stay away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent job T-Fa!","review":"After my disappointment with Cuisinart's Griddler, I really did my research and found this. It has Good Housekeeping recommendations and the 2 good reviews earlier. It has a lot of the features I am looking for (just like the Cuisinart but without the griddle and more ). My Amazon order arrived today, and it is a very well designed little griller. You can tell T-Fal put in a lot of thoughts designing it and covering all areas. It heats up fast, the grease does not splash and drains well. Though it operates with a different concept and is not as sleek as the Cusinart one, it performs very well and is very sturdy.. Cleaning is a breeze, I just take it apart and wash it in the Sink (You can also put the top and bottom in the dishwasher. I don't need to do this) When you put them back, just remember to plug the heating elements back in first and the top lid will lock. I can store the griller standing up too.

Then we're presented with this tired story full of characters (characterizations, really) we care little about and a mystery about as obvious as an episode of Scooby Doo.

That's where drugs, oral sex, abortions etc. come in.It looks like this book has all the ingredients, and still fails to make good on its promise.

In come Bill, Megan's ex boyfriend who's still obsessed with her, and handsome detective Huck, both of whom fall hard under Megan's charm.

First and foremost is the murder of Diana and the investigation. We learn the family's back-story and what happened to bring them to this point in time. It is also an exploration of an extremely emotive issue from both sides of the argument into which is cleverly woven a theme of the nature of obsession and what it can do to people.THE ABORTIONIST'S DAUGHTER is not going to be everyone's cup of tea.

The audio version hooked me from the very start.Dr. Diana is The Abortionist. She is found murdered in her home. Police suspect the husband, an attorney. However, several others have reason to want Dr. Diana out of the picture. A good thriller, that kept my interest through all but the last disc when I had the story figured out. I would still recommend this book; good reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good!","review":"I actually really liked this book, although the title is a little misleading. It's not really about the daughter...more about the daughter's ex-boyfriend. And I wish it would have been longer, the relationship aspect of the book could have been more in-depth. I'm not really a fan of having to guess what would have happened. But none-the-less it was a very interesting book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Mystery, And Much More","review":"Super book! \\"The Abortionist's Daughter\\" is engaging on many levels. It's an engrossing murder mystery that keeps you guessing to the end, but it's also much more. The characters are vividly drawn, the human relationships complex, and the dialogue rings true. And parts are very funny. The characters you'd expect in any mystery - the police detective, district attorney, forensics expert, distraught family members, etc - are deep and complicated. In the course of unfolding the mystery, Elisabeth Hyde examines and dissects the parent-teen relationship, angst of young adults, strained marriages, and the fragile line between love and loneliness.I've read and enjoyed all of Hyde's previous books, but this one may be her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Mystery to This Mystery","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book. Based on the professional reviews I had read, I expected a better, more absorbing story. First of all, I could not find a single character in this book that I liked, much less related to. From the ecstasy-popping daughter of the title to the fanatical \\"Reverend,\\" I found I didn't really care what happened to ANY of them. Secondly, I thought that maybe the provocative title meant that the book would make me think about my own position on abortion and why I feel that way, but there was nothing there I hadn't already considered. In the end, the doctor's chosen speciality had nothing to do with her murder, which made me wonder why the author even chose to make her an abortionist. What was the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been good...","review":"I got halfway through this book and had to put it down. The characters were not sympathetic or even likeable. There were times that I could feel the author using her \\"skills\\" -- descriptive phrases and throwaway lines that felt too forced and technical and interrupted the flow of the story. At one point I thought, Wow--she must have used that in a different story in some writing class! Then, half-way through the book I could see what was coming, and just decided that I couldn't spend more time on the story when I could already see the outcome. I read ahead some and skimmed the last few pages and was not at all surprised by whodunit. This is the second book by this author that I have read, and I come away from this one feeling the same way I did about the first. Maybe one day she will break out and have a fantastic and moving story, but right now her stuff is just good 'nuff...just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but very predictable","review":"This book was entertaining and fairly well written. It was a vacation read for me and I got through it in a few days. The characters are well developed and I found myself caring about them. Sadly, by the second day of reading, I was able to predict the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"short but well written \\"mystery\\"","review":"I rarely read murder mysteries, but picked this up at the book store after the title grabbed my attention. If you are looking for a thriller with the kind of suspense that leads you to stay up late reading, this is not for you. Its more a story of a family, a community, and a teenager dealing with her sexuality. I wouldn't rank it as highly as, say, Franzen's book \\"The Corrections\\" but I will definitely follow this author and consider reading more of her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that exemplifies reasons for choice","review":"The Abortionist's Daughter intertwines a fictional murder mystery with raw human emotion. The book has [too] many characters, but the relationships and choices made by Diana, Frank, and Megan take you through familiar family dynamics that pull at your heart strings. Diana's work shows a tender finess and deep understanding of the complexity behind a woman's right to choose and in this case to help others choose. The opening flashbacks of doctor Duprey describe her \\"pressing the reset button\\" for struggling young girls- but the depth of her career, her dedication to her patients, and the impact her profession had on her own life and reproductive choices is what makes this book a must-read. The book takes about 100 pages to slowly set up but the last half is well worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work yet","review":"this came to me very dirty.

Everyone at the show had nothing but great things to say about fairwarning, so i was eagerly awaiting their performance that night. Finally after sitting through a couple bands, the fairwarning boys took the stage. These boys ripped through an emotional set of hit-worthy songs. Song after song of catchy, poppy, jumpy, touching.. Sometimes tear jerking, sometimes angerdrivin, sometimes cute poppy and laughable.... immediatly after their set, I ran to their merchandise table and purchased this cd \\"Give and Burn.\\" It's recorded amazingly and alll the feelings meant to be portrayed in each song truly comes foward, and just makes you feel it soo deeply.

I was skeptical at first, because I had tried so many other things in the past with so little benefit. After reading the book and listening to the CD, I am now able to control my anxiety and panic attacks, even if I am not in a place where I can not listen to the CD. You do the exercises and learn the principles. Then you can use them, no matter where you are, whether in a meeting at work, in the mall, or in a car full of screaming kids.Thank you Dr Driscoll.

This is just another poor attempt at bashing Disney. In every incident the truth is or seems to be twisted to fit the author's version of what goes on behind the scenes. Please do not give up your hard-earned dollars for this waste of paper.One star is too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not journalism, mostly editorial opinion of sparse facts","review":"At first I found this book appealing and informative (up to Part III), however, halfway through this book I realized that the authors were trying to slam their political beliefs down the public's throat with Disney as a vehicle for such action. Yes, there is documented truth in this book - and it would have been a better book if they had just presented the facts and let everyone draw their own conclusions. Instead, the authors chose to draw those conclusions for you, making it a highly political piece of editorialism that makes the reader wish they purchased another book. This is NOT journalism, just a small sampling of facts and moralistic opinions drawn from the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"And yet another duo trying to cash in by using the Disney name.

I question the geniunity of the \\"documents\\" and the \\"interviews\\" with the \\"sources.\\" When a company or person becomes very big and powerful and well respected by many it becomes fair game to people who want to tear it down, unfortunately. I am not saying the Disney does not have some skeltons in its closet (what company doesn't?) but I think this was blown WAY out of proportion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"The author claims this is a work of journalism...don't believe it. It is all conjecture and rumor. Very poorly written...A basic hack job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading for every parent","review":"I like most Americans grew up on the fantasy of Disney but nowadays that Disney magic comes straight from a witch's cauldron of depravity and dollars. Parents of school age children need to be made aware of where their hard-earned consumer dollars are going and what causes they are indirectly sponsoring. The fond memories of the Disney we grew up with cannot be allowed to blind us to their current agenda. This is a well-written and well-researched book that describes the diverse and depraved Disney corporate octopus in great detail. Some of the chapters are more relevant and have greater impact than others but the entire book is worth the read. One can only guess at the motives of those who would discourage you from finding what Disney up to. Read this book for yourself and make up your own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an honest, in-your-face look at Disney","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart. It's a tough, journalistic look at one of America's great corportions. The authors prove that Disney does steal ideas and use them for their own ends, and yet, the company is quick to show up at your door if you are using Mickey Mouse to your own commercial advantage. Cry babies and Disney lovers will noit like this book, and will trash the journalistic integrity of the work. But believe me, it's real."},{"rating":"1","title":"important journalism mixed with agenda-driven politics","review":"Part of this book is simply the tired mouth-covered-in-horror conservative sermonizing, with more than a dash of homophobia. To imply that Disney is somehow subverting its mission of entertaining children by owning a film distribution company that deals in more adult fare, for example, is muddled thinking. And the authors seem horrified that Disney treats gays like actual people. But the chapters that detail the cover-up of accidents, use of sweatshop labor and plagiarism are important and solid reporting. It's too bad that the book isn't half as long as it is. That much of it is a story that needs to be told. The rest is dismissable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The authors are full of it","review":"Note that this book appears on the web site for conservative books. That should be the first sign of how biased this book is. Like all conservatives do, the authors distort things to their own liking and try to brianwash the gullible public. If Disney employs homosexuals I think they should be applauded. No, I'm not gay nor do I agree with homosexuality but I believe in being fair. What made these authors mad is clearly that Disney is becoming increasingly liberal (which I think is a good sign) and are offended by all the positive advancements of the Co. Don't waste your money, if you belive what this book says then you might as well believe that 4+4=13!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL PARENTS MUST READ THIS BOOK","review":"Any parent considering a trip to a Disney theme park or movie or a purchase of a Disney product MUST READ THIS BOOK!

I hated how much our city depended on tourism and have an innate dislike for super corporations. Where a compay is to big to fail, to big to be sued and has their own police force there's bound to be corruption. However the conservative, self-ritious tone of the author had me actually defending Disney at times. The author longs for a world of bubbles and sunshine and is appauled when it is not. The authors take offence at anyone who trys to depict the lives of children as anything other than happy and innocent. For that reason I could not enjoy the some of the better parts of the book in which they discuss the issues that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalism?

I admit that I work for WDW, and at first I was intriqued to see some of the secrets of Disney revealed but realized the authors main goal was to push there hatred of Disney onto the reader. I seriously question how the authors obtained police and internal Disney documents.I have worked for Disney for 10 years and never have seen anything that would lead me to belive that it is this \\"all powerful evil empire\\".Can a company that spreads so much joy and happiness and does a excellent job of telling good stories to young an old really be that evil?-eric"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do Americans love to deface their icons so?","review":"Disney is a corporation, in the business of making money. One could tie any organization with bad business ideas or unfavorable business tactics if you try hard enough.

If they insist on referring to it as journalism, it is frightfully bad journalism at best.The one star is for entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been at the check out stand of a grocery store","review":"The book while entertaining, does not contain complete information. In some portions of the book, it quotes people who confessed to crimes and aberant behavior. In others it only addresses one side of the story. hence half information, half truth. Anything that is a half truth is at best a lie. The whole story should be published. In the section about the fire department, it only quotes some employees who have had axes to grind, and less than desireable employment histories. It does not interview or attempt to address the views of the people accused of the acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tons of \\"I hate Disney\\" Opinion","review":"While I would still buy this book again, I would say that you have to prepare yourself for all of the anti-Disney opinion. You should know that some of the stories, as well as the way Disney handles \\"problems\\" in the park, are typical. What business wouldn't want to hide away a problem--they're bad for business.

You are supposed to attend his course of course and pay a lot of money.I ploughed on and what was nice was the statements from other people about the subject. Thats why I kept reading.It did not get better unfortunately. In his eyes, the Demartini Method seems to solve all problems of humanity and that is typical for:making a lot of money on other people's misfortunes but clouded in the motto \\"helping others\\", which I am allergic to.Also it's nothing new, he is just re-chewing what we all know anyway.Would not recommend it, waste of money and time.And will certainly not read any of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top 5 books of all time","review":"This book is the most practical book for deepening spiritual awareness I've come upon.

Among other things, his analysis of statements regarding Poe's appearance and the feelings of members of his fiancee's family seem quite overwrought. It seems as if he is trying get to his conclusion, instead of allowing his conclusion to flow from the reconstruction of the facts at hand. Moreover, even given the facts as he presents them, I think there are gaps in his reconstruction that cause the foundation of the book to list--like the leaning tower of Pisa--quite substantially. Granted, other previous conjectures seem implausible also, but this could take the cake. If I were a publisher, I would have rejected his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An odd theory in book form","review":"What kills John E. Walsh's book is that he spends the first half of his book debunking others for their half-cooked theories on Poe's death and their basis on speculation rather than evidence. The second half of the book is Walsh's own half-cooked theory on Poe's death based on speculation rather than evidence. What does save this book is that it does give a fairly good overview of the wide spectrum of theories on Poe's death. Stop about halfway through, and it's a fairly decent, readable book.And to the \\"doc\\" who posted: many doctors have considered this case over the past 150 years and each has come up with a different final answer. His alcoholism is not a fact and is in wide dispute, and he may have been sober for at least a year before his death. Case closed...? If so, we wouldn't have entire books, like this one, trying to solve the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Four Days","review":"Edgar Allan Poe's strange death in 1849 has always been highly contraversial. There have been so many theories, some plausiable some not so plausiable. Mr. Walsh does a very crediable job in returning the reader back to Poe's time, reviewing all the witnesses and presenting his theory soundly. His writing at least in the beginning is a bit strange, he uses paragraph's were normally one would see a period. I believe this is a attempt in another way to capture the spirit of Poe, the mystery, the macabe, the sad end. Still, Mr. Walsh deserve's credit for producing a very quick and interesting read.."},{"rating":"1","title":"DT's","review":"Edgar Allen Poe's death was a straightforward example of delerium tremens (withdrawal syndrome from ethyl alcohol) with fatal outcome, as should be apparent to most physicians.

I never found it. What I received instead was a detailed description of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe leading up to, what I thought would be an interesting and definitive conclusion, nothing. The book just leaves the reader to swallow the author's boring hypothesis. This is a case where the truth is NOT stranger than fiction (at least in this presentation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched writing; implausible thesis","review":"J.E. Walsh may have done a lot of writing, but I sincerely hope it's better than this!E.A. Poe's death--its cause and circumstances--have been a mystery since the day he died. Many theories have been posited, from the well-known \\"beat up by election day thugs,\\" to \\"rabies,\\" to Walsh's \\"beaten up by the brothers of a woman whose letters Poe refused to return.\\" Maybe, but the case is far from being made.Walsh provides a lot of background information, not much of which supports his thesis, unfortunately, but is a good resource for learning just what has been written about Poe's death. His writing style, though, deserves a premature burial. It alternates turgid with folksy in an extremely irritating mix. One gets the sense of great condescention on his part. As this is only his latest book on Poe, it may be that he's just recycling his own, earlier work. In any event, this is one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-fal Deep Fryer","review":"I hate to say this, but the fryer was terrible.

Not only that, but the whole thing is an overly preachy \\"serious\\" attempt to warn its readers of the dangerous chemicals that surround us in everyday life and how they effect the earth spirit.

Consonants are important, too! Plus, with her slight lisp and tendency to fade out the end of words, I find it very difficult to understand the words she sings. And since a lot of the songs tell stories, that's a real problem. Thank goodness the lyrics are published in the liner notes. When I listen to music sung in Gaelic, I realize I won't understand the words and can appreciate the music anyway. However, these songs are sung almost entirely in English, but with her singing style, they might as well be in Gaelic. With a couple of exceptions (Buile Mo Chroi being one), I was bored with this album. On top of being unintelligible, the songs are sung and arranged very similarly.

The unimpressive, sterile sets are a bore to look at and the singers bumble there way through the whole opera. The orchestra was superb but made a very important mistake in Pamina and Papagano's duet. The 1st four beats are there than it's silence, leaving Pamina confused. Now, to the \\"singers.\\" They were just plain horrible. Tamino (Beczala) was OK but lacked the enthusiasm and warmth to play the part. Pamina (Hartelius) was a good try but didn't Make my standards. Papagano (Scharinger) was a bumbling, stuttering freak with no art for singing. The Queen(Mosuc)was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise horrible production. Sarastro (Salminen)was also a breath of fresh air and the only really known singer in this whole performance. Overall Horrible. Save your money for the Ostman or Levine versions. You'll thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triumph","review":"A memorable performance. Franz Welser-Möst conducts in a superb way, using fast tempi, in a \\"Gardinerian\\" manner (but with no any lack of humour). His orchestra is very good, also his choir.Salminen makes a very human and wise Sarastro, with perfect low notes; Mosuc is quite good, not troubled by the hard task of singing coloratura in so fast speeds (Damrau and Miklosa have more precise \\"agilità\\" and \\"sovracuti\\", but Mosuc don't disappoints the viewer). Beczala is superb: a pure, innocent Tamino, enthusiastic in the role. I can say the same thing about Hartelius' Pamina.Scharinger is probably the best Papageno in video, although he sings the last part of \\"Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen\\" completely drunk... the effect is very fun. Comprimarii are capable.The set is a library, with little changes all over the opera. Not a traditional set, but is very effective. Probably, Miller's intention is an association between \\"Die Zauberflöte\\", Freemasonry and the Enlightenment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Church Girl is On it","review":"Hey all:Please check out this debut record from Onithsa, just out on Still Waters, the inspirational imprint from Hidden Beach.

I first heard two of her songs on Pastor Marvin Winans Sunday morning radio show and gave the disc a try. What we have here is a 70% contemporary neo-soul gospel, 30% inspirational disc that is banging musically and gives you lyrics that show the young lady has a heart for God, but understands the everyday struggle. Only the interludes keep this from 5 stars in my opinion. Think of Onitsha as a cross between Kiki Sheard and early Lisa McClendon (My Diary, Your Life) with Badu like vocals. I consider this disc 4 & 1/2 stars worth of good. This is the early leader in the clubhouse for newcomer of the year for 07'."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fav Hey Arnold!

The one exception is Good Timin' by Jimmy Jones. Normally I'm not so picky but some of these recordings sounded completely different to the originals! The whole point of me buying this album was to get these in original versions. If these could just have been cleaned up this would have been better than giving us totally new recordings that take the uniqueness away from them. Without the picture of the cover I could not tell that they were re-recordings. Now to be fair, the sound quality was excellent and for me personally the chosen collection was good because they included some songs that are harder to find than others of the same era. But I just don't like them modernised. If you don't mind, then it's a good buy. Otherwise, buyers beware if you like your versions original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This is an amazing book. i've had it for less than a year and i've already read it four times.

Basically everything is beautifully written--no typos, no inaccuracies, nothing wrong. (Some other fantasy books have at least one thing wrong, however minor, which irks me because the editors didn't find it)The way her world is constructed is awesome. The only sad part is that most of her stories about the Crown Duel world aren't published--but Inda, one set in the past of Crown Duel, should be out this summer (can't wait!).I'll leave the summaries to everyone else, but this book is remarkably good, and deserves more than five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huyen","review":"This book is awsome.

From the very beggining your hooked. Imideatly, from the very first chapter, you become entranced by the story of Meliara of Tlanth, and her people. War and mystery, romance and intrigue. The story is impecably written, and will grab hold of your imagination until you feel that you are part of it's very realm. Harry Potter holds nothing to the magic of this book. A guaranteed instant favorite if you enjoy fantasy. I highly recomend it. Suggestion: Begin with a lot of time, because once you begin, you cannot stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! An enjoyable weekend read","review":"This book is a great way spend a weekend curled up with a book. The characters are well developed and keep you guessing about their end game. It has some predictable aspects to it but for the most part the reader is unsure of what the final chapter will give you. I am not going to spend you time giving you a summary of the book; just pick it up and give it a read. There is nothing like magic, war, murder and romance to give you all the elements of a weekend escape without leaving the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crown duel","review":"I really really liked it.

It was so entertaining and diverting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't get more contrived than this...","review":"Ok, maybe lovers of fantasy for more than 30 years (like myself) should think twice before reading novels like this one. I downloaded it, after so many glowing recommendations, but eventually was almost shouting at my Kindle in frustration by about page 300 at so many lame plot lines. The brave, wonderful, miraculously-getting-out-of-the-most-absurd-situations heroine (Mel) is *so* dense, she doesn't get that her mysterious correspondent is the oft (inexplicably) hated Shevraeth. Doi. Her brother, Bran, and pretty much *all* the other secondary characters in this book, are used and then conveniently disappear from the plot. I guess that some of the other reviewers have it right -- if you are a teenage girl who has the most simplistic appreciation of the most basic plot tricks -- this book is definitely for you. For me, it left a really bad taste in my mouth - this probably was the first book that I stopped reading with about 5 percent left. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible...","review":"I'm sorry I bought this book. There are so many reviews that make this book out to be wonderful, but in the end I was deeply disappointed.I'll cut right to the point. The main character is absolutely unbearable. She has no sense, she's irrational, can't do anything on her own, and the moment of truth when she has a chance to defeat the bad guy? Forget it. She gets knocked out and someone bails her out. Then everyone makes her out to be a hero. Maybe it's me, but seems like the message being conveyed is \\"ladies, save the day by just staying on your back\\".The intrigue is doesn't exist, guerrilla ambushes are silly jokes, the great conflict is over wood, about 95% of character and city names are pretentious, it's predictable, and there are just too many conversational similes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy vey.","review":"What a bad book. The plot was painfully predictable, the characters porridge, the setting neither innovative nor convincing (with minor changes, the story could have been as convincingly set in a modern-day American mall as in a pseudo-mediaeval setting, considering the bland gender neutrality and unrealistically modern way the characters act). The settting seemed poorly researched as well (I remember doing a double-take when a farmer's storage hut had a metal roof on which rain could patter. Right, so every impoverished peasant can have corrugated steel rooves. What's next, oil-fired central heating?).The biggest turn-off, however, was the writing, which was unremittently juvenile and littered with infelicities. There was a time when 'young people's fantasy' was not mutually exclusive with 'good literature'; instead of reading a booger like 'Court Duel', I suggest you curl up with Lewis Carroll's 'Sylvie and Bruno', for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, banal, and boring!!!","review":"I think that the title says it all. This was one of the worst books that I have ever read. If it isn't depressing enough that the protagonist makes mistakes from page one and never stops, maybe the fact that at the end of both books, she gets her face in the mud and someone has to tell her what happened! Read this book if you are desperate. And I mean really desperate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't anyone write good fantasy?","review":"This is adequate writing, but the plot, characters, and setting are so hackneyed I'm glad I didn't pay money for the book. ...there's more to fantasy than this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book EVER!!!!!!!","review":"Crown Duel is one of the best books I have ever read. It mixes the elements of magic, adventure, and comedy in the exact right propotions. Mel is a character that you can easily relate to and thinks like a noraml person. The plot of both books are great and they both have a twist that the reader does not expect. Its a book you have to read no matter how old you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally cool book ....","review":"I really injoyed these books and was very excited to see what I thought was a third. But as it turned out was the first two put back together as Smith had first intended, with some more added to the end. I hope that by adding more to this book she is considering writting more about this land and time. I would like to know more about the Woodland people, the magic she is learning, her brother ect... She does a very good job at portraying a young girl who doesn't check all the facts and jumps to concluesions. You get so involved that you want to reach out to this girl and shake some sence into her. But in the end she learns alot about herself and those around her and tries to better her self despite it.I truly hope that Mrs. Smith will continue with this series. I want to see what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!!","review":"There are a lot of other reviews to tell you what the book's about, so I'll just say what exactly what you get. It is the two books, Crown Duel and Court Duel put together into one book. The only differences are the fact that the prolouge that was at the start of Court Duel is missing, some of the names of different places have been changed, a few sentences have been altered for no visible reason, a couple of paragraphs were added, and there is an absloutely WONDERFUL short story at the end which you wouldn't get if you bought the two books seperately. I can also assure you that this book is worth every cent you spend on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This book is by far one of my favorite books of all time. Great plot, lovable characters, a wonderful complex love story all rolled into one book. A young countess and her brother led a revolt against a tyrant king only to have their plans destroyed when Mel (the countess) is captured. The whole book is full of twists and plot turns, with a love story that is so much greater than any silly teenage vampire novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a pair","review":"Was ever a detective's life -- to say nothing of his wife -- so sweet and stylish? Once again Mr. & Mrs. Detective, Nick and Nora Charles, find themselves in the middle of murder in this nicely paced, self-deprecating (Nora's hats), amuslingly performed film. William Powell and Myrna Loy deliver delightful performances with excellent supporting work coming from, among others, Lou Lubin (Rainbow Benny)and Stella Adler (Claire Porter). The latter stews and seethes and oozes so that you wish she had lots more to do in this film. Pretty Donna Reed sits and pouts. Dickie Hall as, Nick Jr., does a nice job with his cue cards. Of course there was never a pair like Nick and Nora Charles, at least not in the detective business. On the other hand, we are infinitely fortunate in the pairing of superb light comedian, William Powell, and a charming and intelligent Myrna Loy. Oh, to be able to go back to a time that never was."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thin Man ROCKS!!!!!!!","review":"My Mom pointed me toward the Thin Man (among many other wonderful classic films) and I became an instant fan.

Dickie Hall appears as Nick Charles, Jr. who is now old enough to talk.W.S. Van Dyke serves as director for the last time in the series since he died before the next entry was filmed in 1944.

During the inevitable and formulaic \\"gathering of the suspects and revealing the killer\\" scenes, there seems to be the inclusion of what can only be called an editing mistake. I had to watch the ending several times to make sure it was not just my lack of concentration. The police inspector, in response to the killer grabbing a gun after being \\"outed\\", pulls his gun and fires off two shots. In the very next cut Nora attacks the killer to disarm him, but no one reacts to the shots fired, no one is hit, and no one acknowledges that it even happened.

I know that this is a Japanese game, and therefore the portrayal of the legal system won't necessarily translate perfectly for people used to the US legal system. But I can tell you that if you're a US law student/lawyer, the only thing you'll do while playing this game is pick out all the things that are wrong/inaccurate and yearn to make this like a real game of legal strategy that would be super useful. As a result, I hated this game within the first 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull","review":"This game has a good concept, nice graphics, and some definitely funny moments, but the gameplay is a total bore.There are two main gameplay styles: \\"investigation\\" and \\"trial\\". Investigation is the worst; it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room, talking to everyone, and a ton of pointless reading, much like an old point-and-click adventure on PC.The court sections are a little better, but not much. Once again, it's very linear; you don't have to use your brain much, just try all the options. And once again, there is a huge amount of reading. There is way too much dialogue packed into the game, and not near enough actual gameplay. And most of the talking is aimless, too; very little of it actually advances the plot.Overall, this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters, and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting!","review":"I played this game on a long airplane flight. It kept me entertained for the entire time. The story is good, the characters are incredibly funny, and the cases are long but interesting.

Just go with it and you'll have fun. The dialogue is very entertaining, and the characters are really cute. I would especially recommend it for older Nintendo DS owners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Objection! For passing this off as a puzzle game!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in the game. While the storyline seemed ok, and I thought we were getting somewhere, with each case, it just became more and more laborious to wade through the repetitive dialog with completely overblown gestures. It is very distracting to see a character swearing while you're still left wondering \\"what just happened?\\"I finished about 3 cases and found it very tiresome to stick with it. I have no interest at all in continuing, so it's going straight back to the store.To be fair though, I got this game hoping it would be another Prof Layton, so that was probably setting the bar too high to start with!If the path to getting through the cases didn't seem so tiresome and laborious, it wouldn't be a bad game at all.Bottom line - if like me, you're looking for another puzzle game to follow Prof Layton, Phoenix is not the way to go.If you're looking for a game to kill time with and are not a zealous puzzling fan, this may be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but WAY too much clicking","review":"The over all concept for the game was great, but am I the only one out here that wants to play for more than 10% of the time? Every time I started to get somewhere in the game, I had to click 100s of dialog boxes. Of course story is important, but these were just childish interactions between the characters that served no plot purpose. My hand got pretty numb continuously clicking next with the stylus, then realized every single function in the game can be done with the buttons.The concept was fantastic. I loved the cases and solving them, but in between the court cases was just plain dumb. This game embodied everything anime and Japaneseie.By the third case, I put it down for good. I might try the next game in the series, but this one is done for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too average in comparison to others on DS.","review":"Average to decent game, but there is so much better out there for the DS. Even in the text-based genre that Phoenix Wright is based in, it only pales in comparison to something like Hotel Dusk.If you actually like games where you just sit there reading text, then I'd say get this and Hotel Dusk, as well as whatever sequels for Phoenix Wright they have planned in the future. If you're like me though, and believe there should only be one text-based game on your DS, then get Hotel Dusk without a doubt and pass up on this semi-mediocre experience.I will say the fourth level (the last non-touch screen using level) was pretty interesting though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, unique game with some learning going on!","review":"When my son ordered this game I wasn't sure what to expect.

The main defects are inadequate genealogical tables in the back and a woefully incomplete and frustrating series of maps. The maps seem to be only initial sketches; they lack a lot of information, have a number of obvious misspellings (and over-written corrections,) and don't have any over-lapping areas to make it clear how each map relates to the others (even just a one page overall map would have been a big help.)

It got you wrapped up in the story and the characters and led you on an emotional ride.I come from an island where homosexuality and the homosexual lifestyle is still a crime and punishable.

I did not understand what was happening in the bathroom to the right, and what was that for, but the singing is spectacular. Villars and Susan Anthony are very good, Sophie Koch is incredible, and Iride Martinez as Zerbinetta is sensational! Where did they find her? She is possibly the best Zerbinetta I have ever seen, so spunky and vivacious, and her singing is unbelivable. I can only imagine what it feels to come on stage after she did the Grossmachtige Prinzess, as Ms Voigt once said about Nathalie Dessay, she wipes the stage with that aria! And her scenes with the Composer are wonderfull, too, so ignore the bizarre production ideas, they are a bit annoying, but they will not detract you from enjoying the fantastic singing.

Especially for othe RE players.

I couldn't tell any difference. But the PS2 version controls a lot better. You can react quicker, it doesn't have key buttons in awkward places. It lets you take control and actually enjoy the game the way you should of in the first place. I'm a much better player on the PS2 version, and It's a shame I had already beat the game on GameCube. Still it was so smooth that I still almost beat it again on 2 rentals. I wanna add it to my PS2 collection.The negatives of this game, well... the story is still one of the stupidest ever in a survival horror game. Rescue the Presedents duaghter and and save the world stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect installment","review":"one reviewer says is he missing something you must did not play this game another game perhaps this is the best one that they made in my mind i played and beat all resident evils"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest for the PS2","review":"RE4 for the PS2 is an incredible game. The graphics are some of the best that you will find on the console. The story line itself is a reason to buy. There is so much fun to be had while playing this game. Theres a guy who you can buy weapons and weapon upgrades from. Thats the only really downside about this game. You keep upgrading but eventually your weapons are too powerful. One shot kills a boss, that doesnt seem right.pros: graphicsstory lineweapons upgradingcons: sometimes weapons too powerful"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNLIMITED ACTION","review":"There's plenty of suspense and gore in hee, including zombie villagers with scythes, axes and pitchforks. Not to mention the mutant wolves, with tentacles coming out of there backs. There's also bigger monsters, like giant monsters that look like shaved King Kongs, giant fishes, and others.

I wonder what dunce dreamed up that idea...After so many games getting it right (COD, MOH, MGS, Splinter Cell, Max Payne, SOCOM, Syphon Filter, etc.) how the f**k did these overpaid idiots at Capcom get it so friggin wrong? This is disgraceful. With the production value, this COULD have been such an awesome game. Too bad they f*cked it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"the gamecube version is much better...","review":"if you are thinking about picking this up i'd go for the nintendo gamecube version over this one. the graphics look much better and it plays smoother on the 'cube (plus playing on the gamecube means you can use the best video game accessory ever made= the ultra-dope wavebird wireless controller) . the game was designed for the gamecube, and the weird architecture of the ps2 didn't help the shifting over from that console. the game itself is fantastic but be aware that it is much better on the gamecube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very surprised at the poor controls","review":"This is the first Resident Evil game I've tried and was quite surprised that the controls were this poor. I had heard nothing but positive reviews on RE4. Most all of them containing remarks on how they finally got the controls right in contrast to eariler RE games. Those earlier games must of been close to completely unplayable. But you'll have to excuse me I guess. I just finished playing games like Halo, Halo 2, FarCry, and many other recent 1st person and 3rd person action games whose controls are flawless or close to it. There is really no excuse in this day and age to have controls this horrible. If the controls were done this way on purpose to heighten the suspense or something, perhaps the makers of this game should have just simply made a better game to accomplish this. Poor controls = No Fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun game, but... (PS3 Version)","review":"This game could have been amazing, but is hampered by relatively clunky/awkward movement and controls. I recently played Silent Hill 1 for the PsOne and thought it controlled better than this game. With that aside, this game is a very fun ACTION game.. Don't expect this to be your typical Resident Evil Survival Horror, because it is not. It is much more action based with light survival horror (collecting supplies to survive) and light RPG elements (inventory management and buying/selling equipment at the vendor). I had a blast playing this game and if it wasn't for the controls would be a perfect 5/5 in my eyes. The story is alright but has really no ties to other resident evil besides the main character and the typewriter I guess. They mention raccoon city but just in passing. I paid 19.99 for this in the PSN store for PS3 and don't regret it at all, I just wouldn't go into the game expecting such a great experience like Resident Evil 1,2, and 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new way to play shooters","review":"Probably the earliest game released that I've played with the over-the-shoulder shooter style. The graphics are unmatched by any other PS2 game and has a very fine storyline.The one small problem that I have is that the aiming is hard to control. You cannot dodge and shoot at the same time or even remotely at the same time. I wish they would have utilized both analog sticks for shooting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resident Evil IV - a bit trying at times.","review":"Resident Evil IV has chapters where it takes many, many efforts to conquer the \\"bad guy\\".

Amazing value for the money.","review":"It seems like most games last only about 5-12 hours on Xbox 360 and PS3 and they cost three times as much as this game. Of course, length isn't the only reason to buy this game but it's the fact that not only is it so long but every minute is oozing quality that makes it an absolute must buy for PS2 owners. I really like that fact that it's challenging but never too hard. For those who want to pull their hair out you can try it on harder settings but I found the normal setting just right. I wish they had a bit more back story since I've never played other Resident Evil games but it's still one of the best games I've played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exilarating!! But Aiming was slightly annoying at times.","review":"The whole behind the back camera angle is a very cool feature, the game is nicely paced with not too hard enemies. Use of the laser is cool but a bit annoying at times due to the fact that the game was made with as much realism as possible meaning the character's hard tends to shake. That was my only problem with this game, otherwise, it's wonderful if you are looking for a nice horror game.

It's nearly impossible to fend of the attacks of just 2-3 monsters! Not to mention you run about as fast as a snail with polio.The game looks impressive, beautiful graphics, intriguing story, creepy moments. But to me, the actual gameplay is just as important! I wasn't expecting it to be a devil may cry type battle system, but at least you should be able to MOVE while your aiming your gun!Everything ELSE about this game is just as your friends are telling you, amazing, but if your like me, and the gameplay and controls are just as important, this may not be the game of choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME IS SUPERIOR COMPARED TO RESIDENT EVIL RACOON CITY","review":"this game is superior compared to resident evil operation racoon city. pure and simple. resident evil operation racoon city is crap. that is also pure and simple. we need the old original resident evil back with more eerie atmosphere, puzzles, and great story line.

The Raynox came to my attention thru a video forum. No its not a brand name but the price is reasonable, not half the price of the camera, more like 1/10 the price. The lens is a zoom thru adaptor, this means you can use the full zoom of your camera instead of being sharp at the widest and going out of focus at the middles of zoom. Sharpness is excellent, though wide open it does soften at the edges when fully wide. Very little visible Chromatic Abberation. That is it doesn't show a color fringe on a sharp edge. It has a 62 mm thread on the front and comes with adaptors to fit it to various lenses, the base thread is 37mm which fits my Sony perfectly so I don't use a adaptor in my case. In short I use it as if it was my normal lense. So it stays on my camera all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any camcorder","review":"This is a must have. Once you have the wide angle lens you will never take it off again! Unfortunately it blocks the light on my canon HF11 and also makes it so you can only use Auto focus and not instant auto focus. Even with these two things being slightly disadvantageous, I use this lens 90 % of the time. Great for indoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fly at all","review":"This model plane does not fly.

It's short, to the point, and is easily understood by a two year old. The only negative feedback that I have about this book is that it keeps saying \\"Ernie goes\\" or \\"Ernie has to go\\" and isn't more specific than that. It's too easily misunderstood by a child who is used to going somewhere or going bye bye. Adults say \\"I have to go.\\" frequently, but he has always heard \\"go potty\\" \\"go pee pee and poo poo\\" or \\"make pee pee and poo poo\\". So, anytime that it says Ernie \\"goes\\", I read it as \\"goes pee pee and poo poo\\". It also says that Ernie unsnaps his pants and goes. My son has never worn a pair of pants with a snap, so he has no idea what that means. And, in reality, just unsnapping your pants is leaving off a major step: the pulling down of the pants. I don't want my kid to unsnap his pants and go, I want him to get his pants all the way down and then go.

I have to turn book upside down and backwards to read to my 2 year old...SMH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"This book helped me realize that it was time for me to move onto the next stage. Ernie provides guidance on making the transition, and his manner is coaxing, not agressive. For too long I've used the crutch of diapers, but Ernie helped me realize that I don't need to fear the unknown. He made the transition fun and enjoyable. At 34, I'm now a big boy too, and my mother is so proud of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big For Diapers","review":"My grandaughter loves the book. She carries it with her everywhere, even to the potty. Very colorful; it holds her attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplistic","review":"This short book is overly simplistic.

My just-turned three year old boys love the pictures, and this is the only \\"potty\\" book they ask me to read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter love to read this on the potty!","review":"Just begining to introduce potty training to my 2yo and she LOVES this book! From reading and looking at the pictures, she has finally made the association between diapers = baby and potty = big girl. This made a big difference in her desire to go to the potty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dropping a hint to my grandson","review":"I bought this book for my grandson for Valentine's Day. He is about 19 months old. He loves it when I read it to him. His parents will start to potty-train when he is two years old, but I thought I would drop the hint to him now. It is a great book and I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute!","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she began the potty training process. It's so cute! And it really gets the point across too. \\"Ernie's too big for diapers, so now Ernie has to learn to use the potty. When he feels he has to go, he sits down on the potty and goes!\\" etc. I love the photographs, and it's nice and short too.My daughter is not a big Sesame Street fan, but she really likes this book. Even though she's fully potty trained, she still looks at it once in a while.Also for those afraid of gross anatomy: Don't worry about it on this one. Ernie sits down to potty and you don't see anything. It's appropriate for a girl as well as a boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so many positive reviews?","review":"The book is like 5 pages and doesn't have much content (as you may have guessed). Plus it shows Ernie wrapping himself up in toilet paper. Explain that to a toddler..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a baby's book, not a toddler's book","review":"The topic of potty training is very much appropriate for a 2+ year old but the book is not written at a 2+ year old's level. This is very much a baby's book. I guess it would be good if you wanted to start exposing your baby to the broad concept of a potty. As far as using this book as a teaching tool to help potty train a toddler, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"I was disappointed in the story of the book. The book is very short and I felt that when my daughter and I read it, there was not much room for discussion. Ernie makes the transition from diapers to underwear seem a bit too easy. Other books do a better job highlighting that it takes practice and time. Ernie never has an accident or doesn't even seem to object to not wearing a diaper. My daughter doesn't seem to understand why all of a sudden we are trying to potty train her because things seem to be just fine to her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been so much better","review":"Based on the age of most toddlers learning potty training, this book was a dissapointment. It's great that it's Sesame Street and the pictures are simple and colorful, but it's only a few pages. My son (22 months) is just started to get engaged in the concept, and about 4 pages later the books done. This book would be more appropriate for an infant in simplicity if the theme wasn't for potty training aged readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"ernie potty","review":"this is really basic but very cute,takes all of 20 seconds to read!Wished I'd bought it at a yard sale and not paid so much $"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"My daughter loves Ernie.

Now she doesn't want to stop reading it even when she gets done going potty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible ending - Ernie TPs the bathroom","review":"I bought this book to help potty train my 2 year old son. The last page of the book completely ruins what would have been a useful tool. The text warns Ernie not to use too much toilet and there is a picture of Ernie and the whole bathroom covered in toilet paper. Not helpful, buy another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much there","review":"Baby Ernie is cute but this book was too short and simplistic for our 2-year-old. Hardly any text. It didn't offer much information. It's more like a baby's book, and babies don't need to learn about using potties! I've seen MUCH better books out there on potty-training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but Not Helpful","review":"This book covered only the real basics to help your child understanding potty training. There were cute photos of baby Sesame Street characters, but just not enough educational substance to make it worthwhile.For some real help with training, I highly recomment \\"My Big Boy Potty\\" or \\"My Big Girl Potty\\" by Joanna Cole instead. While our son asked to read that book every day, he quickly became bored with \\"Too Big for Diapers\\" and soon forgot all about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I really like this book. My daughter got it for her first birthday, because I want her to be aware of potty training for a while before she does it. She is very interested in this book. I also like that it teaches them to wash their hands when they are finished. Would reccomend to people who are potty training little ones. Also very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"This book is short and to the point. It holds a toddler's attention and I really like the part about washing hands. None of my other potty books talk about that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too young","review":"This book is way to imature for a child that is old enough to be learning to use the potty. It is a good book if you want to start exposing your child at around 12 months, but does not speak to the level of a 2.5 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"Okay, besides the fact that this book does show Ernie getting on a potty and he stops playing with blocks to get there, the grammar is exceedingly awful and it shows Ernie with toilet paper all over the place.

I did have to change the words to fit into what we were teaching our little one to call his body's fuctions."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not as helpful as I had hoped","review":"This book is very short and not as instructive as I had hoped. My son likes it, but, it hasn't gotten the message through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but that;'s all","review":"My son likes this because he likes Ernie, of course. But out of the 4 or 5 potty books he has, this is the least useful as a teaching tool. I would highly recommend Once Upon a Potty as well as Karen Katz' A Potty for Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Potty Training Book for us","review":"I used this book with both of my children and they both LOVED the book. I think the large, simple pictures captured their attention and are perfect for the potty training age (2-3 yrs). My daughter has been potty trained for 4 months but she still recites the \\"potty process\\" from this book as she goes. I love that it says, \\"Don't use too much toilet paper Ernie...\\" When my daughter was training, she would recite that statement as she reached for the TP. This book goes in my \\"all kids love\\" pile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Big for Diapers","review":"Another nice little book to help with the potty training. My Grandson liked this one too and we took it into the bathroom to see if he sat and read, he might get results."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"this is a great book my daughter loves it, it's very entertaining. I'm always looking for good children book and I will recommend this one along with the little boy by rohan hall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Potty Training Book","review":"If your children like Ernie as much as my 2 year old. They will appreciate Ernie's ability to use the potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sesame Street fans","review":"My son loves Sesame Street - so I had to buy him this book. It's a short book but simple and effective. He really likes it and even has read it in bed. He learned to use the potty at a later age than most kids, so this book just shows him that he is \\"Too Big for Diapers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 18 month old LOVES this book","review":"This is a great little book with familiar characters and a simple story line! My daughter makes us read it over and over! It's a fun way to introduce the idea of using the potty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for toilet training!","review":"This is a good and easy for your child to understand toilet training. Great pictures and wonderful concept for toilet training kids. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great potty training tool","review":"This book is cute and to the point. The only thing lacking is the words pee pee and doo doo. It just says \\"Ernie unsnaps his pants and goes.\\" Overall, a great book for boys and girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to the point, well acted scenarios","review":"I got this at my library. This dvd has great production value, great, to the point acting so you won't get bored. The basics are easy, whatever you would do for a human, do for a dog overall. Yes, even CPR. Some things like poison, you can call the Animal Poison Control Center number or for snake bites, they tell you not to do anything or suck it out, but to go to a vet which is obvious.Topics include:First aid kit, What is normal, Scene safety, muzzle, A-B-C (CPR lingo), Rescue breathing, CPR, choking, drowning, mechanism of an injury, spinal injury, fractures, wounds, evisceration, gunshot wounds, penetrating chest wounds, embedded objects, shock, car accidents, poisoning, snake bites, hypothermia, burns, chemical burns, heat stroke, electric shock, eye injuries, foot injuries, ear problemsThey use real dogs to demonstrate, for CPR, they used s stuffed one. All these topics will also show you the signs & symptoms, not just what to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for beginners, and still not the best","review":"This book gives basic information for those just beginning to deal with schools and IEP's. I found some outright wrong information regarding IDEA and provision of services. (She stated that a school has a right to deny services based on their budget considerations, which is false.) I am disappointed in this book, as I truly found her other book, Incorporating Social Goals in the Classroom: A Guide for Teachers and Parents of Children with High-Functioning Autism and Asperger Syndrome, to be very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, touching Book!","review":"The book is based on a \\"last will\\" found by a destitute man. While his thoughts and wishes were written many years ago, they are completely relevant today. The book is touching and endearing with gorgeous illustrations and graphics -- and will make a great gift for people of all ages. It is truly a \\"keepsake\\" book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is a beauty. With jazz, trip hop, samba etc. Music. As well as ambience and drum & bass.

One of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading on several levels","review":"What a fabulous way to introduce young readers to famous artists like Rene Magritte and Salvador Dali. We went to a museum exhibit a few weeks after finding this great book, and my 6 year old son was able to pick out a Magritte on the wall. A secondary benefit is to introduce the idea that all is not what it seems, and that what one person sees is not what the next person sees. A great find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Falsified Information","review":"I ordered and paid for a hardcover book. I received a paperback in terrible condition that was NOT new. I would never buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music but bad disc set up","review":"Great music from the series (the best part of Gundam Seed Destiny ;) )! Be warned, if you use Media Player, you will have to edit the information yourself since it thought both discs had the same tracks when naming them and that wasn't even 100% accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just never got very interesting...","review":"I usually love her work, but this book never took off and the two main characters were highly annoying. Just eh...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Derivative","review":"After reading \\"Getting Over It,\\" I was deeply impressed with Anna Maxted, and thought that her super-stardom in the literary world was assured. Here was a writer who could tackle emotional troubles (in the case of \\"Getting Over It,\\" a woman who cannot cope with her relationship with her father, and thus with her lover) with poignancy and humor; Ms. Maxted wrote so fluently as to seem effortlessly. After this sparkling debut, Anna Maxted has suffered from best-selling author syndrome: nothing to write about so write again that first best-selling novel. To say that \\"A Tale of Two Sisters\\" is a carbon copy of \\"Getting Over It\\" is to flatter it; it is a back carbon copy. The plot is trivial, and the writing, while fluent and polished, is sprawling and shallow. If readers have not done so already they must read \\"Getting Over It,\\" and be astonished at how such a talented and perceptive writer could become so careless and apathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Maxted's Trademark Wit","review":"I was actually very disappointed with Maxted's most recent chick lit outing. Wit, humor and hilarious happenings are normally the cornerstones of Maxted's writing. Not only did I find the two main characters unsympathetic and difficult to care about, a plot obsessed with having or not having babies made for a dull read to say the least. Here's hoping she'll bring back some of the more spirited characters and occurrences in her next novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual Anna Maxted style","review":"I have read every Anna Maxted book, and I must agree with prior reviewers who found this book quite a departure from her usual style. I found the plotline rather dry-it was all about baby obsession. I found it hard to believe that Lizbet went from being happily childfree to spiraling into a deep depression after a miscarriage. I am a happily childfree woman myself, and if I was to have a miscarriage, I'd be celebrating instead of being sad. Lizbet's character was ruined in this book, just like Gabby's on \\"Desperate Housewives\\" was with all of the baby nonsense. Childfree people are childfree, period. There is no all of a sudden loving babies and wanting to be pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of Detection","review":"Very disappointing book I wouldn't have finished it if it hadn't cost so much. If I wanted to read about Sherlock Holmes I'd read Doyle's. The whole story line is dull including Kate, count how many times we're told she's going to read daughter Nora abedtime story. I'll be crossing Laurie King of my list of author's to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great","review":"King's best work is excellent: intelligent, entertaining stories populated by living characters. Often she is thought provoking --sometimes heavy-handed, sometimes not. As a point of reference, my favorites are O, Jerusalem, The Game, A Grave Talent and the Folly books. This was a fun read although perhaps not one of her best. It was fun to learn more about characters from both series in one book. The \\"inner novella\\" was actually some of the most enjoyable reading as far as I was concerned. Other reviews criticized the pace which didn't bother me; King writes mysteries, not thrillers, and I like it that way. If you're a fan of King it's worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Of Sherlockian Fun","review":"In this mystery Laurie R. King is having a bit of fun. In the middle of the Kate Martinelli story another story is inserted that looks a lot like another Conan Doyle creation.The joke is, of course, that when the Sherlockians inspect the newly discovered story to see if it is a lost Conan Doyle creation, the conclusion must be that this is not (in this newly-discovered story the story's author's wife is mentioned; Conan Doyle never wrote of Holmes having a wife.). Thus this story will correctly be declared to not be a Conan Doyle creation, and thus is of no monetary value. Those of us who have followed the Mary Russel/Sherlock Holmes stories will recognize that this story is from the \\"real\\" Holmes, and is thus priceless (and proof that Holmes really did exist).I really liked the joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Idea","review":"I've read every book Laurie King has written. I wait with enthusiasm for a new book to come out. I enjoy both the Mary Russell novels and the Kate Martinelli Novels. This book, The Art of Detection, tries to bring both series ideas together into one book. It was a VERY bad idea. The only good part is the supposed Holmes manuscript. That was well written and very entertaining. The overall book story line however, is uninteresting and it is boring, very boring.I hope now that Laurie King has become more famous that she won't cut corners again like she attempted to, this time. Nothing spoils an author more than fame. Let's hope fame hasn't spoiled Laurie King for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are NOT amused","review":"I've a VERY large bone to pick with Laurie R. King with regard to her new Kate Martinelli mystery (The Art of Detection) which I'd been anticipating for years. Mind you, I read and enjoyed the first two or three Mary Russell Holmes novels, then tired of the trope entirely. Kate, however, has been a constant if often shrill delight. So, what do I find in the new Kate? Sherlock Holmes, that's who. Not ONLY is the mystery centered on a Holmes theme but there's a pastiche Holmesian novela taking up about a third of the book.We are not amused. We may never again trust King."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Queer Tale","review":"Prospective readers should not imagine that this is a Sherlock Holmes book, nor even that it is much about detection. It is mainly a wail about the troubles of homosexuals, and if the reader is as little interested in that subject as I am he should avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bring up sexual preferences?","review":"I wanted to read more books by Laurie King after reading her excellent series with Sherlock Holmes and Mary Holmes. However, this book spent too much time with Martinelli's lesbian relationship and her thoughts on same sex marriage. Hey, I wanted to read a mystery not a commentary on her sex life. I won't read another one of these mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the target","review":"I have read and loved all of the Kate Martinelli mysteries, until this one. It went well until the \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" manuscript was wedged in. After that, the book became dull and predictable, with the only bright spot being at the very end, when Kate and her partner Lee were whisked off to city hall for an impromptu wedding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate Martinelli meets Sherlock Holmes","review":"Kate and Al are investigating a murder on the old gun emplacements outside of San Francisco. The victim is a fan of Sherlock Holmes, even going so far as to dress as he did and to decorate part of his home according to the description of Holmes' study. The investigation hinges on the question of a manuscript the victim supposedly purchased, said to be a long lost work of Conon-Doyle. Kate is especially interested in this as her partner is a Holmes fan. The ending was a surprise for me and I read all of Laurie Kings's work. A rousing good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the broken print?","review":"I very much like most of Laurie King's books, but this one I found slow and a bit dull. The pace was not helped by the lengthy reproduction of a broken-typeface manuscript that consumed about 100 pages and was a bit difficult to read. Anyone over 40 would be well advised to look for a large-print version of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like this author but despised this book","review":"I read this book because I really enjoy the author's Mary Russell series. I always try different series by the same author realizing that at times I will be disappointed. This was one of these times, I simply could not finish this book. I didn't care about the characters, didn't need to know detailed information about San Francisco and simply didn't care for the entire concept. While I am looking forward to the author's next Mary Russell book, I will not be reading any more of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who don't like Sherlock Holmes, skip this mystery","review":"I have really enjoyed the Kate Martinelli mysteries and was very anxious to read The Art of Detection. I am NOT a Sherlock Holmes fan and therefore, have never bothered to read Ms. King's Mary Russell series. Once I realized that this particular Kate series mystery had a Sherlock theme, I was disappointed since I thought there were probably many more adventures and crimes Kate could solve living in the Bay area that didn't require a Holmes theme. I trudged through most of the book since my interest wasn't really held but, I have made it through. For those who think they should read The Art of Detection just to make sure that they don't miss anything about the Kate-Lee relationship, don't worry. There's nothing new so, you can skip this mystery and hope that the author produces another Kate Martinelli book WITHOUT Holmes connections soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring book","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because I love mysteries and I enjoy Sherlock Holmes, but I was really disappointed by it. It started out interesting but slowed down really fast. The descriptions of San Francisco and the natural scenery just went on and on. I wish this author had been more concise and to-the-point in her writing; a good mystery should be fast-paced and exciting. Truth be told, I couldn't even finish this one, and I am usually very good about reading the whole book once I've started it. This one was just too boring, but I bet it could have been very good if it had had a faster, more exciting pace to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Laurie King ...","review":"This is not my favorite Laurie King -- the ending is a bit strange and not in a way that leaves you wanting to understand the overall book better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"I am a fan of this author, and had read the 4 previous books in this series. I enjoyed them. However, this one left a lot to be desired. I found the 8 year jump (leaving a HUGE gap in the story time line) disconcerting. And the page after page after page of \\"manuscript\\" was dull. I will watch for the next book and hope that it is as good as the first 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game's A Bore","review":"Love the Mary Russell stories. Really like the Martinelli character. This book was an ill concieved blend of sorts, with Martinelli seeking resolution of the death of a Holmes' collector. Both the modern day mystery and the pastiche were slow and thin. The book itself is preachy, where it had no need to try so hard. The vignettes of Kate and Nora and Lee spoke more eloquently about acceptance than the rest of the tepid storylines. The mystery itself was no mystery. The pastiche was merely annoying. I just can't find a reason to recommend this book. A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must read ...","review":"... \\"Locked Rooms\\" before you read this book !Only THEN you will know what is going on ... it's a Martinelli book for Russell/Holmes fans !!!IMHO, it's not as good as the brilliant \\"A Grave Talent\\", but it is far better than some of the other reviews would have you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Mary Russell fans?","review":"Fans of King's wonderful Mary Russell novels may feel a tad insulted by the police's perspective that Holmes enthusiasts are weirdos. And unless I missed something, the matter of the authorship of the supposed Conan Doyle manuscript is never resolved. I may have also missed something when Martinelli finally figures out who the killer is. She seems to jump to a conclusion based on flimsy evidence. Add in the strained political correctness, and you have a very unsatisfying mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad it's good","review":"This is one of the worst movies to come out of the 1980s.

It cut off the last few minutes which, in my opinion, are what make the song unique. The other songs appeared to be fine as I played the album. I wrote a letter to customer service and they quickly responded. I was given a full refund and they acknowledged the problem. I was told it would be fixed in the coming week.So, my low rating is not regarding the album. Its obviously a great album. Also, I'm not criticizing Amazon.

I followed the instructions posted here from some of the people who were lucky enough to get a good one and still works like garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Purchased this battery as a replacement for my kids barbie jeep (our battery stopped working - we got 4 great years out of that one). we used this replacement once and it worked great. We used it a second time and only got a short charge out of it. The third time I tried to use it, it wouldn't work!!! $70 for 2 uses!!! That just plain sucks!! What a scam. Don't purchase one of these!!! I hope Amazon will decide to refund me on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"Fantastic deal!

It now runs as good as it did when it was new. Be sure to charge it for 18 hours before using and run it all the way down the first few times to season the battery properly. Also don't do what I did to my last one and leave it on the charger whenever you are not using it. That seems to be what helped ruin my last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enthused","review":"This book really in my opinion is a bunch of BS. It is faith based so that means you have to be kind of a right wing Christian to even want to take interest in this. I found no inspiration here and thought that a lot of it was bull poo, like that paper you had to rewrite twenty times for your english final."},{"rating":"1","title":"For unimaginative, noncommunicative couples","review":"A series of meant to be erotic stories. However, they're told as though by people who are ashamed to talk about sex, which wasn't much of a turn-on. All phallus were \\"big\\". How imaginative is that?! If you're someone who can't talk about it with your partner, this may be a place to start. There is a lot better material out there. Go, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzled","review":"I read the previos review of Nice COuples Do and bought the book anyway. I was delighted. Having been written in 1991 it's a bit less than some of the more overt stuff now, but the suggestions were great and the short pieces of erotic fiction were fun to read aloud and share with my husband.

Cheesy acting plus bad transitional filming make what could have been a good movie (I understand this is based on a true story/legend from the Chicago area) into a jumbled mess. The lead actor is so unsympathetic that I found myself hoping either he would really do himself in or Mary would have her revenge.Unless you're from Chicago and know the background of this story, you may enjoy it just for that reason. Otherwise, I'd pass on this stinker.Mary is coming after those who made this movie and she ISN'T happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"If it wasn't for my mother having a small part in this movie, I would have never bought it.

Just another poor attempt to profit on an old legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The best part of the movie was only Iris Chacon.

Bleah."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritating noise","review":"This movie moves along at the pace of its characters in mid-summer Australian heat. In fact, the pace of the characters exemplifies the overall effect of this film: very slow in most spots, and a sprint or two yielding most of the action/significance of the story. Both the title and the use of \\"noise\\" in this film were not a convincing element of the plot, and some of the segments of the plot are choppy enough to leave me a bit disinterested in what's unfolding. All of the characters are handled unevenly, and some of them (Australian police) seem downright unbelievable. The movie had some effective moments, the outburst of the diabetic heroine confronting her stalker, and the theorizing of our policeman protagonist as to the nature of death, heaven, and hell. But overall for me this movie is woven together with some holes in the fabric and some knots in the thread."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Pitch was irritating. Enjoyed the first 10 Minutes...","review":"Ok, when the film started I was really liking it. It then SLOWLY drags on downhill. About 85% of this film takes place in a Police Caravan watching the lead actor sitting and bored. I share your pain...The lead Actor was good although he appeared as if he would rather be elsewhere. Basically what you have is a Killer, a young Policeman with a high pitched ringing in his Ears which frankly had me mute the film a couple of times and a long drawn out investigation that leads nowhere! The only action was in the first and last scenes. I generally like the Australian films but this was a regrettable purchase. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"many years ago","review":"Quartz are a band I saw in 1981 at the Edinburgh Odeon. They supported Ian Gillan and his band. Also Whitespirit were opening act. Quartz were quite outstanding, with a version of Nantucket Sleighride that Mountain would have been proud of. Anyway getting back to the Album. Certain songs stand out, as well as Nantucket Sleighride, Street Fighting Lady is a fast and rocky number. Mick Hopkins on guitar is quite superb. Dracula would have been a Rock Classic if a better known band had wrote it.Quartz Main Line Rider is another outstanding song, and all excellent live. I have no time left to finish this review but I will come back again and add to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Demo","review":"The demo looks ok, but you didn't see much of DS9 in it, and on Elite Force you get to be on a starship.

The game is not as user friendly as the Elite Force and other Star Trek games I have played. The graphics are slow and hang up from time to time which makes game play harder. I know for a fact it is not my graphics card. I think the technology is just older. Graphics were nice and there were cool features of the game. Just not quite what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Good So Far","review":"Wow, this game looks awesome. From each website I've visited the plot and storyline look really interesting. Its based on the first episode of a multi-part DS9 storyline, The Millennium Saga - will intertwine threads between the playable characters, Sisko, Kira or Worf. You'll be searching for three Red Orbs, ancient relics with amazing powers that various factions inside - and outside - the Federation would like to get their hands on. I know that each playable character is used for different missions and the graphics for the game are awesome as well. The game just looks really cool and I know that when its available I definitely will buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping, and pure Trek","review":"What a great game. I just played it all the way through again. The real innovation is the tricorder (prioritizing information over gun fire) and the vastness of the levels (a tribute to both the sound and the graphics). It looks, sounds, and plays very satisfyingly to a DS9 fan like myself. The core problem with the game (why I gave it four stars instead of five) is that the weapons are uninteresting strategically. About all you do is shoot. As a result, while there are puzzles (sequences of levers to pull) in the game, you seldom come upon, say, a room full of enemies, and have to figure an interesting way to deal with it. Even you aim-assisting cursor always prioritizes enemies over exploding barrels. In short, it is no Deus Ex! But neither was the more linear Elite Forces, a more successful but in no way better game.Ultimately, though, the game pulls it together. It reminds me more than a little of mega-hit Jedi Knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Star Trek Story","review":"I love this game because you have a story similar to Indiana Jones in a Star Trek mission. Searching for ancients orbs and following a legend. You can play three (independent) characters and save your progress in mission. You solve puzzles and kill \\"bad boys\\" and \\"creatures\\".Wonderfull graphics and medium requeriments for your PC.I gave 4 stars to overall rating because you will need to download two patches (first a big and after a small patch) for a good experience in this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danny Kaye","review":"Danny Kaye Sings Hans Christian Andersen And Other FavouritesMerry Andrew.

Skip this and go directly to the A&E Biography's show on Piaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible disappointment -- and a great disservice to Piaf!","review":"the description of this dvd is so misleading. when i watched it, i couldn't figure out what was going on, who the man she loved was, what she died from and whatever happened in her life, early and late. there was just no information at all. what was great was her performances --- but i was hoping for a real biographical film. this made no sense at all. and the english overdubbing was horrible; subtitles would have worked much better. although the whole production was haphazard and uninformative and confusing. i was so disappointed. but i liked the songs at the end, even without any visuals. this did not do the great piaf any justice at all and someone who knew nothing about her would come away still knowing nothing about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"Unfortunately there is nowhere near enough substance to this DVD. Edith Piaf gave a lot of televised interviews in her life, and only a few little tidbits are included here. Only the sketchiest, barest biographical details are included, leaving the viewer with far more questions than answers about why Edith Piaf's life was so remarkable and so short. The performance segments are very good, and for that alone I am glad I purchased this DVD, but if you are looking for something like an A&E Biography on the famous Parisian singer, this is definitely not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman Goes Environmental","review":"Let's be fair. I'm biased towards Roger Stern. He is one of my favorite comics writers. He did great work at Marvel on titles like Captain America and has had his hands in the DC pool as well being very involved with Superman in such stories as Exile, The Wedding and the Death of Superman saga. In Superman: For Earth, Roger Stern uses Superman as a tool for environmental issues. After a conversation with his then fiancee Lois Lane (they tied the knot later), Superman decides to start cleaning up the pollution of Metropolis. However, when he starts to see the more global problem of environmental abuse, he begins to wonder how much even he can do to prevent Earth from going the same way as his home planet of Krypton. Good, little known story with even better art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welte-Mignon","review":"I am very disapointed for this issue. Do not be fooled by the DDD label. The recording is more about the outdated machine Welte-Mignon tried to record Horowitz in 1926 and nothing about grand master Horowitz. I did not even finish listening any of the pieces in this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance of classic Godfather music...","review":"I am a die-hard Godfather afficianado and I was terribly disappointed in this CD. When I purchased it, I didn't realize it was not a recording of the original soundtrack from the movie. Instead, it is a reproduction of the songs by The City of Prague Philharmonic. The performance is technically accurate, but does not at *all* convey the emotion of the movie's moments. It's as if the musicians studied the score, but never saw the movie. In track after track, the rhythms are not quite right, the mood is not set, etc, which is jarring for someone who knows the movies well. If you just want to hear some pleasing music, buy this CD. If you intend to buy a CD of The Godfather soundtrack in order to re-experience the magic of the Godfather movies themselves, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bible for 3rd-4th Graders","review":"This Bible was recommended by our homeschool curriculum to purchase for our 2nd graders.

A lot of blurry pictures when using self timer option - even with a tripod.3. Red eye problem is very common in low light conditions even with the eye reduction option.3. The fact that you have to set time and date every time you open a camera to change a battery or memory card is very annoying.Overall ist's a good camera and worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I have no idea whether this camera would have been good or not.

Not only are they masterfully written but the adventures are exciting and unbelievably well coordinated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the gold standard","review":"Mr. Hoppin has been dead for over twenty years, and this book is still as good as it gets in terms of Medieval music history. It is great for undergraduate or graduate study because it is so detailed and accurate. If you can get through this book, you will have everything you ever need to know about Medieval western music unless you're doing postgraduate work in musicology.A few notes, though:- It is an older book, so the prose can be pretty dense at times. This is not light reading.- It is pretty daunting to read this book if you don't know anything about music history in general. If you really have never read about music history, I would start with Grout first, and then try to tackle this book and the others in the Norton series."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"boring boring boring and old style it didn't help me with any new idea it have not to much pic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Linda!!!","review":"As a Clean House fan and an enthusiastic organizer, this was a must have.

For example: \\"Nightstands are perfect for containing all that essential bedtime clutter, from reading glasses to an alarm clock. Put lamps on them to bring more light to the bed area.\\" Wow! Lamps on a bedside table? Who'da thunk?Many of the photographs in this book appear to have been taken in the '80s, as evidenced by the room decor, unless perhaps Linda's Beverly Hills clientele just happens to favor lime green walls and leopard-print carpet. And Linda's grasp on computer technology seems to be a bit lacking; she enthusiastically endorses the use of a Palm Pilot for organizing one's schedule and address book, yet seems to be unaware that programs like Quicken exist to help one balance one's checkbook.Overall, not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organizing tool","review":"This book is so thorough.

Box novel was NOWHERE TO RUN and I decided to endeavor to catch up on the series within three weeks. Obviously, OPEN SEASON is the book to start with and equally obvious is the reason for the series' popularity.My heading sums up the most outstanding attraction of this book. I noted a similar evenly balanced viewpoint in the first book I read, and this first book centering on the endangered species question does give both sides of the issue a voice while spinning a very enjoyable story with a capable but imperfect lead character. I won't go into further detail which has been ably covered by other reviewers, but I do sure recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Way to Start a Series","review":"Gave the first in the Joe Pickett series a try and was not at all disappointed. Started a little bit slow, but it is not the norm when it comes to thrillers. Pickett is a game warden - not your regular cop, detective, agent nor \\"jack bauer\\" type. He's also quite human - makes mistakes, screws up, but has a great moral compass, as his wife calls it. If you feel it is slow starting out, stick with it. The story and action both pick up and the second half of the book flies by. When you think about it - this is how a \\"first book in the series\\" should begin .... create and develop some main characters who are going to be around for awhile. Can't wait to start on the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 1st novel","review":"Open Season is the most original debut novel I have ever read. C. J.

Instead it was unimpressive writing with annoying characters, and a plot that was obvious 30 pages into the book. (That was the point where I told my husband EXACTLY how the book was going to go. The only thing I got wrong was the species of the critter in the cooler (I thought it would be a black-footed ferret.)) The bad guys and their motivations were all obvious that early in the book. The story plodded along, and I kept expecting SOMETHING that would throw a little twist into things, but it was straightforward and dull. Joe was kind of a dummy, his wife was drab, and his children were whining twits. A MUCH better read is Donald Harstad's Carl Houseman series. A real protagonist and set in the mid-west, but good writing and likable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This book was recommended by a friend and I must admit I fell for all the rave reviews. In a nut shell the story lacks imagination (I think it may have been swiped from various B movies), the main character is an idiot, the plot is obvious early on, and the story is dull at best. Worse yet is the author's obvious lack of knowledge about basic law enforcement concepts and terminology. The only positive side to this book is that it is a quick read. I won't be bothering with this series or this author again.

Box is not only a great story teller, he is also obviously an inherent part of the country, climate, profession, and people he writes about.

Apparently they didn't because I bought the book and found that it was less than memorable, to put it kindly. The plot is a stretch, the characters are insipid, and the ending is a foregone conclusion. The poor reader is asked to overlook cliches, maudlin pieces of dialog, and outright contradictions in the construction of this novel.

Their blurbs on the front cover sold me, so I bought the book. It was SO obvious I could scream. The bad guys, villains, were utterly predictable from the first. No shocks there whatsoever. And the entire short novel felt very much like I was reading young adult fiction geared toward 16 or 17 year olds.I was not impressed and felt cheated by the other authors who gave this book great blurbs. It should have been a graphic novel for little boys. Oh, and Joe Pickett? Very boring, very boy scout-one dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, poor story","review":"Not sure what's with all the rave reviews. I picked up this book thinking it would be a mystery set in mountain country, and to some extent it is. Box has a good writing style, but I did't care for the story. Children being threatened and stalked (or neglected and beaten), harmless animals exterminated, to name a few points I didn't care for. It certainly seems as if Box knows his outdoors; i'd just like to read a story that's a little more straightforward mystery and less rambling mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are the reviews so good?","review":"I tried this novel based on other reviews, which I have come to depend on when buying from amazon.

There are not many Tribal CD's out there anymore and if you love this style, take this one to the bank. Thank You Mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds more like the beginning of the night...","review":"This disc is loaded with the type of instrumental stuff you hear when the club first opens, before the crowd actually arrives. There are a couple of vocal tracks, including \\"Get My Love\\" and \\"Power,\\" but for the most part, this one is more brooding and dark than you'd expect from a Circuit CD. Not exactly the kind of stuff you want to pop into the CD player at your party. The few vocals present end up being glaringly obtrusive instead of welcome. Also, there are some noticeable scratches and pops in the vinyl used for the mix at times. Not exactly a great inclusion to the Circuit Sessions series, but if you are looking for the harder edged, darker stuff, you might enjoy this one. Track times are:1. Flying Song (4:35)2. B (6:23)3. Higher (4:54)4. Violent City (5:23)5. You Won't See Me Cry (6:17)6. Twisted (4:04)7. Get my Love (9:07)8. Love Divine (10:18)9. Rise In (8:45)10. Power (5:29)11.

Especially the finale demands an ear for radical interpretations. How should the naivety of this movement come off? Gielen's solution is to emphasize the ironical. This effect is also - for good or bad - what his soloist manages to produce very well.Having said that, the recording has a place in every collector's shelf. The playing is accurate and engineering is first class. And when it comes to the question of interpretational qualities in total, the first three movements will hardly disappoint anyone.I recommend this disc for collectors that want to expand their Mahler collection with an interesting alternative. It is the perfect choice if you already have Horenstein's, Szell's, and Maazel's interpretations.(Amazon has moved this review to a page featuring Kegel's interpretation of the fourth. I don't understand why. In any case, Kegel's interpretation is greater than Gielen's!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"'groovy'","review":"After reading I recall these lines penned by the scholarly Penfield Geometris S.J.Plainly, a man of skill,and vast educationwho says in ten pageswhat a plain fellow would in onewriting eloquently and with great complexityof humanities speech inferiorityto natural chimpanzee.When a member of some illuminati mis - titles a book in order to press an agenda I feel cheated.

Thankfully, this is not another slant on the Omega Code or the DaVinci Code. The message is gentle, not preachy, so non-Christians will still enjoy this book. I must admit I rolled my eyes when the word \\"alien\\" popped up, but Creed makes it work. (I'm not a Sci-Fi fan so that says something!)Although this book is compared to \\"Left Behind,\\" I found the two in no way similar. The plot of \\"Comes The End\\" gets right down to business without much filler. It makes for a good, fast read. Creed renders settings well; the story is easy to picture. Having felt that LaHaye downplayed the catastrophic events of the Rapture in \\"Left Behind,\\" I appreciate that Creed doesn't pull punches in executing these dramatic events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read...","review":"Unfortunately, this genre is full of amateurish efforts.

I read the review sheet he handed me as I shopped. I bought the novel and read it in just a few days. Having already read the LEFT BEHIND series, it was nice to see an end of days novel that took a fresh spin/take on the subject. Too many forms of media on the subject (film, novel, television) have rehashed the same end of days story. Not so here. It is a unique story, plausible in every detail. Beautifully written, enticing characters, and a fresh approach. My only regret is in the wait for the next novel.

I've read almost everything in the genre of eschatological fiction and I have to say this is ultimately very skippable.

I really enjoyed it, but there seemed to be at least one typographical or grammatical error on each page. Then I purchased the second book and found it to be worse in the proofreading department. I'm not sure if this is because of its conversion to Kindle or if those errors were in the original text. These are the kinds of errors that really detract from the reading experience and take one out of the story. Makes me wonder if these books were rushed to publication without a qualified editor. I probably will not purchase the third one for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.M Redmann's","review":"J.M Redmann's \`Deaths of Jocasta' is excellent!

The book is intended to be a study guide for the liturgy committee and contains summary and discussion questions at the end of the introduction and five chapters. The sixth chapter, the conclusion, completes the book.This slim volume is loaded with helpful information: the need to separate liturgical planning and preparation; the necessity of a theological base for the ritual; considerations of form and structure; attention to detail, pace, and environment to name a few. It provides solid material for all who work with liturgy on any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Necessary","review":"A quick review for a simple, yet necessary, product: My father, who is in his 60s, has used this to repair his glasses multiple times.

Much like the series of Smallville, where we get to see Clark Kent as a teenager facing the challenges that will help him to grow into the fine man and hero to the people of the earth. The story of Arthur, Merlin, King Uther, Gwendolynn and Morgana depict the romance, the chivalry and the brutality of those times.

I ordered 10 sets of these edible bird houses. I was excited to get them. I spent almost two hundred dollars.

The seeds did not look like they'd be enough to create two birdhouses like the picture. Today, I have them boxed up and ready to go back. We have to pay shipping but, even shipping them back is worth it. These are a very cute idea and a kit is easier than using your own tubes, but there is no way on earth this is worth the price they were asking - seventeen each.

I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps. I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to. The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it. It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it. I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken. The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.

It has never been worth it to me, as a one-employee company, to spend $199 a year to calculate two payroll checks a month. I've got access to free calculators online -- why spend the money?Apparently, because Intuit needs the cash, that's why. So they strip out the payroll features and force you to subscribe.Boo, hiss ... Had I known this was going to be an expensive pain in the neck, I would have held off upgrading.

It is so slow, I want to switch back to my 2004 version, but can't, because upon installation of the 2006 version, my historical Quickbooks data was converted to a new format, and now there is no going back. They warned during installation about the format change, but they didn't warn the buyer that the new version was miserably slow in some ways. I consider it a real ambush and very close to fraudulent, because their tests had to show the slowdown in performance before they brought it to market. I wonder if enough negative feedback can be generated to induce them to put out some kind of fix?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better","review":"I have been using Quickbooks for a while now and I must say I would not choose this product again. The only reason one might consider it is that third parties such as accountants seem to be familiar with it, making review easier.One thing that really burns me is what would be so difficult about having payroll built into the system without the monthly fees. Yes, the withholding laws may change, but my accountant can keep me aprised of any changes I need to make. The monthly fee structure for payroll is a first class ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Better Upgrade -- QB 2006 Pro NEEDS IMPROVEMENT","review":"I have recently 'upgraded' from Quickbooks Pro 2003 to 2006. What a disappointment. If I had known that I would get less of a product for more money, I never would have 'upgraded.' There are many bugs in QB 2006 Pro. They did away with many of the shortcut key strokes, and memory recall has disappeared from custom invoice data fields. We are now spending much more time invoicing our customers because we have to re-key repetitive data into the invoices. QB 2003 Pro offered much more flexibility and more keyboard shortcuts, as well as data recall that simplified the invoicing process. If you are running an older version of QB Pro, DO NOT, repeat DO NOT, DOWNGRADE to QB Pro 2006! The biggest problem I have now is that I cannot revert back to QB Pro 2003. Once you convert to QB Pro 2006, you are stuck! It does NOT allow you to revert back to an older version.

We loved QB and it has worked well for us. Until 2006. This software has been one bug, glitch, or problem after another. Many of the customer/vendor search options are gone. But mostly there are so many bugs. Every time we sign in we are always told we have paychecks to send, EVERY TIME-even when we don't which is 90% of the time. Our friendly reminders (i.e. Don't forget your W-2s) never go away, even when we say it is done. We can not create an accountants copy from our computers anymore- now it is only from the server. There have been more problems but these are just what I have been dealing with this week.

Poorly done, Intuit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MUCH NEW","review":"Quickbooks and computer magazines have emphasized the new features of Quickbooks 2006, but they are really quite minor. The \\"home page\\" is a new set of icons for getting to the different features just as using the toolbar icons in Quickbooks 2003, etc. You still can't pay with your own check style - Quickbooks only lets you print on blank check forms purchased from Intuit. Also, to do payroll you must purchase additional services to get the tax tables, etc. and a hardcopy manual is an extra you must purchase. Since Intuit is discontinuing payroll services to older versions of Quickbooks, many will \\"upgrade\\" just to keep getting tax table updates, but there are add-ins from other companies that can keep your older Quickbooks payroll working just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickbooks 2006 - not your best investment","review":"I recently purchased this product when the version of Quickbooks I have been using was discontinued.

The attachment point is down low so more than half the times I was pulled the front of the raft would dive under water. If you don't let go quick you are pulled under and the full force of the boat's speed is forced down your throat...I'm disgusted with this thing. I had several inflatables blown up the last time I was on the lake so rather than crowd up the boat I just towed them back to the dock. The boat was handling very strange, like I've never experienced before.

We've had 3 people on the tube and it seems to be holding up fine. The only issue we've had is submarining at slower speeds (during take off and stopping) But this is easily remedied by having the riders sit back on the tube and pull up on the handles.

I read the review that says that only one adult fit on this tube and I do not know what product they are reviewing, but this is quite large enough to fit 3 adults (just be aware of the weight limit). We had so much fun with this tube! It will submarine when you start out if the riders do not keep their weight back but other than that it was fantastic.

The plotting, prose and characterization are all solid or better.I enjoyed it while I was reading it, and am still thinking about parts of it a couple weeks later - perhaps the ultimate compliment. I bought it mostly because it was cheap, but it made me want to read more of this author's work, so if the price was intended as a loss leader it was certainly effective.Recommended to pretty much all SF fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"My REview","review":"I used to have the smaller version of Mel, the one from McDonald's, but he got lost with the rest of my stuff a few years ago.

Matthew Modine's notes and photos, create a very personal glimpse into his thoughts has he went through what became a very long shoot. This is not a \\"how the film was made\\" book, but rather a document of a very special film, from the perspective of its leading actor.

It was one of those moments, when in my heart I understood in a deeper way why Jesus said, \\"I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\\" Inspired to obey Jesus and change, I experienced a turn around by approaching my prayer life the way these little giants of faith demonstrated in this collection of heart-warming stories. With the outcomes I witnessed from their prayers, I expect only God's best!\\"Whispering in God's Ear\\" delivers an added bonus: every author, famous or not, weaves captivating stories. Through each of the eleven parts of this book, Mr. Holmes ingeniously builds on God's basic spiritual truths. All of us, as children of God, need these reminders every now and then.I recommend this book this to all, especially to those who need a lift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearing God","review":"Hearing God's voice in a noisy world isn't always easy. When cynicism threatens to drown my hope, I hear God's whisper when I eavesdrop on the prayers of children like my own seven-year-old daughter.I can hear her praying like the children in this book. Ashtyn, age six, reminds me that \\"No matter how bad life tastes, prayer makes it sweeter.\\" Kyle, age nine, gives me hope and reminds me \\"The best thing about the future is, God comes with it.\\" Molly asks God to make her heart sparkle. Paige knows she can count on God. And one father reminds us all of what's important.In part three, \\"When I Grow Up\\", Holmes almost apologized for including Robert Benson's story about his son Geoffrey. Indeed, the story doesn't include a child's prayer, but it's one of my favorites.This story and the others Holmes compiled do more than inspire childlike faith. This is a book we can share. The stories remind us that God hears our prayers, not because we know the right words to say, but because we don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works , but flimsy ..

The unit was easy to assemble (with my wife's help of course). It runs whisper quiet; we can barely hear it from 10 feet away and when the heat pump kicks on, I don't hear it at all. I like the basic, no frills dials; too much high-speed stuff means more to break. The 2.5 gal tank is easy to remove and fill while the unit is still running. We keep the humidity level rather high so we have to fill the tank twice in a 24 hour period. I recommend getting a large bottle of bacterio-static treatment fluid in a separate purchase; the small bottle provided lasts about 2-4 tank refills only.

I heard about this band on NPR and must say the music is unbelievable for such young men from America. I must warn you that yes, it will sound Beatlesque. Good Beatlesque. If you're wanting Clay (G)Aiken or even worse The Eagles you will be disappointed. There's no modern day hollerin' at the top of their lungs hitting every note on the scale per beat like you may be used to on American Idol. Just great songs, great beats and lovely songs with strings not overdone. If you love The Zombies, The Left Banke, The Wondermints and such you will love this. Such mature work from these teenagers make you realize how retarded Hanson was and undeserving of fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musician's View","review":"As a former studio/tour musician and singer, the review of \\"Resurrection\\" by Benjamin Sandstrom amuzed me. The only dissent among the reviews, I can't help but wonder how many songs he has written and/or recorded or sold. It's usually these guys that have opinions all over the place, but no discernable talent. Resurrection was and is a well written and produced work that deserves recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Holy smoke was I suckered in. This is a terrible record. Just because these guys once were in the same room as the Beatles doesn't mean they can make music. I tried to listen to this disc a second time just to see if maybe I was being unfair. I wasn't. There's nothing here to hook into. This is one of those obscure bands that deserve their obscurity. Bad singer, no hooks, nothing. A complete disappointment. I gave it one star because there was nothing lower and for the mildly interesting story about meeting a couple of Fabs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harsh and Human.","review":"Richardson crafts a skillful read of his journey from a Little People of America convention through a year of continued association with several of the people he meets. As he explicitly states, Richardson isn't out to show holy triumph over physical limitations, but rather presents his subjects and self in all of their imperfect, neurotic glory. The conventional-sized mother of a dwarf needing expensive and painful surgery becomes consumed by her daughter's needs and develops an internet obsession as her family fractures. Richardson honestly grapples with his physical discomfort regarding dwarfism. Strangest of all is his description of the borderline stalker relationship with \\"Andrea\\", his unrelenting and militantly-opinionated correspondent. Tall or small, they're all a bundle of nerves and it's a fascinating read. Drags a bit in places, with tiresome but necessary repetitious descriptions of e-mail correspondence, but well worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My world isn't \\"little\\" at all.....","review":"Although I thought Mr. Richardson hit on some valid and extremely emotional points throughout the book, I'm concerned as to why he chose to prefice the title \\"In the Little World..\\" I am a woman with dwarfism and do not like to be labeled \\"a dwarf\\", as I'm sure many others don't like be labeled \\"a Black\\", \\"a Jew\\", etc. My world isn't little at all - it's filled with big dreams, goals for the future, hobbies, needs, a hearty appetite for life,etc. As I read some of the other reviews, I am also \\"normal\\" and I challenge anyone to define what \\"normal\\" is in this day and age. Remember, We're all one family on earth and the more we seperate each other due to race, height, sex, whatever, this pushes us all back 50 years. I just wished that Mr. Richardson had hit on this point further. Labels not only form barriers, they segregate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gossip and Details","review":"This book is about someone who goes knocking on someone's door and listens to their family genetics and secrets. I truely doubt the public will be interested, unless your a dwarf. Especially if you want to see where your at in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight for everyone -- short or tall","review":"What could have been simply a voyeuristic look into an underreported world becomes something much greater in the hands of John Richardson. Unlike many reporters, Richardson has the philospohical chops to provide real meaning to what he witnesses, and to bring out truths that aren't obvious to the naked eye. Throughout the book, Richardson surprises by often focusing his energy on the fears and hidden motivations of \\"normal\\" people -- the parents, the siblings, the doctors, the gawkers.If anyone should feel discomfited by the book, it's not the dwarves, it's the tall people -- myself included -- who have so much difficulty dealing with what the \\"little people\\" represent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction, not reality","review":"Here's a good criteria for judging this book. Substitute the word \\"dwarf\\" or \\"little person\\" with African American, Jew, Latino, etc., and you will find this book offensive. The author never gets past the physical differences from himself, and we never get a true picture of the humanity of his subjects. I also happen to know some of the subjects of his book, and he completely distorts their stories, and actual events, for the sake of a good read. Consider it a work of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harder to install than you think","review":"I have been installing this on my garage door and it is harder than it looks. If you don't know the cuts right the garage door won't shut. The ones already on the wood is much easier to install. This is a two person installation process because keeping the product over your head to nail it in is difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Had made my own out of cardboard before buying this. Trust me, the cardboard worked much better. This stuff is OK if you don't have, or can't make, anything else but it only partially seals. The material is too stiff and it's very wavy/wrinkly. Doesn't seal all that well. It's better than nothing if it's all you can find but my cardboard version was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good... At First","review":"When you install this, it looks great and functions well. However, after about 8 months, I noticed it was starting to curl away from the garage door. The sun had dried it out and made its edges start to curl outward. Not only that, it was so dry there were chunks starting to fall off. It didn't last a year before I had to pull it all down. Not sure what else I can try, but this is not the answer in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"wARNING","review":"Cheap plastic wheel/threaded stud.

The music on this album can be viewed as an attempt at uniting the charanga and 1970s \\"Salsa Dura\\" that made Pacheco a salsa superstar with today's more modern sounds and the results are quite good. Unfortunately, this CD got very little airplay (thanks to salsa romantica's total domination of the mainstream salsa market by then) but I nonetheless highly recommend it to anyone who loves swinging salsa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary Reading...","review":"This book is particularly important for young women who are struggling with the competing demands on their time and their identity and those who struggle with ambivalence about their own success. In my experience, that is just about all of us.My daughter recently observed that it should be required reading for every woman starting a new job. I agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waders of the Lost Ark","review":"This book is poignant and RIVETING. The protagonist is as \\"muck\\"rakingly mortal as a Ross Macdonald sleuth and the Delta-country bit parts have the idiosyncrasies of Dashiell Hammett collaborating suspects. The woodpecker himself, whether guilty of existing of not, is as elusive and infuriatingly (intentionally?) mysterious as a John le Carre double agent. And the stakes, a second chance for all of us, to find and preserve the \\"Lord God bird\\" are so heartbreakingly high as to be virtually Biblical."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the swamp with Gallagher","review":"As a life-long-bird lover with limited time to be an active one, this book gave me a great birding adventure. When I closed my eyes after reading,I was there-looking and listening. What can be more enjoyable-especially when you cannot leave the office until the weekend? Whether the logging of swamp land is right or wrong, this book can make all aware of the delicate balance anywhere we live and that we need to consider each move we make and its effect on nature. I thank the author for sharing such an enjoyable adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE definitive story of the rediscovery","review":"THE GRAIL BIRD is the story behind the headlines of the ivory-bill's rediscovery. Gallagher succeeds in conveying all of the emotion behind the pursuit of the ivory-billed woodpecker, so that even a nonbirder will weep when he first encounters this \\"extinct\\" creature. I read the book twice - and sobbed both times.He brings history to life through interviews with those who have seen (or claimed to see) the bird in years past, and through discussions with family members of those had seen the bird but who are now gone. This is a perfect book - part birding adventure, part buddy tale, part sad truth about what we have done to our land, and part fairy tale. It is even part choose-your-own-adventure, in that we all need to take responsiblity for what the ending will be like for this remarkable bird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea Weak Execution","review":"SCARLET TRACES is one of the many stories that follows up on H.G. Wells' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, imagining what happened in Britain a decade or so after the failure of the Martian invasion of Earth, with Martian-derived technologies much in evidence.This is an interesting premise for a story, but alas SCARLET TRACES fails to either explore the idea very thoroughly or construct a good story out of it, building the plot around an \\"evil conspiracy\\" that the reader easily spots as silly: \\"You can't use animals? Bollochs!\\" One might be happier with SCARLET TRACES if the artwork was interesting, but alas it's just second-rate. Readable in an automatic sort of way, but not memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant but Insufficiently Developed","review":"The idea of what happens after Britain wins The War of the Worlds is well conceived and executed. They obtain technivcal knowledge decades, perhaps centuries, ahead, but at a dreadful price. The basic plot is also good. However, the book is simply way too short for the story being told. Wham, bam, it's over. While the characters and plot are promising, their development is minimal. Still, I liked it enough to get the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bunch of songs","review":"How could you not give Tom Jones five stars?

Some of the illustrations to me seemed that they would confuse the average child instead of teach them how babies are made. However the entire book did simplify the entire process of how babies are made in a way that most children would find amuzing and interesting at the same time. This is coming from a senior psychology major at Cal State Northridge, currently studying child development. How babies are made is a hard topic to teach any child and this book does provide a unique aspect of using simple characters and animals to portray this grand event.

I'm pregnant, and I wanted a very basic story of where babies come from to read to our 3 year old son. But this book's pictures were just too graphic, including cutaways of a women's uterus and man's sperm entering, showing a man and woman under the covers, animals mounting each other, etc. This would be appropriate for an older child, but the reviews I read made me think it was appropriate now. Well, not for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for small children","review":"Hurray to the author of this book! Some things in life don't change and how babies get made is one of those things. I didn't want explicit technical pictures. This book provides a platform for the embarrassed parent. The pictures are simple cutouts that explain the process of reproduction. The book begins with flowers and pollination and progresses steadily towards human fertilization. No shocks, no surprises, just simple facts clearly stated. Excellent book. Children are still children and shocking them with a book that they are not prepared to look at is not the answer.

This book was ridiculously lacking in passion and love. It wasn't intense at all, like some people said. I wanted to like this book, but it was so boring! I could not relate to any of these characters because their feelings were never described. And there was so many other characters that were not important to the main plot. Juliet and Ethan were a bit...cold to each other. I could not feel any spark between them.Then one day he stays over her house. And the next morning she wakes up to the phone ringing, and remembers all the sex they had.They had sex? Really? I don't remember that happening. Why didn't Carla write about this?The book wasn't horrible, but it was definitely not something to rave about, like I thought it would be when I read the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking any form of life......","review":"That is the best way to describe this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting. The romances lack any passion. Furthermore, Mailer does a poor job of describing the setting. The book was so poor that I stopped reading it one hundred pages from the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE BOREDOM","review":"This unfortunate book suffers from an acute case of aphoristic intoxication, evidenced in such pithy morsels as: \\"like most cynics he was profoundly sentimetal about sex\\" and \\"our marriage was the meeting of zero and zero.\\"Although such modestly entertaining observations kept me plodding along, the book is a lame attempt at armchair beat philosophizing, ensnarled in a wholly unengaging plot and unbelievably boring characters. I first read about this greatest of books in Joe Ezterhas's biography, and it makes sense that he would consider its shallow machisimo the stuff of masterpieces.Avoid this. Reread Day of the Locust. Recommended for only the most die-hard of Hollywood historians or cultural completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mailer is a bag of wind","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that this novel is lacking any form of life. It is boring and trite and I couldn't finish it either. I usually always finish a book even if I'm not particularly enjoying it but this was beyond endurance. This is the only one of Mailer's novels I have attempted to read. I had seen Mailer interviewed a few times and this book confirmed my suspicion that he is a bag of wind. Mailer is an overblown, immature, egotistical narcissist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and effective","review":"As an athlete, I'm often looking for a way to effectively treat muscle pain. I store these in the freezer for cold therapy. If I need heat, I just simply pop in the microwave. The heat really penetrates and relaxes the muscles. They're comfortable, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand wrap works exactly as described","review":"I bought two of these hand wraps as it seems the arthritis in my hands hits both of them at once. I heat them at the same time and then sit with my hands inside them until the pain subsides. They are a bit smaller than pictured but worked on me as I don't have large hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"sort of okay","review":"Covers only the fingers--that's okay, I knew that from reading other reviews. But it doesn't hold the heat very long, 6-7 minutes max, even after being in the microwave more than a minute and a half. The product is not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blemish","review":"This one is even worse than Royal Astronomy, for very different reasons. Royal Astronomy seemed timid and canned; this sounds derivative and dated. Very disappointing considering how good his stuff was up to this point.Luckily, Duntisbourne Abbots Soulmate, his next album (2007), is/was brilliant. The best electronic music I've heard this decade. I can't think of a single reason to recommend Bilious Paths, though. Best to skip it and pick up DAS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I'm a beginner in DCOM and all I needed to know about DCOM is clearly explained in the book, no function, no parameter,... unexplained. There are few books as good as this one. This is my fist O'Reilly and Thai book, but I'm sure that not the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a good DCOM book? Keep looking.","review":"Would you trust the technical expertise of a programmer who writes this:if (g_hExitEvent == NULL) assert(false);This book is replete with this and other nuggets of technical prowess.The surrounding text is no better. Thai's English syntax is downright odd. His analogies are frequently tortured or nonsensical. All of this distracts the reader from the technical content.There is high praise for that content from my predecessor reviewers, but I thought his presentation was haphazard and unenlightening.I have found previous O'Reilly books quite good, but they did a very disappointing job on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to COM/DCOM.","review":"If you are going to buy one book on COM/DCOM, this should be it. I recommend it that highly. It contains a clear and concise introduction to all the important COM concepts. I also have Don Box's \\"Essential COM\\", but this one is much easier to follow. If you want to quickly come up to speed on COM programming and start writing some code quickly, get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinosaur Paper Chains/A Complete Kit Including 12 Stencils","review":"This book is great for all ages. I bought the book to use with scrapbooking pages, but will also use this as an activity with kids as young as 5 years old. The stencils are large enough that a small kid can use, yet detailed enough to embellish the work that I do. The stencils are easy to cut for a youngster. The paper that is included is elegant for scrapbook pages or for a kid's project. I highly recommend this book for anyone who works with kids and likes to keep them busy. The possibilities are endless. I have seen other 'paper chain' books and they were too complicated for me let alone a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"morrison's worst (worse than invisibles)","review":"this is the worst new x-men volume in grant morrison's run. i almost gave it three stars because the first story-arc has some sick moments (with beak and fly-girl)... but i couldn't do it. first of all, in the first story-arc bishop shows up and you think some hardcore action is gonna come, but it never does...(which isn't really that bad, 'cause the plot is decently suspenseful). BUT then the 2nd story arc comes and its so atrociously bad (art AND writing), that i can't help but give this two stars.this is some of the worst x-men i've read (as bad as claremont when he's bad [which is most of the time])."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relaxor Garment Accessory","review":"Relaxor AM8THIGH Massager Garment arrived as specified.

Horrible product, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but I would think again.","review":"I registered for this because it was so cute! I finally got to use it as my little boy if finally old enough to interact with toys and use the \\"big boy\\" tub. When we started filling the net with toys, the weight would just pull it down. Now don't assume we just loaded this sucker down with toys. We put a rubber ducky (small child size) and some bath time link a doos. Also the spout guard which is adorable, doesn't stay on on all models of faucets. I think the hole is too large in the back. You kinda have to secure it with some strong glue to the tile or stuff it with something to get it more snug against the faucet. We took it back after 8 months of owning it and babies are us actually took it back without a receipt or box. We bought something different(a fish which was even tough to put on so I doubt he will be able to pull it off)and so far so good. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too loose","review":"The guard is very cute, however, it does notstay on the spout and it attracts the child over to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend More for Lasting Quality","review":"I bought this earlier this year. The spout cover did not stay on but the kids seemed to like it as a toy. However, the frog toy bag fell off the wall frequently and got really moldy fast. I washed it several times but it never really seemed to get clean. I think something plastic would be much better for toy storage. I will be purchasing something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these froggies!","review":"This set is so cute and works great. I was a little worried about some of the negative reviews that said the toy bag didn't stick to the side of the shower--but we have a one piece fiberglass shower/tub and it sticks great to that. Maybe the negative reviewers had tile walls or something. You do have to use smaller toys with it or you can't fit them through the top, but that's fine with me. The spout cover is great--fits perfectly on my faucet, keeps my kids from bonking their heads and keeps them from playing with the shower knob thing. Would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT stick","review":"We bought this bath toy organizer several months ago and it has yet to stick to the wall for longer than 20 minutes! The suction cups are horrible. Plus, the mesh is connected in the middle making it pretty difficult to put toys in, especially for my toddler. Larger toys will not fit in on the sides. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it is very cute and my son loved it when we first bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok for a while","review":"It's very difficult to manage all the toys in the bath and I thought this would help. It did for about 2 months then it started to lose its sticking abilities. In addition, the legs of the frog became mildew riddled. I washed it too but it did not all come out. Plus it is kind of small. A helpful hint though, it will stick to glass doors better then a tile wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but very cute","review":"This is a very cute set & the price is right. The spout cover doesn't fit over my bath spout perfectly so I have to take it off while filling the tub, then put it back on before the kids get in, but that's no big deal. The toy net stays put on the tub wall very well, the only drawback being that it doesn't hold very many toys. Over all, if your kids don't have a ton of toys & you're looking for something cute & cheap, this is a good bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the $ for fans...","review":"This single for Ape Dos Mil is worth the money simply for the enhanced video. The live songs are, to be honest, only fair. they do not capture the intensity of their live set. I personally do not buy singles unless they have good B-sides (I was hoping the would release their cover of Quicksand's \\"Dine Alone\\"...) but this is an exception because of the high regard i hold for this band. A must for fans, but their Cosmo single was much better...Overall - 4.5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"Behind a rather dull looking cover is an extraordinary book. It really has little to do with meditation as we think of it with the breathing exercises and such, but it tries to go beyond these techniques to awaken us to something far richer. The authors are very honest about what it takes to grow in awareness. These ideas will not appeal to those who desire immediate spiritual experiences and change. However, with proper motivation, discipline and patience, one can discover real change as the integration of the personality and God, through the higher self, begins to unfold. This book is not perfect, but it can serve as a very important launching point to those serious about increasing their awareness level in life and are not just after a quick feel-good spiritual experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Major work","review":"I've worked on SoC's and do not consider myself an expert but this book is not worth the money. From the title you would expect this book to be about design and test of SoC's. The author does not present any new or insightful design techniques or testing strategys that a person who has designed an ASIC before does not know. He covers basic rules in very general terms with out real specific details. The books seem to be just an ad-hoc hodge podge of every day asic guidelines that are summerized in 200+ pages. Even if you have never designed an ASIC before this book would not help you it is way to general and very vague. I would invest in talking to an ASIC designer in one's company. This books is not worth the money even for the new ASIC designer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinosaur Dreams","review":"I bought this book in hardcover 20 years or so ago for my now 27 year old son.

It's just not a good design - very unreliable. Next problem, the motor started making noises after only a few months of continuous operation. Eventually the motor burned up completely after only 5 months of use. Seems like this unit was not designed to be run continuously.

Once a lyric coloratura and the original Cunegonde in Bernstein's Candide, Ms. Cook has become (in her 70s) a true diva, blessed with a velvety, warm sound. Every note has meaning. Her high B-flat on \\"Ice Cream\\" is still the envy of any soprano today. Everyone should whistle after hearing the superb performances on this CD. Even better, though, is the experience of having been in the concert hall for the live performance. Brava, Ms. Cook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing intro to the body of work of a true master","review":"When I first bought tickets for the 'Mostly Sondheim' show on tour (in San Francisco) I figured it couldn't be too bad. Besides, I had only been exposed to a few of his songs (Anyone Can Whistle, Losing My Mind...) and had only seen \\"A Little Night Music\\". On the way out of the theater I immediately picked up this recording of the program. It is truly amazing. I immediately began listening to it and have barely put it down in the last few months. Furthermore, my Sondheim CD collection increased in size from an unflattering zero to five (and it's still growing)! This is an amazing introduction to the works of Stephen Sondheim, who is now my favorite modern musical composer). Buy this now if you don't already have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"... and I love Barbara Cook","review":"This recording is a disappointment for me. It is not her best work, and Malcolm Gets is uninspired. My biggest complaint however is the engineering of the recording.

The voice, the acoustics, the sound was amazing. I particularly enjoyed the conversations between songs and wished for more. Malcolm Gets (sorry I never heard of him before) was also excellent, a wonderful voice for Sondheim. I couldn't wait for each new song, Ms Cook's rendition of \\"Send in the Clowns\\" was amazing, her voice just improves with age.My only complaint with the album, was the ending and the obvious encores. I would like to have heard more audience reaction and conversation. (Listen to Judy's album, it seems it would go on and on. Of course then, maybe Barbara's would be a THREE CD set. Come to think if it................that's not a bad idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was There -- And This is Close","review":"Having listened to all her CDs and seen her at at the Hotel Carlyle hotel in NYC, I literally ran to Carnegie Hall to get tickets when this concert was announced. Being there in person was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Even waiting outside on the sidewalk for the doors to open was an experience; the feeling inside the hall was electric. So I eagerly awaited the CD, and it doesn't disappoint. Barbara Cook is a remarkable performer, and this CD shows she's still willing to take risks ... with her choice of guest (Malcolm Gets), her choice of songs, and her willingness to revisit old chestnuts with a new tempo or interpretation. A friend turned to me at the end of \\"Bring in the Clowns\\" (after he had wiped away his tears) and said \\"It's as if I've never heard that song before.\\" BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dopeness","review":"I really like this TubePre machine.

I loved the author's lyrical voice and amazing eye for detail.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Maybe I should have given the novel a better chance, but only made it through the first two chapters. A previous reviewer described the work as \\"high literature,\\" and I have to strongly disagree. The prose seemed unpolished, and ultimately boring. It's certainly not a book that \\"grabs\\" one from the beginning. I felt the character development inadequate - I didn't get a good feel of who these people were, or a part of their world. It came across to me a collection of cliches, stereotypes. Maybe the book gets better as it goes, but I didn't feel it was worth my time to keep reading. Not enough sense of mystery from the outset."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"I didn't care for this rambling plot at all. Too much detail trying to get inside everyones minds.

It looked like Wylie was the only one that learned a valuable lesson from the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Detail","review":"This book had way too many details and took too long to lead up to the major plot. The back describes an \\"explosive moment\\", which turns out to be a so-so moment in the last few pages of the book. The entire first 90% of the book is useless details about the characters.I only kept reading to find out what the explosive moment was, only to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this!","review":"This was a major disappointment. I am a great fan of any \\"Vatican\\" novel and will read some mediocre stuff to get my fix. This, however, did not reach that standard! It is the first novel I have been tempted to give up when only half-way through. As for the suggestion that a bunch of feminist-minded nuns are trying to change the church, this compliments the book too much. There is a dream story that keeps appearing throughout the story but adds nothing. Page after page of some medieval drivel. Comparisons to Morris West - kidding? You might say I didn't like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Disappointing","review":"Based on the raving reviews here and from a friend, I purchased and read this book. I kept reading, waiting for the cliches to give way to whatever people raving about and, frankly, I never found it. It's not a bad book, but everything in it has appeared in other papal conclave-types of novels and usually done somewhat better. If you have not read \\"Shoes of the Fisherman,\\" \\"The Last Conclave,\\" and others of the genre, read this and enjoy it. If you have read them, you will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Summer Skip It Read","review":"The plot is transparent. The characters are straight out of an HBO movie. The only value to this is the history of the conclave and the Vatican and all of that was better told in Shoes of the Fisherman or even in Angels and Demons. This is simply not a good read - even for the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for a long flight to San Jose, CA","review":"Somewhat interesting, but I should have known that there was trouble brewing when I spotted a typographical error in the second paragraph of the dust jacket of the book. The main character's name was mis-spelled. The book reads like a dream...disjointed, rambling, and out of focus...probably best forgotten the next day. Good for a flight across country, but only if you have already read the day-old Tribune that you found at the airport. This book seemed to have been created from the cuttings of the editing floor of another book and stitched together with a very fine piece of twine. Two stars if you have little else to read on your journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Anti-Catholic Garbage","review":"If you enjoyed having the conservative Catholics as the bad guys in The Accidental Pope, the Day of Confession, and Angels and Demons, then this book is for you. However, if you think that such portrayals completely distort the conservative (that is, the Catholic) point of view, then don't buy this crap. As with all such books, he never gives the traditionalists' points of view or arguments. Rather, they are all simplified into power questions and are made heartless--you know, heartless conservatives, like John Paul II. Sad. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, if you skip the climax","review":"This book is a good read throughout, except for the climax. Without divulging the ending, be warned that the justification for the climax is totally insufficient. It was so weak that I checked to be sure that my copy had no missing pages. A major disappointment.Also, you should be advised that there are a couple of especially gruesome scenes, bad enough to burn images into your memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preety Good Mostly","review":"For the most part I enjoyed this book. I found at times I couldn't put it down but had to continue to the next chapter. Then there were some times when I actually wanted to skip sections, especially during dream sequences.

A young boy being forced into the military to fight off bad people? Yeah, rip-off. The robots are the poorman's Mobile Suit. Pathetic.The storyline? What storyline? The series simply doesn't make sense -- and don't tell me that I don't \\"understand\\" it. It makes no sense.Gainax has single-handedly ruined Anime and they continue to do so.

Shingi is developed in a much better way, and more likable. Rei definitely got her own spot light that is well deserved. The best thing i like about this remake is that there is no more useless physiological bull crap (like the last few episodes of the original Eva series). A lot more action a lot cooler battle. 2.22 is much better then 1.11 because its action nature. 1.11 setup the story up for 2.22. The only down side I can think of is that some angel battle are on the short side, but never the less it is still very cool.Best to watch this on a really big screen (65\\"+), and with surround sound.

Plan to return the DVD as i dont think I can go thru it again. Also, it seemed that either Vance was having a bad day or he wasnt happy to be there - it was de-motivating to see him almost sulk.

It is not challenging; I barely work up a sweat. The music is not well organized, and there are always gaps of silence between songs. But, what bothers me more than anything is that Mary Kay appears to have gained about 50 pounds since the last video. I cannot seem to focus on anything in this tape other than her obesity. Seeing her makes me realize that this exercise program is not effective for everyone. Mary Kay teaches this program, yet she has gained a substantial amount of weight. Seeing her in this video has prompted me to search for new workout programs. Furthermore, Leslie cannot stand to simply walk and allow Mary Kay to lead the second mile. She is constantly doing things behind Mary Kay's back to draw attention to herself. It's very annoying. Finally, poor Mary Kay is dressed in drab gray and black. They could not have made her look worse if they have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT Buy this","review":"Waste of money. so slow. Its like walk at home for grannies.

Another great one! Mile 1 and 3 sneak up on you in terms of working harder than you realized. The hand weights bump it up to be a great muscle/strength training workout. Mary Kay's 2nd mile is fast paced and fun!On the \\"down side\\", if there is one. There are a few spots where the music doesn't cue up very fast so you have a short time of walking without music. It's not a big deal and doesn't affect your workout but doesn't seem as smooth as most of Leslie's workouts. The great workout more than offsets that minor thing!This is a good workout for several levels of fitness. You can always ramp it up by putting more into it, but starts out slow enough that a beginner wouldn't be overwhelmed. 2 (sweaty) thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I highly recommend this Leslie Sansone dvd!

It was challenging but not so difficult that I couldn't keep up.My only criticism is that after doing such a brisk second mile, the pace of the third mile seems a bit slow so I just walked a little bit faster than Leslie was in the video.I found the music cheesy but it has a good pace and will keep you going. The background setting felt tranquil, like a yoga or pilates studio.Great video.

But for those who know this & wonder why no season 2 yet it's cause the creator/writer is taking time off due to having been pregnant, but from what I understand the plan is for a season 2.

It did not, however, live up to my expectations. Sure, there was a lot of violence, but that didn't really get real until episode 6 or so. Character development was weak. The creators tried to put in bunch of plot twists or tried to cram too much into 12 episodes, but the result was a hurried, sloppy story with little resolution or explanation.If you're down with 12 episodes of a kid crying about how he can never do anything and his strange crush/brother-sister relationship with a mentally handicapped girl, then you might justify the $40-60 pricetag.

I wanted a shower like head that puts out a large volume so I don't have to stand a long time with a cheap head that does knock your plants down unless you cut the volume back to a slow mist that takes a long time.

While working on his novel, the writer sees visions of a beautiful woman on the stairs. Who is she, and what do the other tenants know about her?I'd find this installment a lot more interesting if it didn't so closely mirror last season's \\"Dreams in a Witch House\\" episode, which also featured a student moving into a creepy house with strange disturbances and eccentric tenants. \\"Witch House\\" definitely had better execution, with a more compelling story and a tragic ending. By contrast, \\"Valerie\\" seems to offer a formulaic reveal of its plot twists, and the ending is neither tragic, scary, nor ironic, just...absurd. The moments of gore feel obligatory. And Christopher Lloyd, though welcomed, plays the same screwy character we've seen him do before.More of a disappointment that an outright failure.

He starts seeing--naturally--Valeria on the stairs. I won't tell you anymore than this. You can waste one hour of your life just like I did.

About mid-day, one slight light puff of wind came through for just 15 seconds, and the EZ UP tent folded up and caved in on me.

He devoutly sticks by his wife who does nothing but criticizes him, yells @ him and goes in silence to her self-loathing, hate the world thoughts in which we the readers are forced to read throughout the entire book!

While she is ignoring her advice at home she is about to have an affair with a man when his wife coincidentally comes to her office for advice. Our hero therapist can't wait to run to this lady's husband and tell him everything that his wife said. What is amazing is that it never even crosses her mind that to pass on this information would be highly unethical - as having an affair with the husband of a client would also be. The main puzzle in this book is trying to determine who is the most addled, the main character or her serial killer loving sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, easy read","review":"I've always like Joy Fielding's books.

Her characters were very real, very human. Contrary to another review, I did not find Kate Sinclair stupid, she was guilty of something human beings are guilty of doing, not wanting to see the reality of her family's faults. The fact that Kate knew and did not admit it to herself just made her more human, being a therapist does not mean that one does not have their own personal demons to deal with. This book was not only a suspense novel but it was also about real human beings dealing with real family relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid main character, but others realistic and believeable","review":"I completely agree with the long review preceding this one. Kate Sinclair's character was too stupid for words. However, I do want to be fair and point out that other characters in the book are very well-drawn. My grandmother had Alzheimer's and was EXACTLY like Kate's mother. I know a teenager just like Sara. Jo Lynn's adult behavior is typical of a victim of childhood incest.Why on earth the main character was made to be such a fool is beyond me.

This editor must have been out to lunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book !","review":"I've never read any of Joy Fielding's novels before, so this was a surprise for me. Ms. Fielding writes like a real person, her characters worm their way into your heart by the end of the first chapter. The plot was interesting enough to keep me wanting to turn the pages, and exciting enough to have me thinking about it when I wasn't reading it. I enjoyed her descriptions of life with teenagers in the house,and I even fell in love with her eccentric, almost-crazy sister. Who can NOT relate to how she feels when she almost has an affair? I just felt the author was down to earth, making the novel an easy read and a real bestseller in my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book about life's bizarre twists and choices.","review":"I identified with Kate Sinclair. Caught in an imperfect world that she tries to make perfect, she fights to come up for air as she deals with an demented mother, rebellious teenager, troubled clients who expect fixes and her distracted husband. Heading her list of problems is her flamboyant sister who becomes the numer one fan for a serial killer. Reality is bizarre and cruel; Kate seeks a fantasy relationship with an old flame, Robert. Just as she decides to have an affair with him, Robert's wife shows up for counseling, a comic moment as well as a possible turning point. We long to save Kate and make decisions for her as she strives for ordered sanity but longs to be swept off her feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Fielding's best works","review":"Normally, I look forward to anything Joy Fielding writes and expect that once I start one of her books I don't put it down until it's done. This book was weak, completely unbelievable and definitely a disappointment compared to her other tomes and proves that you can't buy a novel simply because of the author's name. The protagonist was a wimp and should have her license revoked. Maybe I listen to Dr. Laura Schlessinger too much, but I would hope that someone who is trained in human behavior would have a much less dysfunctional family than Kate Sinclair was stuck with (or enabled). I found myself muttering, \\"Yeah, right\\" or \\"what an idiot\\" frequently. I was relieved to finish the book and instantly relegated it to the garage sale pile (which is saying a lot considering that I NEVER throw books away).

Basically all the lady has to do is breathe and she's won you over. However, her singing on this romantic outing is plodding and (inappropriately) mannered.Even in the most anemic moods this album would be tedious. Her phrasing here is overbearing and replete with long-winded bellows, especially on the drawn-out codas. It's heavy man. Heavy like a burden.These are literate torch songs, but with her twisting, loop-de-loop phrasing she deflects attention away from the mood and lyrics, and draws attention to more trivial matters, namely her acrobatic larynx.There's \\"making a song your own\\"...and there's downright annoying. With all her warbling the recording nearly sounds warped. As much as I love her voice, I couldn't wait for these epics-in-slow-motion to end. If the producer had reigned her in a bit...\\"cut the crap Rebecca\\", this album could have been a giant.

I have tried pretty much every type of night guard on the market over the years and I must say this was by far the worst. I tried it for an entire month before giving up and going back to something else. The main issues I see with the item include: its not nearly as customizable as it should be, the bit wings are too thick, and all the pressure from grinding is isolated on just a few teeth. This last issue causes tooth pain and not just the usual soreness. Purchase a custom dental guard from your dentist if you can afford it. Otherwise, buy something you can boil then carefully customize yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushes teeth out of alignment","review":"it does work if you are wide awake and using it but its useless then. its meant for nighttime, and if you lay down on your side, then your head against the pillow will bend the rubber and cause it to press against your teeth which will eventually lead to your teeth being pushed out of alignment, similar to ill fitting bracers. this is a bad product, and for TMJ i recommend a contour pillow. dont waste your time on cheap night guards. either lay down the money for a professional one, get a less stiff pillow, or talk to your dentist. dont get this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy with this!","review":"The additional flap irritated my gums after just 3 nights so much that I could not wear it anymore.

However, it does tend to shift and twist sometimes so that I'm biting the side of the product or don't have anything at all between my teeth, so I can't give it 5 stars. Still, overall it works better than any of the boiled dental guards or the other low-profile no-boil night guards that I've had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, not so good design (for me anyway)","review":"This was my first dental guard. It is adjustable. Although it took me a while to find the best setting. It felt very uncomfortable in the beginning but I kept trying to get used to it. I could feel that my jaws were being trained to relax. I also liked the material it is made of. However, there is either something wrong with its design or I should have tried a different model. The biggest issue was that the side wings were rubbing my gums around the gap between the two parts of the side wings. I had to stop using the guards for a few days, treat my gums with a gel that's usually used by people who wear dentures to heal gums. I kept trying a few times until my husband decided to fix it with boiling water and spoiled it completely. Regardless, I wouldn't be using it anyway. One of the reviewers for this product had mentioned same problem that I have had. I think it does not suit people with sensitive gums and, possibly, smaller jaw(?) size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best damn mouthguard ever.","review":"I inherited grinding my teeth at night from my Dad.

So I was told to try this first."},{"rating":"1","title":"uncomfortable, maybe a fake on top of that","review":"I usually buy dental guards from the grocery store but the price tempted me to try these ones so I purchased them from this vendor. They are really different looking from what I previously purchased from anywhere else and I started to wonder if they are even the real \\"sleep right\\" brand dental guards or not. The markings on the guard are not in English and the whole look is different than what I previously purchased. It is a shame if they are repackaging some generic dental guard and selling it as Sleep Right. I will not purchase from them again. Also, they are very uncomfortable, the bite plates are very hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrapes my Cheeks","review":"The outer sides of the device contain the adjustment slider for the bite pad. It has relatively rough edges. I wake up with an irritated swollen spot inside each cheek where those edges rubbed against me. Other than that issue the product works great. It stays in place for me well. I don't have a grinding problem but a clenching and chomping problem, so that might be the difference. I will try it one more night. This will be the third. Then I will try to get a refund if it continues. I'm not optimistic. My cheek is already feeling the leftover soreness from just putting it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Even though I read the reviews that this was bulky i decided to try it anyways.

The adjustable notches are of no use as it feels the same no matter what you do. A proper fit and acceptable comfort level is impossible.

I am a heavy teeth grinder and find that this product is worth the money spent. The paddles that cover the teeth are stiffer than the previous guard I purchased and I'm hoping that it protects my teeth better. Since it is different in feel than my last one it is going to take time for me to get used to it but I don't feel there will be a problem once I do. I have never purchases a guard from my dentist because I refuse to spend the money.

I find that it is comfortable to wear, night or day, even compared to the extremely expensive \\"custom\\" ones that I get from the dentist. But soon I was finding it on my pillow every night. In fact, it didn't stay in very long at all. I got the low profile because my mouth is small. It doesn't need to be boiled, but it is adjustable by moving the vinyl platforms back or forward in the notches. I still think that, for $30, it is worth a try, since other people have had good luck with it. This is a infinitesimal fraction of what I have paid out to dentists in my life, and I still have Temporal Mandibular Joint Dysfunction!Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me gag. Couldn't wear overnight.","review":"I did not like this product because it was so floppy and unstructured and the one-size-fits-all bite pieces were so wide that it was hitting the back of my tongue and made me gag and even with the adjusted connector on the smallest setting was still sticking out of my mouth. It was awkward and I couldn't sleep with it in and even when I fell asleep with it in, I took it out in my sleep. It is durable and flexible and even adjustable, but I would not recommend it for small mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"dental guard","review":"I have tmj and must use night guards so I won't chip my front teeth.

They will not continue to replace it if it is after the 90 day from your orginal receipt. I get 5 weeks with this mouthguard and it has to be replaced. They refused to replace it. It is poorly made if you spend $70 and it lasts 5 weeks. They also told me I was the only one who continually chewed through their mouthpiece.

After taking it out, I notice I hold my jaw in a more relaxed position without putting my teeth together. It's like it's training me how to be.So far, I haven't been able to sleep through a whole night with it in, and I wear it mostly around the house during waking hours. The description says: \\"Preferred for daytime wear\\". I wouldn't consciously wear this outside the home, it makes me look like I have a severe under-bite!I can see how it may shift teeth, as some other reviewers have noticed. My teeth do feel different after wearing it for awhile. As for it hurting gums (as some have complained), you may just need to make it smaller and/or move the band up or down to a more comfortable spot. That's what I did, and I don't feel it on my gums any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexistent Customer Service","review":"The guard didn't fit well because it was huge, if you are over 7 feet never mind. The real reason why I am writing this review is different. Sleep Right is supposed to have a sort of warranty in which if the product doesn't work out, you can just email it back along with the receipt and get a refund. Great idea! they now have my guard, my receipt, and my money! Good luck in calling customer service, I don't know why they have that policy if they have no intent on following it. Had I known this I would have just cut the loss short and not bothered mailing them back that useless product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for me!","review":"My dentist recco'd getting a nightguard and said try the ones at pharmacy before speind $$$ on a custom one. I tried this and it took 2-3 nights to get used to but it seems to work now. Keep in mind you have to adjust it to fit and then wear it to make sure you have adjusted it correctly...so it may take a few days to get it right. For me, Its comfortable and it is working - my jaw is not sore when I wake up...a good product. It was onsale for about $30 but I know the reg price is about $40. That is a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Secure-Comfort or Dura-Comfort version instead","review":"Tried this night guard and it kept falling out in the night. Finally woke up one day and it was broken in two (where the adjustable bite pads attach to the guard is the weakest spot). This guard doesn't stay in place well enough for a side sleeper to use. Maybe if you sleep on your back or stomach it would work. I am using the Sleep Right Secure-Comfort now and am having better luck, the extra wings that it has helps to keep the guard from falling out or moving around in the night. These are very comfortable night guards, much better than the boil type in my opinion. Couldn't get to sleep with the boil types, they are too bulky and uncomfortable.Keep your receipt if you buy any of the Sleep Right products - there is a 3 month warranty (6 month on the Dura-Comfort version)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"We used the Dental Guard you boil to get a perfect fit. This contraption was supposed to be better then boiling. Riiight. Those lego-block sides scraped the sides of her mouth and she tossed it after 2 nights.

DONT BUY THIS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable fit but it caused my teeth to shift","review":"I bought this night guard to use while I was saving to have my dentist create a new replacement custom guard for me. This product is pretty good for the price. I found it much more comfortable than the ones that must be boiled. It stayed in place as I slept. It's easy to clean. It prevented my teeth from grinding against each other. Overall, I was initially very happy with it.Unfortunately, I had to discontinue use after less than a month due to the uneven pressure from the bite guards causing the teeth directly in front of the bite guards to shift. I would wake with sore teeth and a bite that wouldn't correctly align. Generally by the end of the day my bite would seem to work itself back into place, but I worried about long term effects so I stopped using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost fits perfect","review":"I like it better than the larger model with the bite wings and I remember ordering without flavor although it came with mint flavoring..

Like others have reported, it moved my teeth--not only did it do nothing for my pain from clenching, but now I have an open bite (none of my teeth touch any more, except the four back molars which didn't make contact with the nightguard). Now I have to undergo extremely costly, painful, and lengthy orthodontic treatment to try to correct the damage. (The model the orthodontist made of my teeth shows a clear gap in the spaces where the two rubber planes fit when I wore the mouthguard.)I'd advise others to avoid this nightguard at all costs.

I had been using it at night for only about a week when I noticed my front top teeth were pointing inwards towards my mouth! I couldn't close my jaw properly. It was disturbing. Luckily a few nights of not using it seems to have let my mouth readjust to its usual self. Even aside from the terrifying insight that my teeth were wandering, I found the edges of the guard too high. They rubbed too much into my cheeks and were causing problems with the skin there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I had never used a guard before this one and other reviews seemed good on this product. I am not impressed with it. The dental guard does not stay in my mouth at night. So that makes it a total waste of money.

They left my gums feeling sore and bruised and I couldn't wear it the next night. I'm female, with what I'd guess is an average mouth size. My husband also tried one of these, but after a friend said that their dentist-made mouth guard has lasted many years, he decided to go that route. I wouldn't recommend this product, but if you want to try it, females (at least) should go for the low profile version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product with potential but poor customer service","review":"This night guard is the first non custom-made guard to have worked for me. But after two weeks of daily use, the bite pads broke in two. When I called SleepRight customer service, I was told to mail them my guard and receipt and they will send me a replacement. I did that more than a month ago and I have not heard from them since. Needless to say, I am more than disappointed that SleepRight does not honor their warranty promises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked off a piece of my tooth","review":"I just want to warn anyone about this product based on my own experiences. My teeth slipped off this product during the third night that I used it and I ended up cracking off a piece of my molar. Needless to say, I was not happy. There is nothing to keep the product in your mouth, and so, if you grind your teeth (which is I think the point of the mouth guard) it can slip off in your mouth. The company gave me a refund and \\"officially\\" claimed that they never heard of this happening before. Yet, one person at the company had previously slipped and told me that someone else had a claim similar to mine. Just based on the design of the product, it is easy to see how it might happen to many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard","review":"This product, like many of Sleepright's dental guards, is too hard for comfortable use. In an effort to make the bite pads more durable, Sleepright has made them so hard that they are extremely uncomfortable to wear. Apparently, Sleepright doesn't understand that when in use the bite pads must have some give to them so that contact is spread out on the surface of the teeth that are in contact with the bite pad. Instead, with the bite pads being so hard, pressure is concentrated on only a few points and causes a great amount of discomfort for people like me that clench their teeth when they sleep.I should mention that the initial Sleepright dental gaurds (from serveral years ago) were made of a softer material and were a lot more comfortable to use. Sleepright must have gotten too many returns of the dental guards having been bitten through and they decided to reduce the returns by making a harder bite guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"I had spent several hundreds of dollars on a dentist-made guard but was never happy with the fit. So, I decided to try one of the other options out there. I was drawn to this product because I have a smaller mouth and thought it would be perfect for me. It turns out that it wasn't quite what I thought it would be. It held my mouth open at an awkward angle, so my jaw ended up being more sore in the morning than without it. Also, the strap ended up bothering my gums. While I think the concept of this product was great, it still needs to be tweaked before I will buy it again.I ended up finding one that fit better: Dr. Brux. It's a lot more expensive (runs $49.99 - $69.99) but I am extremely happy with it. It seems like it would be more bulky, but I find it is more comfortable than any other night guard I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't stay in my mouth","review":"I don't know whether this is me or else but as said I cannot keep this in site and therefore use it, the taste of it is also disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"this product is too big for my mouth and is very hard to sleep with it in my mouth i will not purchase again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dura Comfort Dental Night Guard","review":"Sleepright Dura Comfort NO BOIL Dental Night GuardThis product was amazing.

Then, worst of all, the casing apparently leaked and after going to all that trouble to take a full roll of pictures, we ended up with 4 discolored, double exposed pictures and none of the others came out at all. On the pictures we did get, the use of the flash didn't seem to matter at all -- they were still pretty dark.The Kodak cameras by comparison were great.

Now reading the other reviews I suspect they have a manufacturing default which renders them useless. Neither camera could advance the film properly, so that I only got 5 and 8 shots out of the two of them. It looks like you are taking the pictures as it advances the numbers on the top, but in reality you only end up shooting shot after shot over the same piece of film.

Unfortunately has the very bad habit of leaving rubber on those clothes. By rubber I mean the type that becomes part of the sport jacket or shirt (i.e., becomes ingrained). This is especially the case if your computer bag is heavy, you have to walk long distances and you wear light colored clothing. Had to get rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of limited use","review":"There is a small number of good uses for this pad, primarily for something that absolutely has to be supported on your shoulder, for a limited period, and which you won't want to shift around. As noted by others, its soft rubber catches on hair and clothing and it is awkward to shift around: in order to slide it forward or back, it has to be off the shoulder; getting onto either shoulder requires setting the pad in place and only then letting it take up the load--which means that shoulder-to-shoulder transfers require some dexterity. Also, contrary to the manufacturer's specs, it doesn't really accommodate a 2\\" strap unless that strap is fairly light and flexible; it does not, for instance, work with the 2\\" strap of my Timbuk2 computer bag or larger messenger bag. And it is also problematic with narrow, thin straps, which don't really stay in place all that well. I tend to leave it in my shoulder-carried \\"suiter\\" bag for those times when my gate is really far from the airport exit."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great...","review":"This product sounds promising.

You see her try to stop a thief which in the end leads to a teriffic and terrifing journey into the uncharted South. She will follow Orien, who has won her heart, where ever their fortune will lead them; To slavery and beyond... As you read this book you are pulled into Burle's land and her story"},{"rating":"2","title":"A young woman's review","review":"Of all the books in Cynthia Voigt's Kingdom series, \\"on Fortune's Wheel\\" has always been my favorite. It is a very good story about growing up. Voigt introduces Birle as a rather immature young woman with a lot of growing up to do. She has promised to marry Muir, and she isn't ready. Even she realizes this when she meets Orien. Her stubborn insistence that he allow her to serve him as he journeys away from the kingdom into the unknown proves the be the very thing that leads to her gaining the knowledge she needs to properly grow up. As a slave, she learns that life was not so bad with Nan as a mother figure. By the time she manages to escape that life she has learned the value of hard work and friendship. I think it is because of those hard earned lessons that she is able to win Orien's heart in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Fortune's Wheel","review":"Cynthia Voigt's description of the relationship between Inkeeper's Daughter (Birle), and an ambitous Lord (Orien) left me wanting more of a romance story, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this account of their adventures together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written with bad morals","review":"This book is well written, with a good story line.

Chuck Austen, although he has shown some talent on books like \\"Superman: Metropolis,\\" is totally wrong for this series. Iceman and Polaris are written entirely out of character, Havok's relationship with \\"Nurse Annie,\\" which bordered on the necrophilic to begin with, just went into plain goofy at this point, and Austen went to great lengths to essentially cut out the heart of Nightcrawler, one of the few characters in comics to devoutly express any religious faith whatsoever. This isn't an X-Men I want to read, and I'm gone as long as Austen is around. Thank Heavens we still have Grant Morrison writing \\"New X-Men\\"... for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unholy","review":"Chuck Austen has definitely achieved much. He was terrible to start with; but he's surpassed all sorts of boundaries. It's like he's trying to prove something.And this is him at his absolute worst. This story makes no sense, to begin with. (The following will reveal some of the story; but trust me: you don't want to read this garbage, anyway.) The church of Humanity, run by a nun (who was a man, a few issues ago), uses Kurt to reenact a scene from Protestant mythos, to scare Catholics away from the Catholic church. With exploding communion wafers.And the other stories included are no better. Believe me. Run. Don't look back.The artwork is no better, by the way. Phillip Tan struggles grasp the basics and fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven art, Poor Story","review":"Since Austen's run on the book started, it has gotten steadily worse, so it shouldn't be a surprise that this, the third collection gets a one-star rating. The artists are Ron Garney, who's capable of some good work, but is not at all at his best here, and Philip Tan, who might be good with more practice. As usual, the plots are contrived, the characterization randomly changes to fit these plots and the dialogue is some of the worst I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, true X-men fans!","review":"The character of Sammy is one of the highlights of this story arc, but any REAL X-men fan should RUN!

The songs added on this go 'round are \\"Will You Marry Me\\" (why yes, Paula, I will), \\"One or the Other\\", and \\"Ain't never Gonna Give You Up\\".Right from the get go, these songs leap out of the speakers and are just in your face. The production is busy, lots of things to pick out and latch onto with each listen, but the important thing is you can dance to it.And then there's Paula her self... Ah. The greatest voice in the world? No, but perfect for these songs. What she lacks in technique, she makes up for in spunk, very infectious.These songs are as catchy as a cold.

Cannon tells of incidents but is very chary of dates and obviously did no particular research for the book--he just told his secretary things and his secretary arranged them in a roughly chronolgical order. There is of course not a footnote nor a bibliography. Cannon glories in being a standpatter, and is opposed to anything new. He deprecated Wilson giving the State of the Union address in person because it had not been so done for a hundred years.

Also feels sturdy in your hands. It doesn't eat batteries-actually they last forever. Also it is fast, you don't wait forever in between pictures(I would say 4 seconds on high quality is tops) Only problems I have noticed is that in certain lighting conditions(ie inside with artificial lights) you must change the lighting filter to indoor(even though it has a setting of \\"auto\\"), can be troublesome.

I can even print clear 4x6 photos using the economy setting! I also have the new Mustek GSmart 350 camera. It is only a 640x480 camera & prints beautiful 4x6 pictures and 5x7's! The key to using these cameras is using all the features in the menu for settings. I also have an HP camera that does beautiful pictures but doesn't have as many settings to help enhance the pictures. Another plus for the Mustek MDC-800 is the ability to print larger photos with a smaller resolution than the HP. I guess Mustek uses a different type of lense then the HP.

Yes, all these styles in one album. And does it work? Hmmmmm, not very well. Most of this music has been done before and better by bands like Nine Inch Nails, Massive Attack or Prodigy, so Rico has nothing all that new to offer. \\"Sanctuary Medicines\\" provides some experimentalism at parts, yet it becomes derivative anyway and fails to impress. There are some good songs here nonetheless, like the enticing single \\"Smokescreen\\" or the desperate and dark \\"Float\\". Still, for the most part this effort is not very memorable or innovative and ends up being another uneven rock album.Nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap.","review":"It's not as advertised.

The historical innaccuracies are too numerous to even attempt to list. This film is surprisingly generous to the dreaded historical \\"antichrist.\\" His well documented peculiarities including perverse sexual tastes and cruelty as well as his obsessive belief in his divine artistic gifts are largely glossed over. So this movie is not only innaccurate, it is also a snoozefest. The focus on a relationship he had with a slave takes the bulk of the expositional time preventing more interesting elements of the story and his character from developing. Maybe hollywood will give nero the big budget treatment he deserves in the future. I would actually rate this one 1 and a half stars because the production is not bad and the cast are not bad. The movie fails more from the conceptual basis it rests on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I learned nothing about Nero\`s life from watching this movie.

This is an historical drama about the Roman emperor Nero. It suffers from not knowing whether Nero was a bad guy or a good guy gone astray and spends most of its time developing a silly romance that comes entirely from the not very fertile imagination of the writers and none at all from history. Production values are generally high with some good acting at times, but the script is plain silly.

However, I could rate it no higher than 2 stars because of how altered and almost sanctified the portrayal of Nero's life and reign actually were. I mean, from what I've always read...he was always nuts, not only persecuted Christians but declared himself the enemy of God, etc. Here, we're forced to believe that he was some sort of victim and succombed to the pressure of bad choices only to be \\"redeemed\\" in the end.

I wonder what the Italians think oftheir \\"home grown\\" TV mini-series IMPERIUM which has so far spawned \\"Augustus\\" and \\"Nero\\"? There is more historical inaccuracy in these two films than almost all the previous Hollywood style epics put together.

The film doesn't get to the real Nero, an insane, cruel and paranoid tyrant. Half of the bad things he ever did are not mentioned, and none of the good things he did are mentioned.

It's too late in the game to invest in a new brand of bottles as my twins should be done with bottle in the next couple of months, so I will just replace these as needed. We loved these bottles for the fact that our girls rarely got gas once we found the right bottle and formula. Too bad this part is really hard to clean and keep clean! If it weren't for that, these bottles & inserts would have gotten 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to clean","review":"After cleaning these internal pieces for a year, I would not buy these inserts or the bottles again.

We have been using them since she was bout 2 months, and she's now 15 months. For our next baby, though, I plan to use Advent or anther brand. This part in particular grows mold, so I have had to buy them over and over again. There's a little dimple type thing in the middle that you can't clean under, and it becomes gross. If you only have a few bottles, and wash them right away, you're probably fine. However, my husband and I both work, so we have 9 bottles, and wait until they are all dirty to run the dishwasher.

Kia Asamiya, I understand, is a superstar in Japan, but his style simply does not fit the X-Men. Characters are blocky, noses are pointy and costumes are simply ugly. Archangel goes through a transformation and gains a new \\"power\\" that makes absolutely no sense in the context of the character and his sudden, inexplicable attraction to Husk is just weird. That's another of Austen's weaknesses on this title -- every female character seems to serve no other purpose than to pine over one of the male characters.And the mutant \\"werewolves\\"? Seen it before. Call me back when a new writer starts bringing this series back up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Reading","review":"These issues contain some very poor characterization, plotting, dialogue and art. The story involves extremely uninteresting mutant werewolves, who, defying logic, are involved in Warren Worthington's corporation. The characters do not act like themselves. They are completely changed to fit the plot and to add unneeded melodrama to the story. The dialogue is embarassing to read and the art does not flow with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than anything before it.","review":"This is the story where Austen really shows us what he can do. It seems as if he made it this bad on purpose.Essentially, his point is that groups that mutate similarly have to stick together for some reason. And he illustrates this point with a group that has no personality whatsoever. Aside from Maximus Lobo, not one of them says anything that they aren't just repeating.And as if it isn't bad enough, there's Kia Asamiya redesigning the costumes. It's like being stabbed immediately after someone shoots you in the lung.These costumes are bizarre. Lorna's has two sets of black wings (one on her head). Archangel's has a red loincloth.If a copy falls from the sky, I still say that you should set it on fire immediately, and be glad.Or, simply put: DO NOT READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Draco","review":"Popular opinion says that Draco is Chuck Austens worst Uncanny XMen arc, which is saying alot since his whole run has been terrible. But the truth of the matter, according to me at least, is Dominant Species is his worst. Vaguely defined villains (are they werewolves, are they mutants, both?) take over some office building that Warren Worthington owns. Its really as exciting as the premise makes it out to be. Its terrible. Bad characterization, nonexistant motivation, and poor artwork to further obscure any sense of whats going on (for some reason fog takes the place of backgrounds through most of the arc, which makes even less sense because as i said it takes place in an office building).If you want to read good X-Men stories go read some of Grant Morrison's New X-men books, or go read Essential X-Men 1 and 2. This crap by Chuck Austen gives the X-Men brand a bad name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Investigating!","review":"I found this book to contain many ideas about the progress now taking place in the field of collaborative software development. Furthermore it contains many other interesting theses about the development of computer technology.For instance, Tim O'Reilly's article begins with the observation that some of his friends were thinking of getting a computer not for the web in general, but so they could use Amazon.com. Thus we see that a \\"killer application\\" make take the form not of \\"software\\" in the classical sence, but of an individual website. He defines \\"infoware\\" to be this form of application, and then propounds the thesis that there was an era in which hardware manufacturers dominated the computing industry, then software manufacturers, and that now the playing field is shifting to the area of infoware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good background material to the open source movement","review":"It's general background and overview material and even if you don't like all articles (I disliked the one by Larry Wall, sorry, Larry, I do like Perl), it's a definite buy for people interested in software development methods in general or free software development in particular.Mind you, it's not a scientific or very theoretical book, but it does have some opinions and theories in it (Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, Bruce Perens, Tim O'Reilly).So, if you like theory on software development, it's a definite buy. If you're a hacker already, well maybe, but you might already know parts of it.Finally, there is definitely some anti-MS sentiment in there. However maybe it's just anti-baddd-software.

I don't count calories, fat grams, points, or carbs, and don't buy gimmicky \\"diet foods\\", because typically, they are chemical laden, and in the long run, will not help me to be healthy. Just plain [common sense!] healthy eating,[not starving myself, but slowing down & not overeating] exercise, and my Curvelle have helped me lose 25 lbs., and I have about ten more to go.

After 6 months of using Curvelle, I decided to quit taking this stuff. I didn't lose any weight, I didn't notice my hunger decreasing, I felt jittery, and my stomach was upset after taking it. Plus, the cost for this stuff adds up and you could probably get a decent gym membership with the monthly bill.

My trainer is amazed at how quickly my body is transforming & so are the people at Medifast. Curvelle helped me get through the very tough beginning of Medifast; I have lost 30lbs from July to date!! I have been out to dinner many times & at an Italian wedding(we all know how they love their pasta) & I was able to stick withy program. I attribute a big part of this to My diet & exercising & the rest most deffinately goes to Curvelle! It helped to keep me on track & now I don't want to cheat.

I've been exercising and eating a low fat diet, so I have been loosing weight. My goal is only 10 lbs. and in a month I'm down 5.

I held him in my arms that day and knew that he would grow up in a country so very different from the one I had grown up in. This book helped me tell him about that day and helped me heal. Today is the 10th anniversary of that horrific day. We have been watching coverage of the memorial service. I am going to purhase this book to teach my other son about the HEROS of 9/11. I think this book should be in every home and classroom in this country to help educate our little ones about not only the tragedy of 9/11 but also the strength that this country has in its people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History Lesson & Holds Their Interest","review":"This was an awesome non-fiction historical account of a story from 911. It held the children's interest well. I read it to my granddaughter's First Grade class on 911. They were so enthusiastic! Asked lots of questions and had lots of thoughts about the book and the significance of the day. Only regret was that I found this book too late to order the actual book. Reading it in Kindle version on my ipad to a group of 20 was a bit difficult for everyone to see. A student teacher in the classroom pointed out, though, that by reading it on the iPad through the kindle ap, I had introduced many of the students to a whole new option for reading books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, but no thanks...","review":"I bought this product because I liked the idea of side to side motion. The first time I used it, I did get a decent cardio going but was not impressed with the overall machine. It's very had to keep a good rhythm going because the height doesn't seem to be high enough. I was constantly hitting bottom and found it almost impossible to use the resistance bands that came with it. The machine started making a squawking noise shortly after I started using it, so I packed it up and returned it to the local store I bought it from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst customer service ever!!! Don't Buy this","review":"I am surprised this product is still on SALE!!!!The manufacture said it was a DISCONTINUED item.It was my Christmas gift from my husband and exactly one month later broken. (120 lbs of girl, workout-45min, 5 days per week).Even with warranty, the manufacture refused exchange or replacement parts because it's discontinued product.And the lady, answered phone, had no knowledge about CUSTOMER SERVICE!!Basically, it was waste money and ruined my Christmas feeling.Also Amazon site should stop selling this product ASAP and why there is no negative or zero stars available?."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This is the 1st disappointment I have had with Amazon purchases. The stepper is not fully functional. There are air-pressure arms that do not work.

However there seem to be some misconceptions about the story. \\"Basil\\" (Paul Newman) did not design the cup used at the last supper, but designed a silver chalice to hold the cup, and the plot involves him traveling around as he carves likenesses of the apostles, for a decoration on the silver cup \\"holder\\". Palance hams it up as Simon Magnus, a character from the New Testament, who tried to \\"buy\\" the religious \\"powers\\" of the apostles, giving the name \\"simony\\" to related sins. The look of the movie is like watching a play with sets, rather than a realistic movie, but the abstraction of the sets is one of the movie's most interesting aspects, along with the strangely facinating over-the-top performance of Palance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Newman's first movie, but definitely not his best!","review":"This is another one of those high-budget biblical movies made back in the fifties. This was the first film for both Paul Newman and Lorne Greene who play Basil the Greek slave and Saint Peter, respectively. Some of the characters portrayed here are mentioned in the New Testament, but many of them (including Newman's) have to be Hollywood-fabricated ones. The plot is fragmented and really doesn't tell much of a story. The movie props and backdrops look cheap and historically-unconvincing. Jack Palance's role as Simon the Magician seems so out of place in this film and his acting really isn't the greatest. After a while, this flick becomes so uninteresting and dull that it becomes so easy to get up and leave or change the channel and look at something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The 1990 Retrospective","review":"STEPPENWOLF GOLD is a better collection than the 1990 retrospective BORN TO BE WILD because it focuses only on the 1968-1974 period, omitting weaker songs from the late 70s and 80s. In fact, it is the equal of the single-disc ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS, expanding that anthology by 13 songs so that nothing important is missed. Almost everything here was written or co-written by the group's legally-blind lead singer, John Kay, proving that disabilites can be overcome. Moreover, Kay's advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction in May 2005 of a young Australian tourist makes this anthology an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible case design","review":"this case that the 2 cd's are in will keep falling apart. i never seen one designed like this"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"War is murder\\" quote","review":"You can't read the quote which is a super bummer because it is all about how war is murder.

Now he resides with the rest of my stuffies on my desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Snark and RVing","review":"The author of this book inadvertently writes his own review. Two thirds of the way into the book he writes about the boredom that sets in among all the people involved in NASCAR racing half way through a 40 race season. Unfortunately, reading about a boring season is as bad as participating in it.This could have been a great book. The author covered an entire NASCAR season traveling to almost every race in a luxury motor home. The title suggests that the book is about the focus that every team has on doing well in every race so they can earn big purses, \\"Sunday Money\\", and get all the benefits that flow from that success. Instead he wastes too much of the book writing about motor homes and making condescending observations about local residents and colorful fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The agony of watching your neighbors vacation slides.","review":"This is in reference to the 2005 hard cover addition. There are a number of good anecdotes regarding NASCAR, some drivers, the fans and races; however, the majority of it was like being invite to your neighbor's to watch a slide show of their vacation, and every slide had an agonizing story that only they could appreciate. I was also turned off by the fact that the author felt the need to include profanity. The profanity was limited and usually in the context of a quote, but nothing would have been lost if he had used \\"bleep\\" or even f..., m..... f....., etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful adventure ruined by poor writing and lack of depth","review":"I am in shock that so many rated this book so highly. I'm well educated, love competitive sports and like to work on cars so my affinity for NASCAR is natural. But I have no idea who this guy is writing to. The history was OK, and I thought the epilogue about the future of NASCAR was the best part of the book, but taking 4 pages to describe a \\"pit lizard\\" and 4 more pages to describe a pretty woman as she waits for her boyfriend, with the big payoff being the fact that she has a tattoo, and if you're getting sick of this long run-on sentence maybe you can get a job a Sports Illustrated like this guy did because he is quite fond of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a boring blog","review":"After attending my first NASCAR race (Talladega), I wanted to learn more about the entire NASCAR experience -- the race and RV'ing extravaganza. However, this book drags on forever.If you've never been to a NASCAR race, go. If you've been to one, you certainly do not need to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of an afternoon","review":"If the florid, stream-of-consciousness prose doesn't irk you, the author's habit of inserting his studly self and his 'Beep' into every few paragraphs will. I wound up skipping around a lot to get past stuff like 3 pages on buying a RV.If you know anything about NASCAR, you'll know he didn't do his research. How can the guy talk about racing legacies and the tragedies that hit these legacy families--like the Pettys and the Earnhardts--without mentioning the Allisons? How can he mention Mark Martin repeatedly, yet not even interview him? The guy is a prime example of a driver who's successfully straddled old NASCAR and new NASCAR. I hate to think that this might be the introduction to someone who's not familiar with the sport.The really frustrating thing is that the book has potential. He brings up some good points--if he ever got around to them.Don't waste an afternoon of your life on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Off Great........then goes to life support","review":"The first couple of chapters in this book are simply terrific .The scenes where the author picks up his new motor -home and drives it across country are laugh out loud funny.Then he starts following the NASCAR season (2002) and well......(shrugs) I found myself checking to see how many pages were left in the book.Bear in mind both the author and his wife had media credentials from NASCAR.And this is the best he could do ? Jeeesh.As a fan I look to writers to tell me what I don't have access to.I look for \\"inside\\" stuff and human interest stories.There is precious little here I didn't already know.If you follow NASCAR there is nothing new here for you to learn.If you're just starting out \\"Fixin To Get\\" and/ or \\"Daytona\\" are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject, tedious author","review":"MacGregor seems to think he's a cross between Hunter Thompson and Tom Wolfe. He isn't. He isn't even close. So you've got to wade through clunky metaphors that last for paragraphs just to get to the meat of this book. The meat is pretty good since the guy did do his research. If you don't mind skimming through the indulgent crap, which is more than 50% of this book, it's an OK read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"If you know anything about NASCAR this book has nothing new to offer you. The prose style is gushy, Esquire type ravings, and many of the chapters have appeared as articles in other magazines, including Sports Illustrated. If you don't know anything about NASCAR, or prefer intelligent, well-written prose, Jim Wright's Fixin' to Git or Shaun Assael's Wide Open are much better introductions to the people and the culture around NASCAR than this book. Spend your money on something better, like a Raceceiver!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR NASCAR FANS","review":"I saw the author on television and it was a great interview. As a college educated NASCAR Fan, I could hardly wait to get the book. Reading it was another story. Reading this book is quite laborious -- definitely not pleasurable reading. The author appears to be trying to use every word in the dictionary. After a couple of chapters the book is on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"NASCAR fans-got to read!","review":"This book details the dream many of us NASCAR fans have-traveling the whole circuit in an RV, experiencing every race.

It is like you are one big family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"I found this series late, but I enjoy it a great deal.

Tolkien's basic test of \\"offering an harmonious choice of modern English words\\" (\\"On Translating Beowulf). It is not as dreadful as some other translations of Beowulf, still it is still a dismal read. When reading Rebsamen, I was struck many times by the lack of correspondence to the original poem. This ranges from strange language choice (Rebsamen made up the word \\"deemer,\\" for the Old English word for judge) to complete deviance from content of the poem. On the first page of the translation, Rebsamen has Scyld \\"floating with gifts/a strange king-child.\\" Bad poetry, worse translation. The line Rebsamen is translating means, \\"found destitute, he experienced consolation for that.\\" Tolkien used J.J. Earle's 19th century translation as an example of a failed translation of Beowulf. I've read Earle; his translation is bad enough to be funny.

The instructor, who is not Denise (who is herself perfectly good in Fit Dance Jam, despite the misleading title), is very competent, cheery and fun to work out with. I got a 35-minute or so intermediate workout composed of kickboxing combinations, about three, broken down and added on. Basic punches, kicks and knee raises are mixed together with basic hi-lo moves. If you love cardio kickboxing, this for the price is certainly worth considering.I'm wondering if the Druce collection is stronger on basic step, hi-lo and kickboxing workouts and maybe not so much on the \\"specialized\\" workouts like bellydancing or salsa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I think it helps one to get to sleep, but that wasn't my problem, mine was staying asleep for more than 2-4 hours.

It's non toxic but you shouldn't be breathing it into your lungs.If you are using it outdoors you will need to reapply after a rain. I'll be saving this empty bottle to refill it from a larger money saving bag.I have successfully used many Safer products through the years, it's nice to have non toxic solutions to bug control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly Entertaining","review":"Western society's intense interest in Eastern culture and religion is best exemplified in this beautifully detailed and comprehensive book. With an engaging look at the history of each of the East's major religions, the authors offer the reader a special insight in the sacred rites and rituals which typify each of these religions. For those who subscribe to Buddhist, Taoist, Shinto philosophy, or Confucian wisdom, it a rare gem of a book, through which Eastern philosophy devotees can command a better appreciation of their tenets and worldviews. Fastidiously detailed, with brilliantly photographed selections of the various sects in costume, architecture and symbolism, the authors also offer a penetrating look into the minds and hearts of the believers, while assisting the reader in a better understanding of Eastern mysticism and metaphysicalism. Editor Scott Littleton and his colleagues have written a \\"primer extraordinaire\\" for Eastern religious thought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Do not waste your money on Linksys or D-Link products, this ADSL router is the best I ever used.

However, the duck that had caught my eye was one that was much larger, and when I saw this one, I bought it, thinking that it was the same duck. The duck that arrived via mail was less than 6 inches tall, and a waste of six dollars, if you ask me. They should clearly state the size of the duck, and make sure that people know the difference between this duck, and the one that I was hoping to buy. Unfortunately, I can't even buy the real duck that I wanted (also named Quackers the Duck, TY Doll), because I'm on a budget, and can't afford ten dollars to buy this duck. I'm not satisfied, but can't return it, because I opened the package (there was no other way to tell that it was going to be a puny duck), and can't return it (and would lose a dollar or more from shipping).

Personally, this is my favorite Melissa Etheridge album thus far, although Skin comes pretty close behind. Songs like Scarecrow, which tells the violent story of Matthew Shepard, hit you hard and make you realize the power of music. Songs like Mama, I'm Strange and Ain't That Enough are powerful in their own right. But mostly, I love the song Sleep. It's a powerful and sweet love song, typical, and yet, not so typical at the same time, of Melissa's style. It probably describes best what my idea of the perfect love would be like.

I am a dietitian and am always looking for ways to encourage vegetables and fruits to parents and children. The exterior and interior of this book are very colorfull and attractive. But the text is dissapointing for several reasons: too cluttered, too much information on recipes for fruits (many kids will eat them in their natural form or cut creatively), some recipes with too many ingredients, use of unfamiliar language (such as calling the seeds of fruit 'pips'), and confusing use of serving sizes (using 'handfulls').

If you're an 80's horror fan like myself and grew up with this specific genre, then you will \\"get\\" this movie. William Forsythe carried this movie on his back and made up for the horrible special effects. If make-up masters like Tom Savini or Greg Nicotero handeled the gore and magic that they brought us for decades, then this movie I believe, would bring sequels to the table.

Although the book claims that the items used in the projects are found right in your home, I always found myself having to go out and buy the ingredients. Out of the ten or so projects we have done so far, only 2 have turned out right. I must say, even after following the directions to a precise T, the results have been a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best birthday party ever!","review":"I bought this book to help plan my daughters 5th birthday party.

It's so captivating, exciting, complicated and everything in a television show that I want to watch. It's really sad that they cut the show because of the amount of viewers. Maybe FOX should have allowed the season to really get going. People have jobs, and families, and other day to day things going on and can't always watch the show when it's being aired. That's why Netflix is so wonderful.. I first watched Terra Nova when it came out on Netflix and fell in love, literally. I am so sad it won't be aired again.

Groups of peole with specialized skills are sent through to stay and begin civilization all over again.However, theres a group who want to make the wormhole go both ways so that they can take the resources. They have planted a group in the timeline who are there to fight against the new civilization to help them achieve their goal.This show had so many directions it could hvae gone.

C'mon man! Seriously FOX, you have three shows about cooks! (Hells Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, Master Chef) All of which suck, and you cancel Terra Nova. It makes me shake my head. First Firefly, now this. But I digress. This show is awesome! Very well written (despite what retarded critics said) and a very unique story! I'm not going to buy it because I don't want to give FOX any money for it because they're stupid, and also because it's ridiculously priced for a show that will never be concluded. If anyone knows of a fan petition to bring this show back let me know. (I know petitions don't work legally for this purpose, but they can be used to show a network how many people want the show back!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite shows!","review":"Terra Nova was a wonderful show. My dad and I both loved watching it every week and we're both so sad Fox decided to not continue the show. Hopefully someone else will (like Netflix).

In a dying, polluted future, a priviledged policeman and doctor violate population laws to have three kids, then stow away on a last-chance escape through time to another reality, leaving the starving behind. Revolting characters, poorly written, and they wasted over 40 million dollars on it. What a message to send out to the public.Wasting money on this dvd set would be pointless. It was cancelled while unresolved, so it's clearly a waste of your time and dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terra Nova","review":"Just finished watching the only season. I know this is simply a movie and anything can happen in movies; however, couldn't stop thinking as I watched that what they were doing in the past was changing the future no matter how far back they went. As I said this was only a movie but having said that it would have been good to stick to as much science as possible. What we do or have done affects the future one way or the other. There would have been no going back and forth to the same future they left because all would have changed. The first interference to the past would have immediately changed the future.These writers totally ignored facts, science and simple reality.

As a huge fan of SF I wanted to like this. It was horrible. Someone even compared it to Firefly. Firefly was one of the few good SF TV series ever made. There was creativity, an interesting Universe, great characters, and interesting questions to find answers too. There were great scrips and good acting.Terra Nova had none of these things. I admit I only watched half of the season because I couldn't watch such a missed opportunity anymore. I believe the main failure was the scrips and ideas were set up for 8-12 year old children instead of adults. Maybe next time we will get some decent SF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Blu-Ray Edition...?","review":"Not sure which Idiot is responsible of this Release BUT where is the Blu-Ray Edition.....?

My son was \\"Dying\\" to see it, he is 13 yrs old. So I clinched my teeth and thought \\"Only an hour\\" and we watched it. This was a surprisingly good show, a little violent and a little dark and a whole lot of visually creative. My son described it in one word \\"EPIC!\\". I enjoy all the characters from the family to the people that were in the first wave of settlers, the storyline is solid and intricate the creatures bold and scary. I can't see this show running out of plots and stories as so many good shows have done. I don't want to give away any plot spoilers so I'll just say I think this show could be a huge success and lead to games and theme park and become a cult classicif given more than one season.

They also make it so the dinosaurs act like, well, dinosaurs instead of monsters which a lot of other shows do as well. I was disappointed when I found out they only made one season and left it at a cliff hanger. It's a great show for anyone who likes adventure, animals, sci-fi, futuristic and much more.

It was hypnotically attractive.When the series came out on DVD, I rented it. But despite the colorful, attractive cover on the DVD case, and despite the interesting time travel theme, the screenwriting was terrible. Characters say things they would not really say in their circumstances, and characters behave in ways they would not really behave. The cinematography is colorful and some of the special effects are impressive, as is the set direction. But those things are empty framework if you don't fill in the spaces with characters behaving convincingly.A rudimentary conceptual framework is not enough, even if it is one involving time travel, dinosaurs, and a cool-looking home base. What the twelve episodes of this cancelled series needed was a screenwriter who BELIEVED--in his world, in his story, and in his characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just to Give a More Positive Light...","review":"When I saw the preview for Terra Nova I decided to give it a fair shake, I personally was not disappointed. With this being a new series it is very hard to judge it on the first show, so I will be brief. First I personally enjoyed the very abstract and mixed themes/ideas that combined to create the storyline. It has beautiful scenery, dinosaurs, action, and futuristic technology! What more could a person want?? Second, the acting was a little rough but I believe that the show will turn out to be one of the better ones on TV. Many series start out with a shaky first episode and become AMAZING (Fringe, Stargate, etc.) Finally, I watch a show to be entertained, and with this standard Terra Nova is a great show. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this new series, so for me that makes it all the better!!

She calls the shots and while others who don't know Boodil may think she's disobedient or a bit dim, her owner knows different.A positive spin is put on all of her antics. She is a strong-willed child who is obviously deeply loved and appreciated, warts and all.The illustrations are so sweet and hilarious, you'll find yourself wondering if you shouldn't add a Bull Terrier to your family.

One phone in the kitchen, another in the bedroom, and the baseunit in the living room with the cable modem.NOTE: this phone will work perfectly with normal phone service as well.Finally, the phone has a useful intercom function, where you can page a specific phone (or all of them), and talk to them through the phone (works well if you are working in the back yard and your wife needs to reach you)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 of 2 handsets worked","review":"I purchased 2 handsets of this model, charged the batteries according to spec, and then tried to register them with the base unit.

You could tell the airlines were rough with the case but my clubs were in perfect condition upon arriving at my destination. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to my one complaint. The handles are screwed into the case with what looks like metal screws. However, the hole is plastic so the screws seem to loosen a bit too easily.

And one reviewer wrote that he put silicon grease on the gasket...nothing in the instructions about that. So one of the positive reviews actually modified the product to make it work!This is not a quality product. It leaked on the second roll of film, despite extreme care in seating the gasket. I have purchased single-use underwater cameras which give much better results, and I recommended those over this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want good pictures?

I would not recommend buying this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prone to leaks","review":"The first time I used it, I noticed that it was starting to fog up inside the housing. I opened it and sure enough there was some water inside. The second time, using the extra rubber ring that was provided, I noticed water leaked inside again. It seemed to take a little longer this time (30 minutes) and didn't fog up. I used it snorkeling (no underwater dives), so the max depth the camera could have been at was 5 feet. Fortunately, there was not enough water to get inside the camera body and into the film compartment. I believe that if I had taken it to about 45 feet, like the previous reviewer did, that it would have also flooded.I guess all I can say is beware.Pros are: It is much cheaper than the next model from the same company, has a flash, automatic film advance, and a nice strap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless!!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my son in law, who took it snorkeling once.

More than eighty years later, the physicist and humanitarian Genrich Krasko believes that a thorough overhauling of the American educational system can reverse the \\"decline\\" and usher in an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Krasko argues in \\"The Unbearable Boredom of Being\\" that \\"poor education is the main cause of almost all the problems our society is facing today.\\" The evidence is overwhelming. Content to let machines and unscrupulous political and commercial manipulators do what passes for thinking, we have become a semi-literate society. In nearly 300 pages of stimulating analysis, Krasko offers a number of well thought-out ways to reform the educational system and in so doing achieve America's promise. This is an unusually provocative book."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor copy","review":"Most of the books that I have purchased from Amazon have been in Good to Very Good condition. Unfortunately, the workbook/lab manual to accompany Deux Mondes was not only dirty but was missing the first few chapters. Is it possible to exchange it for a slightly cleaner copy? Can one be sent to me and can I return this manual? Like I stated, this is the first book of at least four dozen books that I have purchased from Amazon that was unacceptable. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorely disappointed","review":"As a fan of the X-Men and all the other X-titles, I was sorely disappointed in this graphic novel.The beginning, which featured a baseball game with the residents of X-Mansion, was perhaps the only best thing of the entire novel. After that, it just went downhill!The battle with the Fury just simply bored me. The Fury, to me, was simply a repackaged version of the Sentinels or Nimrod.

I wanted something light enough to carry up and down the stairs and something that would be gentle on wood floors. I LOVE this vacuum. It has a super long cord which means I can vacuum large rooms and even rooms nearby without unplugging the unit. It does a wonderful job maneuvering and getting into smaller areas. I tried a bag-less vacuum and I found the dust and dirt involved in emptying it was more frustrating than buying vacuum bags. I could not be happier with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall a disappointment","review":"It works well on hardwood floors but is a real disappointment on carpet. My house has mostly hardwood floors and a few oriental rugs. It does well on the hardwood but on the carpets it is very hard to push at a low vacuum setting and impossible at a high setting.The attachments are awkward to use since there is no flexible hose. To clean the windowsills, you have to pickup the entire vacuum and run it over the windowsill. I used to use the narrow edge attachment to clean the coils at the bottom of my fridge and now this is even more awkward than cleaning the windowsills.As one other poster observed, the vacuum bags are small.In summary, if have a small house with all hardwood floors, this is probably a pretty good product. If not, I would look some where else."},{"rating":"1","title":"total disappointment","review":"doesn't stay upright. Middle heavy and too much money for something well made but useless.

They were very high regarded in Europe. That was the reason I spent all this money on a mere vacuum broom. What I noticed right away it is kind of cumbersome to push around, I am 70 years old and thought I bought a lightweight cleaner. The thing that upset me the most that is takes forever to pick up cat hair from my carpets. I have to push back and forth forever to he point where my arms hurt. Its alright on the wooden floor. I have a little hand held Shark that does a better job picking up hair. I am sorry I spent so much money when I could have bought something cheaper with better results. Also the little dirt bags have to be mailordered. All in all I am disappointed in the quality of this expensive product.

As a matter of fact, they were stored away in boxes for 2 years when I temporarily relocated and was not using them. Perhaps the chipping is due to washing them in the dishwasher rather than by hand.

There are many bugs each one of them jeopardizing the purpose of operating a security camera.

I called DLink tech support and they told me that they will not repair these products or exchange them after the warranty, and that there are no authorized service centers. I escalated through 3 levels of tech support and then to US customer support and was given the same story and no way to get them repaired. The customer service lady stated that this was their policy on all products. They expect you to discard your $800 camera and buy another one. I recommend you don't buy any DLink product costing more that $100 - $200 as they are not very reliable and are disposable once they fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready yet","review":"This product may be the worse piece of technology I have ever gotten.

However, the text he produces, far from being scholarly, often reads a bit like a tabloid account of King David. Deconstructing the book of Samuel, a Herculean and important task, has been accomplished elsewhere by serious scholars who offer very deep reconstructions of this most fascinating and contradictory character. Readers looking to explore the subject would do well to look for Professor B. Halpern's seminal work, \\"David's Secret Demons.\\" While not as breezy in style, the book goes far deeper in uncovering its subject and will offer the reader far more food for thought. Therefore, if looking for an easy read, pick up McKenzie, but those with a serious interest in King David should put the time and effort into a more serious work. Please, take a look at Halpern; you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody likes a smarta**...","review":"I just heard these two young a-holes reading their favorite excerpts on bokk tv.

The audience, bemused but uncomfortable, asked few questions.The story of two guys blundering into Iraq in the early days of the war and sponging their way about the country is not without interest.

Her motivation for taking an active role instead of a research role was never clear to me. The story of Eugene Byrd's character is strong and the movie would have been better if the Ali Larter character hadn't sidetracked it. There was probably a point this movie was trying to make, a message it wanted to deliver, but I couldn't find it.

On another hike, their description of a return route was very vague & didn't mention several landmarks which would've made the route easier to find.

It doesn't keep my hair from growing back for very long, but I don't care because I always had awful looking underarms and now they are smooth. I guess it depends how quickly your hair grows, and I have always had fast growing hair. I tried to use it on my legs, but I couldn't stand the pain. Works great on facial hair as well.

Pulling hairs out by the root is going to hurt no matter what. If you want to use it around the bikini area I recommend you think twice about that. The legs aren't as painful but it still feels like hairs being pulled out by the root which is exactly what it is doing. It's not very thorough either plus I was left with painful bumps that lasted a few days. I say stick to the razor or go get a wax.

I recently purchased this model and have used it only twice so far, but I am very pleased. Very little pain. Great job removing leg hair on the first swipe. No ingrown hairs. No rash. I decided to buy the corded model because my experience is that it is the adapter on the rechargeable models that goes bad, not the epilator. When the power isn't at full force, the epilator yanks the hair out and that produces a rash, etc. It is sometimes difficult, if not impossible to replace the adapter. I highly recommend this product based upon its performance so far and very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use. Worth the money","review":"So far I like it.

It pulled out every hair from my underarms give or take a few but after just the first time they feel softer and look better and.not dark like when i shavePain?For me the pain was moderate. This is because I have tried tweezing my underarm hair before and that was a lot more tedious.

I purchased this one...and was mad at myself for wasting so many years on the crap I was using before. This one is MUCH faster, less painful and easier to use.The first time you ever use one of these...it definitely hurts (like waxing) since it's pulling the hair from the root...but honestly...as you start doing it every 2-3 weeks when the hair starts to grow back in, it pulls the shortest hairs and hurts less. I love having the smooth feel for longer than just during the day. So I routinely do my legs and arms every 2-3 weeks...and shave any breakthrough areas on my legs in between...I consistently have smooth legs. Very worth it! =)Make sure you exfoliate with a loofah for extra smoothness and to make hair removal easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"like the light works great","review":"This product does exactly what it says.

Which I am willing to understand. But I'm not able to be so understanding when I'm epilating my bikini area and the stupid thing jams mid-epilate, pinching extremely sensitive skin and drawing blood.

In the final example, when the book culminates in a useful Web application (a simple, MySQL-based guestbook program), the reader who tries to get the code to work discovers that the book is out-of-date, relying on global variables and session management information that is done very differently in current releases of PHP.

As for this unit, the drill is made in Mexico while the batteries are from China.My impressions at this time:Pluses:-Compact-Light-Reasonable torque-InexpensiveCons:-A bit nose heavy.-Clutch collar is small.-Chuck diameter is somewhat large.-Neutral switch does not lock the trigger, if set to neutral and pressed, it will default to forward.-I initially thought this was a one-handed chuck like on the EY6100. This requires two hands to tighten/loosen the jaws to make bit changes. Otherwise, the chuck will turn against the friction settings you have dialed in on the clutch.This unit's compact size and weight are the best features. If you have smaller hands and want a drill that maneuvers well in tight spaces, this is well suited for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clutch slips on high RPM setting","review":"I own 2 of the original 12v drills manufactured by Panasonic, the full size model and the Predator. I purchased 4 of these drills hoping the batteries would fit in the older drills. Fortunately they do, otherwise they would be going back.This drill has a serious flaw. On the high RPM setting the clutch slips. Reminds me of the slipping transmission in an old Buick I had. It was fine until I accelerated then it slipped and jerked when it \\"caught\\". This drill will not allow you \\"feather\\" screws in, on the high RPM setting. Since I have 4 of the drills and all of them do the same thing, I didn't get a fluke.In my estimation the lack of a usable high RPM setting makes this drill a loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great at first, but then got slippery","review":"I got this mat back in May 2011.

I washed it, aired it outside for several days, washed it again, aired again. After a week of that, I took it to class, still smelled it when I lay on it; but then, I realized I was wet! Apparently it absorbed water though the surface had been dry to touch, as pressing down caused sweating. Then my feet were slipping on it! Not a good yoga move. So I put a blanket on top to finish out the class.One has to wrap it in towels after rinsing or wiping it which is a hassle. It's too tough to squeeze and rinse, of course.Next class, I borrowed a mat that was cushy and had more give under hands and feet, lighter, prettier, and smell-free.

Yet \\"The destiny\\" is a weak and disconnected film , its main message is a \\"politically correct\\" one: there can be no strict adherence to a religious doctrine without fanaticism and to a certain extent terrorism , that message was almost tailored to please the western media , and Mr Chahine was rewarded with the much coveted Palme d'Or.I also agree with Mr Hefny the reviewer from Cairo , he blew a great opportunity for a serious treatment of the subject of political coercion in the name of religion . His decision to use egyptian slang as the language of Andalusia some 800 years ago is a farce and an insult to the intelligence of the arab viewer. With all due respects to Mr Chahine , we deserve better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been something","review":"imagine the movie \\"the ten commandements\\" with a bronx or a brooklyn accent. thats what destiny feels like when you are an arabic speaker. the actors speak modern day egyptian accent which sounds completely silly to arabs considering that the setting of the movie is the 12th century spain. the idea could have been great if chahine would have stuck to historical accuracy. but i guess chahine dont care about his arab audience that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a delightfully odd movie!","review":"A girl is left with her uncle for the weekend (or a day, I think) while Mom runs off with her new boyfriend.

I have seen these guys since they were a duo alternating between drums and guitar/vocals in 1995. I personally never saw a mediocre show by them. They have a pretty intense presence on stage...and may just destroy some property at the venue they are performing at. Conrad and Jason are nuts.For some reason, however, I dont think these guys record good albums. I have yet to hear the new Mistakes and Regrets (and have heard it is quite good) but Madonna and their debut Lp both left me wanting alot more. The Madonna lp sounds like Fugazi (Guy P. sounding vocals) or Blond Redhead or Sonic Youth, and not very much like Trail of Dead. They have a sound all their own too and I hope they learn how to capture it on album. Go see these guys live or get ahold of a live recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwash!","review":"Well, trail of Bread breaks out into the open with this one, a half-step away from MTV stardom.

This, their second album, sounds less polished than \\"Source Tags + Codes\\" yet remains in the vein of gorgeously constructed and well thought out indie rock. Aside from the key rockin' tracks which make up about half the album; there are these great, what I like to call, \\"darker\\" pieces of music; these songs greatly add to the overall strange mood of this album. Most of my favorite songs off of this, in fact, are some of these departures from your average indie-rock fodder, including \\"Children of Hydra's Teeth\\", \\"Aged Dolls\\", and \\"Day the Sky Turned Blue\\". Altogether this is a great album that closely rivals it's more recent accomplice \\"Source Tags + Codes\\". This band has yet to fail in impressing me, and I definitely think this is worth a listen if you appreciate an album that you can sink your teeth into."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got better","review":"Love this band--and I'm probably one of the few people who like their new material more, and believe they got better as musicians. This album--as much as I like it fierceness, is almost unlistenable. The band is all over the place, some of the stuff just doesn't connect. When it does, like on \\"Flood Of Red\\" and \\"Mistakes And Regrets\\", it predicts better things to come on the 'Source Tags & Codes' album, where their sound and songs just gelled better.Trail of Dead definitely have (had) their own thing going: it's not quite punk, it's not at all prog, but it borrows liberally from these genres and more. The scattershot singing and sections where the band all get off-time here just seem to belie a dashed-off quality in the recording. Sometimes that can be a good thing, but with material as thin as this, it just grates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankfully, \\"Hard Rock\\" isn't what it used to be","review":"At a time when noisy rock music is supposedly at it's lowest commercial ebb, one of the more brash and energetic proponents of the genre grabs a fair amount of attention. Instrumental comparisons to mid-era Sonic Youth (EVOL, Daydream Nation) are accurate, but Trail Of Dead drive the chiming, harmonic edge of their guitars to a new hedonistic extreme and provide a substantial challenge to the more dance orientated \\"alternative\\" acts when measured on the Richter scale. Some of the songs are weighed down by a rhythmic and vocal sensibility from the punk era, but when the Trail Of Dead take a more expansive and sonically adventurous turn, the results are most invigorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Collection","review":"A well put collection of songs from this sultry spanish singer.

Three of the disks of this set (1,2,and 4) are along the same genre/caliber of the first two seasons and appropriate for children. Disk 3 is horrific--figuratively and literally. It should be rated R. It is NOTHING BUT sadistic abuse, torture, suicide, homicide, fratricide, mental illness and sorcery--none of which move the story along. It also plagued with misogynistic overtones...What happened to the writers during those weeks we will never know...I am so glad we do not follow this show on TV. Save yourself the headache and throw disk three away unwatched. Preview it (WITHOUT THE KIDS) if you are curious--but you will be glad for my warning.

The names are different, and you get a greater sense of the financial and social challenges facing the family, and there is no radio for the family to gather around after dinner, but it is very much the same story. If you can get past the differences in the names, you will be rewarded with a pleasant read, especially if read just before you drift off to sleep at night.

This is a small town in the Blue Ridge mountains that happens to be the home of this gifted story teller.From this visit I have acquired a new found love for all things Waltons.Earl Hamner takes snippets from his life and turns them into earthy portrayals of growing up in a poor family and of \\"coming of age\\". It seems like we all have faced questions, problems, trials and triumphs like this.This book was enjoyable to read and entertaining. I really couldn't help visualizing the tv family we all know...

It has never been put on in the US, mainly because of its downbeat message and the fact that it relies on something of an understanding of Britain, but you truly are missing out on something special. This play is a political, poetic vision of despair, the endlessness and emptiness of life in poverty. It is a fantastic character study which inspires, moves and is tragically heartbreaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"good performance of 2 uninteresting works","review":"I'm a big fan of 20th century ballet, especially Prokofiev and Stravinsky. Not being familiar with Roussel's work I snatched this up on the basis of some positive reviews I read. I was disappointed. The two ballets on this disc are rather conservative works more reminiscent of Delibes or Minkus than the extraordinary works that Diaghilev was commisioning at the time.

The Russian singers lend a bit of otherworldliness to the pieces, which works as an effect because the music is supposed to speak to you on a different level. The opening on the first track is very beautiful, and I have to disagree with the editorial reviewer, who perhaps may not be accustomed to Russian choral singing, but the Mass is sung very lightly and very intensely as appropriate. Te Deum is a heavy, bombastic piece, and the orchestra especially shines during \\"Te Deum\\" and \\"Dignare Domine.\\" A slight dislike on \\"Tu, Rex Gloriae\\" is that the sopranos and altos don't enunciate very clearly. Overall, a satisfying purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dua obras sacras grandiosas","review":"A Missa em Ré maior de Dvorak, se encaixa em um contexto de obras religiosas mais grandiosas que já ouvi.

I had been told that it was a great vampire movie.Either I was lied to, or there are two movies named \\"American Vampire\\" (I checked IMDB...there aren't). Oddly I can't find any of the reviews now, and the friend claims not to remember any such recommendation.Anyway, this is a terrible movie..plot makes no sense, acting is terrible, even the Adam West cheese factor can't save it. It's barely even a vampire movie...Save your money for something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely awful -- not even fun to laugh at.","review":"Granted, I did NOT expect this movie to be any good but as a self proclaimed cheesy horror movie expert I certainly expected it to be (unintentionally) funny. However, other than Adam West's involvement, this movie was completely unremarkable (Adam West was his usual self but I figured there would be a few self refferential jokes like the ones from Drop Dead Gorgeous... there wasn't a single one, even the quite obvious Vampire Bat - Batman connection).Of little note is Carmen Electra's \\"starring\\" role in this. Despite what the cover box may have you believe, she has maybe 5-10 lines and flubs NONE of them so it's not really worth watching for her either.Needless to say I'm very pleased that I didn't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"You got vamps in your crib?","review":"This movie is about a group of vampires who crash at a guy's house while his parents are away. As their odd behavior becomes an increasing inconvenience, he elicits the help of a professional vampire hunter. Van Helsingmeister, played by Batman's Adam West. If this all seems like a cool, campy idea, I would agree.The movie drags on slowly during the first 75% of the movie as dogs and cats in the neighborhood disappear, etc. By the time the vampire hunter enters the picture, the movie is beyond saving. The final half hour was a last chance for the movie to start getting good, but, it does not.Great idea and movie concept, but the script just falls way short in keeping the action advancing and giving some action at the end the audience is waiting for. The acting was pretty bad, but Carmen Electra actually did a credible job as the seductive vampiress. Overall, I give it 2 stars for a good concept, but this one is strictly for the diehard vampire movie fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"The DVD case is clearly targeted toward fans of Carmen Electra who is barely even in it.

This one falls into that oh so cherished category of intentionally hoaky and bad. If your only goal from a vampire film is to see half naked vampire women seducing young men, well then, you might be satisified with this second rate vampire picture. After all, you can't beat Carmen Electra as a seductress. However, everything else about this film is beyond the usual bad and goes straight to toilet city.

You even see the sound boom in a few scenes. I thought it may be good to rent for a laugh or 2,but it didn't happen. Adam West couldn't save this one .Much like his Tv sidekick, Burt Ward ( Beach Babes from Beyond),Adam West seems to make 'B' movies to let the world know he is still alive.

The novels assigned provided a fun method of learning, and the accompanying study questions ensured that I learned history through each and every chapter.I've retained much of what I learned through this study seven years ago because it was so enjoyable to work through. I never could have compiled such an ideal combination of books for a thorough US history study. The Beautiful Feet cirriculum proved to be the perfect course for my 9th and 10th grade years.

Are we thinking yet?? Whilst it is a great shame that La Jetee is not presented in both English and French on this DVD release, a measure which would have been inexpensive, simple and after all one of the great things about this technology, it is absurd and ignorant of the reviewers here to complain on the grounds of it being some dumb hollywood machine decision and disrespectful to this wonderful film. Just to reiterate what has already been stated plainly...THE ENGLISH-VOICE VERSION IS THE ONE PREFERED BY CHRIS MARKER HIMSELF. now shut up. think before you speak. take the time to know what you're talking about.And anybody considering buying this film...how can you not? It's quite simply beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubbed?","review":"I had first heard of La Jetée way back in college from a buddy in film school. When he asked if I had seen it, I thought he said \\"le j'etais.\\" I used to be it? I asked. He kind of freaked out (in the style of film students) at the realization of the cleverness of the dual meaning of the title.This the kind of subtlety that's lost when a film is dubbed. While I can understand a studio's decision to dub a film that may achieve a wider audience if the soundtrack is in English (i.e. Life is Beautiful, Jackie Chan's Hong Kong films) I am puzzled by the release of this film in a dubbed version only. It is not as if this film will ever have a wide following and the DVD format is such that the inclusion of the original naration would not fit on the disk.If you really want to see La Jetée and refuse to see it in it's original French, rent 12 Monkeys (a fine film) in 4:3 instead; you'll be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"english???","review":"I agree with the majority of the opinions expressed here so no need to go into detail - the English narration for La Jetee does a serious disservice to this remarkable film. I have done a fair bit of research to determine a source for the claim that Marker 'prefers' this version but cannot find verification and therefore choose to disbelieve it. I have a fuzzy old version on VHS of the original French version and it is by far preferable. Also the English version suffers seriously in some places from a different mix balance between the narration and the music/sfx - very noticeable at the climactic final scene at the airport - in the French one has a tremendous emotional response to the story's conclusion partly because of the soaring music and screaming jet engines, in the English both music and effects are mixed far lower under narration resulting in a very muted concusion. HUGE DISAPOINTMENT ALL ROUND."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah go with Criterion Collection","review":"La Jetée is one of the most incredible science fiction films ever made.

I bought it strictly for La Jetee (Chris Marker) which, naturally, loses a great deal of eloquence in English, as it appears on the DVD. But it remains an incontrovertably wonderful film. Other than the section by/about Gary Hickenlooper, nothing on the DVD deserves a second viewing. The Hickenlooper pieces, while of interest, are not really engrossing, although I may venture into watching The Big Brass Ring at full length.

The re-chargeable battery system holds charge for a good amount of time and it re-charges fast. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FLASH IT SELF, the pin on the side of the flash that holds it at different angles popped out the first day just from taking some practice shots and I was not able to put it back in (small spring bent/broke). However the only problem that causes it's that it doesn't \\"click\\" in to place, the trasnsition from differnt angles is now smooth.

Initially I thought it was pretty good since the rice was cooked nicely and the pot was easy to clean. However, as I use it more often, it turns out to be the worst rice cooker that I ever had. Usually, from my experience, a rice cooker can keep rice warm and moist for 2 or 3 days without any problems. For some reasons, this rice cooker cant do that. The rice became too dry at the bottom, mushy in places where water drains down from the lid or, worse, spoiled on the second day. I bought other brands at about the same price before and never had any problem like that. At first, I thought it was the faucet water that caused the problem, since I just moved to a new place. But the problem still continues even after I used bottle water to cook the rice. So my advice is stay away from this rice cooker, unless you plan to cook and finish all the rice right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Useless","review":"I received this cooker as a wedding present, and I couldn't be more disappointed with it.

I even tried using a 4-1 ratio, and it still burned.I am not surprised at all to see the entire Oster line of rice cookers loaded with bad reviews.

Used it, again was happy, yeay I have a rice cooker! One day DEAD, wouldn't work, wouldn't run on, nothing.

They can't carry a tune in a pick up truck.Jurnee Smollet, the little girl who occasionally guested on their show, \\"Full House\\" is a real talent. Bright and beautiful, this little girl can sing, dance AND act. She's also adorable. Since she doesn't have blonde hair and blue eyes, she doesn't get as much press. Jurnee Smollet was a smash in \\"Eve's Bayou\\" and \\"Selma, Lord, Selma,\\" a fact based account of 1965 Selma, Alabama.Jurnee is the real talent. The Olsens couldn't even sing for their supper.

Originally written in the late 1950's, this book lacks the creativity of Clarke's full novels.Perhaps Clarke has discovered this also, because recently he stays with short diatribes on television shows and co-authors most of his recent works.This book is only for the collector looking to complete their Arthur C.

To say it's a lie for some of the feminist movement is ridiculous. Some of the lies also are common sense, which makes me think the author is using the Bible and the precious word of God to manipulate it to her thoughts. As a young woman, I have every right to want the fulfill my longings (and not through a romance novel or cruise), to work to support myself, and not to stay in a marriage if I am abused (another \\"lie\\" was about divorce and the thought to never get one. Sometimes women get in abusive relationships and have to, so it's wrong to give advice to grin and bear it.)God wants my prosperity, but not in the way this author describes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Guide","review":"I have just started a study of \\"Lies Women Believe\\" with a group of ladies at my church.

And, it does not include those things of which I am most fond, which are mostly his choral and solo voice works. But then, I may not have gotten to listen to this very nice material. Like all of Grainger's work, this is far more accurately described as nice or pretty than 'beautiful' or 'sublime'.

I for one think this is a great system -- powerful bass, good sound out of all the speakers.

I'm not an audiophile, so having all those connections is just setting me up for failure, though I guess I got lucky.Customer support is obviously overseas (outside U.S.), but the guy was friendly, was able to resolve my problem (cable channels over 100 and no sound out of the center channel), and was able to decipher my stupid setup questions quickly.I highly recommend this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy and fun guide to bird habits, habitats and birdsong","review":"Are you bird-literate?

There's plenty of humor ranging from inane to crazy to downright disgusting. There's also plenty of action and tense/suspenseful moments as well. And it stars the adorable Moon Lee!Moon plays wawa - a seventeen-year-old visiting her blind grandfather and cousin in Hong Kong while there's a serial killer that plys his trade when it becomes night. The threesome end up getting involved in the investigation with some wild results!The highlight of this film is seeing Moon Lee use kung fu on Yuen Wah (one of the seven fortunes) while wearing roller skates. This scene is a classic and a favorite among hardcore Moon Lee fans. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because this version has cut out most of the nastier humor which is probably better for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knight's Handbook","review":"I found the text to be written in a sarcastic, mocking tone.

To SLOW DOWN, enjoy the simple things, and live life in the moment! The other feature of this book that I really liked was the page at the end that identifies all the rainforest animals pictured throughout the book...

The company was no help. When I complained that I could not get the box back into the case, they sent me instructions on how to set the box up.

Technically, installation is a problem with obvious glitches in the system. Most games are simplistic, lacking challenge and interest. Not all games have bonus rounds, and few have various levels to work your way thru in those rounds.

I read the book and really enjoyed it. Can merely reading a book give you true happiness if you have a serious mental disorder? No but if you are like the majority of us happiness seeking professionals stressed by events and demands, Pollan's book is just right. Much of the self-help genre books is filled with a list of pithy quick advice from winners from \\"The Apprentice\\" with no perspective. Stephen Pollan is a successful senior executive with a successful life in business and family. (No I do not know him personally) The books rings true in so many ways. When confronted with \\"overwhelming\\" tasks living in the moment and getting \\"something\\" done is much better than agonizing about the past and the future and doing nothing. There is much more in the book to be sure. The book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Insight in Plain Language","review":"I picked up this book because I had read the author's previous works \\"Die Broke\\", and a couple from the \\"Life Scripts\\" series.

With \\"It's All In Your Head\\", Mr. Pollan and Mr. Levine have laid out a very simple, clear path to understanding how one is very capable of living a fulfilling life with the qualities they already inherently have.And they do it in a way that reminds you of a good friend putting an arm around your shoulder and giving excellent advice. I reccomend this book highly not just to someone looking for some answers, but anyone who feels they need a little perspective on things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously Inaccurate","review":"First off, you should by the Pedaller's Paradise instead of Lonely Planet. It can be found for about 12 NZD in New Zealand (but is also available through Amazon for a bit more if you can't wait).Dangerous - The profiles (ie. graphical descriptions of hills) shown in the Lonely Planet Guide are drastically over-simplified. On a good day, this is only just very annoying. On a bad day, it could mean being out in the cold wondering just how many more hills are before the next stop. It is obvious that the writers did not use bicycles to research the routes. Nor did they use GPS or any other precise means of measuring elevation. They were very lazy about how they threw this guide together, and it will get you into trouble. Avoid it!Buy the Pedallar's Paradise instead - it is a fraction the size, half the cost, and packed with useful information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book, better country","review":"My wife and I went to New Zealand on Nov 2000 and used this book along with the regular LP New Zealand book. The description of the rides and maps are very accurate. We had purchased New Zealand by Bike by Bruce Ringer but decided to take this one instead.

Obtain courage from Shavonne for being able to walk away. Fight with Stacy as she battles between \\"the perfect life\\" and \\"real life\\". Admire Kendal for finally understanding her self-worth.

Stan is only content to convey his style of putting with his mechanics and his mannerisms. The same can be said about Pelz. I have read both and I can say that both apply. I putted like Stan for almost 20 years (right handed). I have spent the last 2 years working on a Pelz stroke (left handed). Yes the title is misleading as is the Pelz title (since Dave does not cover the stroke that Stan covers).

Utley's simple/natural approach to the process of putting is a stark contrast to Peltz more mechanical/technical method. After reading this book, I have relaxed more over my putts and the biggest thing for me was alignment and the placement of my forarms. I am already more confident with my putting and can focus more on distance and read instead of mechanics.The book could use some better editing, more examples/pictures at different moments in the process, but all in all a great approach to putting that will improve anyones performance who is frustrated with this aspect of their game.

After a very short time convincing myself that swinging the putterhead square to the swing arc would work, it took hold. I am very confident in my putting now. The amazing thing is that my distances seemed to just come natural. Another outstanding benefit is that this concept of keeping the clubhead square to the swing arc helped my full swing dramatically. I plan to take some lessons from Utley himself if I can get them scheduled. If his instruction can make this much difference via a book, I can only imagine where I could get if I got some one on one time with him.

So he goes to the 616 universe, mates with human women, goes back to his dimension, bides his time, and finally brings them all to his dimension using some convoluted teleportation spell.And therein lies the gaping plot hole. If he can't leave the dimension, then his plan to get back to Earth can't involve travelling to Earth or the whole thing is unnecessary.And even worse is the dialogue.And even worse is Philip Tan's bizarre fusion of realism and manga.

In fact, the same can be said for just about any Chuck Austen penned story arc to date. In this story, Chuck Austen easily throws out Nightcrawler's true character and replaces it with his own nonsensical swill and prooves once again that he is the one man capable of sullying the legend of the X-Men, over, and over, and over again. Perhaps if the artists had something good to work with, the pages might actually look good for a change, as opposed to the continuously uninspired artwork of the two manga-heavy pencilers currently on the book.

I made it through only 60% of the book before I allowed myself to just GIVE UP and not read anymore. Dear Lord, the characters were such horrible stereotypes that I didn't care if got married, divorced, or fell off the planet: The spoiled heiress who is dimmer than a 4watt bulb and the tortured hero so full of angst he really needed professional help than true love. I do agree with other reviewers that the supporting characters (Jack's loyal servants and his siblings) are the scene stealers in this book. I love regency romances too.

I also noticed the shaft was bent near the handle. That may have been the cause of it not opening correctly. I was also disappointed with the coverage size of the umbrella, but that could have been a lack of reading the description on my part. Overall it felt cheaply made and I will be returning it for a refund. Thanks to Amazon for having such a great, hassle free return process! As a side note, I have since gone to Walmart and purchased a Totes brand, automatic open umbrella for around $13.

Sometimes things are explained multiple times, with might cause some slight annoyance, and in some cases parts of an example aren't explained at all, which leaves you wondering what something is used for.To sum it all up, this book is certainly worth the money, and I can definitely recommend it if you're looking to get started with Smarty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"The code errors are inexcusable.

A daguerrotype is not a photograph, and by 1874, hardly anyone was using such outdated technology, surely not at the White House. That would be like finding a mimeograph at the 2009 White House. This error would have been easy for the author, or the editors, if there were any, to correct... so I wondered immediately, what else did he get wrong? Lots and lots... and I second the comments of other reviewers that this \\"novel\\" is loaded with cardboard figures, outdated stereotypes, and so forth, to the point that the writing quickly turned into self-parody. But it's good for a laugh, if you're stuck on a plane with nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predicatble...full of stereotypical characters","review":"This was our book club book and I really struggled using precious time to get through it. However, most of the other ladies in the club really liked it. I felt like the author used the thesaurus to insert words to impress. Too many, \\"I said, she said, he said, etc.\\" The story seemed contrived. When a man writes from a woman's perspective, there is an emotional gap. When May infrequently mentions her children to state how much she misses and loves them, the true despair a mother would feel does not come through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the concept, hated the story....","review":"I really wanted to like this book; excellent premise. However, this is supposed to be a journal (it's not) even with fiction plugged in... the inconsistency just drove me absolutely NUTS (no pun intended if you've read the book)... in one part, May writes a letter to her daughter detailing her sexual exploits. Yet a few chapters later she's all shy and bothered about the same topic... I would think it would have seemed inappropriate to write to her daughter about this than a journal entry to herself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable story with too many stereotypes","review":"The story is an interesting concept, and I had high hopes for a strong historical drama. However, the characters and plot lines are predictable, as if Fergus wrote this in a very lazy manner. There isn't any hint of real creativity, and many of the characters are stereotypes and are not explored beyond the superficial. I found myself wanting certain scenes to go in a different direction, like asking Fergus to put some effort into his writing! The story reads quickly, but other than that, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 white women","review":"What a load of crap!

The journal/letter style communication seemed in authentic. Additionally, the nature of the ending made it awkward. I wish it was just written in third person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"My book club read this book a few months ago. We were all very disappointed. The premise is wonderful and could have been a basis for an excellent story meshing two cultures. Ultimately it is a poorly written below avergae romance type book with a lead character who is manipulated to fit an unbelievable story line. The author often finds himself in a position where he \\"needs\\" an item (ie- a towel), has the heroine pull one out of her teepee and then explains she happened to bring one with her years before. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"get real, Jim","review":"I was very, very disappointed in this book. I found it trite, contrived, and in general demeaning to all women, all nationalities, and to the members of the clergy who were mentioned. The characters were so stereotyped that they were not believable. May Dodd herself was just not believable; the handsome captain fell in love with her, lo and behold, the CHIEF also picked her, what a coincidence! No woman of that era and of her upbringing would have been so open about sexual matters regardless of her \\"renegade\\" nature. Here are examples of the contrived nature of the text: a \\"black\\" Indian for the \\"black\\" woman, twins for the twins, a big dumb Indian for poor \\"ugly\\" Gretchen (not an attractive representation of Swiss or Germans), and let's not forget the \\"Nancy boys\\" how could you have a novel without mentioning homosexuality as well? Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up this book because I love a good historical novel, and the premise of this one sounded intriguing. I've never read a Harlequin romance, but this book is what I imagine is just a notch above one of those. May seemed like a cardboard character, her comrade brides absurd caricatures of a Southern belle, Irish twins, a tomboy mule skinner, a religious nut, an Amazonian African American, and a Swiss milkmaid -- each just as unappealing as Rene Zelwegger's exaggerated hillbilly in the film, Cold Mountain. I lacked any sense of what May's Cheyenne chief -- or, for that matter, any of the Indians -- was all about, although the rationale for this could be that the story was told from May's perspective and she couldn't speak the Cheyenne language. Maybe it would have been better to have had her the character be the one who learned the language easily, in order to get more of the Cheyennes' viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too 1 dimensional","review":"I was looking foward to reading this, but was sorely dissapointed. My main gripe is simply that the characters are flat, inconsistent and unrealistic. The ending was a dissapointment. I felt no real emotion, and no liking for the main character. I flipped through this book in 2 days, skipping many pages because the story was slow. Detail about emotions, relationships, etc. would have been great, but this was, after, written by a man. Pick up something like Follow the River instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real","review":"I read this for my book club and am glad I got it from the library instead of wasting my money buying it. It was on a level with a beach romance, unbelievable characters behaving in unbelievable ways in a yawner of a book. I am amazed some readers liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous Premise","review":"Book club selection was assigned. I was skeptical about the premise of this book from the start. The female characters were predictable stereotypes based on 21st century values and judgements. Read like a bad Hollywood movie.Truly tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy, Predictable, Cliche","review":"Do not waste your time or money on this book if you have any dignity. This book is for poorly educated women who dote on the sentimentality of trash like \\"The Notebook.\\" The stereotypical cast of characters is at best cliche. The author does not have a clue about how a woman's heart or mind function, especially a woman of May Dodd's social class and era. The idea of basing a novel on the the agreement between the US government and the Native American tribes, was the only highlight of this book. Had this concept been written by a more capable author, it would have been worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes Abound","review":"This book served as a distraction on a long and bumpy plane flight, but otherwise I probably wouldn't have gotten much past Mary Dodd's train journey \\"out West.\\" How much harder this book would have been to write had our heroine's small group not included such a fine array of the ethnic stereotypes that have succored the authors of potboilers down the years: the faded Southern Belle complete with lapdog (that her Cheyenne mate, amazingly, presumably feeds and shelters), the lumpy and warm-hearted Germanic (Austrian) madchen, the regal black woman, the felonious Irish twins, the mannish British woman... Oh, and the almost impenetrable \\"accents\\"... surely they wouldn't have been necessary had there been any meaningful characterization. I'm sorry: this is just not a good book. But, Mr. Fergus, you're probably not a bad writer when you write about what you know -- which certainly doesn't include women of any era, much less of the nineteenth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Journey into Indian Country","review":"It's hard to imagine that a man wrote this story. It is a narative, all from a womans point of view and a very entertaining piece of fiction. The characters seem ,from the start, to be steryotypes but they are sympathetic and reflect the time and place..The description of the land and and traveling west is beautifully written.. A reader will get caught up in the many difficulties faced by settlers on the trail into the western territories.It also portrays the Native American in a sense of tragic exploitation. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and imaginitive story","review":"This is a well written book of an interesting story.

Interesting fictional account based upon an actual proposition of trading 1,000 horses for 1,000 white women. Female characters were so interesting as was the insight into Cheyenne culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance or historical fiction?","review":"Seems as if the author couldn't quite make up his mind. Did he want to write a bodice-ripper or was he trying for historical fiction? At any rate, I was put off by his attempts to bridge the two genres.The book's protagonist, May Dodd, was an unlikely character for the times. She had ideas and morals that would have been advanced in the 1970s in many parts of the USA, much less in the 1870s. Too much \\"pat\\" dialogue and plot twists to advance the storyline. Very contrived.Since I am no fan of Harlequin-type romance books, this work was disappointing. Too bad, since the initial idea for the book is an interesting concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I can not believe this book was fiction!

A page-turner that gives names and faces to many of the unknown people of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel was excellent!!","review":"One Thousand White Women is an excellent novel about May Dodd and a group of white women volunteer for the \\"Brides for Indians\\" program, where white women would go to the prairie, live with Indians, bear their children, and introduce them into the white world.

Granted, it has unrealistic incidents, but the reader knows going into this book that it is FICTION.I really liked May, and enjoyed the author's way of telling the story through her journal entries'.I started the book and found that I couldn't stop thinking of the characters when I was away, so I sat down and finished it in two days. I can't argue that this couldn't have happened, but it is a really good story and a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not historical fiction","review":"Unbelievable, absurd, racist.

Such an interesting story and one of those books that you don't want to end. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like nonfiction","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down, and I talked about it for weeks. It reads more like a true story than a novel, and everyone who reads it wonders if it really was based on a true story, but it is not. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is supposedly based upon a true request made by a Cheyenne chief, who proposed trading white women for horses in 1854. His premise was to help integrate the Cheyennes into the new dominant white society, which isn't so bizarre when you realize that our government eventually took all Native American children and placed them in boarding schools in order to do the exact same thing. Which idea is worse? So, the book follows the stories of the women who became experimental marital ambassadors to the Native Americans. It is fascinating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meet May Dodd, an American Girl by Harlequin Romances!","review":"This book, which had such an interesting premise, could be one of the most poorly executed books I have ever read! It is written at about a fifth grade level, but is not appropriate for a fifth grader due to the author's obsession with erections, mass rapes, and bodice-ripping sex! There is also blatant gender and racial stereotyping-embarrassingly so! There has got to be far superior historical fiction out there dealing with the plight of Native Americans -do your research and skip this one at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Thousand White Women","review":"I don't I think would have been as brave as some of these women to assimilate into a Native American culture.

I will only keep going as some reviewers at the same state as I am stated that it turns out a bit better.There is too much in the way of 21st century point of view over painted on a 19th century story. The characters are one dimensional. There is little historical sense of place and time. A rather colonial point of view throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Thousand White Women: The Journals of May Dodd","review":"Prior to ordering this, I read in a newspaper book review, that it was an actual journal (true story) written by May Dodd. So, I ordered it from Amazon and it was promptly delivered. However, I was so disappointed to learn in the introduction, that the book is fiction. I'm struggling to finish it as it now seems totally corny."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Believe This Book Is Fiction","review":"This book grabbed my interest immediately. I have never really been a \\"wild west\\" fan, so that says allot. The story is so believable that I had to constantly remind myself that this is fiction. While some parts are rather graphic and disturbing, it isn't hard to believe that life in an Indian settlement must really have been as described by the main character. I can't wait to discuss this great book with my book club in a few weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I found this book to be a great example of how such an event could have really occurred. It is quite frank and tells the story of one woman (and others too) who married into the Cheyenne. I often have wondered, \\"How did they live from day to day? Eating? Sleeping? Keeping clean?!\\" This book tells it all. I do not know how close to the truth it is, but I feel like it gives a fairly good description of everyday life.If this review sounds too educational, let me say this--I had a hard time putting it down and kept wanting to read until I finished it. It's a great book, and you will enjoy it immensely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I work in a bookstore, and when a customer asked after this book, I had to check it out myself. Ultimately, I was disappointed. The storyline is somewhat cliche - think classic Indian romance novel - mixed with terrible character development and a predictable plot. Normally I encourage people to read books for themselves and form their own opinions, but on this one, I wouldn't waste your time. Reading the title and description will allow your imagination to come up with a much more interesting story than what the author provided between the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I am in the midst of reading '300 great novels' as in several lists I found online and decided to read something light. I loved this book and stayed up one night to finish it. I had to keep saying-'This is fiction' and not true. A unique plot and well written. I'm surprised some people didn't like it. Let those naysayers try the classic 'To the Lighthouse' which was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beach reading but NOT REALISTIC!","review":"It was an entertaining read but hardly great fiction and far from realistic. I felt like this was more in line of pulp fiction than literary fiction -- enjoyable but not memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on.","review":"The extremely interesting premise made me want to read this book, but I should have headed the advice of some of the female readers below. The writing is so stilted and forced that it entirely distracts from everything going on in the book. It is extremely clear that a man in 1999 is writing as May, a women in 1875. The pretentious writing and poorly developed characters, who lack any sort of realism, make ths book unbearable. I can't speak to the plot because I only got through four chapters before I gave up (the first time I have ever not finished a fiction book). I have no idea how this writer ever got a book deal. Please don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodice-ripper novel-lovers rejoice!","review":"How did the publisher miss getting Fabio to pose for the book jacket? This novel is purple in prose and preposterous in plot. And if that weren't enough, it's peppered with howler anachronisms. Would an American woman in the 1870s really use the word \\"sadistic?\\" True, she's quite adventurous, but Freud wasn't publishing yet and it's very unlikely she could have gotten her hands on de Sade.Don't waste your time on this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it 0 stars if I could","review":"I am motivated to write a review in order to offset the overwhelming positive comments on this book. I read it for a book club and have to say this is absolutely the worst book I've read in a long time. The only good thing about it is the premise which is an interesting idea. However this is not sufficient to offset awful writing, tediously repetitive details, and uninteresting characters (as mentioned by some other reviewers, the protagonist is particularly irritating)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egregiously, Absurdly Bad Book","review":"You ladies out there, pay attention: this is what gives \\"books for women\\" a bad name! I don't have the stamina to go into this book's manifold idiocies (it was assigned by my bookclub; never even heard of it before that). Just please read some of the other one star reviews and have more self-respect than to stoop to read this absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"good grief ...harlequin romance meets wild west","review":"I like historical fiction... and this is not historical fiction.I would not have imagined so many sterotypes and predictable moments could be fit into one book. Plain silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The writing was banal at best. It is fierce irony that such a mediocre writer would quote Shakespeare. The characters were shallow, ill conceived and predictable. An example of the down side to book clubs. One star because ZERO was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters were a little off","review":"Although this book grabbed my attention initially, it slowed down about half way through and I had a hard time getting through it. The characters in this book just seemed \\"off.\\" There are so many things that the female characters in this book do and say that just seems so unrealistic. The women in this book embrace the Cheyenne culture, lifestyle and their new husbands so immediately without any longing for their past lives, modern civilization, or any thought to when the bride experiment will be over. The women who are kidnapped and raped in the book seem to get over the experience like a chest cold. As a woman myself, I can't imagine myself in situations like these women are and being as nonchalant about it. Because the author's depiction of women in this book is so inaccurate, it makes me wonder how realistically he portrayed the Cheyenne as well. This book has an interesting premise it just could have been so much better than it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Good book, I enjoyed it. It was our book of the month for our book club. Looking forward to the discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Thousand White Women","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it sometime ago and got my book club to read it. I actually purchased this copy as a gift for a friend. It's a wonderful story about some fascinating women!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane book made worse by Kindle typos","review":"In addition to being an incredibly sophomoric and inane book, the Kindle version is replete with annoying typographic errors, making it irritating and nearly impossible to read. Somehow a lot of s's have been replaced with d's. See, for example the poem at the start of Notebook IV, The Devil Whiskey. \\"jumble of bodies\\" has become \\"jumble of bodied\\", \\"some\\" has become \\"dome\\", \\"couples\\" has become \\"coupled\\" and these are just a few lines of the poem. There are many other examples of the substitution of d for s, but it is particularly egregious here.In another error, what should be the contraction 'll has come out as 1 1 instead with no punctuation.If I were into conspiracy theories, I would say that the publishers were trying to kill e-books by selling books with so many errors. I can't imagine that the print version contained all of these typos.This is the third Kindle book I have purchased that is loaded with typos."},{"rating":"2","title":"a spectacular, enthralling story","review":"Our little local book club selected this title for our last month's read. Every one of us 5 members thought this was the best book we have selected since the beginning of our group. The heroine, May Dodd, relates her experiences with the Cheyenne Indians in a detailed, personal, and engaging style. How could this work of fiction not be historically accurate? It is so believable. The characters are well developed, diverse, and totally lovable. It is a heartbreaking account of the way the U.S. government dealt with the \\"problem of the savages\\". I won't summarize any of the plot and story line, because you must read it for yourself! Our group is particularly interested in the depiction of women as strong, determined, defiant, and independent. This book satisfied our lust for adventure, love, and respect for all humanity. Do not fail to read this one!!! How could a male write such a wonderful story from a woman's perspective? We have got to meet this man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the time","review":"I just finished reading this book and only did finish because I was on vacation and did not have another thing to read. I am an historical fiction lover but this was just too bizare for me...I give the author credit for his imagination but the story just did not work for me. It was boring and far too much time was spent on where they went to the bathroom. Interesting characters I guess but just too weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"Had to read for a book club. I couldn't overlook the poor writing. The author used every horrible stereotype and cliche. The culture was so unreliable. Although the author indicated that this was fiction, it was far from historical fiction. It was boring, predictable, and juvenile."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible book!!!","review":"This subject had such promise! Unfortunately the author turned it into a Harlequin Romance bodice ripper novel about exploited, misunderstood white women who could only find understanding by \\"volunteering\\" to become the wives of a Native American chief who was hoping to broker a cross cultural understanding by \\"marrying\\" his family to white women.He perpetuates every stereotype of native americans and the sexual motives of women that have come down through time. Shame on you!! This could have been a fantastic historical novel. I am sorely disappointed!! You have done a disservice to everyone involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating.....","review":"I found this book to be a quick but fascinating read. I loved the premise of the book, and the writing in fantastic. You get great descriptions of each unique individual, and you come to care about them. I think this book capture the sense of imprisonment some women must have felt about their society at the time, and how freedom maybe the greatest gift a person can receive. I can re-read this book and not be bored. I think this is an excellent way to spend an afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! I couldn't put it down!","review":"This is a story of survival. It helped me put into perspective problems that we face in today's modern world....they just don't compare to what these women faced in the book. This book is well written with descriptions of the surroundings that truly take you into the wild. This is a must read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This author's going places","review":"It's hard to believe that this is a first novel. Jim Fergus so skilfully weaves his intriguing tale that it seems as though the reader is watching the story unfold at the movies, not in the pages of a paperback. But this is no Grisham, God forbid. History comes alive through the embellished real characters Fergus employs and Fergus' empathy with the last of the \\"free\\" Cheyenne indians is powerfully felt. A superb read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the book worst book ever written","review":"This book is filled with bias and historically inaccurate. Do not read it. This is the worst book I ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"A friend of mine sent this to me while I was deployed and I spent every spare second reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor character development","review":"This is not based on history, I read it because I thought it was. It lacked depth to the characters. I was very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical Western","review":"When I read a book based on something that could have happened historically, I would like for it to be at least realistic. Some content was disturbing and offensive to me from rape and murder to horrible mental institutions. I think the story could have been told without a lot of this and actually been a decent Western. Don't know how this book ever got into print!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"Eat, Pray, Love meets the west. The heroine in this novel is a judgmental sanctimoniously implausible character who epitomizes progressive party views. I didn't even read to where she meets her husband to know that bad things are in store for the Christian character and the southern bigot. Hardly imaginative, this theme has been done. She occasionally stops forming opinions about her fellow travelers to whine about her circumstances. Save your money and just watch NBC news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not order and here's why","review":"When you offer a sample of an audiobook, as you do for this one, why does the sample consist solely of the book intro, read by someone OTHER than the person who will read the book? Perhaps the overriding reason for listening to a sample is to see what the reader sounds like. No can do here...so didn't order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get into it","review":"I was SOOO bummed. I gave this book until page 120...and I just could not get into it. The beginning intrigued me, and I was excited to think how much fun this book was going to be to read! It just kept getting more and more boring, and more and more unbelievable. I realize the book is fiction. But there just was not an ounce of believablity in it. Its hard to mix real history with such an outrageous story like this.There were too many characters to have to keep up with and keep the names straight. I did not know who the book was talking about half of the time. Also, the \\"accented dialogue\\" was confusing and hard to read. I understand that the author was probably trying to make the book funnier, but it just made those sections harder to read.Clever idea for a book, just could not get into it :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful waste of time","review":"I'll admit, I didn't finish the book, but I did make it more than half way through it. I never throw out books. I donate them, pass them on to friends, etc. I threw this book out. It is truly offensive, particularly to women and Native Americans. Way to feed into every negative sterotype out there. And to the author, pick a timeframe and show the women in that timeframe rationally rather than making them seem absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the year","review":"I first have to compliment the author on his honesty, noting that this book is a TOTAL work of fiction. Don't think it's an historical novel just because he uses the names of real people and places of that period, because NOTHING is historically accurate ... not even the geography of the United States at that time. The author's perspective reveals an immature view of human relationships, with women in particular. The dialog is peppered with cliche, and the characters are stereotypical caricatures. The book is insulting to women and Native Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner!!","review":"What a wonderful book. I couldn't put it down. The characters were so real they inspired me with their heroism and their will to survive. I can image that some of this actually took place in our great country. Loved the account of life in a Cheyenne village. It read like pure history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever!","review":"I did like this even though I was tricked into thinking it was actually true. I would recommend to anyone looking for some insight into our American past and to the plight of Native Americans at the hands of our Government and its agents. The yarn is well done, I think, if historically inaccurate - but plausible. Our book club loved it. I was the only \\"like it\\" reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Thousand White Women: The Journals of May Dodd","review":"It was an encouragement to women to become free of old formal traditions. This would heal any broken heart. All the women would have rather had a simple home life but had to make a choice and they made their life and other lives much more happier. I did love it.

First time I recall all being in agreement on a book - this was the worst! What a shallow fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"I have never written a review but this book irritated me so much and on so many levels I had to express my opinion. If anyone could be fooled that this was a true diary, all they need to do is read something written in the period. Annoying book, irritating characters, and ridiculous plot. If I hadn't been reading it for a book club, I would have tossed it after the first couple of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been written as straight non fiction","review":"I am forcing myself to finish this miserable book only because it is our summer read for my book club. While the facts about the Cheyenne Indians are interesting and most probably not widely known the story line that holds it together is poorly written. Do Not Waste Your Money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written like a bad Lifetime Movie.","review":"Terribly written book. Filled with stereotypical characters, and the typical message that rich white people are evil. The writing style is contrived and forced. It was like reading the most god-awful Lifetime movie played with the worst B list actors. The worst part about this book is that it's not written in the languistic style of the period. Frankly, people and especially a woman of the social class that the book claims May Dod comes from did not talk like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY INTERESTING","review":"I really enjoyed this book! The story was engaging and fascinating! I felt I knew the characters and worried about their welfare. I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Harlequin Romance","review":"Looking forward to learning something about this supposed historical event I'd never heard of, I settled in for a good read. I was thoroughly disgusted by the time I finished it.The sex and birth scenes are written from the perspective of a man, not a woman as you'd expect in a woman's diary, and an immature man at that. Very unbelievable.If you want to read a Harlequin Romance, but want to talk yourself into thinking you are actually reading a historically based meaningful novel, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book manage to get in print!","review":"If I could rate this below one star I would. This book covered every stereotype possible: the boozy, trashy, red-headed Irish twins; the big, homely, muscular, Swede; the racist, phony, southern belle; the filthy, rotted-tooth little Frenchman, etc. Of course, the heroine is \\"chosen\\" by the most well-respected and good looking brave. The author made sure there was a mate for every one of his characters, there even \\"happened\\" to be one Black brave to be paired with the regal, non-conformist, former slave woman.The premise to this novel is original but everything else was so cliche' it was embarrassing.The only part of the book the author seemed to put any effort into were the elaborate, porn-like, sex encounters. I'm no prude but these scenes were thrown in helter-skelter and added nothing to the story line what-so-ever.Don't waste your money or your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"clueless!","review":"I simply cannot fathom how this book has gotten so much positive press. The writer(male) is woefully ignorant of the landscape of a woman's heart. The idea that the men of the Cheyenne tribe would tolerate some of the behaviors of the women is ridiculous. Like others have mentioned, the idea of the journal was a good one, but the way she wrote it was far beyond the reach of credibility. The characters were undeveloped- cartoonish. I really hate being so negative, but in this case, I can only give the author 1 star for a creative idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 White Women","review":"A male writer for sports and outdoor magazines has written a piece of historical fiction from a woman's point of view.... However, the writing is amateur, the point of view 21st century p.c., and the characters [typical]. When heroine & protagonist May Dodd, daughter of a wealthy, socially prominent Chicago family, is forced to go to work in a chicken factory, she claims it was \\"oddly liberating to be out in the real world.\\"... Definitely a 19th century expression... The characters she meets on the train west include a black well-spoken ex-slave, a manly Englishwoman who has a feeling that they will be \\"spiffy good friends,\\" a pair of Irish sisters who are, what else, \\"redheaded, freckle-faced identical twin [girls],\\" and a \\"large, boisterous, buxom rosy-cheeked [woman]\\" who likes to sing folksongs in a robust voice... This pseudo-historic pulp fiction western romance seems to have been written to cash in on the voracious reading appetites of women's book clubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disguised Harlequin Romance","review":"The diary approach: a literary device aimed at disguising lack of talent or effort (ref: the Secret Diary of Ann Boleyn, equally poorly written).This book feels like a bunch of male fantasies, from the insane asylum to the couplings with savages. It offers little to no exploration of characters; and a gross oversimplification of situations and reactions. Why oh why was the prologue so funny, when the rest of the book fell so flat? Was it even written by the same person?PS: each time the main character repeated Good God I thought I'd scream. Did some bored reader count? NOT a good book club choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Don't bother.","review":"I was drawn to read this book by the premise-- how would American history have been different if there had been a massive program for assimilation of Native Americans or integration of the two races through marriage? In an alternate history, maybe the white folks would have learned something-- maybe even some respect for the earth? Given racism it is not a likely premise, but I looked forward to reading hopeful novel of \\"what might have been\\".This novel disappointed in every way. Other reviewers detail the super-hero protagonist and her stereotyped side-kicks. I slogged through the first third of the book hoping that the arrival of the Cheyanne characters would improve the tone of the book. But no, it got worse. It felt like reading the same story over and over again.I found no redeeming qualities of this book. I would rate lower than one star if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"How did this book get published? Can I get a refund? If you haven't bought this book yet, do yourself a favor - don't. Unless, like me, you were the unsuspecting victim of a book club selection. But if you are looking for fantasy fiction of the bodice ripping, throbbing member variety, with improbable characters and trite, cliche-filled writing, this is the book for you. On a serious note, the book is an insult to women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely historically correct","review":"I am about half through the book; it's OK, but not terribly historically accurate. Am I the only one who noticed that Phemie is singing \\"This Train is Bound For Glory\\" which was written by Woody Guthrie in the 1900's? I find myself looking up other aspects on line to make sure that they are accurate. If you want a good, historical fiction book about the plains Native Americans, I suggest \\"Hanta Yo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books, and one of only a select few that I have read a second time. I have purchased it for several family members and friends and they all have loved it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"Loved this book. We read it for our book club and everyone said how great the story was. A bit of everything for everyone, and hard to believe it is fiction. I couldn't put it down in the final chapters and read into the wee hours of the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable book","review":"This is an amazing book. I knew it wasn't real but it felt like a true story. The writer brings you into the story and makes you feel. Make sure you read every page from beginning to end. Not only was the story exciting but it makes you wonder about our government and you ask yourself why. I talk about this book as if really happened. I laughed, cried and got angry. The only thing I was disappointed in was that it had to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful","review":"I love history in all it's way's !

The author goes to great lengths to explain that this is not a true story but it drew me in to believe that it could have been. It is full of characters of all shapes and sizes.

However, not for ONE split second did I believe that 1) this was a woman writing or 2) that this was written by someone of the time period.The plot and dialogue were both cliched and completely contemporary. The writing style was so \\"not of the period\\" that it was laughable. The characters were pretty one-dimensional. But I got through it for my book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Thousand White Women","review":"I was pleased with the development of the the women in this story, and the way the author was able to bring them together to support and care for one another. The women were unique, and yet much like so many women I have met. If you are looking for a neat and tidy \\"happily ever after\\" story, this is not it. The ending is surprising, sad, and realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with stereotypes","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. It was nothing but stereotypes and was a great disappointment. Also, I found it troubling how much time the author spent talking about the main character going to the bathroom. Once would have been enough. Please don't waste your time reading this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One thousand White Women","review":"Compelling! Right up to the very end, I believed it was a true historical novel based on actual events. Very well written and full of suspense. A little gory at times but true to the character of the book, it had to be included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Fiction","review":"I've known of this book for quite some time, and now I finally got a chance to read it. I found the setting and subject quite refreshing, for the author has definitely done his research on the lives and culture of the Cheyenne and surrounding tribes.You will definitely find the drama in this book, with a little bit of squeamish violence. You will find a little bit of comedy as well, as the women try to adjust to the new culture. I feel that the journals of May Dodd ended a little too abruptly, which disappointed me a bit. I thought that there was more that the author could have said, instead of ending it the way he did.Really good fiction though. Definitely will read it again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great historical perspective.","review":"I realize this is not a detailing of an actual occurrence, but it is so well written, it could be.

The females of this novel were most interesting and had well-developed characterizations. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"I relish fiction which is written (and researched) as if it were a true account. This is such a book. Had it been a true account, it might have been richer in detail and depth and might have been more emotional, but still worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adventure","review":"I found this book to be engaging,entertaining and well written. The author made you feel like you were right there during that time period. The author exposed a piece of her life that shared how early America was settled.

This is not a work of pulp fiction, but an honest thesis discussing cultural issues in such a delightful form as a novel. I recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story","review":"Once you've opened this book you can't stop reading it. A different view of an other fascinating culture. May Dodd is a very courageous young woman with a great heart and who isn't blind to people who aren't like her. It's very interessing to see how someone could be intergrated to an indian tribe even being white. The message in the book is quite clear: people condemn others far to easily. Indians are wild but they have a very comprehesive culture based on the same ideas as ours. I think we can learn a lot of from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great novel for women","review":"I love stories about times past and how women handled life..although this is fiction, truth rings out in every page.It makes me really appreciate my life and how easy we do have it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I read this novel because I wanted to learn more about Native American culture, and that's about all that it's good for. The rest of it is a really bad combination of melodrama, psuedo-feminist blather, and every late 19th-century racial/ethnic sterotype that you can think of. The characters are narrowly-drawn and completely lack any depth, and the story reads like a bad romance novel. The details about life among the Cheyenne Indians are the only part of the novel worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"Someone recommended this book to me on a recent trip and unfortunately I believed her when she said it was great. I'm sorry to say, this is one of the worst books I've ever read and a very poor excuse for \\"historical fiction\\". The premise of the story was great, however, the author turned it into a cheap, trashy, uninteresting romance novel with boring characters that don't even come close to being likeable.I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy and am sorry I wasted so much time trying to get through it. Thank God I only paid a buck for it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the awards?","review":"This book is one of the most wonderful, well written books so far this year. Is someone at the NY Times sleeping? Mr. Fergus has the reader entirely wrapped up in the lives of the \\"Brides for Indians\\" in a ficticious journal. One had to look to make sure that it was fiction, it was so well written. Neither the white nor indian population was romanticized as in previous works. One got an accurate idea of the lives of the unfortunate Cheyenne through the writings of Mr. fergus. One had to wonder, however, if Ms. Dodd was truly a little more \\"ahead of her times\\" as she truly is an example of feminist altruism. This is a book I will highly recommend and will read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordianry insight of life in America in the 1870's","review":"This is a page turner, not in the usual sense.

Granted, she's as 21st century woman as can be, and the characters are typical. But I like typical because it fits the book. The ending is sad. I hate it when a book has the potential to totally work out in the end and then the author makes it end horrifically. Yech.In any event, May was a fun character. But too male-written.

If I had read it, I wouldn't have finished it. I did think I would stop several times but decided I wanted to find out what happened in the end. Yes, this book was written by a man and YES, you could tell. I was not impressed. The book was preachy and the idea that this was how someone would write in a journal is absurd.

It could have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Titillation","review":"Decided I disliked the whole premise. Destruction of native Indian civilizations is a very \\"grave\\" subject but seemed to be manipulated for purposes of titillation, voyeurism, and mass-merchandising. Too many details (hypothecated/ fabricated) trying to chase a narrative.Does seem to have some application and portent for us via middle-class extinction program. Corporations have generated enormous CEO bonuses/ stockholder dividends for sending jobs overseas?? Right, we all just want to be penniless cogs in the machine.

I plowed through the book but found it boorish, improbable, stereotypical, and endless. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Louis L'Amour does a far better job of capturing the wild West and the culture of Indians of that period. The book makes you believe it is real, but is really fiction based on one small factoid, which itself may have never actually happened: the trading of white women for horses with the western American Indians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Good writing style, terrible concept: Post-Civil War, President Grant approves a program to marry off women from the dregs of society (ie, mental institutions, jails, ex-slaves, alcoholics, etc) to a tribe of Native Americans in order to create a mixed-race. Supposedly, this is meant to make the assimilate the Native Americans into our new American culture within a generation as the women reproduce with the Native Americans.It's probably one of the worst historical fiction books I've ever read. Immensely demeaning to women, the protagonist is probably supposed to be a spirited woman far ahead of her time. I found her insulting and could never connect with her on any level. The author clearly means to present Native Americans in a sympathetic light, as well, but only succeeds in perpetuating too many stereotypes.I'd like to be able to say that the storyline improved by the end of the book, but unfortunately, I never made it that far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was so intrigued by this book- just couldn't put it down-","review":"This book is unlike any other that I have read. The author is sure to let you know from the beginning that it is fiction, however after reading this book you will do some wondering. Don't take this book on a vacation- you will never want to leave the hotel and do anything else! Already interested in Native American History, this makes me want to do some research and learn more about the Cheyenne Tribe."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Fantasy!","review":"My book club and I found May Dodd's early comments irritating and implausible. I couldn't imagine any woman of her era acting or thinking as she did. Her love life was impossible for a woman of her background and how she could have left her children seems highly unlikely. Had she jumped ship (so to speak) and left the train early on to get back to the children she SAYS she loves so much, it would have made sense - but then where would the author have been with his book idea? Nowhere! The women of pioneer days were courageous, serious and determined. I found May frivilous in her thoughts and many of her deeds. I hate to bash a writer as I'm sure the author worked hard on this novel, but for my group of 5 women, this novel just didn't seem reasonable. Maybe this is how Jim Fergus thinks a pioneer woman might behave, but we just never could come to terms with his ideas. Sorry, but we all agreed it was one of the worst offerings our club ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp Western","review":"As a light read, Fergus' novel succeeds, but many failures must be overlooked. Telling the story through the journals works best when May is describing in narrative the way of life among the Cheyenne. I found the passages in her journals written in dialogue awkward- more like a script than personal writing. Read as entertainment, the cast of characters holds the reader's interest but offers no insights into the relations between the native Americans and the encroaching whites. (And may in fact, damage relations with the Irish, the Swiss, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This book has an interesting premise, but its execution lacks skill and intrigue. It is filled with one-dimensional characters, repetition and silliness. There are far superior books about similar subjects on the market; I heartily agree with the reader who recommends \\"Follow the River.\\" Take a pass on \\"On Thousand White Women.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic protrayal of American Indian Life","review":"This story was too far fetched to be believeable, and the character May Dodd was too full of herself to arouse sympathy. Most disturbing was the unrealistic protrayal of life in the West. It was not all freedom, nature, and wild beauty. The Indians suffered from disease, poor sanitation, insects crawling over everything, and had very short average life spans. Life on the plains was hard. A forty year old Indian would not look younger than his age, as the chief was described here, but would be missing most of his teeth, and be weathered from outdoor life. The ending at least is realistic, but sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted time and money","review":"Like many others, I read this book for my book club. It is the only reason that I completed reading this horrendous piece of trash.My first impression of the book is of a man getting his jollies writing this absurd and raunchy rubbish that is somehow being passed off as \\"literature.\\" If he thinks he even came close to writing how a female thinks, feels, or speaks, or what a woman wants, he needs some education.I love historical fiction, but this isn't even written well, and I feel so sorry for those who reviewed this book, citing it as the greatest book they had ever read. To what have the minds of Americans been reduced?

I wanted to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I really liked this book. It was so well written in journal form that I had to remind myself a time or two that it was fiction. I admit there were times when I thought some of the things Mary did were a little hard to believe, and honestly the idea of the government trading citizens (women at that) for horses is a little hard to imagine, but truth is often stranger than fiction. I got over those issues quickly and enjoyed the story.I image we did much worse to the native Americans than this book details and it is not something that makes me, as a white man, very proud. But that being said, this book is a great read! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this one!","review":"I read this one a long time ago in paperback.

For anyone who prefers to get their history via fiction, it's one of those....of course, you have to know where history leaves off and fiction begins, and the author pretty much covers that in a prologue, and gives pointers to history in his bibliography.

And I think Fergus did a convincing female POV."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt betrayed by the author","review":"I thought this book was really good until the last couple of chapters.

When they mentioned the title of this book I could not imagine what it was about and visualized something like the Million Man March...in reverse? :-)Even when they told me a bit of the plot line I wasn't sure about \\"One Thousand White Women\\". But they said they couldn't put it down so I gave it a try. I loved it - so much so that I bought it as a gift for someone else. The book intertwines a bit of a real story with 'what might have been'. I found myself so engrossed in the book that I forgot it was fiction...and wished it wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review of One Thousand White Women","review":"The book, One Thousand White Women, is so well written that I placed other reading materials aside so I could read it without distractions.

It does seem to be well-researched but I felt that the characters were two-dimensional stereotypes and seemed to be written simply to be sympathetic for a contemporary reader, with contemporary sensibilities. They were not believeable 19th century characters. As a woman, I also felt that the main character was too obviously a woman's perspective written by a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never believable","review":"This book, \\"1000 White Women\\" was disappointing from the start. It constantly sounded like a man trying to write a woman's voice (which he was!) and thus May was completely unbelievable as a 1800's woman, even a spirited, independent one. There were so many things which simply did not \\"ring true\\" as a woman's experience. The flaunting of Native American customs was especially unbelievable, and worrisome. The author may have thought that he was showing respect for the Cheyenne culture, but there were so many mixed messages, it was just a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"GreAT bOOK","review":"I love this book...could be from a real journal!

It was one of those reads that you can't wait to get back to after a long day. Rich characters and superb writing combine to make this hypothetical story a riveting tale. I have to admit that I was hoping for a rosier ending but we all know that was a shameful time in our history. I have recommended this book to a number of people. I know they won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much promise, so little realized","review":"I too had high hopes for this book. The premise is engaging and it could have been a fun and interesting read. As it was I ended up skipping through the book looking for something of interest. The lead character, May was so obnoxious and condescending that I was inclined to believe maybe the family did have good reason for putting her in the asylum---narssicistic borderline personality disorder! I agree with other reviews about all characters being one dimensional and stereo-types. The biggest complaint however was that such an interesting premise could come out so uninteresting. Even the sex scenes, with such a sexually liberated character,were boring! (and come on---everytime she had sex she got pregnant, except when she was raped????)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"Fergus clearly did much research into the life and behavior of the Cheyenne.

That said, I found the work to be a memoir of a fascinating set of episodes in a medieval woman's life, translated in a workmanlike--but generally flat--fashion by Williamson. The foreword provides a bit of historical context for those without an intimate knowledge of the political situation in fifteenth-century Hungary, while the extensive afterword delves into the lives and roles of women in the middle ages, without ever actually getting around to saying much. I cannot really speak to the quality of scholarship in the book, but I would recommend that the lay reader skim the foreword, enjoy the memoirs and skip the afterword altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAST AND VERY EFFECTIVE","review":"This is an awesome video.

For all of the monumentality of the work's structure, the sound itself is often remarkably subtle and elusive - some of the piece's most striking auditory effects are at the very edge of audibility. At times it sounds as if one is hearing a gigantic aeolian harp, not an orchestra at all. All of this accords beautifully with the Rilke text set for chorus in the second movement, which muses on the delicate web of filaments that binds all creation together.

The only issue is that, of course, they are tiny and with kids they will occasionally fall out or come out, and when they drop down between or underneath the airplane seats, good luck! I recommend ordering more than one pair and having spares available! Even considering the price, worth it to have handy. Plus, you can use them over and over again; the packaging states they're only good for one round trip, but I've used them (and my adult sized versions) many times and they still seem to work.

In \\"God's Choice\\" I feel the title is misleading. I expected to see much more on the reasons for and methodology of Pope Bendict's selection as pontiff. Instead, I found the first 30% of the book to be a rehash of John Paul's Pontificate and death, 40% of the book detailing the church's past and current situation and what Mr. Weigel thinks the current Pope needs to do about it and filler. Maybe it should have been entitled \\"Geoge Weigel's View of the needs of Pope Benedict XVI\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A retrograde horror","review":"These accolades of Benedict XVI are clearly by those who fail to understand his horrid background.

Seventh Generation makes some great products (their all-purpose cleaner, shower cleaner, and laundry detergent are great), but unfortunately this automatic dish detergent just doesn't get the job done. Many of the glasses and silverware that go through my dishwasher still come out with a white residue, and pots and pans that formerly got clean come out with nasty baked-on grime. It seems to have particular trouble with residues from milk and from starchy foods like beans, lentils, or rice. Never had any of this trouble with Cascade, which I have now gone back to and it is working great.If you're sensitive to the harsher ingredients in mainstream dish liquids, this does get about 75% of the dishes clean.

We found this and the liquid soap from Seventh Generation and decided to give it a try. We did like the way the liquid soap cleans, but the smell sort of turned us off. When we used the dishwasher gel, however, our dishes came out with dingy brownish spots all over them. It was absolutely disgusting, and we had to rewash our dishes by hand to use them.We have since switched over to the Method smarty dish tablets-much better.

With this product it was a real disappointment. First of all, the bottles were poorly packed, and a couple of them spilled much of their content. A mess. More importantly, this product just does not do the job. I had to wash dishes again after running the dishwasher on a regular basis-even if I had rinsed them before. I like other Seventh Generation products, but this is a real bummer. Additives did not help. I am now back to Cascade Complete.

We'd like to be more environmentally conscious, especially when it comes to cleaning products and other chemical agents. It's a noble goal, but one that isn't met simply by using a product labeled \\"green\\". This dishwasher soap simply doesn't work at actually cleaning dishes. We've tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but after several uses, the only benefit we've gained is the motivation to wash by hand, instead of using a machine. Almost all of our mugs (tea, coffee, etc.) are always dirty after the cycle, and nearly half of our plates and bowls are as well. The green factor of using this soap is completely lost when you consider the volume of water used to run the dishwasher AND the water necessary to rewash the majority of the dishes by hand once the washer has completed.

Having discovered this marvelous performer via my nephew's continuous onslaught of Disney videos (She does the voice of Megera \\"Meg to my friends if I had any\\" in Disney's Hercules), I'm extremely pleased with this CD. I know it has a tune from \\"Bye Bye Birdie\\" but it WORKS (I just have a problem with that show...forgive me Susan!). The tracks from Cabaret (\\"Maybe This Time\\" and the title track) along with \\"I know Him So Well\\" from Chess (With Lisa Richard...another great singer) are extremely powerful.

Standouts include the beautiful \\"The Story Goes On\\", the hilarious \\"Nothing\\", the powerful \\"Cabaret\\", and her gorgeous duet with Lisa Richard, \\"I Know Him So Well\\". Susan also shines on classics like \\"A Wonderful Guy\\", \\"How Lovely To Be A Woman\\", and \\"Much More\\". I highly recommend this CD to anyone with an appreciation for beautiful vocal stylings.

The main highlight of the album is her gorgeous rendition of A Change in Me from Beauty and the Beast, a song written for Toni Braxton 3 years ago. This is the only recording ever made of the song that I am aware of, and it is certainly worth having this album for. Other highlights include her sultry take on Sooner or Later and Maybe This Time.

Kirsten and Carl Dixon have built, literally with their own hands, a slice of heaven in the wilderness. Kirsten's new book captures the majic and majesty of their home on Finger Lake Alaska. Her recipes and narratives make you feel you are there. Actually, I had a chance to see the publisher's proof of the new cookbook during my stay. I even had a chance to join Kirsten in her kitchen to prepare her recipe for Gruyere cheese puffs. I couldn't wait for the book to finally go to press. After reading it again, I definitely plan to go back to Winterlake Lodge. But, in the meantime, I'll have a chance to relive my experience by trying some of Kirsten's simple, yet outstanding, recipes. This is a great book for cooking afficionado's and for those who just want to learn more about the Alaska experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Winterlake Lodge Cookbook","review":"I bought it for my daughter, who is a chef, after seeing it in Homer, AK.

Sea Monkeys can live about two years with proper care and have been known to live longer than that. The only problem is the water can get cloudy but that is easily solved by cleaning. Using the aqua leash included scoop your pets up and place them in their own water in a clean container.

They were designed so that the insert slot was not tight enough to hold the cord. All three of the Belkin Tune-Ties fell off and were lost. So I tried the Smartwraps instead. They are much better! Where you insert the cord is much tighter. They have never unravelled. At this rate, a 3-pack will last me years. This is an inexpensive gift to yourself or someone else. Makes it much easier to keep the cord to MP3 players, etc. from getting in the way, tangled, snagged or cut. Yes, I did cut a headphone cord when I was pruning a tree and didn't notice that the Belkin Tune-Tie had unravelled once again, letting the cord dangle in the path of the shears.

It wasn't one of my favorites of the trilogy, and honestly I found Shannon irritating after having read Maggie's and Brie's stories.But! I did love the story surrounding Shannon, and Murphy, and tying the loose ends. All trilogies should end as satisfying as this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work","review":"I usually enjoy Roberts' stories-despite the fact that she tends to recycle her plots and characters. Anyway, of the three books in the trilogy, Born in Shame is my least favourite. The heroine, Shannon, is rather unappealing. She lacks Maggie's spirit and Brianna's sweetness. Murphy, the hero, is great, but I just kept thinking, he's too good for her. The supernatural/mythical elements in the story are kind of silly. Roberts does a much better job of weaving them into her other, more recent, Irish trilogy. Roberts has written some memorable romances, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third and Final Book","review":"This was the third and final book in the series Born and the fourth and final book of Nora Roberts that I will read. The character Murray was not very developed and the whole broach thing was rather outrageous - did Murray believe he and Shannon were reincarnated lovers from the past? The very last chapter when Shannon did her final speech all I read was blah blah blah and was glad this book was over. At least Grayson was a bit more likeable in this book, even though we didn't see him much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading ..","review":"Was the worst book out of the trilogy.

The husband is about to take his radio station and real estate to the next level and this is all happening during the celtic tiger.

I love relating to these women from thousands of years ago - finding similarities and stark differences in culture.I was looking for a good follow up from THe REd TEnt - and this book was wonderful in how it explored the relationship of Miriam and Zipporah. I gave it 4 stars because although I enjoyed it, it took me a long time to get through it, slow, but interesting read - it covers a lot of detail, description (moreso than plot).

I finally found a real connection to the story in this compelling novel.There are study questions at the end which make it a good choice for Literary Circles too.

It is perfect for the new people who haven't heard the earlier years of Anthrax. All tracks have been remastered for the first time. This set offers all the key tracks from the first 4 Island label albums and a couple EPs. The only disappointing thing about this set is that tracks 1-7 (from the \\"Spreading The Disease\\" album) were not remastered properly. There is almost NO bass in these tracks and the treble is sometimes annoying. But it is still better quality than the original album.So if you are a pro Bush fan from the 1990s era of the band and have not heard any of the 1980s Anthrax, this is the perfect set for you to get aquainted with.

It was with great delight, then, that I came across this recording, which can have much the same effect as a sampler disk--to interest newcomers in the music of Malcolm Arnold--but which contains whole works that have not been recorded elsewhere. The Malcolm Arnold devotee will recognize the Arnold touch in the first few minutes of this CD; indeed, the opening bars of Little Suite No. 1 are like a little synopsis of his symphonic sound. This delightful recording can be recommended to all, because those who already have many recordings of Malcolm Arnold will want to hear the two recording premieres (the Manx Suite and the Ruth Gipps Variations--two entertaining and rewarding compositions), while those unfamiliar with Arnold's music will find this recording an excellent introduction to his style, and as a bonus, the sound quality is impeccable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A jumbled, uneven period piece.","review":"See the Doctor save the world by dropping some drugs.See Sam wander aimlessly till she's rescued agian and again.See Psyhic giants battle for the planet earth.Go see a good movie instead.(At least Fritz had an interesting story line.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"I used this for my daughter.
