A one-fanged vampire? Hilarious. Roman Draganesti is a rich and handsome and very eligible vampire, but he may lose his appeal and the respect of the vampire community if doesn't get his fang fixed. And it must be done before sundown or he'll end up spending all eternity doing some one-sided chomping. What he needs is a twenty-four hour dentist.Shanna Whelan is a dentist with an adversion to blood, thus her dental practice is going nowhere. Making matters worse, she witnesses a mob hit and now they're after her.The Vampire saves her and expects her to save his fang. There's all kinds of sexual tension, but she's in a quandry.

The intriquing story-line fizzled and turned into predictable mush. There was no humor and so help me, if Roman said, \\"God's blood\\" one more time, I'd have thrown my Kindle across the room... But, I love my Kindle, so I didn't do that. Had it been an actual book, I would have. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious twist on paranormal romance","review":"This book is absolutely outstanding in its genre. I didn't expect it at all. If you think once you have read vampire romance you know them all - this will be a nice refreshing twist for you. The story is very well developed, the characters are believable and the dialogue a hoot, yet the romance is very real. And let me tell you - vamire sex the way it is in this book - yummy. The heroine is very believable, strong, not a whiner and even though the hero is the dark, sexy, powerful vampire - he is different than the usual hero.Anyway, if you like the Sookie Stackhouse novels, you will like this one even more. It is not as dark as the Dark Hunters or Carpathians.I enjoyed it a lot and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it.","review":"I just couldn't get into this book....While there were some funny parts, I was mostly let down.

And yes, Roman is a monster, forsaken by God...we get it already. As for the \\"hilarious\\"...WHERE? The only mildly entertaining thing that happened was Roman losing a fang in a sex doll. That's it. Glad it was free because I would have been royally ticked if I had paid money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy title, not so catchy storyline","review":"I wanted to like this book: I love paranormal romance and have read almost everything else. I was excited about a new author with fresh ideas. Unfortunately, the ideas aren't fresh, the heroine is whiny and immature and the book ends without resolving two very major issues.First, roman IS a vampire, yet Shanna refuses to entertain the idea of being bitten. Yes, he has another food source but is love not about accepting and sharing the most important aspects of your partner? We're not talking about liking sports or sharing tastes in music here.Second, her father clearly intends to kill Roman and all other vampires. Shanna's response is a flippant joke. This seems to underscore the whole problem with the book. Shanna is extremely self-oriented and responds to almost every situation childishly. How are we to believe a 545 year old man, who was once a monk, would be attracted to such a woman?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...not horrible, but not good","review":"I am a big vampire fiction reader and have read many other vampire romance/adventure novels in the past. Although this books keeps you somewhat interested you never really dive into the story. It's too cliche and everything seemed too convenient. All the characters lack depth, and when she tries to make each one quirky it comes off as trying too hard. One guy was too Russian, One girl was too Parisian, Another guy was too nervous. Most books have a way of expressing themselves and you can imagine how the main character looks, acts and feels, with this main character I kept changing her in my head about 50 times. Was she smart? Dumb? Ugly? Who knows! Half way through the book nothing exciting has happened, and when something exciting DOES happen it falls short. I've read fan fiction better than this!However, if you like fluff than this may be the book for you it does have some cute moments and again it is a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Rubbish","review":"Here is one heroine that I couldn't wait to see killed off. This is really the only reason I kept reading, hoping that each page would take me closer to Shanna's death. This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read - its sloppy and not thought through, its corny..Shanna is corny, she's unlikable and annoying. The situations created are cheesy and droll, showing that no real creativity was placed into anything. Ask any teenager at fanfiction.com to use these same characters and write a novel...the turn out will be much better.The author's attempt at comedy fell flat, it was a train wreck. It's just horrible. I can't understand the high reviews and I believe those reviews are doing a great injustice to potential readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and smart love story...so what if he drinks blood?!","review":"I have read six light read vampire books, this one included in the last few days. Other than Bitten and Smitten, this is the only book that was really worth my time. The author has a good sense of how to make funny natural in each of the characters reactions. The characters are very individual and there is no real need to identify who is speaking. I found the two main characters fights believable and a relief. I don't enjoy books where the \\"love birds\\" never get truely upset or lose their temper with one another. The plot moves forward quickly. I was interested enough that I had a hard time putting the book down. I finished the book in about five hours...somewhat interupted and dealing with some dislexia. Overall, this book is definately worth checking out. It's a rare gem in a sea full of time wasting wastes of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddly I had the opposite experience than previous reviewer","review":"My wife has a version of the \\"Emperor\\" by the LSO and Kovacevich and I had bought this. We did a comparison today. We both loved the Kovacevich version but the recording had a very high noise floor, however the instruments sound very real.This performance was lethargic, un-engaging and dry, while Kovacevich was the complete opposite. His was emotive and involving and you felt drawn in. I couldn't help but wanting to speed up the performance from the BSO. It was too sticatto, too smooth. The sound was extremely clean and clear. Great seperation of instruments, deep and wide soundstage as though you are rear of mid hall.

Any of the many books is a fine example of intelligent writing. This book is not a disappointment. It is a book where Pascoe figures a bit more prominently than Dalziel, but we do have Andy there in key spots. It gives us lots of examples of his blustery non-sequitors. Dalziel and his crew are trying to unmask the Yorkshire choker who has a taste for the Elizabethan bard (in particular the play \\"Hamlet\\"). We also have a clan of gypsies to help make things interesting. This is intelligent writing that keeps you guessing until the end. Hill has an uncanny ability to set his novels so realistically, and his very human characters help to reel us in.

At that point, I knew the book wasn't for me and I started skimming. He later (surprise!) suggests that readers seek the service of financial planners, even though he admits that they could cost 1-3% of your portfolio value annually. Other infractions include promoting variable annuities (he downplayed the cost and asserted that any costs would be recouped with the annuity's tax advantage!) and using VERY sloppy math to supposedly illustrate the Roth IRAs superiority to the Traditional IRA.

Mr. Bach seems to have just placed the scraps from his earlier books into this one and as a result he has done a sloppy job. Much of the book is beefed up with standard reference materials that anyone can find at their local library. The numerous references to web sites and magazines, etc are not something that I would want in a book, since I can find them elsewhere for free.

IRAs are one focus but when I went to my bank to discuss getting one, I found that money market accounts were getting a better interest rate currently than IRA's... and with a money market account the funds are available if you need them before retirement age.

I've used it to remove set-in wrinkles from new clothing and to freshen up items taken out of the closet. I also used it to remove dents in my carpet from furniture. Pretty good product.

Deluxe Fabric Steamer it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holds little steam, works poorly","review":"I was very disappointed with this iron. It does not hold enough water to steam more than a few square inches of fabric. It took an hour to do one shirt, and it was still wrinkled. The water tank holds so little that it must be refilled every 2 or 3 minutes. I would have returned it, but was traveling. I just use it now as an iron, and would rather have had a regular shaped iron, which would do a better job of ironing. Forget it as a steamer. Total waste of money.

The only good track is the Biggie Tupac freestyle. Flex really let the underground heads down on this one because after listening to mixtapes 1,2 and 3 which are all clasics numerous times I have to say that this album is the most unlistenable piece of trash that I have come across in quite some time.

So many big names, yet so many weak tracks. The Pac/Biggie Freestyle is the dopest cut on the whole album. \\"If I Get Locked Up\\" by Eminem & Dr. Dre is a decent cut, if only for Em's lyrics, once you hear it a few times, it'll get old. \\"True\\" by Meth is a decent song, nothing spectacular. \\"Dem Want War\\" by Raekwon is one of my favorites, but it's too short. \\"Ill Bomb\\" is a dope cut, I don't like LL too much, but the beat is hot. I just named all the semi-good songs. Everything else is just pants.

These glasses fit the bill. I use them for flying almost 6x a week and they do a great job of cutting down on the brightest spots while increasing the dynamic range of the light emitted (so the contrast is higher while not being painfully bright). They are durable as well. My only negative is the style, which is unavoidable if you want minimum distortion (if you bend lenses it's much harder to produce a flat image). They are on the heavy side, but I consider that \\"durable\\" instead of a negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunglasses are great","review":"I like the glass lenses. Driving is very good.

This is more of a mystery crime thriller set in a historical context. The background is smuggling, the British Navy and the war against Napoleon and follows an intriguing sub plot within the larger conflict. The main character does have similarities with Flashman's outlook on life and general demeanor but this is subordinate to the plot and the action which is very good. I recommend enjoying it in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swashbuckling Fun","review":"I am a a lover of all maritime and Napoleonic wars fiction and I have to say, although this first installment in the series is a bit lighter and not as serious as many others, this is truly a delightful romp and nothing but swashbuckling fun.

It is practically impossible to pour the coffee into your cup without getting almost as much on the kitchen counter! I think it is the extra wide spout and the reason they give you 5 cups instead of 4 in the pot. This spillage also happens when pouring the water into the reservoir. Also, it you remove the carafe during brewing, it is not drip free. It will dribble and splash against the coffee maker. The coffee making is fairly quick and quiet. I prefer my old coffee maker that had a slide out basket and a pot that was easier to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIPPY AND MESSY","review":"My mother swore by Hamilton Beach appliances.

The carafe does not have the little plastic lib that you put your thumb on to pop the top up which is the only major drawback. The coffee is wonderful though. I think it is brewed at a hotter temp than the other coffee makers I've had. Before this, I had the 5 cup Black and Decker where the carafe just fell apart after about 4 months. The bottom dropped off the handle. This is what set me looking for a new one. I never realized the inferiority of the coffee it produced until I tried the Hamilton Beach. I also had a 4 cup DeLonghi before the B&D; which was okay, but not nearly as good as this one.Update as of 11/23/11 - The no drip plug fell out a year after I had this and now the water reservoir is leaking so I get water all over the counter when I brew the coffee. Coffee still tastes great. I am very disappointed that this model didn't even last 2 years.

When Hetty was found guilty of the murder of her newborn child, Kensit let out the most ridiculous cry I've ever heard. No pain, no sorrow, no regret, no fear, just a screech.

Nicely weighted (but potentially a bit heavy if you are used to a \\"real\\" one) and quite sharp out of the box. I expect that if you are going to hack away at rope etc. as in the vid, you will need to learn to sharpen it. This tends to be the 'downfall' of any knife. However, the practical and 'real' product one would expect from Cold Steel is certainly there and if you would like a katana of reasonable quality, this is the way to go.

It took much cleaning to get it off and I unfortunately put small scratches in my attempts to get all the glue off (which is very difficult to remove, by the way). I put my Blu Ray disc in an additional paper sleeve inside the holder to prevent damage to it.

Yes, it's different from the book, but the movie presents a unifying theme that allows the story to be told in a visual, adventurous way. The movie itself gets a good 4 stars, which means this review is marked for two stars because...The packaging for this particular double pack gets 1 star. The discs are actually glued onto the package. Yes, glued. And not only glued, but glued within an oddly designed cardboard sleeve that can't be fully opened. Once removed, the blu-ray disc is unplayable; the glue won't come off easily without scratching the disc. I didn't even try to force the DVD disc out of the package as I'm guessing the same problem will happen there as well (and I'd rather not risk breaking it trying to pry it out). Oddly, the digital download disc is the most easily accessible and best packaged of the three.

Some die-hard fans of the book may not care for the fact that a couple of the scenes are a bit different than in the book, but I thought that just made the movie better; same with the couple of stuff the writers added into the movie.That's not saying the movie is perfect, though. Some scenes (like at the Lone Island) could've been longer.And I have to say, I really liked how they came into Narnia and met Caspian again. It was so much better than the BBC miniseries version.As for the DVD itself, I though it was interesting that the 2 discs came in 2 separate cases instead of in the same case.

It comes in a trifold case with an extra fold down piece for the digital copy disk. The problem is that the movies can fall out the sides of the trifold case since they are only stuck into a slot. However, the slots have glue inside, so one of the DVDs was actually glued into the slot and required me to pry it out and remove the glue from the disk (the data side, not the case side). The digital copy is the only disk that is held in securely, but they use some kind of rubber piece instead of the traditional plastic \\"button\\", so it is nearly impossible to get the disk off without breaking it. I don't know who decided this case was a good design, but I'd recommend you just get a simple version of this movie instead of the deluxe case that risks damaging your movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Harry Potter","review":"We got both Harry Potter's new DVD and the new Narnia DVD.

The script is terrible, the special effects are worse than the 2 previous films, and the camerawork is also terrible, shaking around and zooming way into their faces so much it feels as if your watching a big homefilm a lot of the time.

The author, C.S.

Some of the old cast is back like Prince Caspian and Reepicheech, the swashbuckling mouse of honor and this time around the adventurers are searching for the Seven Lords with the Seven Swords, who were banished during the reign of Caspian's evil uncle. There's lot of mini island adventures and spiritual turmoils for the major characters but I don't want to give away spoilers. CGI is impressive.

Reading the list of features on disc 2 of this set one would think they were getting some info on the making of the film or something along those lines- well no, what you get is about 45 minutes (if that) of clips from the film with some voice over comments in three to four minute mini-features. And the new animated adventure or whatever it's called is what- 5 minutes or so of minimal animation? I won't comment on the included kiddie game; maybe it's fun to play once or twice... Believe me, I've bought lots of Special Edition and 2- disc sets and this has got to be the WORST of them.

Dawson is just a rehash of every sales gimmick you or he has ever read about.If you look, you will see I liked his negotiation gimmicks -- but only if tempered with other's work to set tone and style (and more).

Solid research that identifies effective sales strategies and explains why they work sets Dawson's book apart from many other volumes on sales techniques - even when his advice is repetitive. He warns you away from manipulation, though he doesn't hesitate to use some forms of it, along with psychological insight, time pressure, friendship, subliminal messages and outright emotion to persuade clients to buy. Dawson writes in an easy-to-read, breezy, yet authoritative style and includes tricks, techniques, clever anecdotes and chapter summaries. The book is as well organized as a speech in which Dawson tells you what he is going to say, says it and then tells you what he just said. We recommend this book to people who want to sell better, and who have the starch to use intense powers of persuasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite book for couples!!","review":"This is by far the best sex book for couples that we've read to date.

There's no real villains. The hero is too nice a guy without any edginess or sharpness, and at times the description of technical matters, why and how the sub works, seem just undigested lumps of research. It could have worked: there is at least slightly psycho officer, and some of the crewmen could have gone dangerously wacko; there's a hint of suppressed violence in the hero's background, but it never erupts.

Zane Grey Theatre Complete Season One","review":"I was born in 1952 and have a slight memory of Dick Powell hosting a TV show but cannot remember any of these programs. Watching the Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre series is all new to me. I received my set on Friday and have watched 2 of the 4 DVD's of Zane Grey Theatre Complete Season One. I have really enjoyed viewing this series and will hate when I have seen the last episode. I WANT MORE! The writing and acting is outstanding. I have a new respect for character actors. The series is QUALITY and the acting is EXCELLENT. I do not watch any new drama or comedy series that are currently on televison. The programs just do not compare to the old ones (50's and 60's). I want the other seasons made available for purchase soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by poor sound quality.","review":"For fans of the Golden Age of westerns, this series has it all: interesting story lines, famous actors before they became famous, and an affable host.And it's all ruined by the poor sound quality. As O. Pringle said in his/her review, the sound level is not consistent. You've got to turn the volume way up sometimes to hear the dialog, then a second later turn it down because of the blaring music.And to make matters worse, the audio is often muddled. Sometimes you cannot make out what is being said (at any volume setting).I bought this as a gift for an older relative who has pretty good hearing. She mentioned the audio problem to me, and after watching several episodes I had to agree with her. It's a real shame that the audio could not be improved somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variable sound level","review":"The video quality is mostly excellent. Stripes in Powell's coat make an odd shimmer on my LCD TV set. But the sound level has extreme variations. At places the highest level possible on my TV is still not enough, at others I must sharply reduce the volume level. I do not know if this is the original sound level or if the production of this set is somehow involved. Today's technology should enable improvement of this problem. I considered giving it just 3 stars. No doubt many viewers of this series will be older people who may have some hearing impairment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bird Sounds","review":"This is the most authentic CD of various bird sounds that I have ever heard.

Thank you Amazon for making it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound; Wrong Indexing","review":"I give it 4 stars because it isn't too mixed up with the indexing and the most important part is the excellent sound...all for the low price! There are even 3 bonus birds at the end (but, no names!) I don't understand the person who says the indexing is not wrong. If you select a track and it isn't the bird then the indexing is wrong. Simple. Don't get it if you must have the indexing correct. And I think it is a great buy. No regrets! I'm getting more as gifts. I'll get the list straight. It will definitely help me learn the names!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible printing of this book","review":"Do not buy this printing of this book.

This is one of the last ones to be chosen, but I wish we had bought it sooner when our kids were younger. The Z Was Zapped is a fun and artistic presentation of the alphabet. The whole family enjoyed guessing what was happening to each letter based on Van Allsburg's imaginative artwork. Encore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When I read Van Allsburg books I read with great pleasure.","review":"This book makes you think about what they're going to say next. I like it because it's kind of mysterious in a way. They had different words to say about each letter. I didn't like that the book seemed short. I liked the book so much I wanted to read more. I would recommend this book to my classmates because it is a wonderful book. The author is a very good writer.I love the art work, it makes the book more interesting because of it's details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids, both young and old","review":"For anyone who's on the fence about whether or not to get this for their kids, I wholeheartedly endorse this book. I've absolutely loved this book ever since I was a child in elementary school. It was one of the few (perhaps only) books I repeatedly checked out from the library. Oddly enough, I have not purchased it until just now (some eighteen years later).My Dad used to read it to me frequently. As I became familiar with the book, I tried to guess what would happen to each letter before he turned the page and revealed the answer. The illustrations are elegantly simple and incredibly engaging. \\"The Z Was Zapped\\" isn't as much about learning or the alphabet as it is just about the enjoyment of the narrative and mystery of what happens to the characters of the alphabet. A wonderful book that I can't recommend more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Alphabet Book","review":"A fantastic, unique alphabet book.

I you are in Kindergarten, first grade, or second grade or if you are just learning how to read, it can be a good book. If you are older, I give it one star. Please only buy this book for age's 7 and under. In a fourth grader's opinion this book should be named \\"The Baby Boo Bah Book.\\" -Makalia, Fourth Grade, Nantucket, MA"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Review Was Rollicking","review":"A friend gave me this book when it was published in 1987. It is by far my favorite Chris Van Allsburg children's book. Also suitable for adults. The art is conceptually intriguing -- exactly WHAT is happening in each picture? That's for the reader to guess, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. The answers are all alliterative and literate, with a wonderful rhythm and sense of fun. The drawing for \\"P\\" shows a capital P with a bird perched on top, and the bird seems to have eaten away part of the letter. The answer, which always comes on the following page, is \\"The P was repeatedly Pecked.\\" I guessed \\"The P was Pecked,\\" but I didn't guess \\"The P was repeatedly Pecked,\\" which is soooooo much better. An alphabet book to be read and enjoyed, many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOS 2.0","review":"We have been using SOS for three years. We began with the version before 2.0 and were very pleased with it. We would rate it five stars. This year, we purchased History and Chemistry 11th grade 2.0. We were put off immediately when we found that my computer (where it had worked fine before) did not have enough ram, the right windows version, etc. So I installed it on our more up-to-date computer with a minimum of fuss, but when I went to set up the subjects, etc., I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that, instead of making it simpler, it was actually more difficult. I had been working on it for three days and had completed 3/4 of a unit when we found out that the new and improved SOS 'server' was leaking information through our internet. Add the fact that you can no longer simply save your work to a floppy disk-it's too large, and there were several errors (on their part) in the chemistry problem sets, and suffice to say that we weren't happy with this 'new and improved' SOS 2.0.

Somehow i get tricked into watching these really bad horror movies that Full Moon Entertainment makes. The acting is terrible. I feel bad for Trent Haaga who co-wrote Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger 4(By the way, that movie is actually worth buying), his script never had a chance. The movie would have worked wonderfully as a horror comedy, instead it goes for more of the serious horror movie approach when the movie can't even take itself seriously. The violence would have made up for it, but all of that was blocked by static making it look like it came from a tv. I don't care how much money was put into this movie, it's just a really bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO IMAGINATION IN KILLINGS","review":"This is a low budget version of \\"The Task.\\" 5 babes are locked in a genuine rigged haunted house and must spend the night and perform certain tasks based on their fears. The movie starts out with the producer begging for money to do the pilot. As he gets what he wants he walks out of the office to some great heavy metal swagger music, but there is no slo-mo swagger to go with the music. I mean how much would that cost?The eventual killing of said babes lacks imagination. It is just plain slash and remove guts. No imagination in writing.

Wait until Howard Stern sees her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice mellow pop sound","review":"\\"Equally Cursed and Blessed\\" is a solid album overall. Not spectacular or ground-breaking in any way, but eminently listenable nonetheless. Cerys Matthews has a unique voice, somewhat reminiscent of Bjork and Harriet Wheeler of the Sundays. Her lyrics are humorous and original. If you're looking for a light-hearted mellow pop sound, check this album out. The first four tracks of the album are great. Londinium is an especially catchy tune. The middle tracks aren't that great (Karaoke Queen doesn't really go anywhere, and the harp sounds of Bulimic Beats don't do much for me), but things pick up towards the end of the album. The last two tracks, Road Rage and Mulder and Scully, are quite catchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"This CD is pure trash. For some REALLY good music, check out the band Katatonia spelled with a \\"K\\" instead of a \\"C\\". Now THAT is some beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD with some catchy lyrics and songs","review":"This CD is quite good, and very innovative in its sound. The lyrics and sounds are very catchy and combine quite well together. The vocals are definitely intersting and different from most standard female vocals even if they do get a little screechy at times. It starts off with the great song \\"Dead from the Waist Down\\" which is an interesting song even if the lyric about \\"Making hay\\" seems a little corny. \\"Londinium\\", and \\"Karaoke Queen\\" are also quite good, but I think the best songs are \\"Road Rage\\" and \\"Mulder and Scully\\" which I understand are actually from the International Velvet album and thus I am going to try and find that CD next. Overall if you want an innovative sound try this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I took a chance....and have no regrets!!","review":"I first heard the song En Douce on Putumayo's Cafe Sampler, and immediately fell in love with this group. Four piece band utilizing a variety of instruments, as well as voice for some scores. Wonderful music of the old days without the scratchiness of an old LP.

Beautiful horses and weaponry along with hard, miserable worlds, villany and subterfuge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classics are generally the best movies","review":"I have found over the years with few exceptions that the classics such as Humphrey Bogart, James Stewart, Errol Flynn and others are the best. The second signature series for Flynn has three of the movies I have been wanting for some time with my favorite being Charge of the Light Brigrade, then Dawn Patrol followed by Don Juan and Gentlemen Jim. the other moves are very good as well with each movie made with a crispness that many movies lack today with there dependence of special effects. A good story, acting and great scenes make each movie a treasure to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errol Flynn Remembered","review":"A great bit of nostalgia with Flynn at his best. He really was a piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Errol Flynn Signataure Collection Vol. 2","review":"I first saw a movie of Errol Flynn when I was a teenager, and I was hooked on him since - well over 40 years ago! Errol was extraordinarily handsome and so natural in the roles he played. I have read his life story, so I know what a rogue he was, but for all that crazy lifestyle. he nevertheless played his roles in the movies very credibly, so handsomely in those period costumes that made him look all the more delicious! There has not been another actor in Hollywood, or any other country cranking out movies, that can compare to Errol Flynn. He stood alone and unequaled.It's no surprise, then, that ordered the Errol Flynn Collections 1 and 2, and some of the books about him. Cheers Errol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing collection from not a huge fan","review":"I must say I've never been a huge Flynn fan. Most of the movies I had seen were kind of cheesy. But this set is amazing. Gentelman Jim, other than having one of the classiest endings I've ever seen, is just a pure delight. Though Don Juan fits back into the cheesy category, it is a wonderful collection. Warner takes great care and time in releasing these sets, and it shows. Recomended for classic movie fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully A Tease For A Third Collection.......","review":"An excellent way to round out one's collection of these additional gems, given the right-on selection of such entertaining fare. Flynn himself may have been disappointed that the collection didn't contain more of his latter-year dramatic work, for which he received his best reviews, but marketers may be reserving those for a third collection. If a third collection is planned, I hope that, besides his best dramatic moments, it will include films representing Flynn's comedic and musical talents, which were considerable, although virtually untapped at Warner Brothers. How ironic it would be if such a third set did eventually appear; it would be proof indeed that the broad range of his work was appreciated at last, and maybe then that secretly sensitive soul of his could rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movies","review":"The films of this great actor are all exciting, have a plot, great applicable dialogue and historically accurate stages. Very pleased with these movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely ignorant","review":"The author does a disservice to any message about oil and gas depletion he is trying to convey. In particular, his ignorant views about the Middle East, that came at the end of the book, discredit everything that preceded them.

The guitar players are good. But there is so much extra noise such as heavy breathing, the guitarist moving around etc. in many of the pieces.

There are much better resources out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! - Outdated, expensive information","review":"I tried to order this book first from the copyright holder and authors, Electro Automotive. After I sent off my order, I e-mailed a question about the resources here in Hawaii. Whether anyone has converted a vehicle here using their components, etc. No answer.After a 2 month wait my check wasn't cashed and no book arrived. Nada. Guess they don't want to do business.So, being a glutton for punishment I ordered Convert It from Amazon @ $24,95. MISTAKE. I didn't read far enough into the reviews to see how outdated it was, 19 years outdated. While some of the basics may still hold, the components surely have improved with time.So, I can't recommend it for anything but basic, basics...and not for the price. And, by all means, beware of Electo Automotive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Lovers Rejoice","review":"Having run out of British mysteries, I decided to try this Swedish production. The plots were surprisingly easy to follow with excellent, highly visible subtitles. The pacing is somewhat slow and measured but this helps to keep the viewer on track. The characters are varied but not spectacularly different than those from other crime dramas. The acting is very good and I ordered the next set of DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Swedish detective.","review":"Van Veteeren is a retired detective of about 70 years who buys a book store. Of course, his young former police colleagues seek him out for help with difficult cases they couldn't solve without him.Good stories, superb acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nonstop Action-- Oh, and The Snake Is Still Loose","review":"Frantic would probably be the best word to describe this mystery. Connor also has her usual high body count. However, in this case the reader also learns a little more about Diane Fallon's backstory.Of course there are a lot of people who are giving a synopsis of this book so I will skip that part. What the faithful reader needs to know is that this book has all the virtues of her previous books in this series and avoids the worst pitfalls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring","review":"I purchased this book because it has a four star rating. Imagine my disappointment when I finally managed to finish it.It is the most boring book I have ever read. I am an avid reader. In my mental list of five worst books I have ever had the misfortune to read this one will go to the top.There is no plot and the characters are pathetic. So a word of warning. Have something else on hand to read in-between so you don't die of boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy! The slam man is awesome.","review":"I bought the slam man a year ago and am so glad that I did. I luv working out with the slam man. You get a great workout that is also fun and very challenging.

(Make sure that you have the vacuum out when you are filling it with sand, which is to be expected.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money here","review":"Please read this carefully. I purchased this item a few years ago. What the customer does not realize is that this dummy is not 100% soft material. The black areas are hard PLASTIC! The blue area is not very soft or pliable. The material they used on this product is cheap and inferior. The hard plastic is NOT ACCEPTABLE for a martial arts/fitness training equipment. Yes they provide you with gloves, however, anyone who purchases an item such as this would expect the equipment to be made of appropriate material - which this is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS PRODUCT IS NO ORIGINAL","review":"THE FRAGANCE IN THIS PRODUCT NO IS DURABLE. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER FOR A FUTURE BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for...","review":"I just got this the other day. It fits perfect and looks even better. It doesn't leave room for the ipod to move around inside the case so it stays put. The description calls it a \\"hard\\" case, which it is, but it has a nice hard rubber feel to it. All ports are easily accesible and the port for which you use to connect to the computer has a locking hinge protector so it's not exposed when you take it on the go, great for dust and lint protection.All in all, it seems a bit pricy for just a case but the look, feel, and functionality make it all worth while.I highly recommend this case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hole for earphone jack too thick!","review":"I'm returning my Sidewinder, which otherwise is a cool case, because the hole for the earphone jack is so thick (and too small) that it causes a bad connection. Duh! Did anybody test this thing? I considered drilling a larger hole, but for $24.95, you would expect a better product. I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great print","review":"These sheets are very nice. I bought them in the green stripe and flamingo print and they are adorable. Only 4 stars were given due to the sheets not fitting the mattress properly, even though it states that it will fit my mattress size. They are also a little thin and I'm not sure how long they would last after multiple washings.Overall, though, I've enjoyed them so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for traveling","review":"I got this radio a couple of years ago after reading the reviews. If it sat on a shelf and I didn't have to take it on my travels, it might be OK. The problem is that it is so cheaply made that many things have easily broken-first the battery charger/AC adapter stopped working, then the antenna snapped, then the external, wire antenna. My 10 year old Sony had (has)none of these problems. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - save your money","review":"Very poor quality. Save your money and buy a Sony. I was disappointed with the poor mechanical and electrical components and the internal battery charging function failed after about two months of operation. The receiver is very noisy and very poor quality. The ONLY feature I liked was the back0lit buttons. I just wrapped up the radio and I'm donating it to our local 2nd hand store...actually, I feel a bit guilty as it probably should go into the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed With Sound Quality","review":"I spent several days with this radio learning how to operate it. The manual is not clearly written but it's usable. The radio feels solid and the design has a number of nice features. The user interface could stand some improvements. I wish the clock would display simultaneously with the frequency. I wish the batteries could be charged simultaneously with playing on AC. The problem I couldn't tolerate was the distorted sound. The amount of distortion was not too bad for voice but horrible for music. I couldn't stand the distortion so I returned the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great radio but...","review":"Ok I agree all the good comments but in the first day of use the volume down button was permanently depressed (even it works well)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the shortwave and SSB???","review":"This radio receives FM broadcast and AM fine, but shortwave and SSB on Shortwave is all but existant! I have tried to return this radio, have it repaired, and still not even a word or an \\"I'm sorry\\" DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS MORE TROUBLE THAN YOU WANT, AND IT DOES NOT RX SHORTWAVE OR THE SSB BANDS! THAT IS A SIMPLE ENOUGH REVIEW, AND AN HONEST ONE. I HAVE BEEN A HAM FOR 11 YEARS AND NEVER HAD A NEW RADIO TO BE SUCH A PIECE OF GARBAGE! LOOKS LIKE I EVEN HAVE TO LITIGATE TO MAKE THEM BUY IT BACK, AND IT IS JUST 2 MONTHS OLD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely lasted a year","review":"This is one item I should have returned. There was a short in the wire or something so most of the time I had to fiddle with it just to get it to come on. Changing stations- forget it- if I had to touch the thing, it was too sensitive and would shut off and I'd have to keep turning it back on. It finally died completely on me recently. Nice sleek design but what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weak reception on SW band","review":"I bought the radio in December 2010. On Jan. 2011 took it with me on an oversea trip. Tried to use the SW band but unable to pick up the stations that I wanted to listen to. Tried to return it but past the 30-day return policy, EE doesn't want to take it back. I had an old Sony SW that I used at the same location and sound/reception quality was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing","review":"I have this radio for about a month. As a radio, it is much better than Grundig G6 Aviator and Eton 100 (that I also own). Unfortunately, it seems that manufacturing quality is pretty poor: after about a month of use the radio started having problems with the keyboard. It is necessary to press some buttons twice or more, with force. Pressing \\"power\\" to switch the radio on sometimes switches it on for a second and swithes it immediately off. Pressing some keys causes loud \\"click\\" noise in the speaker.Manual is EXTREMELLY poor and confusing. It cannot be dwnloaded from manufacturer's page. Make few copies and save. If manual is lost, you are lost :)Month later, March 9th, 2011. It is harder and harder to switch the radio on or off. Most frequently, pressing the Power button switches the radio on for a second and switches it immediately off. It seems that even for something that cost 60 bucks it is deteriorating too rapidly..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mini-portable Worldband radio that actually works well.","review":"Since the features of the radio have been covered already by the other reviews, I'll just review the performance real quick. I've owned countless SW radio over the years, and never had a mini-portable that worked well. Until now. The KA1102 simply works very well. Will it replace my Sony 2010? No, of course not. But I will be taking my KA1102 with me when I need a small portable. SW reception is surprisingly very good. The narrow filter is better than on radios I own costing 3 times as much. Even when the bands are crowded, the narrow filter allows me to listen to stations 5kHz apart. Amazing on a radio costing $75. The only slight negatives are: MW performance is average, and the radio's functions take a little time to get used to. ..This radio will be one of my \\"keepers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bars. Flavor is awesome.","review":"I would eat one of these every morning. Texture and flavor is awesome. Box of 30 will last you one month if you eat one daily. It is hard not to eat more than one a day.

I was expecting a \\"typical\\" fruit leather... this had much less taste and a worse texture."},{"rating":"2","title":"I prefer other fruit leathers for myself, but this is the best for little ones","review":"The flavor is good. I don't prefer the texture which is soft rather than leathery. My older kids prefer Stretch Island, however, my 2 year old loves these. Other fruit leathers are hard for her to chew, but these are soft enough she could eat them easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love these and asked me to buy them again!","review":"It's not often I get all three of my kids to agree on the same thing to put in their lunches, but they all really like these fruit snacks. I feel much better giving them these than some of the other fruit snacks that are so unhealthy. We will be buying these and the other flavors a lot. I'm so glad Amazon carries so many natural products that we just cannot find in our area. This one is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft but just place in fridge","review":"For those who don't like the texture, place these in the fridge or the freezer to \\"toughen\\" them up. The strips are softer than other varieties due to a higher moisture content-- similar to dried strawberries although with a less pronounced berry flavor. Overall a very healthy treat, not too sweet but quite satisfying. A good choice for both kids an adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Some Action(Stills)","review":"This book is perfect as the Charlie's Angels Fotonovel.

The group produces their own transcriptions of arrangements from original classic recordings of the 1920s and 1930s wherever possible, and playing them on vintage instruments.This recording celebrates jazz on and along the mighty Mississippi River, from New Orleans up to the Upper Mississippi with seldom heard pieces that are real gems. I have heard this band live several times and highly recommend their work. They are lively as well as accurate in their interpretation of Bix style jazz. There are also nice write ups about the history of the selections with the cd. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking stories, well told and educational","review":"The stories are delivered with such honesty. These women young and old have some amazing stories of virginity loss. One of them even admits that they have a story they tell their friends and then the real story. It's amazing how the stories are similar across race, age and generations. Women have been keeping these kinds of details to themselves and now they're letting us in through the eyes of two skilled filmmakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks!","review":"I swear this is easily one of the worst games I've ever played and the worst PSP game I have played so far. Granted every Star Trek game I've ever played have been very poor games. So I can't say I was all that surprised. Why can't anyone make a decent Star Trek game?Do not buy this game unless you are a hopeless Star Trek fanboy/girl who lives in their parents basement and can't buy a date. Yes, the game really is that bad. Just a crappy shooter set in the Star Trek Universe. Taking your $20, rolling it up and smoking it would be more fun than playing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I don't like long reviews, so I'll keep it short.

It makes you feel that you are living in the city because the director films many scenes outdoors. The ending is tragic and is a bit of letdown as it seems to be saying \\"love does not conquer years of acrimony.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Poingent and timely","review":"An Israeli movie about finding love in an era of conflict. While Noam and his roommates find a way to keep Ashraf in the country they are trying to navigate their own romantic challenges.There were scenes that really illustrated the tit-for-tat nature of the situation and the depth of anger on both sides. \\"Have you ever had the leg of an eight year old bombing victim fall on you?\\" One Israeli woman shouts as they organize a \\"Rave Against The Occupation\\" and the wake Ashraf's family sits for his sister killed by soldiers chasing terrorists.

The ending is distinctly bittersweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, Moving & Thought Provoking! Bravo, Eyton Fox!","review":"Eyton Fox is one of the best filmmakers alive. Each movie that he creates is better than the previous. Everything about this movie is top flight: the superb acting, the wonderful writing, the great editing and the thrilling directing. All praise to a director who can make a sexy movie that is about something of great importance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bubble","review":"Once again it proves that all you need to make a great film is the story and talent. No need for all these wild special effects, just great story telling. This Israel film has so much to think about with the story woven around 4 central figures. I simply loved this film and the music is excellent. Watch it, you won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of my favorites","review":"I have had the CD for over a half year now, and it is still one of my favorite all time rock CDs. Everything about this one is huge; the production, musicianship and the great melodies.

When I wrote my bookUnique Sales Stories: How To Get More Referrals, Differentiate Yourself From The Competition & Close More Sales Through The Power Of StoriesI asked a number of professionals what the key to effective selling was.

I emailed Mr. Lytle's organization requesting one of the templates he offers in the book. I told him that his book was one of the top two \\"sales\\" books I have read...I have more than 70. That is no longer true!! The Accidental Salesperson is the BEST book on sales I have read. I ended up highlighting most of the book, the ideas and suggestions are that good!

This was a horrible waste of money, and of time spent in reading the first third or so I read before I quit. Patricia Gunn Allen is not simply hooked on Political Correctness (which I could deal with). She substitutes it for decent scholarship and for writing ability. After the pointless detours into the legends of her own New Mexico Native American clan and 21st Century Physics, the attempt to relate the \\"myth\\" of Pochahontas to the Legend of one of the Kngihts of the Round Table (I think it was Gawain and the Green Knight, but I'm honestly not sure) did me in.

It read like conjecture for a lot of it, with \\"could\\", \\"would have\\" , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor, at the same time, it was too conversational, and in all just poorly written. The material was interesting enough, and her conjectures intriguing, it was just the presentation that was faulty. It would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures, as it is...she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel, and it would have carried better."},{"rating":"2","title":"LeannessLifestyle is a Lifesave","review":"I have purchased and read (and re-read) The Leanness Lifestyle.

The book has become my constant companion. It is well written, easy to read and contains everything you need to know to finally get fit and healthy, no matter where you are starting from. This is not a fad diet, people. It is the real deal. David (\\"Coach\\") is an expert, and he addresses ALL of the nutritional, physical and emotional components related to transformation. I am a tough customer (an engineer who analyzes everything) and I can honestly say that I am 150% sold on this book and program.

Work hard, eat right. Maybe I was looking for magic pill, but the writing is sub-par, at best. I felt I was being talked down to, all the way through. There are several inspirational snippets, but they are weighed down by the overall tone that implies the reader can't tell the difference between a corn chip and a carrot.

Probably more suitable for people who already have no motivation. Just doesn't cut to the chase for those who already are committed to being fit. Just too full of fluff and talk, and hard to see through it all to what matters. A challenge for the Author: try and re-write it in 23 pages.

David doesn't sugar coat what it takes to make a successful transformation; hard work and commitment and the support of like minded people.

Ms. Heidcamp should be extremely proud that she was able to make such a positive difference in the life of a creature whose species she was already following with a notebook and a passion. Her knowledge of flowers that attract hummingbirds is amazing. So, too, is her ability to stock her sun room with healthy, flowering specimens, ensure the availability of nutritional supplements and patiently regulate both the light and the temperature in the room, all so that Squeak would have what he needed to thrive. Her color photos are beautiful and perfectly illustrate the narrative. I just hope that Ms. Heidcamp someday writes a sequel so we can learn about Squeak's fate upon leaving his winter home and doting host."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!","review":"This book is much more than I imagined. It's great for anyone who loves animals of any type, and particularly those who loves birds.

I thought this would be a lot of video of old racing since ESPN was there in the glory days of the 70s and 80s. But no.The first 30 minutes are peppered with Democrats claiming they're fans. But if you've been to a race you know the fans know better than to be fooled by guys like this.This is sad, there was so much potential. So much potential. There are some good moments in this but they're overshadowed by the subtle mocking of the fans.The video is cut up into the MTV-quick edit-hyperactive video. Again, too bad.

I am so grateful for writers like Peggy Noonan, who can so beautifully put into words and describe for the mind's eye, the message she is conveying. I have found myself reading certain chapters over and over, often times leaving tear stains. What an awesome tool for generations to come,-- this book, about one of the greatest Presidents in modern times.

He made us proud to be Americans as he dipped into our pockets with his Reaganomics. George Bush, while campaigning against Reagan in 1980 called Reagan's economic policies \\"voodoo economics\\". Maybe he was on to something. During the Reagan-Bush years we had the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression. We had more banks fail than at any time except the Great Depression. The crime rate was up the budget deficit was the highest ever. The trade deficit was the highest it has ever been. Yes, Reagan was a great president if all this is great.

The inside information does add a nice new facet to what we know of RR. But the unabashed love fest of the life and \\"character\\" of RR gets sickening. It is amazing to me that any reviwer could read more than one account of RR's life and still think he was an exemplar of character. OTOH, it makes sense if you work for him, and are secretly (or not so secretly as the case may be) in love with him. You might think seeing his crook friends would clue one in, figuring that one who has friends who are crooks would most likely be a crook himself. But, that doesn't seem to be the accepted viewpoint. His character must be due to spin, since it cannot be shown by actual evidence.

Reagan was a good man, and he wasn't the kind of person who let laws get in his way. That's why we elected him. Carter was about as goodie-two-shoes as you can get. Carter was nothing *but* character. That was the problem.Reagan had a dark side and that is *why* he was great. Reagan could be calculating: he was a pretty pro-choice as Governor of California, but he Mr. Pro-life when he ran for President. Why? Any republican who wants to be Gov of California had better be liberal on social issues (like Arnold) but no pro-choice Republican will ever win the primaries.Give Reagan his due. He led our country against the commies and he didn't let \\"character\\" get in the way of winning. He didn't let \\"character\\" get in the way of funding the Contras against the communist foothold in Nicaragua. For God, for country, but not some mommas boy who always told the truth. That was the real Reagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character or Criminal?","review":"More of the same from a leading Reagan apologist.

A friend of mine recommended it to me for which I'm grateful. Peggy's style of writing is fluid and easy. She's capable of capturing the initmate details that bring her character, Ronald Reagan, to life. The book describes the character of the man, and is a refreshing insight into the politics the man. For skeptics and cynics this is a must read. To know that character does exist, that good guys with determination and character do finish first sometimes makes it worth the reading. But the insight into Reagans character and personality are educational and uplifting in a way that you will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Insider's Portrait","review":"One interesting aspect of this book is Noonan's increased respect and appreciation for Ronald Reagan since she penned her previous title, What I Saw at the Revolution. Noonan's evolution mirrors that of America and, indeed, the world, especially affirming for those of us who knew all along what a great man Reagan is. This latest book is fascinating; I've bought and read more than fifty hardcover books on Reagan and this still held my interest. Part is Noonan's superbly intimate writing, part is her unique perspective, part is the recent conversations with former Reagan insiders where Noonan elicits some really interesting and novel responses (including from President George W. Bush). The book is at once a hard-to-put-down page turner, but also one you'll want to savor, turning back pages to re-read sections that draw out happy memories or emotional responses. Thanks for this book Peggy, and also, thanks for telling our Forever President that we love him still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to Reagan","review":"Let's get this straight: I voted for Reagan both times, but not because of his 'character'. I voted for him because he got the job done at any cost. If I wanted 'character' I would have voted for Carter! Carter honesty got us into too many messes, remember? Reagan was a 'do it his way' kind of guy. That's why we liked him!Noonan tries to re-invent Reagan as a simple, honest guy. Sweet, but not true. Reagan brought in tough guys who got it done. More of his people went to prison than any other President. Nixon and Clinton put together had fewer convictions of senior officials. But you know what? Ron brought down the Soviet Union and he got America on it's feet. And if he broke a few laws doing it, we didn't care.That's the real Ron Reagan we should honor. Not this make believe cozy Grandpa from Noonan's weird dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over Substance","review":"Peggy Noonan is clearly a gifted writer, but a horrible historian. This book is an unthinking and uncritical work of near-sighted hero worship. Anyone who simply wants to be told that Ronald Reagan walked on water and cured the lame will certainly enjoy this book. But anyone interested in a more balanced, and more thoughtful, account of the Reagan years should check out Lou Cannon's Role of a Lifetime"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear down that wall","review":"Noonan makes a great case for Reagan being a great President. I think a little is hero-worship for someone she worked closely for the white house but nevertheless she backs it up with stories throughout his life of how he demonstrated character and did what he said he would do as President. Also her insider approach allows the reader to learn more about the man than we thought we knew. I think the most interesting part is how Ronnie stuck to his guns in dealing with the Soviet leadership and it proved to be the right thing to do. He was a leader who didn't do a mission-shift midway through his presidency nor did he lead by polls. Personally, I think Noonan jumped around a little too much at the beginning but I still give it 5 stars as I could not seem to put it down. Even though I admired Reagan before, my admiration grew as I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly worn","review":"Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.

I have been passing around Norman Thomas Remick's book, \\"West Point\\", to my students as the one for the basic understanding of what character is. After reading Ms. Noonan's wonderful book, \\"When Character Was King\\", I intend to obtain several to pass around to our students as a good one to read as a practical example of character in action. Who better to have our children mimic than a President of the United States? As the Remick book is surprisingly easy to understand, Ms. Noonan has done a similar service by writing in plain (though eloquent), clear language that everyone can understand. No matter what one's political leanings are, I'm sure they want to help our children. I believe \\"When Character Was King\\" is a book that will help to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reagan was a better man than I will ever know","review":"In this easy to read book Peggy Noonan writes beautifully and simply to tell of Ronald Reagan, the man himself.

What would they have to gain by trying to conquer hundreds of millions of unwilling Western Europeans? The USSR feared attack by the US, thus they were forced to spend like mad to try and keep up a comparable military, resulting in economic disaster.

Her videos are not good ones to grow with because they are often too easy and her cueing is lousy and she can't keep track of reps so both sides of the body get worked unevenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT REALLY WORKS!!","review":"This is the best investment I have made towards losing weight and feeling great. It really truely works. I have tried diet pills, fad diets, everything. But this video shows results within 10 days. I noticed results by the end of the 1st week. I have lost 12 pounds in a couple months. My arms, legs, abs, back are toned. I get complimented on it all the time. The resistance band really works. HONESTLY you should by this video.As for the comments on drab setting and music. Here is my recommendation. Do what I do. After you get the hang of the routine and all the moves down. Put the TV on mute and blast your own music to get you pumped. WORKS for me! It will work for you! I lost 5 inches off my waist line."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I have a lot of Denise's dvds,including the first power zone. I think this one is better then the first.I was actually sweating to this one! It flowed better,and the toning segments are great.I felt the pain the next day,which I didn't with the original.The only thing negative is that her back up girls seem to be doing this against their will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable workout","review":"It was something different. I like using a resistance band with the aerobics. I found this workout to be a lot of fun. But you know Denise, she's upbeat, positive, her cuing is not great, but she is friendly and encouraging! I sweat a lot when doing the cardio part, and I feel GREAT afterwards. I think it was a very good total body workout. I have a lot of exercise videos in my collection, but I return to this one often because it is so much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gurkhas","review":"The Gurkhas are considered to be the worlds most feared foot soldiers. The crack Nepalese troops have fought almost every British military caqmpaign since 1816. When WW1 broke out, virtually every Nepalese man of fighting age vounteered. The British no longer employ many Gurkhas, though, so there's now about 300 applicants for every vacancy. Some who fail to make the cut commit suicide rather than face the disgrace they think they bring upon their families. Wages and pensions paid to Gurkhas are now Nepals third biggest source of forein currency, but Parker points out that the Gurkhas are still being ripped off with paltry pensions after a career on the front line that often leaves them permanently maimed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant album","review":"I'm a big fan of McSherry's music.

The book shows tablature, steps for stumming and each note but really the course is designed to follow Esteban on DVD.Example, after you've followed Esteban and learn part of a song, you'll know the song only by rote - not by reading the notes.Yes, he teaches technique well, but as a beginner, learning how to play the songs and read music is more important than the technique. My biggest annoyance is that the songs are short, abbrieviated to 1/2 page. For instance, you learn the chorus (only) of Greensleeves.On a positive note, the first 7 chapters of the DVD go through basics of the guitar, correct positioning, strumming and finger picking styles. This could be very helpful to beginners.Overall, interesting, but this won't teach me how to play the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISS PRINTS MISS PRINTS MISS PRINTS","review":"I was working on the second song (Green Sleeves) and found out the hard way that the diagram on page 26 does not match what I was trying to play.

Very frustrating.I received my dvd by SADIE yesterday and I began with her because I could see her muscles and could put my mind in my muscles. Very good work out I'm still sore.

The actual calendar on each page is a mere 5 inches wide, to apparently make room for the same picture on the bottom half of EVERY page(a picture of Rob's wife incedently). There is also a picture of her underlaying the calendar making the numbering very difficult to read. I would have given it another star if the picture at the bottom varied from month to month at least. If you're looking for a useful calendar, I wouldn't recommend this. If however you already have a calendar that you use, and are just looking for something with awesome pictures of Rob Zombie/House of 1000 Corpses, then this is the calendar for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This tv has died 2x in the last year.

I thought my wife was listening to an old CD, but no, it was the brand new one I got her. Yes, there are a few new tracks on there, but let's let the tracks that have been released over 3 times now finally be put to rest.

Recipes that include large amounts of butter, cream, cheese and creamed commercial soups are both too rich and salty. I'll bet they taste wonderful, however. Creating such fattening dishes is irresponsible. Also I resent having to use Paula's prepared mixes as part of her ingredients, eventhough she does offer the recipes to create substitutions for them.I have watched the TV cooking programs and enjoyed them. The food she cooks has always looked delicious though rich. Paula's accent is lovely to listen to, and her presentation is beautiful.Photos of the finished dishes would have been extremely welcomed.

This is not that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Mr. Martinson makes a few points over and over in this book. He enjoyed his time growing up in suburbia. Other people seem to love suburbia because there are so many of them living there. And it is wrong, according to Mr. Martinson, to criticize the way people choose to live, even if their behavior does the country as a whole and the world harm by the waste of resources and the overall degradation of life. He ridicules books that criticize the automobile and yet says almost nothing about increasing commuting time that more and more Americans put in in order to live in the suburbs. He implies that anyone who thinks Americans could live more efficiently if they were more densely populated wants nothing but 'big cities.' And the most insulting part is the premise that if many people are doing it now, it must be ok.

They had a large number of tracks, as well as great selections, and a good variation of genres. Unfortunately, \\"Now 3\\" does not follow in the footsteps of its predecessors. With a limited selection of ten tracks, it gives you no more than 35 minutes of listening. Also, unlike the first two \\"Now\\" releases, \\"Now 3\\" offers no variation in genre. Genre listing- R&B- 5 / Rock- 3 / Pop- 1 / House- 1 / And the biggest mistake- Rap/Hip Hop- 0. Do they have any idea how many people won't buy this record because hip hop is not represented even once? The people who selected the tracks for \\"Now 3\\" must be the same people that run the three major networks. So this Christmas, don't bother buying \\"Now 3.\\" Stick to the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about a rush job!","review":"Being a huge fan of this series, I was excited to hear about a new collection.I immediately ran to the store to grab a copy,but upon picking it up I noticed right away there was only 10 songs!I'm sure we all remember 18 on the last.This is a very dissapointing collection.Half are great,three are ok, and there is two that are horrible.Save your money kiddies and find it used!

If I wanted to hear Blink, Garbage, & Lenny Kravitz, I would never buy this mix. Just mix your own cd... if everyone had a way to sell their mix cds, you'd have quite a variety there.

I just purchased NOW-3 and firmly believe that I wasted my money on this album, it seems that they just threw any song into the album without thinking. If you are looking for a really enjoyable album that gives you the popular hits, I suggest buying \\"TOTALLY HITS\\", now that is a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now That's What I Call A Mistake!","review":"NOW 3 is nothing like all the other NOWs. It is completely different. A lot of the songs are songs that have not made it to the Top 40. Some are K-Ci and JoJo's \\"Tell Me It's Real\\", Ideal's \\"Get Gone\\", Case's \\"Happily Ever After\\", and the list goes on. It has rap-rock crossover, Limp Bizkit's \\"Nookie\\" and songs that made it to the Top 40 but are no good anyway like Blink 182's \\"What's My Age Again?\\" or Lenny Kravitz's \\"American Woman\\". Some songs are good, however, like Smash Mouth's \\"All Star\\", Backstreet Boys' \\"All I Have To Give\\", 98 Degrees' \\"The Hardest Thing\\" and Britney Spears' \\"Sometimes. But when half the songs on the album are bad, then it's not good. If you want an album that is half Top 40 and the other half songs you don't know, get this. Me?

How bout it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a four star, a 4.5","review":"This is a great cd. The best songs on the cd are Nookie (limp bizkit), and Hey Leo. (Blessed Union of Souls). Although I do not have this cd I still think the mix is great. Some songs get boring somtimes which is why I gave the album a 4.5. The cd has it all, pop, rock, ect.

It's the third in a series of albums that are a mixture of recent chart-topping songs. It contains great pop songs like \\"All Star\\" by Smash Mouth, \\"Sometimes\\" by Britney Spears and \\"All I Have to Give\\" by the Basckstreet Boys. It also has hip-hop songs like \\"Happily Ever After\\" by Case and \\"Chante's Got A Man\\" by Chante Moore. Also included are rap songs like \\"Nookie\\" by Limp Bizkit and \\"The Rockafeller Skank\\" by Fatboy Slim. That's why this CD is good for just about anyone. It has such a mixture that there will definitely be something on it you'll like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great complement to a Music Collection","review":"Now 3 is a great way to add to a music collection when you don't necessarily want all the albums of the individual artists but do want to keep track of the popular songs of the era. The remake of American Woman will never quite beat the predecessor, but it is a good attempt with a hip new beat. All Star is just a fun song with some interesting lyrics. Beyond that, Garbage probably wouldn't get much garbage time on the court, unless Mirsad Turcan were already out of the game. Limp Bizkit absolutely has no business on this album; I understand it is hot with the teenage kids, but it's just noise pollution for the rest of us and doesn't jive with the rest of the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!!","review":"I love it and you will too!

I bought his vacuum just to clean by bare floors as a broom has never done it clean enough and it works wonders on my floor as I can now move about comfortably without having to feel any dust particles. It however, is a bit noisy for some persons and I now wish it had a hose attachment to do other jobs but I knew that before puchasing. Other than that, you cant go wrong the quality that you get for that price.

This $ 39 vaccuum gets the job done right. I use it for my four bedroom house and it has yet to give me any problems.The only negative side it has is that for such a small product it is really LOUD. I mean you can hear its annoying \\"eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\\" all over the house. It bothers my ears, so I decided to get some ear plugs for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank god for customer reviews","review":"I bought this in 2005 and it died in 2006. For the year that it worked it cleaned well but was very loud. In the light of its death, I think 12 months use is very poor bearing in mind we had bare wooden floors only. In 2007 I bought the Hoover Flair..which lasted 1 month (and got a refund from Amazon) and I almost re-ordered this Dirt Devil..then checked my order history and these reviews to refresh my memory! I shall continue the search for a good vacuum and will pay more for one..as it seems the cheaper ones last about a year only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"I hate this vaccum. I have two kids, two dogs, and a husband that is messier than the other four. I bought this for my basement family room because I was tired of carrying my 'good' vaccum up and down the stairs, it has only been six months and I am shopping for something else. The hose clogs CONSTANTLY, and we call it the two steps forward four steps back vac. You have to go over an are 3 or 4 times to pick everything up, and the hose for the attatchments is only about a foot long so it's pretty useless as well. Yes, it's lightweight and the dirt cup is big and easy to empty, but what good is all that if it doesn't really vaccum?! If 0 stars was an option, this would get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Loud","review":"There are many reviews about this product so I'll keep it short.I think there are two problems with this vacuum:1. It is extremely loud. I vacuumed my 1 bedroom apartment 20 minutes ago and I still have a headache!2. It is hard to move it on the carpet.I purchased this vacuum from Wal-Mart for $40 today. I wanted something compact and cheap. Well, you get what you pay for. I will return it ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy for Small Size Spaces","review":"We got this for our summer cottage and here are the pluses and minuses:+ small size works fine for small rooms, under chairs, into corners+ handle slides down for compact storage+ no bags to buy, clear canister easy to remove and empty+ no accessories to clutter up the place+ long cord, plug into a central location & vacuum the whole place- hard to push on carpet, really have to put some strength into shoving it- won't vacuum throw rugs, eats them up (just shake them outside instead)- pretty noisy, but tolerable for a small time for small space- no adjustment level for carpet or bare floors"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this item","review":"I read the reviews before purchasing this item. The one negative feedback I read was that the filter was hard to clean. Not sure if that helped set a low expectation for me, but I would say nothing of the sort. If you live in a small space, like myself who lives in a 450 sq.ft.studio, and don't want to spend alot of money, but want a quality product, this is the household appliance for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, engrossing mystery, not just for \\"legal eagles\\"","review":"Sarah Caudwell's mysteries are a treat for lawyers and those involved in the legal profession, but also for readers who enjoy a good, page-turning, British-wit novel.

I know of no other book that gives the reader a taste of the true personality of billionaire, John D. MacArthur, a hard as nails business man who also quietly helped an untold number of people who had fallen into need. During the five years that I worked as Mr. Mac's personal expeditor, I especially grew to appreciate the way he managed to turn each day into a unique and exciting adventure. Bob found his view from the bar to be an adventure in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Sanford's book is very disappointing","review":"Very disappointing. Costs much more than the book is worth. It is 149 pages of large print and many pictures. There is too much about the author's life and not enough about Mr. MacArthur.The section about MacArthur's rise to wealth adds nothing to an earlier book about MacArthur called \\"The Stockholder\\". The information in both books is sketchy and incomplete.There is almost nothing about MacArthur's wives or children.I think that the information about MacArthur's cause of death is incorrect. The author cites pancreatic cancer but I think it was lung cancer which killed MacArthur.No one to-date has written a thorough biography of the life of this fascinating man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny!","review":"Maybe I'm old school here, but I thought you had to be funny to have a comedy album.

My son got this for his birthday party and I was only happy that I wasn't the one that spent money on it. It is slow moving for starters, which was an ultimate disappointment for my 4-year-old. When it runs into an obstacle the tires just click non-stop in an attempt to get away and change direction but it never actually accomplishes this. My son ends up having to retrieve and move it himself.

It sent chills all over my body and brought tears to my eyes with every note that he played. With his collaboration of mostly instrumental and some vocal on \\"I Surrender\\" my entire soul is transformed every time I listen to it. It is as if a piece of heaven has fallen from the sky and is playing through my CD player. On the CD there are parts where he speaks the Word of God and I am completely mesmerized! I could go on and on about how incredible he is and you could not even being to feel or understand what his music and testimony accomplish, until you hear it for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sellout","review":"If anyone who has listened to \\"I Surrender\\" heard anything that Darko had composed and played before going down to Miss. they would be able to understand that Darko has sold out. The music on this CD is vapid and for fans of easy listening music. It lacks the amazing soul that Darko's music once contained. I do not know how he went from jazz and music inspired by the folk music of his birth place, Yugoslavia.I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Bought this partially based upon the other Buyer review. Received the pad and put it on the mattress. It fits very loosely and bunches up under the sheet causing annoyance. Because it's waterproof, you tend to sweat because of it causing an uncomfortable sleep. Had to buy another mattress topper to put on top of it because of it. Also, the other reviewer said that this doesn't make noise - I disagree. The closest analogy is that it feels like sleeping on a diaper. It's noisy and annoying.

This is some the most original, disturbing, evocative music around. Interesting that Schutze goes largely unnoticed in the U.S. since a great many so-called New Age composers could learn a great deal from him. Very few--Roach, Rich, Greinke, the Hypnos group--come even close. Schutze taps the unconscious; adds a bit of the ominous; draws from a stunning variety of acoustic, electronic, ethnic, industrial, and mythological sources; and produces soundworlds of unparalleled richness and dimension. Highlights from this collection of what the composer calls \\"Stray Particles\\"--Part 6 of a Tone Casualties series--include \\"two mirrors facing,\\" \\"revered cigarette,\\" \\"the heart that fades,\\" and the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this little Label Printer","review":"This is the best price I coud find anywhere on the internet.I thought Doberman had the best prices until I ran acrossthese at Amazon, and these are a Genuine Brother Product too,Doberman isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The label count was at least 50 less.","review":"The label count was at least 50 less that what it said on the box.

I bent them flat and assembled the unit. For a top I used 1 1/8 plywood. My main problem is that the finished table wobbles and flexes. The problem is in the way the braces bolt to the legs. The threaded inserts in the legs stand proud of the surface of the legs. This allows the flanges on the braces to flex.

Once again the Chinese imports have found a way to disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I had great expectations given the other reviews, maybe I just have bad luck. The legs are painted very nicely and is sturdy. My major complaint is once assembled I could not get anything square. It was then I noticed that there were many parts that were bent and also no square.

Maybe I got a bad batch I don't know I just expected more for the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Grizzly, bad!","review":"Like others I recieved my bench base damaged. The packing is horrible still after all the complaints I'm sure the company has recieved. The flanges that connect the base to the top were bent and not even welded square or perpendicular to the legs. The factory drilled holes on the stretchers do not line up resulting in the bench being out of wack and racking. I have bit the bullet and sold it for a hit on c-list as I did not want to deal with returning it. I will build my own base to ensure it is correct. This base would be okay for someone that doesn't need a perfect bench. I am a fine woodworker and need something that is dead on accurate and does not rack or move. I would expect this from a company like Shop Fox i.e. Grizzly. Given the business the company is in, and the product I recieved is the reason for the low rating. If I could give it Zero stars I would. POOR product period.

The carrier had taken good care of it so I had no problem handling them. The nothing was bent and the paint on them was good. Everything went together easily. I made my own workbench surface from MDF and plywood and used 2 2x8's as rails spanning the leg posts to give more support between the legs. The tops of the legs are not shown in the picture but each leg has a square piece of metal with 4 holes welded to the top of the leg to attach the workbench top. If you use something thinner than 2\\" as a workbench top, you will need to provide your own support between the legs. The lower shelf has metal rails provided and is offset to allow the bottom shelf to be inserted easily. This is a very sturdy set of legs.

Her quest was different from my own -- she wanted to experience a world that spoke to her origins as a descendant of Sicilians. It was not agreat book, but interesting enough ."},{"rating":"2","title":"She describes it so well...","review":"She shares the feelings and experiences of meeting the people and places of Sicily.

However, my opinion may be bias. You see, I grew up with Vince Papale in Glenolden, PA. We lived about three blocks apart and went to the same schools. I was two years ahead of Vince. My sister and Vince's sister were best friends. I knew almost everyone and everyplace mentioned in the book. Although I didn't see Vince after high school, I followed his career with the Philadelphia Bell, Philadelphia Eagles, and TV sport casting years. Interestingly enough, the owner of the Philadelphia Bell was the star halfback on our high school football team. If you are looking for an inspirational story about a local boy overcoming many obstacles to become a professional football player, this book is for you. Unlike some similar stories (Rocky), this one is true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I enjoyed reading Invincible and thought the book was great.

Enjoyable tale and encouraging","review":"Like other reviewers have said, this book tells a great story of a guy who grew up poor, had all the cards stacked agaisnt him and used the doubt people had about him to feed his thirst for success. By comparison, the basic plot of this story reminds me A LOT of \\"Million Dollar Baby,\\" except Papale doesn't have one person doubting his ability, he has the whole world doubting his dreams of playing football.I thought the book was well written and would be enjoyable for probably any football fan, since the majority of the story does not revolve around Papale playing for the Eagles, but rather tells his whole story from childhood when he played sandlot pickup games to playing organized games later in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invincible","review":"This Book is a great incouraging story about Vince Papale who beat the odds and runs an explosive 40 yard dash in just 4.5 seconds.

Even then the veggies still seem to be soaked. Water and condensation are too close to the veggies creating a soggy taste and feel. And forget about vegetables that take a long time to steam (artichokes, for example). Steam for more than a few minutes and all the water will evaporate and you'll be left with a burning pot. I nearly destroyed a good pot because of this.Making the legs longer seems like a simple thing. Then again it might increase the price. I suppose you get what you pay for.Better to go with the type that goes on top of the pan, rather than the bottom of the pan like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"This product annoyed me. It's just so much work. I just feel as though a steamer should be a simple thing. It's not that it doesn't work, it just doesn't work well. You have to have the perfect size pot or pan, and then you have to fill it with just so much water so as not to soak the vegetables, it's not very big, and it's a pain in the back side.I ended up just buying a pot with a pot insert steamer that is MUCH easier to deal with and worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"good with 1 drawback","review":"I love this steamer for steaming vegetables and chicken. It is great because it forms to the size of the pan and collapses for storage.The only drawback is cleaning after steaming chicken. I've found if I spray it with cooking spray it helps a lot. I even reserve the water from steaming as a chicken broth (I usually season chicken before steaming)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Handy","review":"Fits in lots of different sized pots, fairly easy to clean, and seems sturdy so far.

I have a larger steamer and it is too big and a pain to clean the bigger pot required to hold it. This one is a great size for a small family or steaming vegetables for baby food. I was able to fit 1 giant crown of broccoli inside.The quality of the steamer seems decent, considering the price. It is not quite as sturdy as something you might find at crate and barrel, but it is stainless steel and after 3 or 4 uses I don't see any weak points in the design or construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjustable and simple to use","review":"The best thing about this steamer is that it conforms to the size of your pot. You can have a small pot or a big pot and it will fit. We usually use it for steaming vegetables, chicken and blue crabs.Cleaning the overlapping metals plates is the challenge. Not only there are many little spots where the food clings to, you also need to be a little careful if you scrub using your hands. I have another silicone steamer that is much easier to clean.So, the question to ask, do I want an adjustable steamer rack? Or do I want a fixed size steamer that is more convenient to clean?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disputed Farther of American Special Forces","review":"Disputed Farther of American Special ForcesThis book is a memoir of Volckman's role as head of the United States Armed Forces behind the lines in the Philippines during World War II.

Of note, the last chapter of this book is a treaties on the relationship of psychological warfare, guerrilla warfare and special operations that was ahead of his time when published.

Very facinating! I thought this book was a most insightful look into her world as first the Dauphine & then Queen, a girl & then woman and the property of the French Royalty whose 'sole purpose' was to produce a male heir...a Dauphin. The author helps one to understand the complexities of her priviledged cocoon in the beautiful palace of Versailles and the driving forces as she seems determined to undermine her whole world with many foolish & selfish choices. If you love history this book is well written & a comfortable read. One of my favorites on MA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja Vu","review":"This book is like a trip down memory lane. In fact, it is. As having survived the same season on the AT as McKinney, this book brings back the memories. It's an accurate depiction of the true trail experience, unlike other books that fall short (1800 miles short!) Buy this book for yourself, or give it away as an Arbor Day gift. Either way, get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"This is yet another glowing review, but completely honest. I loved this book! Rick McKinney is a true artist; the poetic way he paints with words is unlike anything I've ever read. I had no idea what the AT was, but the more I read the more I felt like I was actually on the trail with him. The raw honesty of his writing was so captivating; I couldn't put Dead Men down. It also brings to light many issues with American culture that most people choose not to think about and inspires me to be more compassionate and unselfish towards fellow beings on this planet. But it's not all heavy hiking, there are many humorous moments and I found myself laughing out loud many times. Rick McKinney and I share a common hero in the great gonzo writer Hunter S. Thompson, and he keeps the flame of his spirit alive and burning brighter than the sun. Let's hope it shines just as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, poetic, living story.","review":"There is little doubt that this guy can write! This is a book that you can pick up after weeks and get right back on the trail.

Never before have I felt so inside the head of a fellow adventurer than during my three-day-tear through this book. While pouring through author Rick McKinney's finest work to date, I flashed back more than thirty years to my first read of J. D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, a personal reckoning journey of its time. Now we have Lord Duke Jester's ramble up the trail, with an invitation to join him. McKinney gifts us with more than a glimpse of the searchers and characters driven to tackle the physical and mental challenges of the trail. As in any of our lives, no one really knows what is going to be lying around the next bend, and when you read Dead Men Hike No Trails you will wake up wondering what great thing is going to happen next. It is not yet the time to die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"After 189 pages I just couldn't take it anymore. I've read everything I can get my hands on that can about hiking the AT but I couldn't finish this book because I got so tired of the constant boozing, misogynistic behavior and self-absorbed monologues. The author is nearing 40 but sounds like a college student. His negativity - constantly putting down the people he meets along the way (except for the bedable women) and making gross generalizations about folks on and off the trail - was grating and disturbing. I don't really get why this book got such high marks for the writing. I found his thoughts disorganized and unfinished, fragmented and, at times reading like \\"brain salad\\" rants.But it looks like lots of other folks like the book, so there must be a market for this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the passion?","review":"I'm all about bands progressing to new sounds, but this change in Soncicflood is too much. My biggest gripe about this album is that it completely lacks the passion that their first album had. I did not find one song that intrigued me enough to ever want to listen to this album again, and I was a huge Sonicflood fan after seeing their original lineup on tour a few years ago and then buying the album. They seem to have completely lost their focus and passion for worshipping God that they originally broke out with a few years back. This album I would simply call Christian ear candy with a slight praise/worship bent. Save your money and buy a different album."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing stands out","review":"I read some of the review and thought for the low used price Why not. Let me tell you why not.

YEA it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All SonicFloos","review":"The original Sonicflood album is arguably the best praise and worship album out there. However, this if far from it. The real Sonicflood is gone, with the only remaining member of the original band the bass player turned lead singer who was not an original founding member. First, the new lead cannot hold a candle to former vocalist Jeff Deyo. Second, the passion and musical talent left with the original band members. I was so dissapointed with this cd that I threw it away shortly after purchasing it. If you're looking for a followup to the original Sonicflood release, you'll never see it. At least not in this life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time","review":"I hate to say but the days of the original Sonicflood are definitly over! Rick (the new \\"lead singer\\") led the public and fans on to believing that this album was coming from the same band that their original one did. That is sad first off that he felt he must ride off the name that the original band built instead of just starting a new band. Sadly there will never be another TRUE Sonicflood album. But I can tell you that Jeff Deyo's new cd comes out in March and it's gonna rock! Save your money from buying this CD and spend it on Jeff's CD \\"Saturate\\" when it comes out! You'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This album is NOT a Sonic Flood album. The energy and excitment of Sonic Flood is missing. I was so looking forward to the new album, that I am very disappointed in this CD. Worship wise, it is very strong lyrically, but the songs are just plain boring. I wish that this new band would have changed their name, so that I would not have bought this CD thinking that this was a Sonic Flood CD like the first. I wish Sonic Flood(Part 2) the best, but I miss the rockin worship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonic rip-off","review":"This is not the REAL Sonicflood. This album has no similarity to the original Sonicflood except the name. These new guys have made a lame attempt at reproducing the spirit of worship of the original Sonicflood, and their insincerity shows through.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've called themselves \\"Sonicflood Revisited\\"","review":"I was like so many who bought this CD thinking it was the original band line-up. I was disappointed, of course, and my initial listening still holds true. Yes, this album has a good rockin' sound, but this is nothing like the real Sonicflood. The new band line-up captures none of the essence of Jeff Deyo's band. Under another name, this version could've probably won critical acclaim. Cashing in on a recognizable name, however, was a mistake. Take the same guys back into the studio, give them another name, and try again.In the meantime, if it's the REAL Sonicflood you want... buy Jeff Deyo's CD \\"Saturate\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, sorry. Not as good as the original","review":"Even though I knew Jeff Deyo (original SF lead singer) had left the group, I naively assumed the other original members had stayed behind. To my surprise, I found that the group was completely \\"re-cast.\\" But I figured, \\"Maybe they're still moving in the same spirit.\\"Uh, not totally.Sure, the same sincerity of the original group was still there, but not the same passion. This album is full of weird arrangements and forgettable songs. I really don't like it, and that's saying A LOT for me because usually I love praise music with an alternative edge to it (such as delirious? and Third Day).It's too bad for the new SonicFlood because I'm sure their hearts were in the right places and I know they must have worked hard for this album. But (and there's always that \\"but\\") they're not the same SonicFlood I fell in love with. And that's a terrible shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't believe it....","review":"I couldn't believe it when I heard that an entirely new band dared to call themselves Sonicflood. After one studio album (and a very similar live one), Sonicflood emerges as an entire new band with an entirely new style, and a new record label. I don't get it.Finally it occured to me that the only reason to keep the name Sonicflood is to [trick] former fans in to buy the album before they realize that they aren't even buying a true Sonicflood album.People criticize my favourite band, Petra, for changing band members, but at least their founding member, Bob Hartman, still works around the scenes and has for the entire 30-year existence of Petra. As for Sonicflood, none of their original members remain only a mere four years after their first album released. Pathetic! :x"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"This is an pretty good cd. I've gotta admit, I was taken back at first by how different just the first song was that I almost didn't listen to the rest of the cd. After that, I almost didn't listen to it again. But this is just the kind of thing that has to grow on you, I guess. I've never really been one for ANY dance/techno music, especially with worship. But, again, it grows on you. As far as the worship aspect goes, if you're truly worshiping God, it shouldn't change your worship because you're singing out of the overflow of your heart's love, not out of your taste of music. Anyways, I would go for the cd, just be prepared for something really different from typical worship.

You probably already have the Iron Maiden and Angel Witch material on other albums, but the other, lesser-known bands like Ethel the Frog, Nutz, and Toad the Wet Sprocket (the metal band, not the 90's alterna-wussies who stole their name) are still worth checking out. It was an important album in the NWOBHM scene, bringing together the bands whose sound would change heavy metal forever. As an added bonus, Sanctuary's 2000 version features remastered sound, which you wouldn't otherwise get to hear on most these bands' material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the artists right!","review":"Come on!

Yes, I am Utah bashing, yes I am from Utah, that is why I find it hilariously sad that these developers chose to make a game about urban gang-warfare and street culture.

Also there isnt much of stealth in this game, its basically run and shoot. The guns all seem to work some what the same as eachother and aren't very impressive in my opinion.

I'd recommend to only get this game if you have online, because that's the only fun you'll have with it is when you do so.

My only negative comment on the collection was that I just couldn't bring myself to watch the \\"Mill on the Floss\\"...it just didn't seem like it belonged in the set, and was poorly done. But that is no reason not to watch the others in this wonderful set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call it 4 and a half.","review":"I lucked out and got this for a bargain price, but twice as much would still have been tough to resist. \\"Mill on the Floss\\" is a weak link, but understandably so, a very hard adaptation to make; I live in hope that Andrew Davies will get himself back together and do a good one. The rest are absolutely sublime. If you have the means, I highly reccomend picking one up (or five)."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Eliot DVDs on BBC at Amazon","review":"This series of DVDs contains Adam Bede, Daniel Deronda, Middlemarc, The Mill on the Floss, and Silas Marner. All are excellent productions by the BBC and were on my local PBS station and after viewing them I wanted to purchase them for my home viewing. Finally, they have come out on DVD altogether in one box set which I bought just recently and am enjoying them again. Adam Bede was one of my favorites as it contains one of the heroines from BBC's Pride and Prejudice production and she is featured as the lay pastor preacher in Adam Bede. Silas Marner is most memorable too as well as the other productions and I am so glad I made this purchase which is inexpensive as well as so vividly portrayed by the BBC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection","review":"These DVDs published in a bundle represent a good size cross section of Mary Ann Evans work. George Eliot was her pen name. She proceeded Jane Austen'l life and when I purchased these, I thought I might be getting more of the same type of viewing. This is not the case. All of these are dark and brooding, both in content and in film. They are unlike Austen in that the endings are not happy ones so keep this mind when you buy them. Middlemarch and Mill On The Floss are the most interesting of the set and the most famous of the lot. Most of us took Silas Marner in school. To be fair, she is a great authoress. In England, her following approaches that of Jane Austen. There actually is a George Eliot organization which believes that she has not had the support that she deserves due the popularity of Austen. Very interesting period writing but keep a box of tissue nearby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"After I had overcome the small product aspect I really enjoyed these. Not always the ending you want but she was a very talented lady and one comes away with the thought that much of the incidents are autobiographical"},{"rating":"1","title":"malfuction","review":"I recieved this DVD, did not watch it until three days after arriving. Middlemarch is not recorded correctly, it skipps two chapters and plays two chapters twice. I can not even return it because I had to play it find it was NOT PROPERLY RECORDED. This is a great story, it is so sad that it does not work, and worse that I am stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical BBC low production with great acting","review":"I have only been through the two movies, Silas Marner and Adam Bede, two of her books I have read. Both acted very well, however Silas Marner followed the story better. Of course Adam Bede is a longer book and requires considerably more editing. I'm very satisfied however. Hopefully our healthcare won't become comparable to the British TV production values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"All (no exceptions) of the movies in the collection were boring and just plain awful. I wish I could give it -10 stars. The acting in all of the movies was amateurish and reminded me of the \\"live\\" plays in black and white on TV in the '50s that were horrible. In addition, there should have been closed captioning because I couldn't understand half of what the actors were saying. The sets were cheaply put together and it showed. In one of the movies (I can't remember which one), there was a scene where a young man was at school taking a lesson from a fencing master and it was obvious that they learned the moves like dance steps and were counting how many times they were suppose to engage the swords. I laughed and laughed. If you are considering purchasing this collection, one word - DON'T. It's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic men...in all the movies- Negative 5 stars for each movie!","review":"this is by far the worst of the worst series I have purchased. Some of the movies are HORRIBLE, namely Adam Beade. The rest seem to be written about men who are really weak and guided by their own weaknesses. How and why would each story play out like such. I thought Daniel Deronda would be better but he too is a fool! I don't recommend any of these movies unless you like sitting and being utterly disappointed by the actors, stories and worst the outcome/ending of each one of these hideous stories. Absolutely the worst of the worst ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far!","review":"This has been great. I don't use it everyday or anything like that. I've only used it with baby in front, facing in and out. It works great. Yes, there are a lot of straps and buckles, but it gives you a great fit once you get there. I would have given it 5 stars but it won't let me cross the straps. To me, that would make it fit even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH FOR TOO MUCH!","review":"First of all there are so many straps it was confusing, and the instructions did not help. It also says that it will fit up to 35 pounds, which for my daughter, who weighs 28 pounds was not true. I ended up giveing it away to a women who's baby is alot smaller. I would say that 20 pounds should be more accurate for the weight limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you practice yoga, buy this book!","review":"When I read the poem about the Warrior 2 asana, I was hooked.

When it finally was released I felt really disappointed. I tried to listen to it several times, but there is not one track on this album that I even found mediocre,To think that this man released gems as \\"Closer to the truth\\" and \\"Lake Placid Blues\\"...Let's hope that his new album released in November 2002 will be a return to the classic TJW."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stocking stuffer for the yoga enthused!","review":"This is a tiny book about basically a chicken performing yoga moves while contemplating the breathing techniques and meditating.

The show also features a lot of Art Deco which I also love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"I have always been a fan of the Hercule Poirot mysteries and was pleasantly surprised when I bought \\"Movie Collection\\" Set 4. I had not seen the episodes included on these discs and they were very well done and longer than most of the usual Poirot episodes: as advertised, they were \\"Movie\\" length. I went on to buy sets 1, 2 and 3 and upon opening sets 1 and 3 was disappointed to find the episodes are exactly the same as the original recordings (which I already owned). These collections are sold using a STRONG suggestion that they are substantively different from the original recordings. I mean, it's only logical to believe they would be. Otherwise, why would Acorn Media sell the collections under the new description of \\"Movie\\" length? Why, indeed?If you own ANY of the original recordings of the Poirot episodes listed in the Movie Collections (with David Suchet), don't waste your money on these: they're the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"poirot season 1","review":"I love a good mystery. Enjoy the period look, architecture. Good quality filming. Even a little humor. A good friend to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Officially in Love ...","review":"As a long-time fan of Agatha Christie, I decided to go ahead and watch the Poirot series using my Prime membership. I was more than pleasantly surprised by David Suchet in this series! While being meticulous, and a bit prissy, David Suchet actually makes a very likeable Hercule Poirot.This series begins with one of my favorite stories - The Adventure of Clapham Cook - when Hercule is shamed into discovering why a domestic has disappeared!The appropriate settings and timeline are retained in this series, and I found myself looking forward to each new episode. Do start with this Season 1 if you, like me, are just being introduced to this wonderful brought to life series.While there are occasional variations from the original books, the stories are generally true to Agatha's intent.Nicely done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Dependable","review":"Poirot always gets his man or woman........ eventually. I've read many of Christie's books and short stories. These TVroductions do a decent job following the script. I find them thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"PBS Series","review":"If you're a fan of arm-chair mysteries, this is for you. The Poirot series is a step back in time to an error without the blood and gore and yet with a mystery to be solved. I love Agatha Christie's work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as always","review":"Well written and presented. A great break from special effects only stuff being made today. Totally suitable for any family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, Wretched Packaging","review":"Just a few words. This is one of the most essential collections in jazz. So much has been said about the wonderful music here that there is really nothing else I can add. The packaging, however....Great book! The CDs, though, are tightly packed in cheap cardboard slipcases in the cover. The CDs are guaranteed to get scratched as you sweat and struggle to remove them. You can do one of three things: Place the CDs in standard jewel cases, make backup copies, or both (like I did). This is too great an investment to needless damage the CDs just by taking them out of the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tragedy of a lonely woman!","review":"The stature of this emblematic singer of the jazz is absolutely undeniable. Her powerful, sensitive and expressive voice made of her, one of the most tragic icons in the jazz. She sung as she lived. In this sense she reminds too much to the legendary Edith Piaff in the other side of the Atlantic.What else might I add for cataloguing this cult artist that it has not been said just before? She is part of the history jazz and her memory will transcend and surmount the next years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"born talent, from the heart","review":"If you love the blues, and its history, this is a must have. Billie Holiday had a voice, and a tempo, and delivery, followed by back-men who are jazz/blues icons today, that was new, and fresh, and inspiring in their time, and remains so today. I lost all my belongings in a wildfire, including an extensive collection of Billie's recordings. This was my first step back to remembering her, purchasing this wonderfully produced CD. I now consider it a treasured musical archive. If you love Lady Day, relax, and listen to this CD, and you will be entranced again, and again. Her gift to us, forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete Sampler","review":"Far from being a jazz buff, I'd still take issue with the other recommendations of this set to be a sufficient Billie Holiday sampler for the general public. The single most important reason - it's missing \\"STRANGE FRUIT\\".It is Jazz's \\"Guernica\\", and therefore belongs in *any* Billie Holiday collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady Day: The Best of Billie Holiday","review":"Disappointed in CD--not what I expected. Have heard better of hers. Just doesn't do her voice justice--no power, and these are suppossed to be the best of Billie Holiday. Don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"the best of billie holiday","review":"This is not a good demonstration of Billie Holliday. First, too many songs squeezed into each side. Sound not good. For me, it was a waste of money. One of her best is the Billie Holiday-Lester Young CD \\" a musical romance\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate, but some questions linger . . .","review":"This is a magnificent collection to be sure, but I am left bewildered. Why, if this is the \\"complete\\" collection, does it omit some tracks that are on the 8 disc Japanese set, \\"The Lady: Billie Holiday Complete Collection\\"? And why, if the Japanese set is \\"complete,\\" does this American box contain many additional tracks? Billie was a wonder of nature, but the people at Sony are a little slippery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quintessential Billie","review":"It seems that I am always following Mr. Chell in my reviews, and he usually leaves me without any more to say! This case is no different - even down to the remark about the Complete Billie on Columbia. These are the gems, though. There are some great renditions of lesser tunes on both Basie compilations, and Lester compilations (I was just listening to \\"This year's Kisses\\" from \\"The Lester Young Story Vol. 1\\" - a really sappy tune rendered immediately listenable by Billie), and many people, myself included, find value in SOME of her later Verve recordings (they differ from track to track). However, if you get this, you get the best of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice fills up my soul","review":"All of Billie Holiday's recordings are so emotional. They fill up your soul!!!!! She sings all of her music with such passion & hurt. I never get tired of listening to her. I've loved her since I was a little girl. Her talent will never be duplicated not in a million years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry-level call","review":"This call was recommended to me by a guide on a goose hunting trip in central Illinois, Jan 2010. It's a great first call for a novice goose chaser. The included DVD covers the basic sounds that are commonly made with the call but doesn't delve too deep into calling strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A eye-opening family saga","review":"This is very well told, evocative memoir of several generations of the author's far-flung family in the Jewish diaspora. Most of the family lived in Malta, Italy, Tunisia, Israel and Egypt, and Tayar does an excellent job bringing their lives and times alive. This is an adroit mixture of family history and social and cultural history of the Jews in this part of the world, mainly in the often tumultuous 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Coast to Coast Walk","review":"A great book for planning and walking across England.

These two sisters from the East, with different dreams and futures, learning how to live and work on a deeded bit of land and rundown house. Teaching, establishing an apple orchard with apples to sell and how they learn to relate to the area people is a very absorbing drama. I enjoy it more each time I read it. Plenty of characters in it and it spans many years. You are also given perspectives from some of the locals who play major parts in the sisters' lives. I am buying the other books she has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nine Wests' better products...","review":"These look cute in the picture, but think twice before you buy.

Again, we have a comprehensive study into what made Zane Grey who he was and why he wrote the novels he did, and it makes for makes for fascinating reading. And I agree with him that the unexpurgated novels which have been appearing in recent years will only add to the mystic and the status of Zane Grey as the greatest writer of adventure set in the west. To quote Dr. Jackson from the book, \\"Zane Grey today is a refuge from the ocmputer-television-traffic jam-supermarket world with which most Americans have to contend.

I cannot really add anything to the list of topics covered in this book given in the review by Mr. Harrison. Mr. Dana is a good observer and chronicler of what he observed in Cuba in 1887. He is a good writer and wrote \\"Two Years Before the Mast\\" which I consider an excellent sea story.

Polk makes a solid product that's always dependable and their 3/5 yr warranty is better than almost all the other subwoofer I reviewed. The only problem was I purchased it through Crutchfield. Generally a good merchant but this time they couldn't do anything right. They claim the first one was lost in delivery but UPS had no record it was shipped.

Since then, coffee continues to get stuck somewhere in the machine. This wouldn't be a problem if you could access the blockage. However, there is only very limited access to the inner parts and opening the machine requires special tools (not to mention a manual). Therefore, the only way to fix even the most trivial of blockages is to send the whole thing to Jura's service center in PA at a cost of >$200. To do so once or twice a year is too expensive and simply unacceptable.Bottomline: Poorly constructed and very customer unfriendly! Avoid this manufacturer!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"After only one month of regular morning use the machine began to intermittantly malfunction. It would not complete a brewing cycle and would tell you to open the tap. This would go on for several attempts before it would finally complete a brewing cycle. Highly over rated and over priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a reliable machine","review":"We've had this for about one month, used it twice a day (two espresso drinkers in the house) and it's now starting to fail once a day. The machine will fail for a couple of attempts, ask you to open and close the tap, and evenutally work correctly. The espresso tastes great, but it's not worth the headache of using up beans on failed attempts. For this much money, you'd think they would have worked out the kinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, lackluster espresso","review":"I bought the E8, used it for three weeks and ended up returning it. I tried everything but couldn't get a decent tasting shot of espresso.I don't think machine gets hot enough, so espresso shots were very weak tasting! I tried changing the dial on the grinder, letting the machine heat up longer, but nothing improved the taste. I think it just uses too little espresso, as the pods when they are finished were smaller than I've seen from other machines.The machine is convenient to use, I will say that. But it looks cheap, and makes mediocre espresso, what's the point? I've had better espresso from much cheaper machines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Purchase","review":"I share some bad experiences too.I bought the E8 on Amazon and used it for 3 weeks. It was working fine initially until I started using my Capresso beans, which were delivered to me just last week (made use of the Amazon rebate offer). The machine seems stuck and there is no longer a clear stream of brewed coffee. Instead, the coffee came out in droplets literally and the amount also dwindled. The machine kept requesting that its tap be turned on. I've stopped using it altogether and have emailed the Capresso customer service for assistance yesterday. There's no point calling the toll-free number since I'm never home during office hours to go through the process. This should not happen since the beans ought to be compatible in the first instance.Other than that, I must say the machine is simple to use and very convenient. Although I do agree with Roell that it does look cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can make bad coffee for much less money","review":"All the reviews at WholeLatteLove were glowing except for one which said that this unit produces weak coffee. My experience with the machine confirmed this opinion. A fully-automatic machine gives you very little control over how the coffee is made inside the machine so you're stuck with what it produces. If you like a darker, more flavorful roast, this machine demands that you set the coarsest grind which reduces the flavor and intensity of the brew. Which is what you choose a dark roast for in the first place.The machine WAS impressively convenient; a triumph of technology on the countertop. For a mediocre result."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love it","review":"We bought this pot at williams sonoma Two months ago and just love it. We have had no problems with it and use it all day long for regular and decaf coffee. I've alway been a cofee lover, but since we got this machine even my husband has turned into a coffee lover. In fact, I think he loves it more than me! Our friends have started dropping in on there way to Starbucks and never seem to get to starbucks. I will say that the been used is very important. We found a nice houseblend at Costco that works great and is reasonable. Never bitter, always just right. You must make sure that the been is not too oily or the machine does not react correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capresso stands behind their products","review":"We learned about the Jura-Capresso E8 from Capresso after our previous Capresso C1000 gave up the ghost after about five years of great service. We've liked the E8 even more. In this day and age of not great customer service, Capresso shines as a rare exception. Each and every time I've needed any assistance, they've been willing and very able to help. It goes without saying that this is an expensive way to make a cup of coffee, but if you're trudging down to Starbucks twice a day for a latte you might find it's not so expensive after all.

I wouldn't say his childhood up til then was all bucolic bliss, and his first years after returning to the States were certainly stained with his experiences in the \\"green war\\" as he calls it. This is a memoir of a working class youth- with all the roughness around it. What sets it apart is it's also the memoir of a man who went on to become one of America's great poets, a man still able to cultivate love and tenderness. Weigle comes full spiral to a place where he becomes a translator of Vietnamese, and with his wife adopts a young Vietnamese girl- a tale in itself as compelling as the childhood and the war.

As with any personal development product, this cd was produced by JZKnight after the 'create my day' segment of the film. It is obviously designed to provide the least amount of information about the 'Create my Day' process as possible.

It should be remade with a section on the DVD titled \\"Step by Step Instructions of How to Create Your Day\\" -- so you actually do get to learn how to create your day.

She's very charismatic and, to tell the truth, even hypnotic at times. But her whole DVD was full of useless babble, delivered, mind you, in a very professional manner.

I was actually berated for not having an \\" open mind \\" and hanging on every word of Ramtha as coming here to show us the way. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that what she was saying was nothing new but watered down self-help and we are all gods, etc. Same old crap re-packaged for people jaded on the Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Buddhist main stays.

JZK is more interested in copyrights and rehashing its material, maybe have you bit $10,000 for a one hour session with ramtha. Ramtha is as expensive Eliot Spitzer's prostitutes.The disapperance of universe by gary renard is a far more interesting book, and gives a better explanation than whatever ramtha gives. Including the creation of the universe.

Just a boring woman talking dribble drabble.The content is such intellectual junk that it's not useful at all.

In such elegant language and concepts, Ramtha describes the process of consciously manipulating the quantum world--it is the right and privilege of every human being to do so. The concept of creating your day lends such hope to the hopeless and inspiration to the uninspired, that even an modicums worth of believe in this discipline can begin to positively change your life. Ramtha explains in complimentary teachings that not only do the great scientific minds have access to the quantum world but so does everyone, and that if we consciously create our day through our access to the world of the unseen, which is the foundation of all things, then we can begin to see how our dreams can become real. This video teaching represents an opportunity to begin the process of changing your life.

You know, the scene about really driving the car you want while sitting in your living room. If you can duplicate that scene as it relates to your health, relationships, family, finances, spiritual development, quality of life, then you can create your life by managing each day's plan. If Ramtha takes 45 min of your time without doing more than to just motivate you, without giving you more concrete instructions than I just gave you, ... well, she's ripping you off.

This video is a good aerobic workout for a decent amount of time. So many say it is a 30 minute workout but by the time you warm up & cool down it is a 10 minute workout.

This tape is fantastic! It gets you going the combinations are powerful but not dificult to master and what a workout. After a couple sessions my whole body felt it - It incorporates your whole body, all the major muscle groups. If you like kickboxing but are bored with your regular routine then this is perfect.

I thought it might be more challenging, or just add some variety to my workouts. I did the DVD twice and yes, it got my heart rate up and all, but it was just dull! The \\"advanced workout\\" was a joke - the same workout, but with \\"challenge\\" moves at the end, after my heart rate had gone down! My advice: try TaeBo II instead.

It is the only workout tape that I have been able to do over and over without getting tired of it. Kathy Smith teaches the punches and kicks so well that by the time I stepped into my first beginning kickboxing class, I felt like a pro. She's very descriptive and explicit about how each move should be done, which I appreciate while I'm working out so that I can focus on the enjoyment of exercise instead of worrying about whether I'm doing it wrong and risking injury.

The workout is a good length and the moves are easy to master. I like all of the bonus features, like being able to add on the advanced combos and the Tai chi session. I also feel like this video gives you a good amount of warm-up and cool-down time with plenty of stretches to avoid injury.One of the things I really like about the cool-down/leg exercises near the end of the workout is that she does all 4 kicks slowly using a chair for balance. This provides a good cool down while showing you proper form and conditioning your leg muscles so that you will have better kicking form next time you do the workout.On a side note, Kathy instructs so that you can mirror her (i.e. she punches with her left and tells you to punch with your right) which I have an easier time following than the other way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough instruction and boring","review":"As a user of the Billy Blanks Tae Bo tapes, I got this looking for another fun tape to do.

I don't understand why Kathie Smith didn't leave all the kickboxing to the guy, Jeff Cooke. This guy has the power, speed and aggressiveness that I want to see in a kickboxing DVD.Otherwise I'd buy one of the countless aerobic DVDs.The movements of the girls look like dancing.The TaiChi \\"thing\\" is ridiculous and has absolutely nothing to do with TaiChi.Next time, move Kathie and her girls to the back row and let Jeff do the kickboxing and there you have it, a good workout DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a So-So Kickboxing video","review":"I typically like Kathy Smith and her videos.

There's a male martial arts guy named Keith Cooke. There is also another female (?) in the video and she scares me to death! I'm so frightened of her that I won't do this video anymore. I wouldn't want to meet her in a lighted alley!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy Smith annoyed the heck out of me!","review":"If you're a Kathy Smith fan, then you can ignore this review. If you don't know who she is, consider yourself warned. After doing the Billy Blanks Tae-Bo thing, I liked it but wanted to try something new. I found Kathy Smith so annoying I had to turn off the video. And what's the deal with her hair-do anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy Smith- kick boxing","review":"We still have not received the item, so we can't say. We wanted the tape for my son for the summer, but now it is just about time for school to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I bought this kickboxing workout video instead of the Taebo video because of all the great reviews. When I actually tried it, I was very impressed at the simple instructions and careful camera angles. I have other videos in which the instructor is doing some fancy footwork and the camera is shooting a close-up of the face! That gets really annoying because I end up not knowing what's going on for a few seconds. With this one, I was able to keep up with the routine the entire time. Kathy even cues you in at all the appropriate times. And by the end, I worked up a good sweat. All in all, it's a great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous workout for the busy person","review":"You have to be at a regular workout pace to start this video. But once you get into it, its wonderful. I work a lot and have little time to myself, so I needed an workout that targeted a variety of areas. This did the trick. It is an upbeat program that is fun to even turn on your radio to instead of the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout!! Love it!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite cardio workouts!!! I have many DVD's & tapes. I feel awesome afterwards. It may be a bit tough to get the moves down but, keep trying. It is fully worth it. Excellent for stress relief!!! I rotate to a new cardio workout DVD/tape every 4-5 weeks and I can't wait until it is time to do this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kickbutt workout!","review":"This video is really fun and pretty easy to do. You probably won't get everything the first time, but after a few tries you'll have everything down. I don't have any experience with kickboxing but the moves were not hard to pick up. It made me sore even though I didn't expect it to, and it's definitely very aerobic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith is the best! This video is amazing--A must have!","review":"I have heard the craze about Tae Bo and I have tried the videos (they are not great). This video by Kathy Smith blows them all away -- it's terrific! True to form, Kathy's video is safe and effective. She is such a good instructor -- she made me feel confortable doing the workout while having fun. I wasn't worried about injuries because she shows you how to do the workout as a beginner as well as at an advanced level. The routine is a real fat burner too. The production is interesting and not \\"too over the top\\", and the music kept me motivated. I recommend this workout for anyone -- even if you thought kick boxing was \\"not your cup of tea\\". Try it, you won't be sorry! I have been doing workout videos at home for 10 years and I've tried them all. Kathy Smith is truly the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT A BAD WORK OUT","review":"I found that the tae-bo advanced tapes gave me a better work out. I still enjoyed doing this work out and Kathy Smith gives you good instruction on proper form which is very important. I would use this tape on a day when I don't want to push myself to the limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH OWING THIS ONE.","review":"The video was better than expected. Great workout for beginners/intermediate, a little slow for advanced. Very similar to Tae-Bo. Easy to follow -- and much easier on the body than Billy Blanks Tae-Bo videos. You work up a sweat without injuring yourself. Kathy Smith could not do an advanced tape of this nature -- not a powerful leader in this area. But overall, a very good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time a challenge","review":"This was a difficult first workout. I learned Tae Bo with Billy Blanks but after a while you just wish for a little more variety. Kickboxing is very fun, but it is even more fun with challenging and interesting combinations. I was getting tired out during the warm up. I like the way Kathy Smith leads her excercise tapes (using mirrored moves so you can just copy what she's doing). I really recommend Tae Bo too (especially the Cardio Circuit I tape) if you enjoy kickboxing. Maybe this was easier to pick up because I had previously learned the basic moves? I would see if your library has it before investing because there are different exercise styles and needs for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners","review":"This is one of the best kickboxing videos for beginners because the instruction is very good. Kickboxing can be dangerous if the moves are done incorrectly. Kathy explains everything quite well which makes this the perfect tape for those wanting to learn kickboxing. It's also a great workout for intermediates, gets the heart rate up, and it's fun. Advanced kickboxers would be bored with it. It's another great Kathy Smith tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cardio workout!","review":"I was skeptical about ordering this DVD, but once I pushed play - I was just amazed as to how energetic the workout is. I find it much better than working out to my FIRM videos. Kathy makes each step easy to follow and what I like most about this workout DVD is that she lets you take at least a break in between. I would highly recommend this DVD to all my fitness friends! This was worth my investment! Now Kathy's inspired me to purchase other videos she has done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for training, not for cardio","review":"I'm really surprised and disappointed that so many people gave this video high marks, especially since I bought the video based on those reviews. I rarely contribute comments on videos, but after doing this video for the first time today I was so disappointed I have to comment. It is a great instructional video for the beginner who has never done a kickboxing workout before. But if you are looking for a cardio workout, this is not it. Kathy takes so much time to teach and build up all the components of a move. Then when you finally do the complete move, the number of reps are very low, and you are back to training for the next move. I barely broke a sweat. If you are looking for a great cardio kickboxing workout, buy Power Kicks (Aaron Langford). I'm desperately searching for another great kickboxing video to have some variety, but with Kathy's video I'm disappointed yet again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great & Energizing Video!","review":"I have recently taken up martial arts and wanted a workout to get me in better shape and also improve my kicks, etc. The tape has a 10 minute warm-up, cool-down, and the workout itself. In all, about 45 minutes which will have your sweat glands working to the max. The music is energetic and the cueing is excellent. There is one section which breaks down each kick in slow moves that improves your form if done about 2-3 times a week. I have tried other kickboxing tapes and have found this one to be the safest. They encourage you to go at your own pace; there is a split screen informing you of the correct technique, and adequate warm-up and cool-down segments. I just love this workout as it is energizing and a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickboxing Workout","review":"It was fun!!! I didn't particularly care for the music, but that goes for most workout videos I've done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I'd have to say that on a technological level, this video is reminiscent of something from 10 years ago. It is of extremely poor quality and the camera angles are terrible especially in comparison to another of Kathy's Videos, Aerobox(1994), which was superior. As a competitive athlete I may be judging the workout portion too harshly, but I found it to be a Tae Bo copy (not to say that was much better) using moves that would hardly be challenging for a beginner, which is the only way to form strength. I wish beginners who have used the video once would stop rushing to their computers telling the public that it has changed their lives. I plan to return this video and would discourage anyone from purchasing it. However, one thing which I do not understand is the purpose of Keith Cooke. He seems capable, but he had no real instructional part in the video, probably just another advertising icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $$","review":"The video is nothing compared to what the reviews that are posted. I was looking for a workout comparable to the kickboxing classes that I take at my local martial arts school. There has to be a better video than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"Well, I'm not saying it's a \\"BAD\\" workout...I just felt it was a little slow...okay, VERY slow. I didn't break a sweat and could barely finish it. I felt that I was standing around most of the time waiting to get started. I personally like Billy Blank's Tae Bo's MUCH more and find they are much better workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Aweful!!!","review":"Why does Kathy Smith have a following? Why does she have to make those sounds and sound so insincerely chatty? Ugh! If you hate exercise videos where the fitness leader \\"acts\\" as if the workout is sooooo fun, even orgasmic, then skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my boyfriend loves this video!","review":"This is the first workout I attempted after the birth of my daughter. The first few times were a major challenge, but I have been doing it 3 times per week for 3 months now and, not only have i actually stuck with it, but I have my pre-pregnancy body back! I really don't feel I can say enough good things about this video. My boyfriend and I do this video together and we have both been very impressed. And the best part - as I get better I can focus more acutely on the relevant muscle group and maintain the difficulty of the workout. I highly recommend this video for all levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK workout- Few combination moves","review":"I have been kickboxing for some time and I was a bit disappointed to find this tape to be more of an instructional tape for those just beginning to kickbox, than a good workout for someone with experince. The warm-up section (10 min) is good and is followed by a cardio section (25 min) that focuses on teaching punches and kicks. After the main workout there is a short section which focuses on the leg and butt and is very helpful for improving kicking form. The stretching section and the abs section aren't worth it. I usually end up doing my own stretching and abs. The real disappointment for me in this video is the lack of combination moves. The ones that Kathy does do aren't that difficult and are very short. Kathy is also a little irritating after the third or fourth time of doing the tape. I am looking forward to trying XKO and other kickboxing workout tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"kathy smith's kickboxing workout","review":"I hate to disagree with all the positive reviews (which is why I bought the tape), but this is not a tape for beginners. Actually, I've been doing kick boxing exercises for about six months when I got this tape. I still found it too complicated to get into easily. The moves change quickly from one to another, so I was always behind and off balance. I suppose that would improve with time. Don't get this unless you are pretty well coordinated. In all fairness, I am older and not terribly well coordinated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cardio workout","review":"This workout is great cardio. I liked Kathy Smith's version much better than Tae Bo. This was better choreographed and I liked the way moves were broken down. I also like that the DVD has a feature that is devoted to helping a person do the moves correctly, that was a chief problem I ran into with Tae Bo.I also liked that this workout was functional for a person at home and understood that not everyone has excessive amounts of floorspace, the way some cardio workouts do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not into it","review":"Can't say I'm that excited by this tape. I've done quite a few Kathy Smith tapes and have seen great results with all of them...except for this. I don't feel that I build up enough of a sweat and the moves irritated me. I don't find there is enough kicking or high impact cardio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it), I picked up this tape. I had heard of Kathy Smith, but had never seen any of her tapes, but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular. Her approach is calm and knowledgeable, and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move. Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this, but after that it's fun and sweat all the way! Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym, and good for the kickboxing newcomer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I have been doing Taebo for about a year, but this tape is much better! It is slower and more instructional so you get a better work out. Taebo tapes tend to go too fast and you miss half the workout trying to keep up also the kicks can cause injuries if you do them too fast and too high! This tape slowed me down and gave me a better workout all around, i was sweating more than taebo workouts and i know i got a better workout with Kathy Smith kickboxing! i switch the taebo tapes and Smiths kickboxing tapes for more variety! her tapes have helped me with my stance, my kicks and my punches to make them more affective as well as adding strength to my kicks and punches! I am very pleased with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for experience beginner","review":"I read all of the reviews for this DVD before buying. They were extremely helpful. I've been doing the original Taebo workout at 20mins, but needed more. Taebo Advanced was too fast, jumping to 60mins and not exercising with perfect form led to some injuries. I just finished viewing and doing the workout on this DVD and it's just right. The exercises are slower and more controlled. Kathy's direction and instruction are excellent for the uncoordinated like myself. The DVD format is also maximized by allowing several camera angles of each exercise and jumps to the instructional screens for quick reviews. Great DVD and workout for your dollar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD is a great format for workouts","review":"I have taken kickboxing classes at my local YMCA, but this DVD is a lot better. I like the multiple camera angles and the fact that you can slow down the speed of play so you can watch the moves in slow motion. As a beginner, I also appreciated Kathy Smith's teaching technique. I also like having the option to customize my workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrrreeaaattt Aerobic and Toning Workout","review":"You're gonna sweat a lot during this exercise, and when you end it you'll feel sooo good. It contains two different exercises + a very nice ab workout. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I bought this workout tape to get back in shape after my baby. Although I did work up a sweat, I thought some of the moves were complicated and had the potential to injure my knees. I think someone who has some previous kick-boxing experience or is really fit and agile would enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains useful nuggets, but unsatisfying overall","review":"If you're looking for one book to introduce you to GUI design and give you a solid grounding in design for usability, this isn't it.

It's also true that several others are excellent, but Arlov alone has found a way to balance detail with breadth. I'm steadfast when folks get sarcastic about it being a Dummies book - I look them straight in the eye, rattle off all the other titles I've read, and say \\"this is the one to read and keep on the desk.\\" The book comes with a CD (not a 3.5).

Each section is virtually a paragraph, so it is easy to find parts of the argument. The book is of a good (material) quality; the paper is nice, the printing is flawless.If you're interested in the sublime, this book will be a good addition to your library. The author covers a lot of ground in a rather concise manner, which I found enjoyable.I presume some of the medical knowledge he exposes in his volume is rather out-dated, but never so much as to sound ridiculous.The punctuation is slightly different from what we would use today, meaning that you'll find commas where we wouldn't place any today, but is not any the less readable for so much.Other than that, excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful to an Owner or Handicapper","review":"As a handicapper who is considering buying a thoroughbred race horse, I had high hopes when purchasing this book. I have read many handicapping books; this one is the most poorly written book by far. I can't believe a professional editor, if one was used, would have ignored the spelling, grammatical and typographical errors as well as the incomplete and awkward sentences. It made it difficult to read. The material was also very weak with very limited detail on any subject. Skinny to begin with, the author repeats many of his points using almost the same words with little additional insight. Hard to assess the value of the subject information. I can't say that it's not right and it gives the reader some different things to consider when handicapping or claiming. Despite all its weaknesses, I rated it one star because it got me motivated to quickly learn as much as possible about acquiring a horse, before I jumped in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic trash","review":"This is a very poorly written and organized book. The information presented is nothing more elaborate than one can find in any decent track program and/or the racing form. If one were to pay $3 for this book, one would still be getting ripped off. If you already know which end of the horse bites and which one serves as a waste delivery system, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for novices","review":"This book would only be useful to those who have never owned, or spent much time around racing or race horses.

I personally picked-up this book to gain general knowledge about soil, and I found everything I asked for and more. Nevertheless, there were things that I felt were not explained enough, but that's not the fault of the author because I am neither a master gardner nor a farmer. In the begging of the book it almost seemed like the author was one of the environmentalist extremists, however as I continued reading I found the author to be a responsible writer with no extremism. As a matter of fact, on several occasions the author offered advise to non-organic farmers.

She sat on the grass by the wayside of the road at a tourist site. Her music was absolutely gorgeous - it was truly a heavenly sound. I was thrilled she offered a CD and immediately asked my husband for the cash to buy it.When I returned home and opened it to play it I was totally disappointed. It sounded nothing like what she was playing that day. There is a predominance of Indian flute music in several of the songs. The first song was dissonant, not melodic like her performance in person.I was hoping for something completely different. I was disappointed, I am sorry to say, because she is a gifted musician. I hope she'll make another CD with her glorious celtic harp music alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I bought this because I'm a Python fan and enjoy documentaries and historical accounts. But this product is very disappointing. Firstly the picture quality isn't great. Secondly it's very amateurishly done: The interviews are done in grungy surroundings that are irrelevant to the subject. The host is sitting in front of rock band equipment, and the interviews are done in dark rooms. It's very unprofessional. Thirdly, the footage excerpts go for too long... anyone who buys this will be a Python fan, so they don't need or want to see a lot of material they already know or have. Fourthly, there's nothing new here. I didn't learn one thing that I didn't already know. I'll be selling this on eBay. I just don't want it, and I love Python."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming mystery with great personality.","review":"I appreciated the information on the Quaker tradition, and that the heroine is not a super hero or private sleuth.

It was easy to put together, is sturdy, and installed quickly. Holds two full sets of towels (bath, hand, and wash cloth). The hooks that go over the door are deep, so I rolled up an old hand towel and wedged it underneath both hooks to ensure the rack stayed still. (You can also screw it into the door, but I didn't want to make any marks or damage the door.) I also Scotch taped a pad of little yellow stickies under each of the hooks at the bottom to hold the rack away from the door so it wouldn't mark the paint on the door.

The design is great and most importantly, so is the coffee. It's pretty easy to use. My only complaint is that after 2.5 years, the on/off buttons are failing. Of course it's out of warranty and the only service shop is 40 min drive away (I live in NYC). It's a bit of a bummer as you would think that this should have held up for many, many more years.For this one mechanical reason, I am having a very hard time recommending this.

Unfortunately, as another reviewer noted, coffee only drips out of one side or the other of the double spout filter holder. This makes for unpredictable quality/brew times, and a huge hassle if you want to make multiple shots. I've tried it with pods, single and double filter. And no matter what type of bean or grind, it would drip instead of pour out in a stream like it should.I tried everything to save this machine because I loved the look, functionality, and the compact size. No luck. I called Breville about the one-or-the-other filter. No help. Even they suggested that I return it. Why I didn't get an Italian-designed machine is beyond me. I am going to exchange this for one and hope it does a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Brew","review":"I have used a Starbucks barista for over 10 years so I sort of know how to make espresso, but wanted to upgrade recently. Like many here I too found this unit marked down so I purchased it. To make a long story short, no matter what type of espresso, how I grind it, or how hard it is pressed down in the basket, I get the same result. A quick black brew and then it immediately turns clear and watery, and yes this is a shot glass amount, no over watering. I am very disappointed and plan to return the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firefly Buys attempt at ripoff","review":"Just received my machine.

Overall, a complete waste of time...can't use the machine and it's a pain to have to deal with them on this issue and repackage/ship the machine.

The first one was EXTREMELY hard because of serious lack of save opportunities. The second was way too easy even on the challenge mode, although two personalities added fun replay. Now, this third one has a little of both. Easy mode is REALLY easy, while nromal is pretty difficult (make every shot count!) The Mercenaries sub-game you open the first time you beat the game is an interesting twist, as people who buy rather than rent this game can keep playing after they've beat Nemesis. My policy has always been rent first, buy second, but if you do enjoy the Res Evil series, you should buy it, as you know what you're getting into. For those who don't want that much commitment, renting it twice should be enough to beat the regular game."},{"rating":"2","title":"RE3 Kicks Butt!","review":"RE3 is the best Resident Evil yet. The graphics, sound, weapons, stoyline, and movies all kick butt. The only bad thing about RE3 is that the big dude is every where you go, you can't get away from him, untill the end, but every thing else is the best.

Unfortuanateley when something is well made and original there is always a danger of sequels designed to make money on past glories. Sure the game is smoother than the original but the jerky character movement in the first game was part of the appeal. This game isn't original any more it has run out of surprises and the puzzles are starting to get really tedious.

Also, if you want a frightful strategy game, you might want Echo Night(maybe). Just don't be RE3! DONT BUY IT AT ALL BECAUSE RE3 ISNT LIKE THE OTHERS!

I had a deposit on it three months before it was released and all I can say is WOW. This is the best game in the RE series so far. This game offers live selection which is a great added feature but I especialy enjoy the fact that you are not locked into your selection (Dino Crisis) for instance if you make a decision and the change your mind the game always leaves you the option to take another route. This is the best game ever and I hope that the upcoming dreamcast version of RE4 will be as well thought out as RE3. All in all new weapons, new moves and lots of fun.

You visit many places that you visited in R.E.2 and a few new ones. I can't say this one was a scary as the first two, but it will make you jump every now and then.

U either put it on easy and it starts u with enough ammo to finish the rest of the game with, or u put it on hard and it makes it so u barely have enough. But the worst part is the tyrant. It chases u so u barely have a chance to explore. It literally follows u through doors and into new areas constantly! He's hard to kill and always comes back. Plus he can kill u in one or two hits and is fast. It takes away from the fun of the game.

It is the most suspensful and the puzzles almost make sense. In easy mode you start off with almost all the weapons and in hard you start off with a handgun and 15 bullets. Beat the game in hard mode and you unlock the merchanarie mode. I recommend it for any fan of Resident Evil games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monsters, horror, bloodshed, mystery, ACTION!","review":"Although I have yet to finish the game, I have played it enough to recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies or just a challenging mystery. Jill Valentine (or Carlos if you so choose) has to battle through the monster clogged debris of Racoon City, avoid the nearly indestructible Nemesis, and solve the mystery of what has happened. Oh yeah, and surviving it all would be nice. Doing so is thrilling and addictive fun. The graphics and sound are topnotch and the suspense level quite high. Usually I consider video games to be an utter waste of my valuable time, not so here. This is time well spent, especially if you love all things horror. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ask yourself:\\"Do i feel lucky\\"","review":"A great game,even though you need to a lot of patience,but I guess that's what makes it great,couse even though you thought you've been to a place you can't expect the same things when you get back there.This game can really make you jump with fright,especially when you are really concentrating.Those zombies jumping up from nowhere.Wow.Don't play it when your'e alone,you'll scare yourself.Graphics is absolutely great.Blowing those zombies to bits is also really cool.Sounds are very realistic and sometimes really scary.You'll love this game no matter what.It's like starring in a great action movie(well except your'e a girl if your'e actually a guy,but a girl that can really kick butt and stand her ground).All I can say is.Coooooool."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an alright game for a resident evil series.","review":"I played the second resident evil when it came out on nintendo64. And I must admit, Resident Evil 2 is hands on more brilliant than Resident Evil 3. Nemesis is a cool character, but basically it get's borring after a while. It does follow a similiar story line and it seems the creatures always stay the same. The downside of having Resident Evil 3 was the fact that it kind of tore me away from the series. Although the second resident evil game was awesome, Resident Evil 3, couldn't pull off on the graphics. The music was good however, and it did have a good sound to it. It just needs a different story line and a more complex one. I must say, if this is your first time playing Resident Evil play the second game before you play this game. The second game is by far better through it's graphics, story line, and characters. Overall, this game would be good for a addon for someone who collects resident evil games. I, myself, didn't care to much for the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool 3rd option for the series.","review":"Let me start by saying that out of the 3 this one is the most improved in terms of the facility to handle the controls. I won't get into much detail because others have pretty much summed it up, but I will say that part 1 and 2 were a bit of a notch superior than this one, although it is expected, afterall the first two were classics. But they did a fine job in making a strong 3rd one. As far as the feeling of getting scared is concerned, the first two were scarier. Still a superb game! The puzzles are very good for most of the part because at times they can be hard which is challenging. However, it does not have that flavor of the first two, but nevertheless an entertaining time."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll laugh, you'll cry, it'll become a part of you","review":"If you are looking for something to do a rainy afternoon, I suggest RE3.

I THOUGHT SEQUALS WERE SUSPOSED TO BE ABOUT PROGRESS, THIS GAME PLAYS MORE LIKE REGRESSION. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESIDENT EVIL 2 AND RESIDENT EVIL 2 SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESIDENT EVIL 3. THERE IS LESS VIOLENCE IN THIS GAME! THE MERCENARY MISSION IS SHORT AND THE REWARDS ARE NOT NEW TO THE RESIDENT EVIL WORLD (IE. GATLING GUN, ROCKET LAUNCHER) AND THE NEMISIS IS SIMPLY A SLIGHTLY MORE PERSISTENT VERSION OF THE TYRANT (TYRANT MEETS SCICCORMAN).

Well, I guess a game about criminals vs. law enforcement (COPS AND ROBBERS people) is so horrible that it should be taken off shelves while games like GTA remain where you can randomly walk anywhere, carjack anyone, kill anyone, and destroy anything....yeah that's much better for our youth. Now the TRUE problems with the game; the single player game is pretty lame. On Xbox Live it's about as fun as games get, but the problem is about 50% of the time people find a way to cheat and walk through walls and stupid stuff like that and it causes the game to crash (hence the 2 star overall). Way too many glitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad and fun","review":"Game isn't bad It is linear and story driven so there is no open world but the story takes a twist early in the game and you go from there.

That is to say: the nylon bristles in no way are a good replacement for boar bristle, as the description implies. Other than the bristles, everything seems to be of good quality (but the bristles make a brush, don't they?).

And though I have remained faithfull reader so far, I think this book marks the end of the road for me.

One, because I have a lot of time to read and two, because it was a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're old enough to have hot sex, you're old enough to stop whining.....","review":"Just so I'm sure I understand, please allow me to repeat the facts as I understand them. Your financial situation is about to result in your loosing everything you own, everything you've worked for. Further, your little sister is about to loose her chance to pursue an education, something that she desperately needs, the reader realizes after listening to her for only a handful of sentences. But wait...all is not lost.....the ever present estranged Uncle leaves money, and not just money, eighty million dollars. Yes, Eighty Million Dollars. But alas, our heroine has decided she does not want the dirty money because of the attitude and unfortunate vocabulary of the erstwhile Uncle.I;m sorry...that's all. you lost me....I can abide many things but a stupid, whiny heroine....just no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable - Not Garwood's Best","review":"I bought it in hardback when it first came out, and I can honestly say that it's a forgettable venture on Garwood's part. I love almost every one of her historical romances, and I LOVED her first contemporary, \\"Heartbreaker\\", but I'm convinced that her contemporaries are on a \\"good one\\"/\\"bad one\\" pattern. I like only every other contemporary that she puts out. Half of them are duds.\\"Slow Burn\\" is formulaic and lacking in creativity and passion in the romance department- the characters are not ones that I connected with or can root for with enthusiasm. Garwood seemed enamored with the idea of putting in as much action and explosions as she possibly could, but there wasn't enough downtime to have character development. Not enjoyable.If you want to read a good JG contemporary, I recommend \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Mercy\\", and \\"Murder List\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor showing for such a talented writer","review":"I have to say I found this book disappointing. The plot was clunky- neither the mystery nor the romance pulled me in at all. The main characters seemed more like caricatures, the mystery wasn't that mysterious, and there were entirely too many subplots cluttering up the landscape whose only purpose seemed to be laying the groundwork for future novels about these two families.I've always been a huge fan of Garwood's historical novels, and hoped her signature depth and humor would shine through this contemporary story. Unfortunately, all of the elements of a classic Garwood were missing from Slow Burn, and I was left with shallowly drawn characters and a sketchy plot- not enough to carry the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The chemistry between the two main characters is great and I loved reading about more Buchanans. I missed Noah in this book but it was still good. The only dissapointment for me was figuring out the suprise villian...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are you Julie Garwood?","review":"Let me begin by saying that this was a very hard book to rate. It is not that it is a bad book, but it doesn't compare on any level to her older historical works. I like all genres of romance, but Julie Garwood's gift was historical. Perhaps the positive reviews belong to people who have never read Garwood's historical novels and therefore don't know how amazing her writing can be. Check this one out from the library, but don't waste your money. Perhaps our protests will come to Ms. Garwood's attention and she will favor us with a great new historical. There is always hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pining for the Garwood of Yore","review":"This book is a stinker. When I compare the artistry, humor, and emotion of Garwood's historicals with this...book...I want to WEEP! Once upon a time, she was my favorite! I re-read her work over and over again. This book, however, has no mystery, no charm, no character development--I could go on, but other reviewers have said it for me. And it's not that I don't like contemporary romantic suspense--they're my favorites!--but Garwood just can't write them. Try a Linda Howard. Try a Catherine Coulter. Try a JD Robb. But leave these new Garwoods on the shelf where they belong. Serious readers should discount all those positive reviews. They could only have been written by Garwood's kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Burn","review":"Julie Garwood was my favorite author for few years now. I was anticipating again a good read.....well,what a dissapointment this book was! I can't believe she just....lost her touch.Not a plot, no humor, not even a nice love story.Nothing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't change what's working so well","review":"I've been an avid JG reader for years...and then she started writing contemporary. WHY?!?! I've tried to read this new series but I every time I start one of these books, I end up skimming through until I'm at the end and then I don't pick them up again.Her historicals, I have read over and over again and never get bored with them but these contemporary...I just can't seem to get into them.It's not like I don't enjoy contemporary. I eat up Iris Johanson, Nora Roberts (JD Robb), Linda Howard..ect...but Julie Garwood just doesn't pull them off very well. I don't care for the characters and the plots seem so lame.Don't stop what's working for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!","review":"This book started promising enough, with what appeared to be a dual plot. One..someone is trying to kill her, and two, someone is trying to steal her business. Well except for the a few meantions in the beginning about her mother supposely signing away her business to pay medical payments, and one brief phone call from a supplier saying someone came in and said the business was now hers, that is the last you heard about it till the very last chapter in the book. Then they meet at the bank, and then its over in two seconds. So much for suspense and intrigue. Found it boring, and dull.....a very hard read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Burn","review":"The story is suspenseful and exciting. I really enjoyed the heros, Kate and Dylan. The villan took me by suprise, sort of! As usual, Julie Garwood wrote a very entertaining book which makes a snowy afternoon fly by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly enticing read","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book and was unable to put it down from start to finish! I loved the plot, the characters are so interesting and the story line was exciting from the very first line. Julie Garwood has quickly become one of my all-time favortie authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed. This is not the old JG I adore.","review":"I didn't connect at all with the main characters. The dialog was very weak and the storyline not much better. Did she change editors or something? Her last few RS books haven't been nearly as good as her old books. Don't waste your money on buying this one. Get it at the library and purchase her older works if you haven't already read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the ending I wanted","review":"I agree with a lot of the negative reviews for this book, and yes, I usually love JG. The romance could have been stronger between the h&h; it did seem at times to be just thrown in to meet the requirement of a romance, still, I was rooting for them. SPOILER ALERT: What I did not like the ending. Granted, it was noble of the character to not want to accept her uncle's fortune considering how he obtained it, but how about replacing the things she lost because of this will (i.e. her car blown up, her business supplies blown up at the warehouse, the loss of her time away from her business, etc.). It was pretty hard for me to swallow, especially since she has to take out a loan for her business. In this economy it seems she would have considered this. Also, while it was thoughtful to donate it all in her mother's name (someone her uncle hated), how about trying to get some of it back to all those people it was taken from? Or at least make an effort. Just my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Garwood fan","review":"This is not her best work, but worth reading. The characters needed to be developed a little more and the story skipped around a little, but still enjoyable. I wish Ms. Garwood would write Noah's story. I keep hopeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Over the years I have read all of Julie Garwood's books. I have always thought she is an exceptional author and could not wait to get my hands on her next amazing story. This novel was highly dissapointing. The character's lacked depth. The storyline seemed to drag. The little bit of romance thrown into the novel could not even be refered to as romance. Overall, this book is not what I expected from Julie Garwood. I would really love to read a new book from her that is up to par with her older novels!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way, way below standards","review":"This book is the last straw for me. I'm an ardent fan of JG's since the Clayborne brides. Heartbreaker and Mercy were quite good and I expected better stuff from then on. Instead, we get the same predictable setting and prototype characters. She seems to want to write a book of all the Buchanan brothers. Very,very disappointing thus far. Murder List was excruciating and when I thought that things couldn't get worse, she comes up with Slow Burn. I'd wish she'd just write Noah Clayborne's book and be done with the whole series. Hopefully, she'd write a great book for Noah Clayborne."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A JOKE!!!!!","review":"I can't believe someone would have the nerve to place a pricetag of $25.95 on this piece of drivel!!! Fortunately, I was able to check it out at the library, or I would be howling. The storyline was ridiculous, the dialog was juvenile, and I got the distinct feeling this author was just trying to fill up pages with meaningless conversation among the characters. The romance wasn't even believable. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is don't waste your money. I won't be reading any more of this author's contemporary romances. I can't imagine the sequels to this book will be any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"I read this book a week ago, and as I sit here to write a review...I realize that I do not remember the names of the main characters or anything especially wonderful or interesting about the plot. No, I'm not suffering from any mental challenges (beyond the usual that a busy professional/mom suffers). <g> This just wasn't a very memorable book. If you're a die-hard fan, borrow the book from the library. If you're new to JG, I would recommend reading some of her earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time reader of Julie Garwood","review":"WOW! I must say this book literally sizzles.

Now there's an author..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Burn is Middle of the Road","review":"\\"Slow Burn\\" is a book that is a middle of the road, okay book. The author tries to double dip into the romance and the mystery genres and hits both marks on the fair side. The main characters, Kate and Dylan, aren't developed well and neither is the plot. Kate finds herself involved in several near-death \\"accidents\\" and Dylan comes to be her protector of sorts. The book is not terrible and a lot of the concepts such as Kate unknowingly being an heir to money that a lot of other people would like to have is good. However, there was a lot of potential for story development that just didn't happen. If you love a good mystery or a good romance novel, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a quick, light book that doesn't require much effort than this would be a good selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow burn","review":"Julie hardwood is one of my favourite authors. I enjoy the way she intertwines characters from one book to another. It is suspenseful and a real page turner. I don't want to put her books Dow especially slow burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Burn","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It has just enough suspense and mystery to keep you intrigued, but not so much as to overwhelm the developing love story between Kate McKenna and Dylan Buchanan. This book, much like many of Ms. Garwood's books on romance, features a woman who knows her own value and worth, but recognize her need to have the insights and protection of a man, especially after she seems to be having some bad luck involving bombs exploding near her. She has unknowingly become the target of an assassin. It is only after two attempts on her life failed that she comes to the conclusion that someone wants her dead. She shares her concerns with her friend Jordan Buchanan, who sends her brother Dylan down to help her figure out what is happening to her and why. It is a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid wrestling game","review":"I personally own this game and can testify to how good it is. WWF attitude has eccellent character selection, and create a player mode....for its time. Unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like Smackdwon 2 with its quick executing of moves, unlike Attitude, and its enormous backstage area, unlike attitude.

My favorites are typically those made by Squaresoft, due to quality in the visual effects and engrossing storyline. Several months ago I was looking for a solid RPG to play and I spotted Xenogears. None of my friends had played it, but it looked interesting. While I was playing it I was blown away by the storyline, it is a classic tale of right and wrong based on biblical references and contains countless plot twists and ethical undertones. Most of the time that I spent away from the game I would be thinking and wondering about what would happen next. Anyone who enjoys anime and RPG's will love this game. However I would not recommend it to someone who has never played an RPG before. It is incredibly intense and contains gameplay aspects that require a decent amount of experience with RPG's to master. Good Luck and Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest RPG of all time!!!!!","review":"Okay, this game is one of those gems to keep forever.

I think that game would be \\"Xenogears.\\" A futuristic RPG epic, with most of the classic RPG features. It has a few twists for battling, an anime to through in there, and some large robots. Besides these features, you have nothing more than another FF. This game was created by the dream team of Square (makers of \\"Chrono Trigger\\" and \\"Chrono Cross\\").

Equipped with a masterfully woven story and a wonderful graphics engine, Xenogears continues in the tradition of Parasite Eve and Chrono Trigger, perhaps even surpassing them. (Perhaps? It did!)

Occasionally even giant mecha versus unarmed fighters, which is ... interesting. Many early RPG's focused entirely on fighting and left the characters with no personality at all. Fei, the main character of XenoGears, compensates by having enough personalities for everyone! Throughout the course of this very lengthy game, Fei's sordid past is revealed piece by piece, explaining the mysterious voices he hears in his mind and his phenomenal ability with the Gears. You _will not_ get bored with the plot. You may need to play the game through twice just to get the story straight, but you definitely will not get bored. The opening and ending animation, and the many animated cut-scenes, are wonderful, and I will be surprised if this game does not spin off its own anime.

Even worse, he gets into a gear, and an explosion kills one of his best friends, Alice. Her brother has a huge grudge over Fei for killing her sister.

Xenogears is one of the best RPGs I have ever played. I'll start witht the story. The story is what makes this game unforgetable. The deep religous issues made the story so interesting. This is also the most serious story I have ever heared in a game. There are very little humor in the game, but there is a bit in there. The graphics are not the best. The characters are ugly sprites, but the background and gear graphics are great. The gameplay is great. The battle system is creative, with different types of normal attacks, and being able to fight with or without your gears. The combo system makes the battles more fun than Final Fanatsy's battles. The anime cutscenes are amazing. While the dubbing is a little messed up, the story will make up for it. All in all, this is a game that all true gamers should add to there PSX library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Storyline with an Anime look","review":"With the popularity of Anime on the rise, this title will do nothing but help. Xenogears is an amazing RPG. Its dual battle system (with or without Gears) is great. The point system used to gain powerful attacks is very interesting too, if a little complicated.The game covers a large world with a lot of characters. The storyline is great. It's one of the best that I've seen, comparable to Final Fantasy VII and much better than VIII.The only complaint I have is with the save and repair systems. Saving only occurs on the world map or at save points (like most Squaresoft RPG's) that are spread much too far apart. Repairing Gears can only occur in gear shops (same with refueling). Combining this with the save system can make the game very difficult, especially the very end.Other than that, this game is great. I highly recommend it to any RPG fan. It's has a new twist to the RPG theme and has a great story driving it throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xenogears Is a Masterpiece","review":"This is by far thje best game I ever played.

The charactrs were completely generic and forgettable. The story (if it's worthy of that title) was horribly concieved and executed poorly. I found myself wanting the characters to all be killed.

I also have found these to be better than the low-profile versions of the RainX or Bosch offerings.When it comes to wiper blades, I view them as a safety item and don't mind paying a premium as long as they have good performance.These Bosch wiper blades have offered me excellent performance in heavy rain, and icing conditions such as sleet and freezing rain. I also find them up to the job for both light and heavy snow. Durability is excellent and I can go 6 months or longer without changing these out.

While Beecham's Beethoven may not be as acclaimed as his masterful readings of the late Mozart and Haydn Symphonies, they are still thoroughly enjoyable, first rate performances. Throw in a second disc of the Mass in C and The Ruins of Athens Incidental Music (neither of which I previously owned) and you've got a set that's essential for Beecham fans.

Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

That was the case then, and now. With this strategy guide for Donkey Kong Country, it really doesn't seem to bring out a whole lo with not enough visual help within each course, and a failing grade for access to all the bonus levels and features. Arguably, even though it was issued in 1995, when Donkey Kong Country was only on the Super Nintendo, there just isn't enough here to take on the masters. If you have a the original authorized guide only from Nintendo, whether it is from then, or the recent one for the Game Boy Advance, stick with it.

This is a very uneven, strange, paradoxical album full of things that will grate on your nerves, but also full of nice surprises.Highlights: Check out \\"The Other Side of Summer\\", evil twin to a Beach Boys song. This one captured the imagination of my teenage daughter with both its catchy tune and its wry lyrics (don't miss the friendly jabs at John Lennon and Pink Floyd!). \\"Georgie and Her Rival\\" is bouncy and strangely haunting; it sticks in your mind and pops up at odd times. \\"Playboy to a Man\\" is raucous good fun, and if the lead vocal sounds strange, that's because it's Paul McCartney, uncredited and in full shouting mode. \\"How to Be Dumb\\" is a not-so-subtle dig at former Attractions bassist Bruce Thomas.

Cassidy Black is our heroine and she is currently on parole. She ends up being lured back into business by an old accomplice who swears it's an easy target. Cassie ends up back in Vegas where her last job went bad; it ended up with her lover being thrown out a window on the top floor of the Cleopatra hotel. The new job takes her back to that scene.

Spacey doesn't usually play such a brutally physical type, but he could really bring up the hidden depths and nuance. * Quibbles - I wished Cassie had made a couple less mistakes.

From the beginning you know who the little girl is and how she will come into play plot wise. I expected better. This is the last hardback I will buy from M. Connelly.

The main character was very dull and I really didn't care what happened to her. There was no suspense, action, or mystery in this book.

He should stick to cops and murders."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and amazing","review":"this book is absolutely amazing. at the beginning i found cassie distasteful. i was missing harry bosch. i almost quit the book half-way through. but at the beginning, we only know cassie from the outside. as the book goes on, the point of view changes, incrementally, to cassie's til she becomes a true hero. i cried for 10 minutes at the ending (not too common for me). not because it's sad (it isn't), but because it was so loving and beautiful.reminds me of the ending of season 2 of nbc \\"life.\\" or, comparing it to other novels, it has the poignant power of \\"the help\\" or \\"elegance of the hedgehog\\" or \\"extremely loud and incredibly close.\\" and that's really really unusual in a thriller.it's possible one may need to be a parent to really love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonstruck","review":"Michael Connelly is a gifted author, and I enjoy his Harry Borsch novels.

I found Cassie to be a one-note character, who wasn't particularly likeable. I had hoped that her pursuer would be more than a standard bad guy, in fact, I would rather have seen an offbeat romance betweeen them and team them against the casino head. No such luck. And sadly, the final reveal of who did what to who, doesn't make sense. Sorry, I take a pass on this one. I just hope they don't try to make it into a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A very average book from a great author. This was the only Connelly book I have ever been disappointed with. A simple story which moves forward chronologically with the mandatory plot twist at the end.

Try any one of the other Connelly books and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one from Connelly","review":"A fun, easy read.

I have been a big fan since his first novel. This thriller does not disappoint, and I wasn't surprised it was optioned by a studio. The protagonist is what we would label a less-than-reformed criminal who's less sorry than just plain sorry she got caught. Yet we grow to care about her and appreciate her pain.

I'm a fan of Michael Connolly and enjoy the Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller books, so was very impressed by the action and character development that pulled me in immediately to this unrelated story.

A very satisfying book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connelly rocks!","review":"I was a little put off when I realized that Connelly's latest didn't feature the conflicted Harry Bosch. But my misgivings faded fast. Void Moon is VERY good. It's a page-turner of a thriller, and one that swirls around several mysteries--better even than that, though, is that Connelly's characters are marvelously drawn. Connelly just gets better with each new book. And this one's great. I'd rate it 5 stars but, hey, it ain't Moby Dick."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars Good read","review":"Just finished reading this book and I really liked it. Ex con takes an inside job and get more than she bargined for. Las Vegas and lots of trouble.

For me, Michael Connelly is someone I can grab off a shelf and be sure I'll enjoy it. Not this one, though. After 120 pages of very detailed writing of a woman getting back into her criminal ways - how to set up the scam she will commit - I gave up on this one.

I'm going to buy some of those little rubber earring stoppers and give them a trial run that way, but sadly, I wouldn't recommend them based on this design flaw.

The zippers are totally flimsy and cheap on the flexi brand compared to Outward Hound.2. The nylon used for the bag is really thin, cheap and does not hold it shape and form as well as the very thick and durable Outward Hound brand.3.

The product worked great initially. The bag is a tad bit too big for the flexi small dog leash, but it still made my life much easier because I could organize my dog food in one pouch and the doggie doo-doo bags in the other. I could tell right away the bag materials and stitching were of low quality. The stitching has already come undone on one of the pouches, so now everything has to go in the other pouch. It is only a matter of time before the stitching rips on the other pouch and renders the bag useless.I am tempted to buy another one, because of the low price on amazon and I know that it will fit my flexi leash that I love... but am I going to have to replace this every 2 months?

Not true. I recently replaced my regular-sized Flexi leash because it was damaged by sand. It was made for smaller breeds, but worked just fine with my 80-lb. black lab. I decided to go with the Flexi leash made for his size breed because it was well-priced. Unfortunately, the accessory bag's elastic bands that secure the bag to the leash hardware do not expand enough to fit my leash. While I can get it to stay put, the elastic is fully stretched and inconveniently spans the opening for the leash. Consequently, the in-and-out motion of the leash tape is chafing the elastic holding the bag in place, which means it will not last very long. Do not buy this item for the larger leashes. It should be just fine for the smaller leashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"I keep everything in these little pouches! It is a great invention.

If he is lying down while playing with it and he drops it, it falls on his face. Ouch! He only tried that once. I'm disappointed because I thought he would like the shape and be able to reach his back gums with it. Also, it CANNOT be immersed in water to clean. You'll get water inside if you do. Think: Mold.

If you want to learn more about the terrorists who perpetrated the attacks on 9/11, and about the draconian Taliban regime, and the role of other countries in the war on terror, this is one book you want to read. Bergen has done excellent research:This book is an example of brilliant journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best","review":"Written before 9/11 and quickly updated for mass marketing, Bergen has done a remarkably good job that still stands up to scrutiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"I found it kind of a consumer mass product. If it pretends to be a one-book-on-the subject, it is not, I found it somewhat superficial, kind of a snapshot. It does not elaborate deeply and thoroughly enough. I would have dedicated more pages to the context, the people and recent history of Middle East. Other books on the same topic I would rather read instead are \\"Bin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America\\" by Yossef Bodansky, \\"Taliban\\" by Ahmed Rashid, \\"Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy\\" by Paul R. Pillar and Michael H. Armacost among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Alot of information put out","review":"This book had alot of information about the al-queda and taliban terrorist networks. answeered alot of my questions. and for once tell you the truth on osama bin laden. Is amazing that he use our own weapons against. well most coutry does that anyway. Whoever wants to know mor about our new war on terrorism, this is a must read then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This is the best book on this subject I have seen. Peter Bergen shows us the inside of the terrorist network and explains the tough questions in simplistic terms that even Americans can understand, such as what motivates Osama Bin Laden. While its journalistic style reads like a novel, he remains objective and does not take sides on the issue. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Media Perspective","review":"The events of 11 September has led to a sudden resurgence in books and articles on Islam and the core of world terrorism. HOLY WAR, INC. is good basic background. Unfortunately, it is somewhat typical of the CNN worldview. Broad brushstrokes but never completing the point. An example is the core debate over Islam itself. While Mr. Bergen does us the service of pointing out Professor Huntington's CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS he weakens the point by attempting to point to a few somewhat moderate Islamic spokespersons. This is the problem of journalists attempting to write analytical works. They lack the basic issue of providing an analytical point and then defending it. Instead we get a bit of this and a bit of that. One should read this book but only after other, more vital, works such as BIN LADEN: The Man Who Declared War on America by Yossef Bodansky."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opening Book!!","review":"An excellent book. It was very well written and researched. It gives a good history of Bin Laden and the Al- Queida terroist network. It informs the readers for the motives and beliefs behind Bin Ladens jihad against the U.S. This book is also about the inside politices of the Sovoiet-Afgahn War, Dessert Storm, and the U.S. millitary presents in Somali and Beruit. This is a great book on current American history. I would recomend it to anyone interested in current events or American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"UBL has declared war on YOU","review":"The Washington Post is right - if you're only going to read one book on AQ, this is it. It will impart a better understanding of who these villains are, what their organization does, and the perversion they extol to justify their terror. Not nearly enough Americans appreciate the death sentence UBL wishes to inflict upon them - no matter who or where they are - perhaps after reading this book they will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended book for anyone serious about OO design","review":"This is one of the best object oriented design books I have read. Traditional object oriented analysis and design books mainly focus on methodologies which can become very academic and perhaps boring to read. This book is different, it focus on design heuristics and gives practical tips on how to apply them. Most of the design heuristics in the book are well explained and the author did a good job in explaining the reasons behind these heuristics. There are codes given in the book to illustrate some of the concepts but I would like to see more of these codes in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every OO development team should have this book!","review":"OO design and analysis is so very gray. No book can cover every aspect because the possibilities are endless. Everyone's application and environment is different which causes each and every one of us to approach our design differently and value different affects of our coding practices. By far this is the best book I have read that simply lays out OO rules-of-thumb and then explains why each is beneficial and when they might contradict other rules-of-thumb. The book encourages the reader to be reasonable and practical in your application of OO best practices.I strongly recommend that every development team read this book and discuss it amongst themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a really good book...","review":"Wow. I wasn't expecting such an easy yet informative read. About 50 pages through this book, I wanted to hunt down the author's e-mail address and send him a personal thank-you letter. If you're experienced with language-specifics, and ready to get a grasp on the better ways to implement your designs so that they are more maintainable and logical, then grab this text. Riel explains things in a clear way, but the best thing about this book is that it follows the thought patterns of a typical reader. It's not pretentiously high-minded and verbose. Riel explains problems in common language, offers the common solutions, and then tells you in many ways how they can be improved. He covers \\"god-classes\\", encapsulation vs. inheritence, message passing, and much more.Overall, this book is a very mind-opening experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Price","review":"The Toshiba W622 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR is one of the better VCRs on the market. It plays back tapes with a very good image and has one of the best pictures around. This unit has a 4-head 19-micron video system in Hi-Fi for very good stereo sound. That's an excellent feature that gives you great versatility. It also has commercial skip. Pre-recorded tapes play back with an excellent picture too. How good a picture looks is what it is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment.","review":"This VCR is very complicated to program to record. It will not record triple digit channels, which was why I bought it. I guess if you only watch videos and don't record it will do okay but if you want to record things forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"there's nothing like resistance . . .","review":"This book stars one of those romantic damsels every teenage girl seems to want to be. You know the deal; beautiful, intelligent, wildly talented, has famous rockstars fall in love with her... The hero is the typical byronic romantic figure; handsome, troubled, hollow cheekbones and of course also stunningly talented. The reader is angled into gunning for him because of the romantic posturing and all the hints dropped that the two of them 'belong together'. The angle of obsessive love and male as stalker is presented to make the whole thing more attractive. There's nothing like resistance for stirring the pulses, so it seems...I find it really depressing. But from reading other reviews, no one else seems to think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will put children to sleep and adults to passion","review":"This album of nightsongs is a melodic, relaxing mixture of lullabies.

There is something about Rebecca Dru's voice singing Italian -- you'll just have to see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best R/C sim yet!","review":"This game is great for all ages. Re-volt lets you drive in shopping malls and other great places that you can't normally drive your radio controlled car. You should consider buying this game - as it is GREAT fun!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Compared to PC Version","review":"I love the PC version of Re-Volt, unfortunitely the Playstation version does not do it justice. Game play is very similair, but the graphics are much poorer and the games takes much longer to load. If you have a PC with a 3dfx card, get the pc version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as cool as you would think...","review":"ReVolt sounds fun...but the graphics are horrible. Gameplay is below average-hard to see where the track is going and difficult to control your car. Major disappointment for a game that has had so much build-up"},{"rating":"2","title":"A meditation and affirmation","review":"Mark Salzman's novel is short and sweet, full of brief, beautiful metaphors - a vivid depiction of the contemplative life, and a look at the human doubt that inevitably accompanies the vocation.In this story, a contemplative nun, Sister John, is diagnosed with epilepsy, which leads her into uncertainty about her own spirituality.As with Alan Lightman's \\"Einstein's Dreams\\", each chapter is its own meditation, with a basis in the observation of nature -- the struggle against pride and doubt, the struggle towards purpose and enlightenment.The setting may seem esoteric, but Salzman's attention to detail and depth of character bring it to life, and make the reader one with Sister John's struggles. Ultimately, we all share those struggles, feel that doubt, and question our purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why we read books","review":"A wonderful thoughtful book -- I read it and felt like I was discovering a small treasure. The other reviewers have said what I wanted to say but more eloquently, and I think the range of reviewers speaks to how universally appealing and enjoyable this book is. The writing is beautiful, and rings true and deep. I'm not religious and somehow this story of faith and grace is personal to me. This book kept me up for two late nights, and thinking for weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I like Mark Salzman's writing and I was looking forward to reading LYING AWAKE. Having just read it, I feel disappointed. The story and characters never caught hold of my imagination. Salzman presents a nun impassioned with religious feeling who writes of it in poetry. However, when diagnosed and treated for temporal lobe epilepsy, her intense feelings dissipate. Salzman presents us with the paradox of attributing spirituality to a physical disorder. It is a wonderful idea but his book speeds along without developing the characters, place, and issues with the complexity they deserve. A much better book about an impassioned life in a convent and the issues it creates is Ron Hansen's MARIETTE IN ECSTASY. And a provocative look at the relationship of epilepsy to visions and writing is Lauren Slater's book LYING."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Became Uncomfortable","review":"I was really enjoying Lying Awake - the real world of cloistered life, the conflict of the solemn vows and the interluding poetry - until I reached page 139, about three fourths the way through the novel. Here we are told that the Miserere was an ancient poem written in honor of the Blessed Virgin. Lots of us (Catholic or not) know that Miserere, \\"have mercy on me\\", comes from the 51st Psalm (Vulgate Psalm 50) and has been the foundation of many noteworthy music arrangements throughout history. Fiction or not, I became uncomfortable in not knowing Salzman's further diligence and research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Mark Salzman is a terrific writer.

It works fine an everything. The problem I see is the strict requirements. It works with Mac OS 10.4, but now they launched OS X Leopard, so I can't upgrade.The same happens with windows. I was thinking of buying a new laptop, but now they all come with Vista, and the Mbox is compatible only with XP.If you want some advice, save a little bit more and buy a MOTU Ultralite.It doesn't have that much requirements and Sonar works as good as Protools."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst device I have ever bought","review":"I tried connecting it to 4 different computers (3 Win XP, one Mac, 2 desktops, 2 laptops) and each one had a different problem that made it completely useless. I still have not managed to record a single good track, and I was close to ruining one computer in the process. I spent more time on it than anything else combined and I have nothing to show for it except one ugly paperweight. No support, very poor website, no new drivers, nothing to help users after sale.

In License Renewed, John Gardner has created an original novel that combines all the essential James Bond elements, including an abundance of action and adventure, into one exciting story. The actual plot of the novel has enough exciting twists to keep the reader interested, while the characters are very well crafted in order to convey a sense of realism. The villains in particular are effective in involving the reader in the story. Also, the fact that the character of James Bond is portrayed so effectively adds tremendous support to the action packed storyline. With License Renewed, John Gardner has succeeded in translating one of film's greatest franchises into an equally exciting novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry!","review":"The Fleming estate milking Bond for all he's worth.

That is not the way this game works at all! You can only build up to 6 rollercoasters in each park, and each of the parks terrains are pre-designed! You have to build the rides in designated ride areas! Plus you've got this thing called a \\"Thrill Meter\\" that limits the size of the rides and amount of them that you can build.

I also would like to state that near the time this came out Capcom also released Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. The graphics in Dino Crisis aren't near as good as RE3. Why! Not to mention the low ammo and gun choice in the game. A Handgun, a shotgun, and gernade launcher. That's IT!

With a horde of different foes from cute compys to T-rex it's one game I won't play in the dark"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this game.","review":"The graphics are well done. The game play is pretty easy. The mix of shoot em' up and thinking man puzzle play is great. It took me awhile to get through the first 1/2 hour without getting my butt whooped, but once I got the hang of everything it became very enjoyable.They weren't joking about the realistic violence and gore. Watch out if you're at all squeamish. It also has a couple of different endings depending on how you play the game, so it has a lasting appeal to it.I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The first time I heard of this game I thought it would be just another RE game but I was wrong. This game is much more realistic with enemys twice the size of the RE series and twice as realistic with puzzles that make you think (unlike any of the Resident Evils)so get the facts this game is more realistic doesn't include completely wasted zombies and has one big T-REX. So in my opinion this game should be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a fun game...","review":"For all of you that like survival horror games, this is your best bet.

So i wanted to replay it and i was very frustrated. I never finished the game back then and it was a big pain finishing it this time around. a lot of backtracking and poor inventory setup. I still think its one of the few titles for the playstation that you should give a try. I ordered it used and it came on time and i had no problem with the CD during gameplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dino Crisis Review","review":"If you like to shoot dinos this is Not your game. It looks like a good game, but I like action games and this game is just full of puzzles. You only fight 1-2 dinos about every 15-50 minutes. If you want a game that has Dino shooting action then get Dino Crisis 2. In Dino Crisis 2 it is none stop action, you kill about 12 Dinos every minute, and their are two times more dinos in Dino crisis 2 then in Dino Crisis, And their are about three times more Weapons too(And the wepons are so cool, like when you have one machine gun in each hand at the same time you are able to shoot two different Dinos at the same time). So if you like hard core shooting games(rock on) then get Dino crisis 2, but if you like puzzles(ZZZZZZZZZZZ) then get Dino Crisis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dino Crisis is resident evil but greater and much better","review":"it's great.

I would rather watch the show named after me (Barney). It is so violent that you think that you are really in the game yourself. That is a bad thing by the way because you see blood and body parts torn off of the people's bodies. If you hate violence, I suggest you not to get this terrible game. If you crave for violence, have your cravings met by this awlful game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premium Bag for a Steal Price","review":"If you are a beginner hiker/camper looking for a bag around $50, THIS is the bag for you.

The pack handled great on a four day 22 mile trip. There was plenty of room for all the items needed and additional items could be hung on the outside (such as a sleep mat, which is a must for the back). The shoulder and waist starp could be easily adjusted. If your a small size this pack is deffinetly not for you. I'm 32 and i had to nearly adjuted all the way. The rain tarp which is included came in very handy when heavy rain hit us. The only negative thing about this pack is if more pockets where available. I do recommend this for anyone in the medium size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Create for a weekend trip","review":"Used this bag twice to go camping/hiking. Had all the right pockets to fit all of my gear. The straps were comfortable and there was just enough space for all of my \\"just in case\\" items for this weekend trip. Looking back though, it was a tight fit, and maybe the next bigger size would be worth the money.The only things I did not like about this bag were that there were loose straps everywhere once you got everything strapped in. It looked kind of messy, but it didn't bother me that much since hey, we're going camping, big deal. But I did look at the picture and my bag for awhile trying to figure out how they got it so neat, and mine looked so messy...? Another gripe I had was that the right shoulder strap kept coming loose after about 3 hours of hiking with a full pack. It was pretty annoying and I ended up having to tie a knot so it would not come loose again.All in all, a good bang for your buck compared to comparable, more expensive bags out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential!","review":"I love South Park and I really hoped that this game would do the show justice, but I found that I was very disappointed with the graphics and the sound.

Foggy vision, humourless weaponry and a terrible idea for a plot!The characters for the game are even worse! listening to Stan shouting rubbish such as \\"You mother ......!

This game has no meaning. All you do is play as Kenny, Kyle and the gang and throw snowballs at giant turkey's. Basically all you do is just shoot at flat characters from the show.

However, it is SO repetitive and annoying...the turkey level alone goes on FOREVER. Friends of mine have had the same reaction. It's a first-person shooter (or should we say first-person snowballer) that just has you running around the town of South Park throwing snowballs at turkeys. Yeah, I know, according to the packaging, that the game evolves into some sort of space/zombie creature thing, and you're supposed to save the town, but I never got that far due to the overlong turkey-shooting level...when I saw the average 4-star rating, I knew I had to respond. Perhaps younger people will like this due to the character tie-in, but this 34-year-old was bored and disappointed in this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"what, i have to give this \\"game\\" one star?!","review":"People, i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game.This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window.The games has most of the characters(whoopie...)which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring.I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay.If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is.Avoid this nerf dung at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Improvement","review":"I love south park and was expecting more from the game when I heard about it. In story mode you can be any of the four 8-year-olds. All the unlockable characters can only be used in battle mode and that was one of the biggest dissapointments to me. Another was the characters always say the same thing, I think they should say something new each level or episode.And the last was that they only killed kenny in one episode on the game (the one with the robot turkey). They should've killed him more!!!! I bet that dissapointed alota kenny fans.I really wish they would've added more kenny deaths but oh well. I heard on a web-site that the creaters of SP are thinking about making a new video game but still don't know what company and game-system to have it on.

In one, for example, they take the excellent work previously done changing one 'adversarial' group into a three dimensional, believable group, and in this they revert to a one-dimensional 'We're sooooo evil' group.Another disappointing thing about this book is that they hyped the so-called '10th Sphere' - going as far as to include mention not only on the cover, but in the introduction - then it turns out that there IS no revelation about it. Rather, the '10th Sphere' is danced around as plot points.If you're a Mage or World of Darkness completist, get this book.

It list only one hotel (La Cabana Resort) which is across the street from the beach and although a nice find for families - definately NOT a secret hideaway type hotel. I could have wrote this book in my first year in the travel business with my eyes closed. Did anyone even go see these resorts? It sure does not sound like it.

But, I have to say, my favorite section was the \\"most embarrasing moments\\" one. POOR JUSTIN, he tells about breaking his thumb during a performance.

Unfortunately, the graphics are no better than any other game. It is simple and fast paced (normally my kind of game) but it is a real design flaw that when you pass the ball to your teammate, you don't control the teammate (other than to shoot or pass). A more complicated game like NBA Live can even manage that simple feat. The dunks are great fun and I would imagine the game play with four people would be loads of fun (if I had friends I would be able to say so but, alas, such is not the case).

The wood body for the wagon appeared to be made of medium grade wood and would not hold up well if the wagon was left outside in the elements. The \\"rubber\\" tires had a pungent odor so I had to keep them out in the garage while I waited for the seller to arrange for the wagon to be picked up under warrantee and my money refunded.

The size is good and both kids and a bunch of dolls, stuffed animals, etc. fit in easily. What I didn't like, was the size of the handle. It is tight for my hand and I don't have especially big hands. What I noticed after using the wagon with the kids many times was the lower sides of the wagon (not the red removable sides) bowing and separating from the base as the kids moved around and leaned on the sides. I added several screws to it in the bottom and sides to strengthen it. It has rubber air tires but the wheels are plasic so I worry about overloading it and having a wheel break, especially as it gets older."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great tool","review":"Bought this to wheel stuff to the beach. It is well designed, easy to assemble and a real workhorse. A simple, thoughtful design that performs well. Its large capacity, low center of gravity and inflatable tires make this wagon surprisingly maneuverable. Everyone likes to use it and wants to help. Take the side rails off and use it to move bulky items like mulch bags and potted plants. See a lot of them around, hopefully it will be durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great #29 Wagon","review":"I can't say enough good things about this wagon, but I also wanted comment on finding the correct wagon pad that will fit it. The pad sold through this site does not fit. You need to find the pad made specifically for Radio Flyer model #29, which I easily located through other online merchants.

The wood materials and craftsmanship are cheap and skimped on quality. The parts of the wagon that were preassembled fell apart out of the box. The metal parts seem solid, but they cut corners on the wagon's wagon bed. Lastly the tires smell absolutely toxic. We can't keep the wagon in the house or even the garage due to the smell. Not sure what they are using in the rubber, but I am thinking twice of exposing my kid to this level of smell. The positive Aspect to the wagon is that it is light and easily lifted to put in the trick for the beach, but I would not buy this piece again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOW MADE IN CHINA","review":"This product is now MADE IN CHINA, I was extremley dissapointed to find this out. When I purchased this product it stated made in USA, from the time I purchased it until it arrived the ad has changed. Toy R us still advertises made in USA.

When we went to the punpkin patch this past October we did not have a wagon and could not find one to use. I looked at all of the wagons that families had brought and made a mental note. Then I told my daughter since we had three adults moving large pumpkins every thousand yards or so by hand that next year we would bring our own wagon. She was thrilled! I went on line and checked out several wagons that Amazon sells and picked this one becuase: 1) It has slats that can be removed. 2) Once removed it can be used as a buckboard for removing garden waste and transporting it to the trash can. 3) It is big enough for two small children sitting up or one lying down. 4) It is the longest one that was available. 5) It folds up into a smaller bundle and can fit in the back of a Van, SUV, or in some larger trunks on cars. It is light enough that a small child can pull it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wagon","review":"Very pleased with the wagon. My grandson loves it so much he wants to sleep in it. Worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARD TO PULL","review":"I wanted to like this wagon, after all it looked like so much fun!! However the reality is that its hard to pull, expensive and uncomfortable for your children. My son did not like having his legs out like he was lying down. He wanted to sit up and look out. My son is long and with him sitting in it, I had no room for anything else. the bed is hard and if you hit a bump, well you can see where I am going with it. I like that it holds alot of weight, however, my back after pulling my 35lb son one day was in such pain that it was not worth it at all. he refuses to go it and I can't blame him. I think when he gets older he will like it for hauling stuff in, but I am selling it before then and getting a step 2wagon. he seemed to like that one much better. Overall I would say no to this product as a wagon to haul your kids in."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"We are not so happy with the quality of this wagon.

It's very nice quality and my 1 year old daughter loves getting pulled around in it. I agree with the other comments about the smell... it's definitely putting off some toxic fumes, but that's to be expected and it will eventually wear off.

While building the product I was shocked how poorly the materials were. I had been told that the wagons are no longer American made. Where ever they are now contructed I wish they would no longer use the Radio Flyer logo and image because it truely has diminished from years ago. The side gates are so poorly constructed that I fear that any child over 50 pounds who leaned against the sides would go right thru them. The screws are so flimsy that they chip when installing leaving sharp edges on them in the wagons bed where the children sit. And I can go on and on........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good wagon","review":"We bought this wagon for our son's second birthday gift -- what a mistake!

This is a very poor quality wagon, not to mention dangerous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wagon for Growing Families","review":"We bought this wagon when we found out that we were expecting our third child. Since our oldest had just turned 2 when we found out about baby 3, we figured that we needed a way that we could safely transport three small children to and from the park, around the zoo, etc.This wagon has been great. We've brought it to the zoo lots of times, and it fits right into the back of the minivan once you remove the siderails. The kids absolutely love to ride in it, and are looking forward to getting the cooler and the wagon trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimy and suffocatingly toxic-smelling tires","review":"If never exposed to the elements, this wagon may do fine. The walls work well and remove easily. But the wooden base won't take more than a few rains. The handle is too short (for me anyway - I'm 6'2\\"). The whole steering mechanism is very flimsy and will not support pulling any load up over a curb.Worst of all, the tires have by far the most unbelievably strong toxic smell. In order to transport the wagon in our van, I had to wrap the tires in plastic bags and keep the windows cracked to avoid suffocating the children. This is after leaving the wagon outside to air for almost a week. I don't know what chemicals are in this wagon's tires - but I'm sure it's not something you want children around. I really wanted to love this wagon - but am going to have to return it. I've nominated this product on [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality is not what i expected","review":"The historical quality aspect of this brand are seriously in question considering the poor workmanship and bare minimum materials used in the wagon I purchased. I replaced the side rails because of the flimsy and un-matched design plus re-finished the wood base although i suspect that will need to be replaced soon because of the wood the used is a soft wood prone to damage or decay. I'm not opposed to paying more if the quality is there but regretfully it is not with this item and the price is not justified.

Amazons return program is awesome! I did everything online, they printed me a label to put on the original box to send back, and in the mean time they overnight-ed a replacement!! The replacement was much better! The box was in much better shape than the first, and all the parts were there and undamaged and the floorbed was properly put together.I do feel that they could have made the box a little bigger to allow more packing cushion so that the railings will not break during shipping since these are made of wood. It was difficult to get the original one back into the box to send back, but I managed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good wagon","review":"I just wanted to warn people who buy this wagon that you need to let it air out if you are going to bring it into your house as a gift. My husband put it together and brought it into the house and even after putting it out on the deck more than 24 hours ago, the smell persisits. It's a very noxious odor.On the other hand, when I wheeled it through my very old house with tight corners, it turned beautifully. It's sturdy and I'm sure will be lots of fun. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so haven't given it yet. But we still have a very similar radio flyer wagon from when my kids were little that is still great.Only thing I'm bummed about it that right now, price is way lower than when I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice wagon, but tires reek","review":"This is a nice wagon. Bought it for our granddaughters. @ 3 months of light usage-- So far, so good. I would feel better if the wheels were secured by pins or nuts, rather than the 'pound-on axle caps'. A major annoyance is the odor that is emitted by the tires. It's really obnoxious and strong. I was nearly overwhelmed by the odor, while doing the assembly in my basement. The wagon is now housed in a garden shed because the odor is still so strong, too strong for even the garage. It is obvious that this wagon should not be left out in the elements; I'm pretty certain that the wood would de-laminate and warp, if it gets wet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice wagon","review":"The wagon arrived in a very timely manner and not too difficult to put together. One of the rails was damaged but the Radio Flyer folks were more than happy to send another one. The wagon is for an adult or VERY strong kid to pull. It is way too heavy for my 3 y.o. to pull by herself. My biggest complaint is the SMELL!! The tires STINK!! We don't have a garage and at the time it was too rainy to keep on the porch and it completely stunk up my basement. The wagon needs a long time to air out. Overall we like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the cost","review":"I bought this for my daughter and grandson.

Right now, I am the proud new owner of a great little DVD player that, while lacking a carousel for multiple discs, has most of the features DVD users want and need for a LOT less than $100! Stereo, scene jumping, compatibility all across the disc spectrum, (it can play MP3s and ordinary CDs too!) I defy any other manufacturer to come up with a model that offers so much for so little.NOWHERE are any shortcuts visible, except in the fact that it's not a changer. The construction is decent, the performance is faultless and you'd expect to find the DVD specific features on something costing at LEAST fifty to a hundred bucks more!I'll get back to you on the long term, but for now...NICE GOING, TOSHIBA!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe its just me","review":"When I first bought the dvd machine for my son as a X-mas Present, it did not work the day we bought it. His new Janet Jackson DVD got stuck in the machine, so we had to take it back and ask them to please send us back the Janet DVD (which they never did by the way, so I ended up buying another dvd). Once they sent me another machine, at frist it worked well. Although at times it would freeze, and jump. Then about 4 monnths later, it froze, but it could not be shut off. My son removed the plug and now it will not shut back on, so his Poetic Justice dvd (staring Janet Jackson \\"He's her biggest fan!) is stuck inside the machine.

The PLUGE black-level setting is a VERY NICE feature: takes a DVD that would look washed-out on another player and makes it vibrant and brilliant.

I tried several different discs and all had the same error, I even verified the discs were fine by playing them on my PC. I then checked out the net and found that the \\"Disc Error\\" is a very prevalent problem with this player and that I actually did pretty good getting 18 months out of it, as most seem to die at 12! It is not acceptable for a DVD player to breakdown after a year and a half of playing about half a dozen DVDs a month in it. I will not buy Toshiba again.

My SD2800 player went in for \\"Disc Error\\" problem (Nov. 2003). No disc would play. Toshiba fixed it and did a firmware upgrade and charged me for the repair. The head technician then told me \\"I would be happy to know\\" that the player did not need any upgrade for any reason. He assured me that the upgrade had nothing to do with the problem, yet, he could not tell me what the upgrade was for or why it was done. I asked if it was possible that the upgrade addressed a faulty program causing the disc problem. He said it WAS possible but no it did WASN'T the cause of the problem. What caused the problem?

Or is it more important to get a machine that lasts? My machine lasted for just over a year (14 months). Now it freezes and jumps an hour into almost every movie. Luckily, I bought a \\"3-year extended warranty contract\\" from a third party (GE), so getting a repair or replacement costs me nothing. Today the repair technician called to say that the video relay board has gone bad and the part is not available from Toshiba. He also said that this was a common problem with the machine.

It's been easy to setup and use. The only \\"disc error\\" issues have arisen from burned discs that might have been overly compressed, or with a codec that is too new for it. However, among the virtues I've found with this device, is the wonderful quality of audio I get using the optical out with my component stereo system. The only knock against it: right near the beginning of playing almost any DVD, like a record, it skips one second of audio and then continues with no problem the rest of the way. I never understood this, but have lived easily with it.Overall, this DVD player has served me well, and I would recommend it to most folks. Of course, with many things headed toward HD, this unit is pretty well obsolete. However, if you are currently happy not needing to see every pore on a person, instead opting for an engaging story, this unit is simple and perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality for a good price!","review":"I have owned the SD-1600, SD-2700, SD-2710 and when I was looking for another one, the SD-2800 was first on my list. The ColorStream component output makes your component capable TV look amazing. I would suggest calibrating your TV using the Enhanced Black level setting that this unit (and all of the above) offer. I tried Samsung, Sony, Phillips and I selected and will continue to select Toshiba. The features and picture quality outstripped units that cost far more! It is a true value for the money. The only real difference in this model compared to the previous ones is the controls built into the front panel that allow you to do everything without the remote if you need to.

I estimate that we used it to play about 3 or 4 DVDs during this time. Anyway, last week, we began getting intermitment video pictures that were violet and green tinted rather than full color. This happened using a variety of DVDs. Then, the picture would \\"freeze\\" and not respond to any remote or direct commands other than cutting the power.

We can only add this warning to the other bad reviews and caution buyers to buy alternative manufacturers of DVD players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless warranty","review":"While it worked the SD2800 was fine, but after less than a year it broke down. Images freeze and no sound. Of course, Toshiba does not warrant labor after the first 90 days or so, and the labor to fix it plus the cost of shipping the thing back and forth adds up to more than what you would spend on a new one.

If the DVD is brand new or in pristine condition, no problems, otherwise no chance. Something in the player mechanism to deal with disc errors must wear out or break.

We've never had any trouble with it. The remote isn't as intuitive as it could be, but the player has been 100% compatible with nearly 10 multi-function remotes we've had over the years. The only tiny issue I have, and this is really because if its age, not a design flaw, is that it won't play DVD+R or DVD+RW recordable DVD's. Not many players did play them when we got this thing, so it's not really a negative. It's just a little outdated when you can get one today for under $50 that will play recordable DVD's, MP3, and JPG. Overall, it gets 4 1/2 stars. If it was just a little more compact, it would get 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Bang For The Buck!","review":"When you compare the features of the SD2800 to any other DVD player in this price range, you just can't beat it.

This season also marks the formation of Titans East, which helps expand the scope of the series a little more.The bad is that the ongoing Brother Blood storyline (which really only amounts to 4 episodes) kinda falls flat, especially compared to the strong Slade/Terra arcs before it. The two Starfire-centric episodes are also duds.Really, the biggest strike against season 3 is that by now, it's just offering more of the same. You can predict what happens with a Raven episode, or a Cyborg episode. With all of Teen Titans' wackiness, the series recycles its own formulas. But if you can accept that, season 3 is worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season of a Great Show","review":"This Season of Teen Titans was great because it focused more on Cyborg and the Season Finale was my focused on Cyborg and the Hive rather then Robin and Slade.

It's a totally different, and totally awful, game.Now, as for Blitz 2000, which this review is about..\\"EXCELLENT\\" !It's a very nice update to Blitz. Faster gameplay, smoother gameplay, and a little more realism has been added, without sacrificing the insanity that is the Blitz series.It's nice to see additional plays for the offense. I wish defense had more though.Also, Turbo Hits are actually useful now as you can knock the ball out of a runner/receiver's hands for the fumble. Interceptions are a bit more realistic, as are the pass patterns.Buy it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAKE UP","review":"This book was the greatest waste of time I have ever spent...I ask that the writer keep her day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks wind.","review":"BLow by blow I was knocked over by this angry woman and her writing style of picking apart instaed of building up... she is every woman's enemy not friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very user friendly","review":"The head is very difficult to get off if yu want to trim close. Even the adjustment is difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A general explanation of a complicated problem","review":"Miller and company has managed to explain the complex issue of Biological Warfare(BW) in a general manner that is accessible to the public. And the outcome is not bad at all.While the media has pushed out frenzied reports and scattered statements in the year after Sept. 11 about BW this book really brings it all together in its history, possibilities, and limitations.If one wishes to go behind the headlines of the newspaper and acquire a better understanding of BW and its uses for the military and terrorist groups this book is a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Read But Where Are the WMD She Claims in the Book?","review":"I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable. After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq. However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction? As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, \\"the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong,\\" which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility. You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Account","review":"I read this book for the purpose of gaining an understanding of the dangers of bio-terrorism and wanted to be more informed on national preparedness to this threat. This book was well written, well researched, balanced, and informative. It showed the increasing importance bio-terrorism is playing on public decisions. The first part of the book gives a little history of germ warfare already instigated by radical terrorist groups, and the role it played in the Cold War. In more recent history, concerns about possible germ warfare and/or bio terrorist attacks led to certain actions in the era of Desert Storm. I would have desired the book progress from giving an excellent historical account to explaining the current public debate, Is there protection to be afforded by spending money on public health measures ? Is protection feasible given the variety of microbes that can be created in a world where gene splicing is becoming commonplace? Is a good defense possible in the future?"},{"rating":"2","title":"America's worst enemy","review":"This book is a factual account of the biological terrorism that has and is plaguing the United States for some time. I found the authors researched the subject with leaving no stones unturned. The depth with which the authors take the reader is astounding. I found myself asking why have we not taken the biological terrrorists attacks more seriously before September 11th??? The book gives great detail about these germs and the pains in which they have been chemcically engineered by militant terrorists groups. This type of terrorism seems so brutal and unforgiving. There are many factions holding on to germs for warfare. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the leading germ warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miller's Motive For Bad Reporting","review":"This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales?"},{"rating":"1","title":"As much propaganda as fact","review":"Miller and friends have written an easy-to-read, mass-market book on biological weapons. It is very focused on alleged biological weapons programs of other countries, without acknowledging our own dog in the fight. In other words, when I began to see Miller outline certain outrageous actions allegedly taken by the Russians or Iraqis, she omitted the fact that the US had taken the same actions, and worse. These glaring omissions made me question the purpose and intent of this book, as well as the \\"facts\\" presented. Indeed, it was as if Miller was beating the drum of war for the Bush Administration. The \\"facts\\" in this book are extremely slanted to the point of propaganda. As a scholar who has spent well over a decade studying biological and chemical weapons, I advise anyone who wants a truthful understanding of biological weapons, to avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"File under fiction","review":"As others have noted, the editors of the New York Times have discovered that one of the authors of this book was manipulated by Ahmed Chalabi's false claims that Iraq had WMD.Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraq war lobby used New York Times reporter Judith Miller to make the case for invading Iraq.Infomation in this book has been discredited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary to say the least","review":"As a molecular biologist, I was shocked at what was discussed in this book. Descriptions of potential weapons, or weapons that were being worked on when the Soviet Union fell sent shivers down my spine. The authors have thouroughly researched the material and present it more as fact rather than a story.To learn that West Nile virus was used as a \\"model\\" to demonstrate how the government could \\"contain\\" an invectious disease, only to find that we totally failed to contain demonstrates how real this danger may be. Unfortunetly, you also gain the insight of how politics actually works. The creation of the programs would cost billions and if they \\"work\\" they appear as wasted money since the programs success would result in no attacks.Some parts of the book read rather slowly, but serve as the foundation required for the modern discussions that are addressed later in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"This is an astounding book! This is not some quicky response to the recent anthrax scare. This is thoroughly researched, well written and comprehensive in scope. This covers previous biological and chemical attacks, Russsian and US efforts to develop and then to control these weapons, problems with vaccinations, government bureaucratic dithering, and the potential problems that must be understood and dealt with NOW.This is a very readable book. I found it to be gripping and thought provoking start to finish. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying and Timely","review":"This book is a remarkable and timely account of the US/Soviet germ warfare programs. This book illustrates why the U.S. was unprepared for recent anthrax attacks, and the ominous conclusions are even more terrifying given recent events. A must read for anyone interested in the 20th centry history of biological weapons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of it rings true in my experience","review":"There are a lot of people who want to discredit the entire book for one reason or another, and they're just plain wrong. In the early 90's, I was an Army infantry officer; I had gone through the army's NBC school (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical), served as my unit's NBC officer, and did a lot of additional reading on these topics, including reading this book. Almost everything I read in this book rings true. The average American would be smart to read this book (although most Americans are too lazy, too self-absorbed in Reality TV, and too stupid to be able to comprehend the highly-technical information in the book) and to be aware that biochemical weapons are very enticing to terrorists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Policy Wonking","review":"The first half of this book was fun, when they talk about the germs and the damage they can do. After the 1991 Gulf War, the book is endless handwringing about how to protect our soldiers and civilians. Forgettable luminaries are paraded across the page to come to the conclusion that America is at risk, but nobody really wants to spend any money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring and Uninformative Book","review":"What these three authors are up to here is known in the trade as \\"selling your notes.\\" This is a poorly organized, poorly written and boring account of a fascinating subject. Do not waste your money or your time.And yes, it's *that* Judith Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Insight","review":"This book coincidentally came out around Sept. 11. It could not have been released at a more perfect time. We are all worried about bio-germ warfare. This book shows us the reality of it. How prepared the US are, or aren't! How Iraq, Iran and Russia have programs designed at creating germs for offensive purposes. It is everything we want to know but the government is afraid to come forward and admit. What's truly amazing is the amount of time the US has been aware of this threat and how politics and bureaucracy has kept them from preparing this country from it. Read it for some good insight. All Americans should be researching the historical religious, polictical and scientific facts surrounding our present situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author discredited","review":"I would have given this a 5 star. However, the author, Judith Miller, has been seriously discredited. I cannot recommend this book to anyone. Please find a book where the author's reputation is not so completely marred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uses hundreds of interviews","review":"In the past decade the government has realized the U.S. is defenseless against the possibilities of germ weaponry, despite its leadership role in science and technology. This uses hundreds of interviews with scientists, intelligence officers and government officials to examine how new \`bio-defenders' are dealing with the possibility of biological weapons. The history of such research and realizations is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality game for PS1","review":"this game was good it actually has talking in it you don't have to read everything its pretty difficult in a way that its fun and its not too short there is a story-line to it the game works great no unable to read disc errors or anything like thatthe only downfall is that if you have Pac-man world 2 for GAMECUBE or PS2 you going to be slightly disappointed because Pac-man world 2 is way betterbut that's just my opiniongreat buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pac-Man World - A Great Game.","review":"My son (age 6) and I have played this game and had a great deal of fun with it.

When you first turn it on, you think it might be fun because of the colorful graphics. But the levels are tedious and surprisingly difficult. It's too easy to fall off the cliff, and your life meter is tiny, so you have to start the game over a lot. The continue starts you over at the very beginning of a world, and so then when I fall off the cliff a couple of times I have to start all over again, and on and on it goes. It's very frustrating for me and my wife and my son. We all hate it. The stuff in the levels is very repetitive with the same stupid props in every level like the lazer beam that kills me every time. Plus the PacMan guy is kind of hard to control. Don't get it, there are a lot better games than this out there like Spyro, all the Crash Bandicoot games, and Ape Escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pac-man world","review":"I don't know because i have not recieved the game yet.

I bought this CD on a lark and it lives up to expectations. An earlier reviewer likened them to Motorhead, though Motorhead is a bit faster and heavier, but the now-defunct Unband is well worth buying a used copy of.

I left the heavier guide in the hotel room, reading in the morning or evening about places we had been or were going, took this Top Ten guide out with us, along with the excellent Insight Fleximap, having put post-it-notes in the Top Ten guide if there was some additional data for the day (for example, the Top Ten guide mentions nothing about the Catacombs).This is not the book to get in depth historical or architectural information, but handy for use in the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"falls apart","review":"this is the first toothbrush I have ever used that the bristles fall out of & stick in one's teeth.I don't recommend this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good item, not what I ordered","review":"I ordered what was written in the description & information of the product, and what I received was somethig different, with out any notification of a change what so ever.

It arrived with a large piece of wood chipped off the corner and lots of wood filler throughout the wagon. Cheap cheap cheap.So we tried this wagon, twice. The first time, it had lots of dents in the bottom because the wheels were smashed into it when it was shipped. This one arrived in a plain, cardboard box, making us think it was re-packaged.We exchanged it for another, only to get one with a large paint chip on the top lip of the wagon, exposing the steel. The second one came shipped in a radio-flyer box, which tipped us off that the first one was probably re-packaged.Sure, eventually the wagons will probably be dented or chipped, but if you're spending the money, you want something that was quality controlled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Build Quality, much like the one I owned years ago!","review":"Very satisfied with the 2011 version of Radio Flyer wagon classic. Very little plastic in this current model, and looks like it should last for years. My grand daughter loved it on Christmas morning. Two fairly minor issues: First, I had to redrill two holes on the wood side rails because the pre drilled holes didn't line up with the wagon; Second, the rubber smell from the tires stunk up the house so badly that we had to put the wagon outside for the first few nights after assembly! These were inconveniences, but well worth it because my grand daughter ended up with a durable wagon that should give her years of service, instead of the cheap plastic models sold at Target or KMart or Toys-r-Us that would break and end up in the Landfill quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer Wagon","review":"This wagon is perfect for the grandchildren!

It seems very sturdy, and we really like the big, soft wheels. The fact that the handle folds under the wagon makes it easy to load in the car.

Being that he is only 13 months old there aren't many toys to hold his interest. However, he has shown in non-verbal ways that he wants his mom to take him out for a ride in his wagon. He beams from ear to ear and is noticing things all around him which he hasn't up to this point noticed. He watched birds up in a tree and watched skateboarders very intently. It has become his favorite pastime to ride in it So for those of you interested, even as young as a one year old enjoys this My daughter took 3 toddlers together for a ride in it and they all loved it.

I love the quiet tires sompared to the hard ones typically found on radio flyer wagons. Some of the wood pieces were severely warped and had ugly wood filler in several spots. It still functionally works fine (keeps him from falling out when going over bumps), but it seems like they pulled wood scraps out of the trash. I expected more from such an expensive item. If I could do it over I would buy the one without wood and build my own wood sides, but I was trying to avoid adding another project to my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Grand Daughters First Birthday.","review":"We purchased this item for our grand daughters first birthday gift. It was a big hit! She enjoyed riding in her new wagon and you couldn't get the smile off her face.

The ATW package has inflatable tires and is truly an All Terrain Wagon.

I'm looking foward to many hours watching her play with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer All-Terrain Red Wagon","review":"The wagon is true to the image I have always had of Radio Flyer's flagship wagon. It was easy to assemble, and is sturdy. It had a dent on coming out of the box, but not a big deal since it will soon have more dents. The AT wheels are a nice improvement over the wagon I had so many years ago. Nothing else seems to have changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, sturdy wagon!","review":"This wagon definitely lives up to its \\"All Terrain\\" name! It is very sturdy. At times it can be a little bit difficult to steer in tight spaces, but that's really no big deal. It also does not have seatbelts (which I knew before I bought it) so make sure your child is old enough to understand that he/she needs to sit down & stay in the wagon. Overall, I love it! It's exactly what we wanted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wagon. Stinky tires.","review":"Wagon is great, old school quality and durability. However the rubber tires smell horrible. Even after two weeks assembled, the smell from the tires fills my garage. Still not a deal breaker but definitely not an inside toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids love it.","review":"This was a shared present for my 3 kids, 1 year old twins and a 3 year old. They love it, so far playing with it has mainly entailed me pulling them around the neighborhood, which, by the way, is an excellent workout. Radio Flyer has always built things well and they did on this wagon. Amazon had the cheapest price I could find and it arrived well packaged and undamaged.Things to consider before buying: 1. Little fingers will get stuck in the slats. 2. It is pretty heavy to pull up hills and through thick grass. 3. The wagon is huge with the over sized wheels and slats so you will need adequate room to store it. 4. The tires will be expensive to replace, take care of them. 5. The wheels are plastic, wish they were metal.Overall, a great product that will provide your children years of entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made product from Chine","review":"These wagon's used to be made solid and heavy. Not any more. They are made of cheap stamped tin. I mean the wheel's do not even screw on any mroe like previous models. They have a press on cap to hold the wheel. BAD IDEA! The wood on the one I purchased from 8 years ago was almost 1/2 inch think. This wood is 1/4 inch thick and will not last long to a child's abuse.

The tires are sturdy and easily handle stairs & curbs. We have taken it literally off-road and it has handled all terrains.

She loves it! She wants to ride every morning before work and again in the afternoons. She brings friends along (human and stuffed) and there is plenty of room for four small children. The high rails allow a good view but keep her safely inside giving Mom enough reaction time when she tries to stand in it (which she does frequently!)The big wheels make for a smooth comfortable ride for all.I HIGHLY recommend this affordable, safe, classic toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not american Made","review":"I'm shopping tonight for my 14 month old daughter.

Think Twice.","review":"You might want to think twice about getting this wagon if you live in a hilly neighborhood. I found that trying to pull this wagon up hill with 2 small kids in it is extremely strenuous...and I'm even in good shape. I thought the pneumatic tires would make it easy to pull. They do, on level ground. But any kind of incline becomes a real work out. I end up using my Bob stroller with a kiddie board attached because it's so much easier to push up hill. I thought I would also use the wagon when we go to the beach, park or zoo but it's so big it just barely fits in my Subaru Forester (no room for anything else at all so don't plan to take it on vacation). And it's very heavy so it's hard to load in the car and tricky to try to keep the handle under the wagon while loading it (that's the only way it will fit in mine). I am selling it on Craig's List after using it only a handful of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wagon Ever","review":"So if your going to buy a wagon might as well get the All-Terrain!

I would not recommend this wagon to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandbaby's First Wagon","review":"The product itself is very sturdy looking, with big fat all terrain pneumatic tires. It was purchased as a first wagon for our first grandchild, who is only 1 year old, so he has not been hard on it yet, however the reviews I read previously and from what I have seen, it is going to be his \\"wagon for life\\". It arrived a couple of days later than it was supposed to to, but it was very late in Christmas Season. It had a puncture hole in the box, looked like a forklift got it, and it did dent the side slightly, but my husband pounded it out with a soft mallet, and it is fine, (there was no time to return it and still have a gift in time for Christmas). It was a big hit stuffed with Teddy Bears and a box of diapers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wagon","review":"My son loves this wagon.

Clotworthy. However, I was quite disappointed. While the work is rife with information and anecdotes about Mr. Clotworthy's work at NBC, and in particular on Saturday Night Live, the lack of an index - or, for that matter, chapters - made it nearly impossible to navigate and rendered virtually worthless as a difinitive reference book. My advice is to invest in a pack of Post-It notes upon purchase. That said, the book is well written and a quick read. And a note of thanks to its publisher 1st Books for taking the care to get this book to the public.

However, I only had it for 6 weeks when the power supply died. It can't be repaired, and Toshiba won't honor the 90-day warrantee.So, while it looks like a great product, the power supply is fragile and the customer service is one of the worst I've seen.My advice: Go with a similar product from a company with higher standards of quality and customer commitment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning...Do not buy this combo unit","review":"I purchase this vcr/dvd combo today and was disappointed.

Then, only about 6 weeks after receiving it, the power supply didn't work at all. Amazon wouldn't take it back. Toshiba directed me to take it to an authorized dealer. I did, and they held it a month, then gave it back to me unrepaired, saying that \\"failure is typical of lightning or power surge.\\" There was no storm. There was also no warning on the box that a surge protector might be needed for the product. I am told that this is not covered under the warranty! If Amazon won't stand behind this product, and Toshiba won't either, I don't think it's worth buying. As a student, I don't appreciate being ripped off of this much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you save your receipt","review":"Thank goodness that the DVD part of this unit quit working just before the 90 day return period at Target expired.

After extensively reviewing this combo unit at several web sites including the Toshiba corporate site, I decided to purchase it. I was excited that I was able to tie the unit into my audio reciever. I was disappointed to find that this model does not come with a multibrand remote. It is advertied by Toshiba as having a mulitbrand remote (to control other brand tv's and so fourth) but it does not. The remote only works the unit itself it will not control my Toshiba TV or any other brand TV for that matter. My 8 year old Hitachi VCR even came with a multibrand remote. I questioned Toshiba customer support and they were rude and directed me to their web site's disclaimer about not being responsible for changes in fetures from advertised product, bla bla bla. I am all done with Toshiba. I will be returning this for a Sony that actually has this feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Electronic Item I Ever Bought - Complete Junk","review":"I bought this thing for our bedroom, so my wife and I could watch both kinds of media on the TV and listen to the occasional CD, or plant our kids in there so they can watch a Disney DVD while we do something else around the house. What a piece of junk! Within a couple of months the remote stopped working, new batteries didn't help. I bought a replacement remote; still no joy. It turns out the sensor on the unit (not the remote) stopped receiving the signal. That's especially bad on this unit since there's no control on the unit that lets you get to the menu on a DVD (big problem with most Disney videos). This unit is worthless. I junked it and bought a Sony combo instead - that one works great. No more Toshiba for me, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet my expectations","review":"Package arrived with most of the tape torn off, but inside seemed undamaged.

After three days of frustration I sent it back via UPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote control won't control TV <-- Shame","review":"It was a great idea to buy this unit instead of buying VCR and DVD players separately. I checked all the specs, inputs, outputs, etc., and was OK with them. Except one I did not check ... Will the remote from this combo operate a TV? This feature was so given that it did not even occurred to me to check it. For last ten years remote control from every single VCR player I bought, could operate many different brands of TVs.I also tried universal remote controls. They would not work with the combo b/c appearantly Toshiba came up with the new IR control codes that universal controls don't yet know about.Anyway, I am dissapointed in Toshiba. They lost a loyal customer and a big fan. I am returning this unit back. I am not used to use two remote control units to just perform one simple task like watch a DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before you buy this unit!","review":"I thought by spending a little more on the Toshiba product I would save myself money in the long run. I assumed it would last longer and be a higher quality product. The product warranty is 3 months parts and labor and 1 year parts (you pay labor charges). I've had mine seven months, and the vhs side simply quit showing us a picture. We can hear sound, but the screen is blank. I took it to the service center where they charged an initial $37 just to look at it. I'm sure that before it's over and done with, the repair costs will be climbing upward to what a new non-Toshiba combo would be. If you have had good luck with a particular band, buy it again. If you have no prior experience with a brand, don't assume that spending more is going to get you a better product.

The end result is exactly the same as the images taken with the camera's 24mm lens at its widest angle without the converter - with the addition of a little distortion.

The lengthening of the story without really adding anything to it made it awkward rather than captivating and in the end I paged to the latter fourth of the book, no longer able to finish it.The sad thing about it all is that it's not a bad story, just one that does not manage to capture the grandeur of the original.

Bakker's views are controversial. But if you are armoured with needed background information, you will enjoy in reading this book, whether agree or not. Even if you don't know anything about dinosaur, this book still shows you how to think scientifically that you can always apply to other fields as well.Don't be afraid this book could be wrong. Every piece of information about dinosaurs are from educated guesses. Nothing is the whole truth. So far you're not a teacher or a professional, you can always benefit from this book as it shows you how to think logically and scientifically. Even if you're one, you know when to be skeptical. I suggest everyone to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great, Great","review":"This is a great dinosaur information book. It's NOT a bunch of classic drawings and grade school text for 5th graders. It's the grown up version complete with controversy and insight that only Bob can come up with. His artwork is top notch. Bakker has done his homework and makes logical sense about how dinosaurs ate, mated, gave birth and led social lives. He needs a sequel to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Fiction","review":"Outstanding look at new palaeontology and dinosaur work. Taking the various papers that Bakker wrote for scientific journals and converting them to a book that is slightly more understandable to the public.

The black & color cartridge together is $56, then you have to worry about these individual color ink heads or something like that, which cost $34 each!

It is not the size of any wrench and very difficult to turn. If it had an indentation like a screw head it would be far easier to use and make more sense.

Those were good songs, delivered with all of the wrenching plaintiveness of a penetrating songwriter. Now we get a shallow, plunky, whiny, gloss version of what we used to love. I guess it's better than a lot of sh*t bands on their best days, but still a let down. And what's with everybody saying this is a \\"hard-charging rock\\" record? The only song with cajones is the opening track, the rest is a pallid imitation of a better time.

I think the concept of seeing the world through a filter of 'noir' is awesome. I also think the setting of this novel is very interesting in a Gibsonesque way. But. When I noticed the protagonist is called McNihil, and an office early in the book is called \\"Foucault & Derrida\\", I felt like throwing the book out of the window.

One of those books that leaves you asking, \\"Why?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"a disturbing vision slowly becoming reality","review":"Noir is an excellent novel, particularly to those more interested in reading the book than looking for mistakes.

With every server raid and court case against copyright infringers today, the aspheads of Noir begin to look less fantastic and more inevitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting world, but plot is not what is expected.","review":"The author appears to be using the book mostly as a platform to harangue against copyright violations, as well as provide some chilling ideas on what should be done to the violators. The bulk of the story is essentially a wrapper/filler around this concept as it meanders along trying to provide a coherent plot. The book would have been much stronger (and a better read) if more time had been spent developing the tale itself; as it is, the book doesn't really answer any of the questions brought up in the storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting writing","review":"I didn't really enjoy _Noir_ all that much. The writing was convoluted, seemingly for its own sake at times, and it never built toward an ending. It seemed, rather, to meander in exacting description of just how bad everything is.The last 40 pages or so wrapped the plot together by revealing a lot of off screen action that made for a 'happy' ending. While the reader is struggling to understand the significace of McNihil's eyes, and why it is they are mentioned every 10 pages or so, McNihil is solving everything, without having the decency to let the reader know what the Hell it is that he's doing!It was, however, rather disappointing to wade through the baroque writing of the first few hundred pages and find it to be nothing more than scene setting. Not plot development. Scene setting.Sure, the characterizations are interesting, and yes, the world is somewhat dark. Wasn't worth the build up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could use a little more structure...","review":"I'm disappointed with this novel. I found the main character implausible: his cyber-eyes are not very credible, and even the author seems to forget how they should work for dozens of pages. His work is even less plausible. The Collection Agency and the episode in which the main character does one of his \\"jobs\\" seems to just be an excuse to rant about the author's view on copyright. Lastly, the final part with the showdown against the main villain is more than a little confusing, and the evil-megacorporation-plot-against-everything-and everybody is cliched and, again, not very plausible, either on technical or social grounds. I suspect that the book was put together under some kind of pressure, and the various parts don't seem to fit well together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better book.......","review":"The 5th Edition of this book has been revamped by Dr Lumb to its infinite benefit.

Once the elastic is gone there is notheing that will keep the cover from falling off in the lightest of breezes.I also agree with the review concerning water pooling in the center of the trampoline. At the very least I'm sure it weakens and shortens the spring life and also probably has the possibility of compromising the longevity of the trampoline frame.One other complaint I have is that it is very difficult for one person to put the cover on by themself. As you attempt to pull the cover across the trampoline, the whole cover just slides on over and you end up walking in circles trying to get one side to stay put long enough to stretch the cover over to the opposite side."},{"rating":"1","title":"cover not advised for rainy climates","review":"There is nothing wrong with this product, it's how you use it. We almost ruined our $300 trampoline in it's first week by using this product. We put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine.

It took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since. Trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through.

Within a few hours though a breeze blew it off because it doesn't come with any straps to secure it to the trampoline. Instead the only thing to hold it secure is some bungie like material sewn in the cover. Poorly designed, cheaply made. Once the padding arrived, I tried putting this cover on again and it didn't fit over the extra material (only about 1/2 padding). I have it secured with plastic joint clamps from the home improvement store. Fortunately for this situation we don't get much rain here in the desert. I don't think I can fit a large ball under there to keep the rain from pooling in the center. I will just remove it when it rains.

It denies the very escence of gandhis teachings for no other purpose than to do just that. The Historian who wrote this is a revisionist. While at times, Revisionism can be helpful in understanding characters-this is revisionism for revionism sake. The claim of the book that gandhi was a racist and hindu fundamentalist is absolutly absurd when one reads gandhis writings on religion and truth, \\"differen't roads converging at the same point,\\" is not a mark of fundamentalism. I found this book to be very poor in trying to be overly critical, and took many parts of gandis life out of context"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacers great games","review":"I think it is stupid to complain about somthing that you did know was not there.

I think there is space in literature for that type of history, but not in a book that is meant to be for people's enlightenment. I believe that in order to get nice things in life, you don't need to repeat/read painful histories over and over again. It doesn't help woman empowerment, when they feel themselves like the victims.I am a woman and I don't think the idea is wrong about having a partner in the esoteric practices. I just think that focusing too much in a relationship in order to look for your spiritual goals is a bit dangerous. Woman need to feel strong inside themselves first of all, then whatever comes on a loving relationship is a plus and consequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall very good but a few problems","review":"This book is written in three parts: (1)the manuscript supposedly channelled from Mary Magdalen, (2) principles of internal alchemy, and (3) one woman's story.I am always very skeptical about channelled works, as is (interestingly) the book's first author. The \\"channelled\\" manuscript is an interesting read regardless of its validity. I found a major error, however, that causes me to seriously doubt the authenticity of the channel. On pages 29-30 there is a description of the Virgin Birth, but it is described as the \\"immaculate conception\\" which is a very common misconception. According to the church, the immaculate conception is that Mary Mother of Christ was born without sin; NOT that Mary was inseminated by God in order to conceive Jesus. Because of this error the channelling is highly suspect.The second and third portions of the book are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK !","review":"The warrantee is only 90 days.

The print speed is fast enough; it's not extremely slow. This is not the model to get, however, if you're looking for lightning speed.

The addition of Glenn Hughes and Steve Lukather on Things Aint What they used to Be doesn't work, as its not a strong song, and their cover of Mean Streets doesn't work, except for Sheehan's killer bass solo. Aside from that, the rest of the songs have a strong drive and rock hard, especially Bootleg Jeans and Blue Mondo. Subsequent releases are also consistent and strong, but this was the first excellent Niacin CD, where they find their groove and write and perform an entire CD of consistently good material. Dennis Chambers totalitarian drums are a delight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great bass, yes, but bland music","review":"Many of the songs have interesting bass lines, but that won't sustain the songs for more than a minute or so.

Watching beautiful but somewhat emotionally immature Julie ruin, and ultimatelly lose, her life, is heartbreaking, but strangely fascinating. Glatt does a great job of setting up the murder by profiling the victim's parents, and her difficult childhood. The background information makes it easier to understand how such a beautiful woman who seemingly had everything [handsome successful husband; lovely home; adorable baby] would chuck it all for a not too attractive and impoverised Greek cruise line worker. Well, not 100% easy to understand.While reading, I felt like screaming at the victim: don't go with him. What, are you crazy? But, of course, if you read the book description, you know exactly how the story will end. Knowing does not make the read any less gripping, which is the sign of a good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sad","review":"Good book...but it would've been alot better if John Glatt also focused on the troubled life of Skiadopoulos, prior to his relationship with Julie.As for the curent status of Skiadopoulos, last year his life sentence was dropped to 23 years.

All show a simplistic lack of depth that is almost insulting to any player of the older games and hopefully will be equally insulting to newer players.This new Mage is a case in point.

Gone is the idea of paradigm, of mages being powered from within, of technomancy as another method to the madness that achieves the SAME RESULTS as magic. Gone is the flexibility, gone is the believability that joe schmoe you meet on the street might just be an archmage, dealing with magic as an interesting hobby rather than the sum total of his being.everthing I loved about ascension... is gone.

Just Terrible.I also find it amusing that they cleared out all of the metaplot history in Vampire to make the game more open to interpretation and less confined by metalplot events, and then went and eviscerated the background of MAGE, the WOD game that was MOST open to interpretation.

The play was totally autobiographical and when O'Neill died in 1951, his widow, Carlotta gave permission for the play to be performed 5 years later (O'Neill stated in his will that the play was not to be produced until 25 years after his death!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"character study of perfection","review":"hepburn is transformed in every sceen. nuances from the play not only dialogue make the performances unbelieveable. every line is a moment in time. alcohol,morphine,and family all are totally explored. verbally and visually mesmerizing. hepburn is old,young,strungout,and youthfully innocent. all are brilliant. study characters, and acting!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and beautiful film of O'Neill's masterpiece","review":"Under Sidney Lumet's superb direction, Sir Ralph Richardson, Katherine Hepburn, Dean Stockwell and Jaosn Robards, Jr. convey the beauty and pain of a masterpiece of American drama. The tension builds slowly to a devestating and emotionally wrenching conclusion, as each member of the Tyrone family confronts the knowledge that the ties of love cannot save them from the unfulfilled dreams and illusions of a past that continues to haunt them in the present. With the somber black-and-white cinematography and the stark intensity of Andre Previn's solo piano score setting the mood, the actors give some of their finest performances, capturing all the power of O'Neill's masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIVE stars for the performances, ONE star for DVD quality","review":"I agree with the reviews, the performances are absolutely stunning, especially Katharine Hepburn's, possibly the best of her career if not one of the best ever captured on film.HOWEVER, this DVD release is atrocious. This is close to a three-hour film and they crammed on to one disc. That wouldn't be so bad had they done a new transfer, but this looks like the same one used for the VHS tape. Cropped for the TV screen like the video release, (this was definitely shot in widescreen, according to imdb.com), it's got the same gritty, low-res quality. You could tape this movie off of TCM or Bravo and get better quality. Rent it, tape it, but hold off on buying this until it's given a proper DVD release (if anyone from the Criterion Collection's listening, please license this movie!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre DVD transfer","review":"This is a powerful film that's making its long-awaited DVD debut and what do we get -- a scratchy print scaled down from widescreen to a 4X3 aspect ratio, essentially the same as its VHS presentation.

I was slightly taken aback by Hepburn's performance as Mary. I think this presentation was a tad overdone for my taste. Many times I found myself cringing during her lines. I did, however, enjoy the book, where I could interpret the character to my own liking. Perhaps that was why I didn't some of the performances. In my mind they were less dramatic. It wasn't all bad, the young man portraying Edmund did put on a heartfelt and believable performance. All in all the book was done with impeccable taste and value, but the movie could have been toned down a notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all tastes.","review":"First, the performances by Hepburn, Robards, and Stockwell are top notch. Noone else could have performed any of the roles better. But this film is basically a three hour argument. Everyone fights with everybody else. There are other movies with less than happy endings which I love, but seeing this one once was more than enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Movie's relapse into boredom","review":"The play wasn't so bad, but the movie was worse. Giving it a 2 was generous and the producer should thank his wonderful cast. Great acting was the only thing that kept me awake. Katherine puts on a wonderful preformance as a nervous maniac, I mean she had to spice that boring play up somehow! Actually, I have to give O'Niel some credit because it was an autobiography. As terrible a life he had, one day in his shoes bored me out of my mind. Sorry Mr. Taylor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Day's Journey Into Night","review":"I give this movie 1 star but truthly I can't rate this movie because it had no affect on me nor did it bring out the full potential of the play. The actors could have done better job and the play doesn't seem to be brought alive it more died right away as it started. There was some very poor acting and the crying as well as Mary being a morphine adact didn't seem real enough. I have seen morphine adacts and how she played her role seemed more like a lunatic or a nut out of a nut house then someone addicted to morphine. The book was done wrong by this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrring Snoozefest!!","review":"It is all talk. The performances are good but the film is much too long and what could have been an excellent character study comes off over-the-top and theatrical. Hepburn is unflatteringly photographed and her mannerisms are distracting and annoying as well as her \\"cheese grating\\" voice. Sir Ralph RIchardson, Stockwell and Robards do well by their roles but I just couldn't get to care about their characters because the film put me to sleep within ten minutes of watching it and I had to watch it in spurts (took me 17 days)to complete the viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An entirely too long movie","review":"I'll be brief. This was three hours of pain and suffering. If it had been a short, twenty to maybe an hour long, it could have been more enjoyable. But three hours of mediocre acting with fake emotions was a terrible waste of time to me. Fans of the playwrite or actors, don't be outraged, this just wasn't a good production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalous DVD issue","review":"This movie is an excellent filming of a great American play. The one star rating is for another Lion's Gate DVD disaster. Not only is the image dark and blurry, but it has been cut down from its original 1.85:1 ratio to 1.33:1. This means nearly a quarter of the image is missing at all times. So called \\"full screen\\" DVDs of widescreen films are questionable, but when this is the ONLY version a company makes available, it is a downright disgrace. Avoid at all costs. Watch it properly on TCM and/or wait for a proper DVD release.** Nov,2012 update: Olive Films has now released a new transfer of this WIDESCREEN film in it's proper aspect ratio.

This drama is an utter tragedy and the tortured Tyrone family drama plays out in real time: a long dark night of the soul. All of the roles are definitively performed. Hepburn gives the performance of a lifetime: full of pain and memories she can hardly bear to recall. There is also the remarkably simple but moving piano score of Andre Previn.If you need constant action to be entertained, don't subject yourself to Long Day's Journey Into Night - if, however, you are interested in the depth of the human heart and the catharsis of a shattering tragedy, this film will stay with you forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for text book use","review":"I read this book hoping for a clear understanding of Buddhism.

It's like seeing that one tree outside your apartment window, the one that reminds you that not everything has to hold to the grid. His style reminds me somewhat of Glenn Gould's interpretations of Bach.The best two pieces are a review of an old 19th century travel guide to London and an interview where Perec describes his experience serving as a paratrooper during France's Gaullist period.Lyrical, measured, and humane; a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll try to think like this","review":"What a joy reading these placid small thoughts. The everyday was never so interesting until Perec showed how. I'll be keeping this paperback. I'll be opening it whenever I feel a slump in my own writing.

The Fix will make an even better movie because it's so positive, compared to the story about Knight, who is so negative. This is a great read, and a positive message to basketball players, and all athletes in general. Mike Kramer doesn't succumb to the pressures of life, and in the end wins because of it. This may be the best book this reader has read in over five years. I couldn't put it away. I heard him on the radio in the Twin Cities during the Final Four. He knows what he's talking about.

I am pretty curious how a passenger managed to get a handgun onto a plane, even though he checked it.Also at the end when all the zombies seemed to come out of the woodwork when the black girl sacrificed herself to give her friend time to get away was a little confusing. At that point if my math was right, we should have had 2 infected left alive, but somehow 5 zombies run out and attack her.If you like survival horror, check it out, but if you're expecting an awesome sequel to the first movie, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont want to go on planes no more","review":"Quarantine 2 was a good movie... unlike most sequels this one ran parallel with the first one.

This time they ripped off \\"Flight of the Living Dead\\" (which is a much better movie BTW) and slapped a \\"Quarantine 2\\" sticker on it. The first Quarantine movie was a rip off of the Spanish film \\"Rec\\". This rip off was the worst movie I've had the misfortune of seeing. the plot was weak, the acting was terrible and the special fx needed help. What happened to original film making? What happened to great story telling and film making?....It's still happening...only in Spain as far as the Quarantine movies are concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"The first Quarantine, which was a so-so remake of the spectacular Spanish thriller [REC], spawns a direct to DVD sequel with Quarantine 2: Terminal, and the biggest surprise here is that this sequel is surprisingly good, and better than the film that came before it. During the events of the first film, a plane taking off from Los Angeles ends up becoming the breeding ground for the same kind of rage/zombie virus for the crew and passengers alike, forcing them to land at a terminal and, you guessed it, get quarantined and race against the growing odds to survive. What really makes Quarantine 2 so good is that it's surprisingly well-filmed, well-acted, and even more surprisingly taut and suspenseful as well. Though it has its share of shortcomings, Quarantine 2 makes the most of its minimal budget and delivers the goods, which is something that many, many horror films of this type should take a big cue from. Check it out, you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"String doesn't hang nicely in your ear.","review":"I bought these awhile ago and finally went to wear them the other day and discovered that although they look great, the chain/string is some weird link that doesn't hang nicely in your ear.

I am not particular to roosters or butterflies and her animal designs (like the one for the dog) aren't great but the color schemes make the sweaters stand out. I also like the way the table of contents is laid out: there are color pictures of each design. You also get good views of each design; I wish more knitting books had such good photos.

A serious omission is the impact of technology on leadership in organisations (at least this is a serious omission for a book so titled). The publishers (Wiley) probably have something to answer for as well, whereby the advertising doesn't match the product. This isn't the first time this has happened with them either. Normally it isn't a problem, but when you purchase through Amazon and you're in Australia, it's too much of an effort to squawk about the book not matching the expectations.

You can shoot at them, hit them with your car, and run them off the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"if there was a reason to live this cd is not it.","review":"This cd was so bad I almost threw it in the trash.

I normally use the elliptical and the recumbent bike. The book that comes with it does not explain what setting to use with the elliptical, so I tried the bike setting first. After about 10 minutes, it said I'd burned over 200 calories, so I changed it to the weight setting to see if that would be more accurate. Well, it wasn't either! Then I went to the recumbent bike, and of course used the bike setting. After 2 hours at the gym, the thing told me I'd burned 2000 calories! While I wish that could be true, there's no way it's possible. The gym machines tell me that I've burned 1000 calories after 2 hours, and even those machines tend to overestimate calories burned. The X-Max Caltrac Calorie Counter was even worse, and therefore useless. I sent mine back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caltrac","review":"Love this product.

However, after a week and a half, I laid it down as I slept. When I woke up in the morning, it had stopped working. It smelled like it was burning on the inside, like circuitry problem.

The recipes I've tried from it have turned out great, and there are helpful product recommendations interspersed throughout as well. The author draws from some Cook's Illustrated test kitchen results in his detective work, so we get to benefit of CI's research as well as the author's own testing (which he does in his own kitchen). He writes about ingredients or methods that he tried along the way that DIDN'T work, and why, so that we can learn from his trial-and-error without having to go through it ourselves.The reason I give the book 4 stars, and not 5, is that sometimes the writing style is a bit hard to follow, and the general layout of the book is kind of \\"blah\\". There are several black and white photographs attempting to show the difference between two recipes that really don't add much to the book at all, the photos are generally too low-quality to discern whatever difference they're trying to show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"First of all, I paid more for this at a Target store :( Secondly, i went with interplak because of their reputation.

Where are all the tortured souls and ripped flesh we were promised in the original. Hell is just some dark tunnels and some old mattresses. Big deal.

Some people say this movie was way too gory and sick, but thats the way it was sapposed to be. Do you really think that there would be a film being made like this that would have pink bunnies and feathers instead of hooks and chains and Cenobites? Didn't think so. Speaking of Cenobites, those people(and/or demons) kicked [butt]!...though I would never enjoy becoming one...pins, hooks and chains tend to hurt a bit...

They also show that people are thinking algebraically even when they don't know they're doing so. This is a great book if you took algebra a long time ago and are not sure you remember the differences between the various mathematical disciplines.

To put it simply I enjoy this author's style, imagination and daring."},{"rating":"2","title":"One and Done","review":"This is an imaginative, well-written, and very creative effort, that does not in any way require a sequel. By that I mean that Gregor's adventure in Underland is exciting and rewarding, but the conclusion is satisfying and I feel no need to return to Underland.That makes this a great book for experimenting. If your reader doesn't particularly care for the book, or is satisfied with just one installment, fine. If he or she really gets into Underland, there are more volumes that continue the thread. It's sort of a win/win.It's especially nice that this book is aimed at a younger audience than a lot of the current fantasy/adventure books, (like Collins' own Hunger Games series, or the Maze Runner series). There is adventure, and danger, and derring-do, but not a lot of explicit violence, or an overly complicated plot. The writing style also suits a younger demo.

Yes there is still death, but not like the morbid assumption that drives the Hunger Games.The underworld of book 1 is richly described and well conceived. And the characters are almost believable.

What he finds is a whole new world with gigantic roaches, evil rats, enormous spiders and an odd race of humans. Gregor's arrival is seen as a possible warrior who can save the Underland according to an prophecy written in stone hundreds of years ago. All he knows is his mom is going to be worried sick if he doesn't get home soon with his sister (as utterly charming a human as ever existed!) I loved this book. You will love this story. I can't wait for the next book in her series. Highly recommended to kids and moms, and everyone in between!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"A different and quite imaginative story.

This book is also good because it is full of surprising events and cliff hangers that will make you want to read more. You will not be able to put it down.This book is not recommended for those who do not like fantasy stories. We think this story is best for grades four and up.

Eleven year old Gregor and his two-year old sister, Boots, become entangled in a quest to save this dangerous but intriguing world from disaster. This is a fabulous fantasy series for kids who have finished Harry Potter and are wondering what to read next. Collins makes this incredible world inhabited by gigantic creatures entirely believable.

Gregor also finds out that his father who had been missing for 2 years might have fallen to the Underland and been kidnapped by the rats.

My first concern was that the story might be too scary for my youngest considering there are giant roaches, rats, spiders and bats throughout the entire thing. But, it wasn't. The story has an Alice in Wonderland feel to it that is very nice. All of us are looking forward to reading the rest of the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad to discover how subpar this is","review":"I'm guessing lots of parents like me, and kids too, are giving Gregor a try after reading and loving the Hunger Games books. There's a reason this was never popular though. I couldn't even pay my middle grader to read this AND I TRIED. It's subpar, rather less than average, and not even in the same league as Hunger Games. Two stars though is probably a little low, especially considering some of the utter dreck I rated 1 star recently.

From the start I found myself really BELIEVING in these characters and, more importantly, believing the situations that they found themselves in. Giant talking bats, cockroaches and rats should have seemed silly but did not. The author made me care deeply for Gregor and, of course, Boots but what shocked me the most was her ability to get me to care about cockroaches. Any author who can make me cry when a cockroach is killed is a truly amazing storyteller.

They say it's difficult for someone to get back to the Overland, and then it turns out to be as simple as a bat flying them up. I suppose they could've been lying so he wouldn't leave, but then why did those other Overlanders they mentioned die, when they could've easily gotten out? Another thing that bothered me was when he **minor spoilers* tried to 'run away' from the Underland humans with Boots. He had absolutely no idea where he was going, and it was basically the stupidest decision ever. It could've been because he's 11, but I think even an 11 year old would have more common sense.I guess there are just some things in the book that I wasn't quite able to understand.

Prophecies are unraveled, trust is put to the test, and new bonds are made.I enjoyed reading this fantasy adventure, enough to purchase book 2.

I'd heard of Mr. Allen but had no idea what I was stepping in when I started to watch this set.

That said, I did notice some of these episodes seemed rather short. Then I found this review at sitcomsonline:Buena Vista had been doing a rather decent job of releasing this series on DVD, but then they decided to release the sixth season in a cheaper package than the previous releases. Of course, packaging shouldn't immediately cause alarm, but then you get inside the package and discover that nearly half of the episodes have this bizarre video compression problem. Then, on top of that, they use syndicated versions for an unknown number of episodes? Does everybody know what time it is?

The storyline a remarkably poignant.

You can easily tell that it's a great movie by all the other reviews. What I'll focus on is the DVD itself. One point for it is that it has a menu. It goes down hill there as the DVD only has Stereo sound. This might be due to the original's lack of budget but I began to wonder when I see this classic movie is only pan and scan. Fox/Lorber has seen fit to put hard subtitles whether or not we can understand French. This is a DVD which could have been a lot better. It's a shame that we get such great movies done in substandard DVDs. Bowfinger is going to be 16:9, Widescreen, and Pan&Scan; plus DTS sound & lots of extras. Couldn't Fox/Lorber have done this movie with at least a widescreen version and removeable subtitles? Look at A Better Tomorrow to see how good a foriegn film can be put onto a DVD.

I was neither shocked or offended as I viewed it with pure innocence. Within 10 minutes I knew what sex was. Sexuality issues I later developed were not the result of viewing this book, but rather interactions I had with other people. However, it can be a very odd book for an adult to own. It may either say the parent is very progressive or a possible pedophile. I strongly believe their are two very distinct sides of the fence in this matter, one which is pure of mind and one which is very dangerous.

This is one of those scripts. However, even in those talky and unconvincing scripts, the visual effects were usually pretty striking. And here, they're pretty striking.What sinks this episode is technical-sounding doubletalk, and a lot of it. Stevens' speculations about the nature of the afterlife, and the science of metaphysics, are genuinely interesting. If he could have stuck more to the point, he would have been more effective.Still, the sets are impressive (the series blew a lot of its budget early on, ironically on its lesser shows), the visual effects are truly eye-catching, and the finale is actually quite dramatically satisfying and even moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Borderland = 2.5 out of 5 stars","review":"The Borderland is a nice little Outer Limits story. \\"The Borderland\\" is the 4th dimension that our scientist hero of the episode is trying to explore.

That goes to show you that the game is AWSOME graphically and in gameplay. This is my first PS2 golf game but I have played the old school golf games. This is by far the best golf game I have ever played. I don't like the changing the ball spin in mid-flight nor do I like the Caddy tip on the greens. It makes the game TOO easy, I wish I could turn thos off. It only took me 4 days to beat all the Tournements and the Tiger Challeneges but the scenerios and the throphy balls are giving me a problem.

I am essentially learning this game but I love the fact that I didn't beat the game in one day. That's always the best part of any game. Can you come back and play it again 6 months later and be interested? This game has great re-play value. It seems pretty straight-forward to learn the controls.

I guess if you're easily amused...Also, the game seems to lack the flair and fun factor of the Hot Shots series, or even new-kid-on-the-block Outlaw Golf.

After buying and falling in love with Walela's debut album, Walela, I was eagerly looking forward to this one. But, sadly, it's like comparing apples and oranges. The songs on this album are unremarkable and seem to my ears to be thrown together. Their first album was incredible and I listen to it daily. I don't see how they could go from amazing to pitiful from one to the next. Listening to this one just doesn't bring forth the same emotion as the first. It's just like listening to any old other country song...there's nothing spiritual about it. And the beautiful harmonies that they displayed in the first are nowhere to be heard. The songs are choppy and vary so much from line to line that it doesn't even seem like the same song sometimes. Very little sound from their Cherokee roots and turns into a total copout.

I overheard him having a conversation with a fan when the topic of Marianne Faithfull came up. Elvis highly praised this release, so I sought it out to listen to it.I concur with Elvis.

She is an an incredibly gifted interpreter of others' songs (and of her own songs herself, when she gives it a try). But the last two albums, this one and \\"Kissing Time,\\" are just disasters. Why is she trying to perform the lackluster songs of today's forgettable artists? She's far more talented than that. Indeed, she is a voice of maturity on today's music scene. Stick to what you do well, Marianne...Billie Holiday, Kurt Weill, and the like. With that material, you are a brilliant pioneer. With this newer, insubstantial stuff, you are just a joke.

Not only does it try to cover too much territory by doing all of Europe, it strays from it's intended purpose as a camping guide book. Most area descriptions are only a short paragraph long and have more info on area attractions than on the campgrounds (just check out all the activities listed in the index, unfortunately insufficient detail is provided for the activities as well). When I want info on area attractions I consult dedicated guide books such as Rick Steve's.As such only 1 or 2 campgrounds per area are covered (typically w/ only 1-2 sentence descriptions) and no info as to the size, quality, costs and exact locations of the campgrounds. No attempt is made to distinguish or recommend certain campgrounds; nor is any particular area covered in enough detail to give you a range of campgrounds to choose from.

It constitudes the only book published by Lee during his lifetime. It includes excellent diagrams for streaching-excercises drawn by Lee himself! However, this book is not really an introduction and it would prove non-beneficial to a beginner. There are far better introduccions to martial arts or even Bruce Lee's art and I suggest you look at the Bruce Lee Library books for that. On the other hand, this book provides a great insight into Lee's early technique and thoughts on the martial way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung Fu in a nutshell! Bravo!","review":"To the dude who said it was not good for the beginner in martial arts, I totally disagree. In fact, as a new student of Choy Li Fut gung fu and not the wing chun that bruce lee practiced this book has greatly enhanced my training and knowledge. I have the Choy Li Fut kung fu book by Doc Fai Wong and it lacks many details on footwork and punches. Bruce Lee covered the basics which are essential for mastering any style of martial art or fighting for that matter. Yes, it is not 100% complete on wing chun and martial arts like for example it never mentions chau sau (sticky hands) or weapons training but it is great way to learn how to do the correct footwork, stances and core basics. A must for Bruce Lee fans and martial artists. Get this and the Tao of Jeet Kune Do for a wonderful training aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon title misleading","review":"The only reason I gave this book one star is because the title listing on the web site is misleading.

I suddenly had to replace my 1991 Sony KV27V75 when it passed away. I really considered no other brand but Sony. Picture quality was important and I knew that Sony would deliver. But sound quality was critical as well. The FV series has superior speakers and sound as compared to the FS series. The only thing I do not like is the remote control. If you are over 40, get out your cheaters -- you will have a difficult time reading this remote. Also of note is that even though this TV has two S-video inputs, one of them is in the front. And I am not crazy about the styling - gray color and a larger cabinet than my old Sony - but it's the way most manufacturers are going these days. All in all, you can't lose with this TV. Plus, there's something about that SONY logo on the set that makes one feel a bit superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good TV...","review":"the picture is really cool, and it seems like there are multiple speakers. that i like. what i don't like is that i paid 150 bucks to get the screen flat. you can get a TV with this great picture for less. i recommend searching a little more before you choose a TV"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for indoor bb range.","review":"I suggest purchasing this for indoor bb target shooting.

We've had no problem with BB's bouncing back. I have made him use it primarily outside, however it was listed as being able to be used indoors. It is great for outdoor use and if you're extremely trustworthy, indoor use would be fine too. The only problem we see is that it would be nice to have holes to be able to mount it to a tree or other object.

I have listened to this album over 25 times and I still can't wipe the smile off my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex guitar work that is fun to listen to","review":"What I love most about this album is that it is so enjoyable for me to listen to. Even if I knew nothing about playing guitar, I could appreciate how complex of chords that MS is playing and yet, still be entertained by them. Sometimes great guitar players release recordings that appeal to only accomplished guitar players. The accomplished players like the recordings because they realize how hard it is to do what the guy is doing. However, average people completely turn off to it, because it is just not made for them. Well, with this great album, Michael Schencker has made a musically accomplished album that appeals to all. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Michael's best albums","review":"I've had this CD for a year now and have yet to grow sick of it - the album ROCKS! Great selection of lyric-less songs in a Satriani-type format. Very much like a Surfing with the Alien type of albun. The songs are well put together and really take you on a journey. And of our course the guitar playing is phenominal. I think it's his best post MSG era album since the 80's. And is personally on my top 3 favorite albums from Michael. Pop it in the player and go for a ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time great guitar players.","review":"He plays so fluidly, never shreds just to shred, every note always makes sense and fits, 3 Fish Dancing is a lesson in every type of Rock & Roll guitar playing. Don't just listen to the samples. There is no way you can get a feel for this record that way. If you like great guitar playing pony up the dough and buy this. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cool brew tea I've ever had","review":"This is the best cool brew tea I've ever had. The raspberry and lemon are the best.

I love the ease and convenience of this tea, but wish the flavor were better.

I put a bag into the bottom of a glass, put some ice on top and add filtered water. 5 minutes later it's fully brewed :) I found that Amazon has a better price on it than I can buy it for in individual boxes at the market.

It randomly fails to load games properly under DirectX 8.1, which then procede to eat system resources until the system crashes. MS has been unable to resolve the problem (and, the first time, the registration # it gave me was faulty and they wanted me to pay for support, had to re-install and get a new # before I could even get them to acknowledge my existance w/o a credit card...). Even when the games do work, they are generally poor adaptations. For much better emulation, get MAME and download the original game ROMS at www.mame.dk. Sorry for the sour grapes.

The video quality is poor (circa 1970) and there are better games available for FREE downloaded off the Internet than what this disc provides. My son (who is a very bright 6 year old) was bored after a short time, and so I played each game to see for myself. I can understand his boredom: These games, although they may have some \\"retro\\" sentimental value to adults, are not interesting to kids because the graphics and sound are primitive-looking and do not even come close to comparing to other games that are currently available to kids and are in his library already.

As you turn the last page and begin your introspective journey, you realize that this book may have been fiction, but the resultant feelings and conclusions drawn about yourself and where you are headed in life is priceless.

The battery drain when using this card (which is a microdrive) and TCPMP compared to my 512MB compactflash card and WMP is about the same.

The microdrive is exceedingly SLOW when compared with the Hitachi 4GB microdrive. I had to send the microdrive back to Seagate (at my expense) to be sent another microdive with same OLD (3.01) firmware. If you have the Canon 20D with the 2.0.3 firmware install, you will need Seagate microdrive with the 3.02 firmware. Please take note of this.

Have had no problem putting it in and taking it out or with bouncing it around in the camera or camera case (not that I use the the camera or equipment as substitute basketballs).

Meaning, the show would use the 1969 opening and yet air a 1978 episode. But yet these are not re-runs at the time of their airing...as it's been said, there were only 2 seasons worth of shows of the original program. Throughout the '70s ABC and then CBS and local affiliates would re-package Scooby shows and slap on whatever title they wanted. Anyone remember the Scooby short episodes? Ones that ran like 10-15 minutes at the most? Daphne had shorter hair and acted as a news reporter...Scooby of course was in it...Shaggy i believe wore a red shirt...and yes, Scrappy was on the show.

You can drive a varity of cars like the BMW Z8 BMW 750i and an Aston Martin. You can hold a bunch of different weapons like the Defender a powerful handgun, the traditional PP7 (silenced or non) a Sniper Rifle, and my favorite the FSU9 an M-16 with a grenade launcher. Also you can get upgrades like Golden or Unlimited ammo. This game rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?????","review":"No where near as fun and addicting as golden eye was. Multiplayer battles are a joke, levels are way to small. When you beat the game in a matter of days, you are left wondering if you really beat it, no ending, credits or anything. The only thing I liked was the new driving levels. At first it seemed like a good game but really fell short in the end. Sorry Jeff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agent Under Fire","review":"There are many positives and negatives of AUF.The positives: 1) The Q-Claw in multiplayer is devestating2) The huge arsenal of weapons and the selection of these is awesome in multiplayer3)The vehicles in single player are sweetThe negatives: 1) Bond looks like an idiot2) The storyline is hard to follow3)All of your gadgets names begin with Q (Q-Claw Q-Slicks) it sounds like its from some dumb pokemon or power rangers.AUF is generally a good game. Get it if you liked the previous Bonds because this is basically the same except for the new gadgets and weapons and the fact that Bond looks like an idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 actually","review":"First off, Bruno, Tommorow Never Dies was never released for N64, and second, the last 007 movie-based game was not TND it was The World Is Not Enough. Get your facts straight.Moving on, i have rented this game 3 times for my PS2 and i loved it. Now tht it is finally coming out for GCN im definately buying it. the multiplayer mode is by far much better than Goldeneye's multiplayer mode. But the story mode just doesnt compare to Goldeneye's. The story mode in Goldeneye is much longer and complex, while as AUF's is on the skimpy side. A high for this game is that is that driving plays a much bigger role in this one than in Goldeneye, and the grafics are much much better. This is kind of like a mix between 007 Racing for PSX and TWINE for N64 (the PSX version stinks). I say buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I would have to say over all Goldeneye is waaaaaaaay better. This game has good graphics but the plot sucks and so do the guns.

That was an amazing game. It was fun to play over and over again. The multiplayer neared perfection. Agent Under Fire on the other hand is a much less exciting Bond game. Overall the weapons aren't very cool. As other people have mentioned the game is extremely short. While Goldeneye had a great multiplayer, Agent Under Fire's is a disaster. The multiplayer levels are so tiny. It just isn't fun playing in an area so small. The BOTS are a nice addition, but it is not enough to make up for terrible arenas. I don't recommend buying this game because you will only play it once and then throw it in a closet. Absolutely no replay value what so ever. The multiplayer just plain ... I hope that the new Bond game, Nightfire, is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game I've Played In Years!","review":"This is truly the best Game Cube game out there so far. The graphics are amazing, and the story line is more involved than with Goldeneye and TWINE. Comparing this game to the PS2 version, I'd say Game Cube has much smoother animation. There's plenty of characters in this game, unlike Goldeneye, and unlike Goldeneye, they actually talk! I admit, Goldeneye has it's place in video game history, but this one is way better! I especially like the fact you see Bond reloading his guns, like in TWINE, and the fact you actually drive a car! Anyway, if you don't own it, rent it, and if you like it, by all means, BUY IT! It's a great game! *****5 STARS!*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!, but its so easy!","review":"007:Agent Under Fire is one of the coolest games because the story-line is great, the characters are pretty cool,note:(if you want Pierce Brosnan to appear, i'd stick with Nightfire),the graphics are extra ordinary and the guns are awesome, like the usually one-shot kill Frinesi shotgun. The only thing that really puts most players down is the shortness of the game, there are only 12 extremely short levels!Overall this game is pretty cool so if you like short games or you are a James Bond fan i'd buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great game!","review":"The missions are great, you get awsome weapons, high tech gadgets the best graphics, and if you complete the mission well enough you can get up to 2 cheat codes for getting a gold or platinum medal on the mission, but don't worry the game isn't that hard overall I beat it the day I got it. That makes it fun but doesn't last as long. The only drawback is the multiplayer gamemode, It's okay but the levels are extremly small and you get shot by the AI's or other players everywhere, theres nowhere to go. You can get cheats like infinite missles, golden gun, multiplayer maps, golden accuracy, gold rocket launcher, etc. This is a great game and is a must get."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet!!!!","review":"This game is the best! if you don't own it, you should! this is the best 007 yet.

Best Graphics for Bond","review":"James Bond's perfect game has 10x better graphics than any other Bond game. James Bond blows away other games and now he has the best of all the car driving. Driving the car is so awesome. The graphics almost looks like the true thing. If you have PS2 and Gamecube don't buy Agent Under Fire (AUF) for PS2, because GameCube's AUF has much better graphics than PS2. The gameplay is awesome. You have new devices like Q Laser, Q Claw, and so on. The other 007 games and Perfect Dark were the greatest for either N64 or PS, but don't have much of a chance against 007:Agent Under Fire does. Is this going to be the best shooting game ever? 007: Agent Under Fire is just as good as Halo, but Halo is for X Box and Agent Under Fire is made for most of the systems.These are the ratings in 007Gameplay:9.9Control:10Graphics: Big Time 10and everything else is 9.5 through 10.The game is going to run out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the Gamecube version!","review":"I have played this game in the PS2 and its the best James Bond game available. The new weapons and levels make a different and unique adventure. This is the first James Bond game that is not based on any movie! Amazing new story and characters make this game a must buy for any gamer. The multiplayer is filled with action and suspense. You need all your secret agent skills to defeat your enemy and win the battle. Just buy it and enjoy one of the best first person shooters out there! This game is head to head with Halo."},{"rating":"1","title":"its fun, but weak","review":"Possibly my least favorite bond game, even rogue agent is better. i don't like bonds appearance, the guns, the people, the only good things about it are multiplayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"single player= Amazining Single player. 12 missions, but it feels like there is more. The missions combine being on foot, in a car, and even in a tank!!!!!multiplayer= Multiplayer is also amazing. You can Q-claw (grapple) anywhere. The bots can be easy medium and hard. There is a lot of different games from just plain shooting to defusing bombs. The maps are gig and amazing. Plus, the mini-map is easy to read and VERY, VERY, helpful.weapons= The weapons sets is amazing. There are grenade and rocket launchers. Plus sniper rifles, grenades, pistols, photon cannons, and machine guns.Controls= The controls are annoying sometimes, but you get used to it. The only thing different from most shooting games, is the looking around controls (control stick and c-stick)."},{"rating":"2","title":"75% fun ,10 % cool charectors, 15% super cool cheats","review":"AUF is really fun however there are some let downs like the bots in multiplayer, and voice talents but overall is okay. the part i like best is the vip level in multiplayer, it is soooooooooo funny when you terminate him. and the q claw makes you spiderman/ doc ock. the bots were a let down 'cause they only allow 2. but the weapons are hecko tight. i like the fsu 4 and remote mines. overall rating 7/10."},{"rating":"2","title":"007 Agent Under Fire review by Mike","review":"I was very disapointed withe this game.

So we bought this one, and lo! We have the same problem. We can't be unlucky enough to get two coffee makers with the same problem, so we decided it must be the metal filter we use. But the same thing happens with paper filters (though less often--they're taller). So we blamed it on the size of the coffee grounds; maybe the finer grounds from our specially ground coffee clogged the filter. No, same thing happens with Folgers. We have to use perculator-size grounds to prevent the problem. That can't be right.Reading other reviews for the Hamilton Beach product, I see at least one other person has had similar problems.

That being said, it does provide some of the most original footage I've seen of the actual conditions in North Korea, and does a very good job of showing the xenophobic nature of the North Korean people. While the movie suggests that people's public display of affection for the Dear Leader may exceed their actual love of him, not a single person throughout the film shows even the slightest deviation from the official line and provide a hint that all is not perfect in the Workers Paradise and that the Dear Leader is not divine or all loving.

In keeping with the stated purpose of this series, this book attempts to bridge the gap between academic study and the life of the church. It does an admirable job of both. There is a wealth of information and discussion, but there is an impressive pastoral bent to many of the chapters.To cite one example, the chapter, I am the Resurrection and the Life; The Resurrection Message of the Fourth Gospel, is a very well-done narrative critical picture of the Gospel of John and word study of resurrection vocabulary. It is a masterful example of wedding word studies and narrative theology into an engaging whole. While this (and other chapters) is not pre-packaged sermons or Bible classes they would serve as very helpful study material for such purposes.Other chapters worthy of mention are the one on Acts by Joel Green and the one on the resurrection and the Christian life by G.

At that time my friend was diagnosed with cancer and 2 years later, my mother was diagnosed as well. Having never experienced the awful emotions cancer delivers, I had no idea what I could do to support both of the people I dearly loved. Sadly, most of what I thought was the right thing to do or say, wasn't at all what could have been really helpful. I think unless you've been there, you have no idea what cancer does to you and what you need from others to get through it. This book is an instruction guide with vignettes of the frightful battle Ms. Brown lived.

I had been a fan of the \\"... for Dummies\\" books for a while now. Unfortunately I found this one to be a disappointment. Although I can appreciate having sections on good web page design, I felt it was too much to wait until chapter 4 to code your first page. Plus, there's just too much design-based content in the book overall, and not enough of actual HTML tag-based exercises.The examples on the CD ROM are awful. They really don't give any good insight as to how the tags work. Plus, many of the example files are identical. For example, TFOOT.HTM, THEAD.HTM and TR.HTM are the exact same file. That's just inexcusably lazy. How hard could it have been to exhibit some of the attributes of those tags?I give it two stars because if you already know HTML, it can be a pretty useful reference.

I was expecting a \\"how-to\\" book with lots of worked examples. This was not it. (BTW: My 12-yr old daughter put this down even faster than I did! She wanted to know how to create webpages. This did not do it for her.)The first 4-5 chapters were boring essays on the history of the web and html. At 90 pages in length, Chapter 6 is apparently the heart of the book. This chapter is basically a HTML manual. It describes all HTML commands using a variant of BNF. Very few examples are given. There is a CD that comes with the book that supposedly contains worked examples. The few that I looked up were not detailed enough for me to infer the patterns.Chapters 7-22 were short overly general sections discussing various issues. I did like chapter 15 on navigation aids. The end material on evaluating the usability of your website was even more vague (and a lot less entertaining) than a Jakob Nielsen lecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"HTML for Dummies NOT for Dummies","review":"I ordered this book along with Web Design for Dummies expecting to get started writing simple web pages.

The story line is good, the action is decent, but the game just dosen't live up to previous Mechwarrior games. The mech lab is horrible. The player can only exchange weapons of the same type(lasers to lasers, or missles to missles, but you can not replace an AC2 with a PPC, for example), so customization is frustrating and difficult. The acting is poor, and the opening scene is boring and uninspired. The mech selection is also poor, although the new mechs are ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This game is a complete disappointment from the other Mech games. The new mechlab takes away a players creativeness by restricting the weapons a mech can carry. The controls are completely hideous.

Microsoft has taken a great line of games and completely screwed it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechwarrior made easy","review":"To me it seems more time was spent on the storyline/video recording than game development. The actors didn't say anything I really wanted to hear and it just wasn't as satisfying blowing things up as it was in MW3. Even with a good PC (Pent 4 1.4G w/all the trimmings) it gets choppy in battle.

AMS doesn't work, you can't shoot legs off, and mech modification is totally unrealistic.but if you are a novice and just want a little bit of sim action, this is the game for you. simple, easy to understand, you'll like that fact that you don't have to work.i wish they woul have just fixed the problems with the 3rd version. it was much cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"A less than average game.","review":"This game really isn't worth your time. Microsoft has gutted it. Many people may be raving about the graphics, and the story line; but honestly, the story line isn't any better than mech 3's, and what's the point of great graphics if the gameplay is horrible? Microsoft has done three things that have really destroyed this game. The most noticeable is that the mech handling has been greatly speed up. The speed at which you can turn around in this is something I would expect from a 150 pound person--not a 100 ton mech! Microsoft has also made the control system incomprehensible. The first 3 mech games were simple enough, but this one is impossible to figure out. Finally, the mech lab makes it impoosible to have any variety. The game gives you only one or two options for what you can do to your mech. This igame is not worth it--buy mech 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"beware of your processor","review":"Though I find the reviews of others to accurately describe game play and performance, there is one very big drawback to the programing- If you don't have a fast enough processor you will not get the performance.

I mean, there must be too many bad writers for TV that are out of work because of all these even more stupid reality shows - they end up writing this campy dialog for software games just to eat.

Even under the more reliable Windows 2000, I even get an occasional bluescreen or unannounced reboot.From the looks of the Event Log messages about bad blocks on the CD, I bet this problem has something to do with CD-ROM copy protection. With the ORIGINAL CD in the drive it crashes.I'm noticing more game CDs that I can't make backup copies of. It's no coincidence that those same games are the ones that crash or hang on startup (when they check for non-standard sectors on the CD, I presume).

(2) Short control-learning time - good for newbies, but I really miss some of the functionality of the old system.Con: (1) Controls are imprecise - and don't even think of using a force feedback joystick... (2) For the life of me, I can't disable limbs. (3) The storyline isn't well thought out. For example; lessor techs come by and give you basic info. If some sub-ranking tech talked to a superiour like that, they'd be dead (in the series). (4) Networked play just isn't as much fun for me with this version - I think primarily because of the second \\"Con\\". (5) Eats processors alive.

I downloaded the demo, and the graphics were beautiful, but the gameplay just wasn't as fun as 3. But I gave it the benifit of the doubt and thought the story in the full version would make up for it. I was very, very, very wrong. This has to be the most boring story ever. Not only that, the voice acting and videos are extremely boring and the actors just act like they don't care. Mechwarrior 3's voice acting was superb, everytime my commander in the MFB said something, i really made sure to listen. But geez, these guys just don't care. Plus the video quality is terrible compared to MW3, really choppy and botched colors.

Mechwarrior 3 was a true Mech simulation, this is just a flashy ... arcade game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a good game","review":"I was excited when I heard that MW4 was going to be released. It met most of my expectations. The graphics are absolutely BEAUTIFUL, with the lighting effects, smoke trails, and definately the Mechs exploding. I found the storyline ok, I found MW3's quite better, but the MW4 didn't suffer from it. I was mad when Microsoft TOTALLY changed the controls on me (why put the Mech controls in the keypad?) but that was easily fixed when I bought a joystick. And the multiplayer has been totally revamped from earlier versions, I don't know why but I find playing MW4 online a lot more fun than MW2 or 3. The only place this game lacks in is the actors, definately. I found the acting very cheesy, while in MW3 the MFB commander had a voice that would FORCE you to pay attention.But, this game gets 4 stars for the graphics and multiplayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't live upto the standard","review":"Graphic's were ok.Didn't like how they changed the keystrokes nor the fact that you have to shoot another mech 200 times to kill them..Shoot a leg off & it's still there..What gives with that?Another bothersome thing about this game are all those video's you can't bypass..On all the rest of the games just hit esc & the video stop's & you can enter into battle.But not on this game.You must endure all the [game] video's.I've played all the Mechwarrior games & this is as disapointing as Heavy Gear was.Even was a member of Clan Wolf on the old Mplayer.com mech2 online gaming site.I'm just hoping Mech4 Mercs won't be like this one is.

All the packing material had been long since thrown away so I just ate the purchase. Moral to the story - open and check the product at time of receipt. Buyer beware. Incidentally I own another pair of these and they are great. What they lack in magnification is more than made up for by the wide field of view.

I have worked as a typist for a major police department for about three years, and I am overwhelmed by the increase in juvenile crimes with time. Now I can see why!

It has a slight tropical scent to it that gives you a clean smell but does not overpower like many other colognes aimed at men. I have been commented on the way that OP juice smells by many people who say that it is refreshing and not too thick or powerfull.

Therefore, I can not do anything with the cologne. I emailed the company and Amazon my issue, yet received no response from either . I am pissed ! What do you do with a cologne that you can't get out of the bottle? Please consumers, there are many places on Amazon to buy cologne from. Take it from me, do not buy anything from this company.

In the background you get just about the entire music video and song.Okay, this is why the game is crappy. First, the game is hard to control with the PS2 controller because the buttons are sensitive and you need to push them quick. Furthermore, when you mess up the dancer on the screen doesnt mess up. No matter how good or bad you do, you watch the same CGI dance loop over and over.the 2 stars are for the good Britney CGI character, her music videos and the songs.

To me, it seemed to be footage of the WHOLE concert without any cutting. My wife and I went to this concert earlier in Milan 2004 and it was basically the same performance (same songs, props, etc.) The only difference I could tell was one song missing from the encore in Rome (he did two songs in Milan). Really a great concert by a true musician. I highly recommend this DVD.From this site it looks like the region 1 (USA) format is not available, but if you go to United Kingdom Amazon site, you will find the region 1 format available.

We just haven't gotten around to actually doing so yet. :) Believe it or not, I'd still recommend the thing -- just know you're probably going to have to fix it, and plan accordingly!

When I decided to track it down last year I found that it was based on \\"The People Stories\\" by Zenna Henderson. I had no idea! I immediately bought the book here at Amazon and LOVED it! Then, on a whim, searched for it at Youtube and the whole movie is there (for free). Yes, it is definitely a lower budget 70's tv movie but I just loved it. After reading the reviews here, I won't be buying this version but I do hope a non \\"bootleg\\", digitally re-mastered/restored version will someday be released.

This item is non-returnable in that I have already opened the box to play it and it has no visable signs of damage. It's just a bad copy.

The People (1972-USA) DVD","review":"This DVD simply cannot be a legal copy. It comes in a generic clear DVD box without artwork. The DVD media is a DVD-R.

The video was amplified to the point that it looks all washed out. The sound is awful. 2/3 of the way through the story the tape evidently broke and they restarted it with wavering audio and video from the tape that was not tensioned properly and produced continues bands of noise through the video. If you are going to make a dvd from a video at least disclose that is what it is. This mess has gone way beyond just false advertising. It is simply a fraud. 20 bucks for garbage. I want my money back. What really pisses me off is that this production by Francis Ford Coppola was truly great for the amount of money he was given. He did a great job. The purported copy of it is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story Poor Reproduction","review":"The reproduction of this movie was so poor, particularly the last third of the movie, obviously copied from VHS that it was impossible to enjoy.

I've hunted for a copy for a long time. However, the writers took a mishmash of pieces from the short stories and stitched them together like a frankenstein monster to make a series of events without any of the power and magic in the originals. Kim Darby did the best she could with what she had. William Shatner did not have any of Dr. Curtis' irascible persona to work with. And Valancy was downright creepy while Karen was a negative bystander instead of a supportive mover-and-shaker. It's way past time for this set of stories to be remade. Today's technology could make a spectacular, enchanting trilogy out of Pilgrimage, The People, and The Anything Box.

Even so, I am deeply disappointed in what arrived. A disc arrived in a clear plastic cover, with no attempt to recreate the film art. When I tried to show it to my kids, it played as a pirated second hand copy, with awful sound production. Near the end of the film there was a break to a black screen with the message \\"please wait while we start the second reel.\\" After this pause, the film did resume but with a horribly distorted soundtrack. The music was ruined, and the dialogue was out of sync with the speaking mouths. It was impossible to watch the climax.While I didn't expect a new and shiny production value, I did at least expect to be able to watch it all the way through and appreciate it for the movie it once was. This should not be sold by amazon, and no one else should buy it. Even if you are really desperate--as I was--to watch this old classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused PEOPLE","review":"For anyone who loves THE PEOPLE stories stories of author Zenna Henderson (collected inIngathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson), this tv movie is bound to be a crushing disappointment. The script mashes together more than one of Henderson's short stories, resulting less quality and less of a sense of the original stories. Don't base your decision to read Henderson's works on this movie. Worse, the script confuses the Peacenik culture of the time with the sensibly pacific culture of \\"the People\\" of the stories. While Kim Darby is a good choice for the new teacher, others aren't, eg, William Shatner and Diane Varsi (in a come-back attempt). To sum up: Wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"The People","review":"I loved this show many years ago and this is the only DVD copy I could find to buy. So, I love the story, BUT, whoever made this apparently has an old reel projector that they are taking a video from.

The move is a well done blend of the Zenna Henderson stories. But the DVD copy is terrible! To call the transfer of this film to DVD amateurish is a gross understatement. Although the first two thirds of the video is tolerable. In the last third of the movie, the music is unsteady, the sound is out of sync and the picture tends to break up. The production quality of this DVD is a terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, probably illegal reproduction","review":"I made the mistake of ordering this for my wife for Christmas as she had it on her wish list. Neither she or I had bothered to look at the reviews. It's as bad as others have said. I think someone copied this originally from film to VHS, and then to DVD. Either the first, or both copies were done by someone without the right knowledge and equipment, which leads me to believe this is probably an unauthorized copy, which should not be selling to the public.I enjoyed the story, and I think it was a nice trip back in time for my wife, but it was hard to deal with the poor quality, especially at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible kit!!!!!!","review":"this is a horrible kit. it is easier to make your own. i had to glue this about 20 times and the guide rails are way to short. also the 5/8 of an inch lines the maglev kit says to put the guide rails on are to far apart. you should not buy this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"this toy gives you the idea behind a levitated train, but it is hard to get it to work. hard to keep the train from hitting the sides, good starting point needs further development"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I thinki this is a good idea with alot to learn from it but very poor design.

I don't want to go into detailed description, but this so-called \\"toy\\" is not something a kid will play with, regardless of age. It includes several square magnets, some round magnets, a couple of rubber ribbon magnets, a nail, a couple of wooden blocks, some pieces of plastic and that's basically it. The manual includes some \\"activities\\", which basically represent instructions like \\"put magnet A on magnet B and see they repel. turn them over and now they attract. wow! now let's go to the next activity\\". All of those activities require extra stuff such as coins, bricks, sticky tape, strings, and even contact cement, which is not included in the box.Doesn't worth a dime.

We glued the tracks on a laminate floor piece, and added a long strip of tape inside each plastic guard to smooth out the section connections. The magnets are very strong. My son glued a lego base on the train wood block, and built a lego structure on top of it. It turns out quite nice. the construction skill requirement is a little high for a 8 years old. So, a lot of parent help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good upgrade over Remington base stock","review":"Mounted on 870 express supermag. This stock helped my skeet/trap shooting (though I never intended to use it for that role originally). If you end up shooting skeet/trap consider a monte carlo stock, this stock is made more for general use.Really like the grip of the hogue, the grippy rubber feels comfortable IMO. The stock behind the pistol grip is smooth hard plastic, not the hogue grippy soft rubber, probably a good thing since I get smoother cheek welds. That soft rubber is only on the pistol grip and forend.For certain shooters (like me), I was gripping my 870 express foreend way too far back on the original. With this foreend it forced me to grip with my support hand much further forward. This helps shooting quite a bit.Overall good stock. For Skeet/Trap you should look instead at other alternatives. Overall an improvement over stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shotgun stock kit","review":"It was very difficult to install. It was not like I thought it would be.

If you want there to be a point, then you are in the wrong place.These myths are quite funny, and extremely pun-y. If you can enjoy a good pun, a bit of zaniness (actually, make that three dashes of zaniness), and don't care whether the over-arching story is ever fully resolved, then you'll like these.Each story is self-contained, and yet there is an overarching... plot, if you will... that connects them. At times, it seems as though the overarching plot will never move forward. It does, but only slowly, and clearly not to any intended conclusion.Each individual plot, on the other hand, wraps itself up in a totally absurd manner in the individual volume.Oh, go on, buy them. You'll fly right through them, chuckling the whole way. Who cares if there's no point!I'll meet you at the bazaar. I've been stuck here for so long that I don't remember where I came from.

But sometimes you need more. Perhaps 62\\". Perchance, 75\\". In furtive moments, 98.5\\". Sometimes you feel like going crazy and measuring something that busts past that two-digit inch barrier into something truly lengthy.For such moments, a mere 60\\" tape measure simply will not do. Have you ever sworn you wouldn't touch something with a ten-foot pole? How would you know? Now, with the 120\\" yellow fiberglass tape measure - you can! 120 muscular inches of pure measuring power. That's like ten school-year measuring rulers, matched with the flexibility of finely-crafted fiberglass.Need to make a pair of pants for a sumo wrestler? There's a tape for that.Thank you, Fiberglass Tape Measure - 120\\" Yellow. You are my passport to a new world of measurement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, affordable measuring tape","review":"A simple product for a good price that does what it's supposed to do: measure things. 120 inches (300 centimeters) is way longer than most people will ever need; the fiberglass material is flexible and sturdy, and the markings won't fade easily under normal use. Not really much else to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you value your health!","review":"The product description failed to disclose that this TAPE MEASURE, as stated on the packaging, \\"contains LEAD & other chemicals known to ... cause birth defects & other reproductive harm.\\" Are you kidding me?

Too much manipulation here for too little reward."},{"rating":"1","title":"good and bad","review":"A relatively interesting story, but I must admit the initial chapter or 2 is so profanity laden that my wife has told me that this book must leave the house after I finish. Fortunately the language does improve considerably later in the book. I am surely in the minority, but I don't see why authors have to remind us that some junior high/high school kids curse. In this case \\"realism\\" tries to overshadow the literary benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speed of Life","review":"Jeremy Jackson does an amazing job of bringing the reader into his novel. I would find it unimagineable to believe that there is a person who can't feel in some way connected to the characters. For runners looking for a strictly running plot, you probably won't find this story to completely enrich this hope, but should read it anyways for its brilliant character development and touching story line. I'm not a runner but after reading this book I'm inspired to follow in Kevin Schuler's footsteps and live my emotions through running. This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good!","review":"In Life At These Speeds, Kevin Schuler is swept along the surface of his life: going to high school; running, winning, and breaking records; becoming a local hero; and trying to decide about college. Meanwhile, Kevin is dwelling in the depths of his forgotten past-he is haunted by emotions he cannot confront and undefined fears. His real story unfolds somewhere in between and is punctuated by memorable conversations and occurrences that are all the more poignant because they seem so true. As a reader, I became invested in Kevin Schuler because I often knew more about him than he knew about himself. Like his family and friends, I watched with care and hope to see how Kevin would decide to live. I am so thrilled for first-time author Jeremy Jackson (and for all of us) that his debut novel should be this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Addicting!","review":"I read this book in high school and couldn't put it down! I loved the style of writing the author uses. It's such an addicting story! I couldn't help but start a regular running regime after reading this! I didn't want the story to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"would have been five starts but for a slightly hokey ending","review":"This was a great story of a boy (the narrator) growing up after his track teamates (including his girlfriend) were all killed in an accident. After, he goes on to a different school district and is more or less used by the administration because of his newfound running skills. Running becomes something that makes him in the eyes of the community, and it's also something that gives him solace as he goes though the pains of high school and growing up. Part of the ending seems a little silly to me, but that didn't damage my opinion of the book overall. Very well done and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"I don't where to begin, or how to begin, to describe the feelings I have for this book. What an experience to read this book. I found myself slowing down when I came near the end, I knew I wouldn't be ready to let go. I found myself stopping after chapters and thinking about Kevin, then going back and rereading that same chapter, just to enjoy the poetry of the author's words and to revisit the place where Kevin was. I don't think I am expressing myself very well, but I havn't been touched by a book this much in a very long time, and I am not only looking forward to this author's next book, but I know I will be rereading this one. Mr. Jackson, you are a treasure.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"The writer seems too concerned with his own vocabulary, rather than giving each of his characters a unique voice. Not that the diction is meant to be over your head, but even the young children speak in an awkward, florid manner. I guess that intended to be humorous, but it mostly just got on my nerves. I also agree that the silly names were annoying, and I'm a big fan of silly names. Why is the Kenyan named Bobolink Crustacean in this dramatic book? That isn't even vaguely Kenyan-sounding.There were also parts of the book that were beyond ridiculous. I'm not even referring to Kevin's running (the best parts of the book related to running, or at least that is my biased opinion). The way that the school administrators acted was beyond childish, and it was impossible to suspend your disbelief for such whimsical occurrences.It is an interesting story, and I like the way that Kevin progresses as a character. But there are too many flaws in everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!!","review":"I'm a runner.

Later, I found that Cook's Illustrated gave this their *lowest* rating, putting it last among a large number of spatulas. Unfortunately, that's where it belongs.This is almost useless for actual cooking, although I guess it's ok if all you're doing is flipping a fried egg or something. The material is quite soft, meaning you can't scrape the sides of a bowl. Certainly if you're working with a stiff dough you won't get enough leverage. There's a piece of metal inside meant to give the Switchit some rigidity, but it doesn't extend far enough.The gimmick of having two ends to work with turns out not to be that useful--flip the spatula over and you've got whatever you were just stirring now running over your hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good vendor","review":"Ordered this item. First package received did not contain my order, but rather that of another customer. Contacted vendor. Order was replaced. Received second package. Item was not the item that was ordered.

I have several of their pieces and they are fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite kitchen tool, ever!","review":"I love this thing! They call it a spatula, which I think of more as something you flip burgers with, but whatever -- I guess I could flip a small burger with it. It's a great tool for stirring and mixing. It's great w/nonstick pans. I use it in prep and on the stove top.Others have complained that the silicone split where the metal support stops, but I've used mine frequently for over a year and see no sign of wear. I just bought a couple more for stocking stuffers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too stiff for my liking","review":"I like the concept of this easy-to-keep-clean kitchen gadget, but I found it to be too stiff for my liking.

I tried them on and was really disappointed with the lack of tailbone protection, in fact I think the padding would cause more of an injury then without padding because it causes additional pressure.

The change collection sheet light never came on and there wasn't anything really on the sheet. Well, that's until I moved into a house with a mold problem. The light goes off even before the 30 days (the house I'm living in is old so there's lots of mold and mildew) and the collection sheet is very dirty.I have a problem finding extra collection sheets for this item.All in all, it's a good price and it does pull things out of the air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Corelle","review":"I have one warning when choosing to buy Corelle: Pick your pattern carefully, because they last forever!

The music is very discordant (is that the right word?) and does not leave me feeling relaxed, just bored and irritated. Maybe this music is just the kind that doesn't resonate well with my brain waves, but I found it extremely poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one should have been the pilot for a series","review":"I loved this one about the time travelers. On the back of this cassette box the producer indicates he wrote this while on an air plane flight between shows. You'd never know it. Grace Lee Whitney (Pre Yeoman Rand) makes an appearence here. She plays the jilted partner in a bad relationship about to shoot her husband. The time travelers, (Carol O'Connor and Barry Morse) prevent all the mayhem that's about to occur. Both O'Connor and Morse would have made a good series together on this one. The stories they could have told would have been limitless.It was like Quantum Leap with a playback button. You have to see this one to know what I'm getting at here. The black and white of this series just added to the mystery. It's a good thing this was in black and white. Color would have revealed the cheesey special effects and the shadows always added to the atmosphere. Most of us know this was done to save money and production costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfunny","review":"I expected a funnier season. Most of the stories I found boring and annoying. I don't know, maybe I just get older. KITH were still young and had a lot of freedom to do any stories on any topic. That's cool when you are young. I think season 1,2 were much better. All of them are older now despite that seasons seem still fresh. I wonder if they would still do same episodes or they would cut some of them out now. Mark McKinney is my favorite kid in the hall and it's a fact (though \\"It's a fact girl\\" segments got on my nerves)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great comedy&#65533; poor value&#65533;","review":"The other reviews are absolutely correct; the Kids in the Hall are astounding.

Mark Haskell Smith winds us on a twisty trail/tale through the Mexican underworld of LA, following slacker Bob as HE follows a severed arm that belongs to a Mexican mafioso who wants it back.Really good sex scenes (steamy and goodnaturedly perverse) are juxtaposed with some of the funniest ones you'll ever read--I found myself rooting for everyone to succeed in this comic caper: criminals, innocents swept up by them, the unlucky LAPD cop who is assigned to bring them down. Nobody acts in a particularly despicable way unless Smith has already taken us into their (sometimes marijuana, sometimes mescal-influenced) musings so that whatever we see them do next seems as logical as it is loony. Smith obviously has great love for his characters, and you will too!Overall, a fun read for the slightly twisted reader out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your drill","review":"I attached my heavy duty drill to this thing and turned one small chess piece and my drill burnt up.

On his trip around the country, he speaks to so many people, all of whom seem to feel *very passionately* about the issues they're discussing. At times I was shocked by the anger of people I would've stereotype as peaceful, and amazed at the quiet ernestness of people I would have stereotyped as pure fury. (Not that I advocate stereotyping ;o) I really felt like I was there, watching these conversations, and I wanted more . . .

They didn't even put enough thought into it as to have a standard cinder block fit on it. You will be breaking one up to make it fit, or find yourself at the hardware store looking for smaller ones to fit the platform. Even then, it doesn't seem to really dig into the ground well, even after watering. This is probably because it's more of a rolling motion than a downward motion. Sounds like a good idea, but not when it's put into practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use a Nail Instead","review":"I bought this with some hope that it would break the matting on turf grass, I wasn't even looking for aeration. This product is useless for either endeavor. A cinder block lacked the weight to punch through the grass. I modified the unit by welding two rods to the plate so I could attach weights. Started with 30lbs and still didn't work. At 60 lbs the unit worked but you could imagine pulling that weight around. This thing has a few design problems - if you pull it, you are lifting its weight off of the ground. If you push it, you might as well use no weight at all, your body acts as the weight. You will be guaranteed some exercise with that approach. Oh, I even tried sharpening the blades with a grinder.

Plastic between spikes breaks immediately, the sides plow into the turf, and the handles are impossibly made for pushing unless you want to break your wrist every 3 seconds that the thing gets stuck.Also mislabled because concrete blocks are neither heavy enough nor stay on without 40 bungee cords--being solid, they also bounce around too much.

It's a cross of pinball and the arcade shooter HOUSE OF THE DEAD. You kill zombies walking around a pinball machine with the ball. It's easy to learn, fast fun! Good for a 10 minute break or an hour of smash em up time killing. The game is a little dark for the normal GBA, but the SP handles it very well. The graphics are good, and I liked how the zombies explode into a bloody mess. It's violent pinball, and very twisted and fun.

Just as they are to make their escape the enemy foils it etc.,etc. They even rip off a line word for word - \\"we found the men , but I wish we hadn't\\".

Another example of how Warner Bros. had no idea how to use Cooper during his six picture deal from the late forties to the early fifties.

Now, I'm not saying the NFL Blitz games are bad games (most of them anyway, the recent GBA game is horrible), but you should take any other version of a Blitz game; whether its on PS1, PS2, Dreamcast, N64, Gamecube, or XBox; over this any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is fun but needs a graphics makeover!","review":"This version of Blitz for Game Boy Color is very good. The controls are easy to use and it is all explained in the manual. The scenes that show up with the scoreboard are entertaining (for example, there is one where the QB rides a bomb). These touches make Blitz 2000 for GBC a good game. However, the graphics are only so-so. The players resemble blobs at some angles. There is a good part about the graphics, too.

Actually if you are wanting to choose one to settle down with I'd highly recommend making your decision based upon whichever method your Electronics program uses. For example this publication allows you to take a fact sheet on an electronic device and use the published data in order to calculate the circuit.

I ordered 2 battery so I could keep a spare charged and ready. One of the batteries was bad so Amazon replaced it at no charge or hassle, but now one of the pins for the CF card docking stations is misaligned. If one is not careful when inserting the card, the pins can easily be bent. In all of my camera's and card readers, the pins are recessed deep enough to keep the card aliened while inserting it. The Foci's pins are placed too shallow in the slot allowing the card to go in at an angle bending the pins.

From a sitar on \\"Sublime\\" to the bond-esque \\"Ain't Got Nothin\\" to the wa-wa guitar and horns on the soul-influenced \\"What's The Deal\\", this is just a great trip-hop album without too much club looping or drum machine reliance. I like that they use 'actual' instruments in the mix... gives the music more flavor and texture. And they finish off with a great dance beat in \\"Under the Gun\\".I would also recommend \\"Lazy incorporated\\" by Lazy. They don't have this CD at Amazon, but you can listen to it at CDBaby.com (or iTunes). After SBOL disolved, two of the members formed Lazy. Their new vocalist really has a sultry touch and the groovy songs will cause you to smile and \\"chair dance\\" while driving.

Yes there are sonic similarities to Morcheeba and Portishead, neither of whom I like, but it's less dark and samey than either and has heaps more soul and verve. Someone even mentioned Yello - good grief I hadn't noticed it but it's true. But this band are more than a collection of influences, they've found their own voice on this one.

Lord, was that a mistake.Now, it's not all bad: it's just so easily forgettable. What did 'Sublime' sound like? Hell if I remember. How about 'Golddigger'? I only recall an annoying woman repeating the words 'gold digguh' and wanting to flip to the next track.The disc is way too short, too: 45 or so minutes? Give me a BREAK! There's a half hour of unused space on this disc, people. Talented artists can, do, and WANT to fill it all.The songs are too poppish and shallow to be anything more than background noise. If you're looking for weak music to cover up the dead air of your boring party, here you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't Nothin New","review":"SBL sounds like a very much calculated and formulaic slick studio production. The guys aim high but unfortunately they don't have the substance that is necessary to make it happen. Although each track on this album is individually fun to listen to, when you listen to the entire album you can't help but think of other bands who had been in these waters before.It is almost impossible to talk about a band identity so the album very quickly becomes boring after a few spins. I'm not sure how far anybody can go by simply creating hollow stylish tunes. To me they sound like they're gonna jump on to the next trend train and have a drastic sound shift in their second effort. After all music business is all about making cash !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starbucks Music","review":"Yes, I confess: I bought this at Starbucks. The barrista was too slow with my double short latte, and my tired brain succumbed to the Schultz marketing machine. They had a kiosk with cds and headphones.It DID sound pretty good with the cheap headphones at the coffee shop - laid back, with a James Bond twist. When I listened to it closely, I heard a singer with no emotion, no range, and fake attitude, trying (and failing) to sound like the best of Morcheeba, insipid lyrics, and silly annoying hooks. I thought maybe it would grow on me, perhaps if I didn't listen too hard. Whoever said you can get used to anything was wrong.There are lots of solid trip hop cds.

This is probably quite true and Supreme Beings definitely have got style. This is about as good as it gets in this vein and I've never heard any band that deserved 5 stars except maybe the real originators of this type of music, Yello, back in the 80's. Remember them? Supreme Beings have got it together in all departments. From that oh so sexy voice to the great grooves and James Bond theme music guitars, this is a cd that is fun and musical. And, for the poster that thought the Presence cd, 'All Systems Gone', was better, I think not. This one far exceeds that low-key, underacheiving sound that is so, so, ruthlessly hip in Londontown."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent even though a bit derivative","review":"OK, so I won't argue that SBL isn't a bit derivative, especially of Portishead, but despite this, they sound great. Nothing wrong with putting your own spin on a genre. I mean, how many blues artists are out there playing very similar music but who are good in their own way. It's the same thing with SBL and their spin on the genre is that their music is eminently more danceable to than others to whom they're being compared. The melodies are catchy, with a great beat and the various \\"world music\\" riffs thrown in just make the tunes more interesting to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I absolutely love this CD. It has a permanent spot in my 5 disc changer. A lover of jazz and techno, this really hits the spot for me. Unlike quite a few albums in this category of music, each song is unique on this album. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and compelling . . .","review":"This is an extraordinary band! It's too bad people seem to have this inherent urge to classify and compare everyone because SBOL wears so many more hats than just one! Call them groove, trip-hop, drum/bass, dance, electronica, pop, what ya will, but (to quote Dan Bern) if you must put 'em in a box, \\"make it a BIG box.\\" It's rare to hear a group that takes such an eclectic variety of sounds and influences and fuses them together so successfully. They take a rap background, add compelling base, gritty guitar licks, amazing programming and sampling talent, futuristic effects, and then float one of the most seductive and unforgettable female voices I've heard in years over the top of it all. So instead of listening to everyone buzz about who they do or don't sound like, pick up the disc, put on your dancin' shoes, and celebrate in the ingenuity and originality of this talented band. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice way to start off the millenium!","review":"This is an awsome debut c.d., and one hell of listen! It sounds very Portishead-ish, but without the valium! Smooth, and creamy, nice enough to eat! You 'need' to own this...you really do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laid-back chill-out perfection","review":"The \\"chillout compilation\\" boom in the UK has somehow stupidly missed out on this fantastic group. I don't see why. The music has a relaxed, mellow groove but is never tired, boring, or worn out. Comparisons to Portishead can only be made by someone who didn't actually listen to the album. They are nothing like Portishead. Their music is slow, dirgy, and clunky, while Supreme Beings of Leisure is as light and effortless as a gentle summer breeze. There are obvious trip-hop influences there, as well as eastern influences...one song contains a very cool sitar hook...and it all seems to blend together effortlessly. If I had to make a comparison, I would compare them to Morcheeba, Thievery Corporation, Zero 7, or Bent. If you like any of those groups, it's pretty much a sure thing that you will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great driving music!","review":"I love this CD. It takes a while to grow on you, but it's really fantastic. I love Never the Same and Under the Gun and Strangelove Addiction (the best track, in my opinion. I don't know what the other reviewers are on). I suggest listening to the audio samples Amazon offers, then see what you think. But this is definitely one of my favorite CD's. As I said before, it's great driving music. Got a good beat and some fun lyrics. Not intellectual, just fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the coolest album","review":"This group is soooo cool and smooth - I am amazed they have not hit it bigger yet.

The girl, however, can sing. The hooks, particularly, in \\"Never the Same\\" and \\"Golddigger\\" are truly addictive, in that you can't wait to hear them again. To \\"hmmmm, heard it before...\\" I'd like to know where? Geri Soriani-Lightwood's got the most tantalizing style of any singer in this bag and I've heard them all! I'll take style over substance when, let's face it, in this genre style is substance. As for originality, I absolutely agree with \\"mind altering\\" that they \\"tear through the artists that originated this style\\" although I may have said that they \\"cruise past them\\". Musicians and people who enjoy a groove will love this and we'll leave the musicologists and purists to sort out its \\"originality\\". I can't wait to hear more from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I've had this record for 5 years now, and have listened to it countelss times. Usually, after that many listens, a record will fall off of my list, but this remains my favorite top #1 record in my life, replacing Pink Floyd The Wall, which had occupied that position for the 20 years before.The quality of the songs, recording, mixing, and performing are right up there with the tops of any genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This c.d, no joke, is THE BEST CD I OWN.

Come to find that that's the only one on the album I listen to without having to think of other artists. This band is experimenting in familiar territory. One song is a dead ringer for Madonna, the next is like Erika Badu, etc. We're in a decade of copycat music, it seems, and this album is no different then what you've heard before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"This album is the definitive deal closer. A must for any elitist reveling in frosty martinis and Japanese Minimalism should go squarely between Lamb and Portishead in your DownTempo section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy Lounge Feel with Jazzy Coolness","review":"I feel ten times cooler, and I feel like my house is a jazz lounge when I put this CD on. Truly inovative music. The female vocalist is amazing, and adds soul to the already very soulfull tunes on this disc. This CD defines modern cool. I find this music top have similarities to the drum and bass sytle of LTJ Bukem on his Earth series, just add vocals. I highly recomend it to anyone who loves jazz or electronic music. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA vibing","review":"Supreme Beings of Leisure's debut embodies sweet cool. Their music is brimming with a sunstreaked, breezy vibe.

They start off promisingly with the dreamy opening track, but the slow, ethereal sounds get old fast, especially since the melodies aren't strong enough to hold much interest. Griffin was never the world's greatest tunesmith anyway, and here his slight songs get lost in a vaguely psychedelic C&W haze, like the Byrds on Quaaludes. I wanted to like this, but in truth it bores me to tears. The pseudo-spiritual lyrics don't help. The pedal steel work is very nice, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great game","review":"It's fun,but if you have it for N64,forget about getting it for game boy.

You can get passed the first levels easily, but it gets harder as you progress and even if you hit the button when you are supposed to, the computer doesn't register it. This game is boring, too.

My daughter played with it maybe four times since she has had it. All you do is press the A and B buttons over and over and over and over again . I tried to save what my daughter did with the code and this didn't work either. What good is a game when there barely is any challenge? The other part of the game was Britney puzzles.This was boring.

I was stupid to buy this game. I had 30 bucks saved up, so I went out and bought Britney's Dance Beat. It had to be the worst purchase I have ever made! 95% of the game is pressing the A and B buttons as the little spinner goes over the designated letter. Even if I did press it, as someone else said, the game did not register it. It got annoying and boring to sit there for 3 mintutes pressing the A and B buttons over and over and over and over again. You couldn't even watch her dance until the replay. By the time the replay came, I was bored out of my mind. What good is a game when there barely is any challenge? The other 5% of the game was Britney puzzles. Boring. The only thing worth the game was the short clip of Britney singing \\"Overprotected\\" live. And that was lip-synched.

Also no irritating oders.I feel I have noticed a slight improvement in my skin's tone and the size of my pores after 2 months of using. My skin is definatly softer.

I check now and it is only $275!!!! I can see why it is one third of the price. It is ugly, and it says Mountain Dew on it. Who would want something that says Mountain Dew on it instead of Xbox? Also, for any of you who thought it was a 360, it is not. Mountain Dew gave these units away for free when they had the \\"look under you cap thing\\"!! It is worth 1 cent. It comes with a black S controller. Shouldn't it come with a green controller to match it?

Jenkins does a great job piecing together the story from letters, court records & scattered oral history. The first half of the book is a lot of adventure & was hard to put down. The second part included a lot of lawyer-speak in court, but it wasn't overdone. This is a great example of manifest destiny at work. After reading the epilogue of \\"Bloody Falls...\\", I've come to the conclusion that neither the Catholics nor the Eskimos won! ps. All of Jenkins' books are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arduous!","review":"So many hardships! Starvation, traditional hatred between cultures, weather, terrain - almost anything could kill you.

GOOD LUCK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zeonic Front Review","review":"This game is difficult at first. My first point of the is is that It is nothing like J2J. Controls are much different. This game is like Rainbow 6. If you played this game, you should have an idea what this game is like. This is not for the average game player since a lot of thinking and stragety has to be used to play this game. So if you want this game go ahead and get it but If you don't like stragety type games, then let it sit on the shelf and collect dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Too Hard","review":"I've had this game for about a year and I LOVE it! It's fun,challenging, and long. But it's a bit too hard. Like on mission 6. One hit from that mobile suit's beam rifle and BOOM! How are you supposed to fight something like that?

I felt the book was pretentious with the vocabulary also. I had to check out the meaning of words with the dictionary and prefer to read authors who don't try and impress or show off their vocabulary. I spent much of my reading time flipping past pages as the sex portions did not add anything to the book. I am sorry that I ordered three of her books for my kindle. In the future I will read an author before I go ahead and keep ordering. (the price was good; but not worth the money on this book) The review of the book did not indicate all that sex, instead it appeared to be a good read. There are too many books out there that have fast paced stories that are enjoyable and I will stick with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read and a super find of a new author!","review":"Typically I shy away from trade paperbacks because of the added expense, but I took a chance on this book because of the beautiful colors in the cover. Lame, I know, but this time the eye candy choice paid off. This is a snappy romantic suspense story with interesting leads and well developed secondary characters. It takes place in a new setting--a food television network!--but seemed authentic and believeable. As a mystery there are the red herrings strewn along the path but the powerful romance between the two leads is what drives this story and makes it worthwhile. The sensuality between the couple is slow started and continues all the way to the epilogue with a steaming scene to end the book. I am excited to find an excellent book and new author to recommend. Now--on to find her back cataloge books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for the clean minded","review":"I was hoping that this author was good but was shocked. The reason I bought these is because the titles were interesting.

I deleted all of her books from my kindle and am very sorry I even paid a penny for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best is the title song at the end","review":"The introduction of this movie looks interesting: Several couples from different ages want to experience sex. The cast features sexy and beautiful girls. However, at the middle of the picture, gets bored as they talked and talked with no action at all. Nothing happens, and at the end, leaves uncertain: What this movie about?The best: the title song (sung at the end of the movie), and Carolina Cano (who played Alexa in this movie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!!!!","review":"This deals with four Peruvian couples dealing with sexual matters. The problem is that it's not very sexy at all. It's boring too.I love the age and gender diversity here. However, this movie only uses European-phenotyped actors. I hear that Peru is full of brown people of Inca and other indigenous descent. This lack of ethnic diversity frustrated me greatly.\\"The Big Chill,\\" \\"Parenthood,\\" \\"The Woman's Guide to Adultery,\\" and countless other films have ensemble casts dealing with everyone's favorite topic. And they all do it better than this work.Don't get me wrong: I didn't hate this work.

However, when I tried to buy them in bulk, I was disappointed. The picture is not an accurate representation of what is actually delivered.

Durling's book, however, was dumped to the Kindle without the slightest regard for the fact that the Kindle's \\"page\\" size has nothing to do with the page size of the original -- in fact, of course, the Kindle doesn't even have a fixed \\"page\\" size. So, what do you get in the Kindle version? You get 30 lines of English followed by 30 lines of Italian, then 30 more lines of English, and so on. How this will break on your Kindle screens is completely arbitrary. For the Kindle, the text needed to be re-organized and it just wasn't. A quality version of Inferno on Kindle would be most welcome, but this isn't it.Save your money. This is the worst, most incompetent Kindle transfer I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durling's trans is great: beware the current Kindle rendition","review":"Some day, soon I hope, the providers of e-texts will begin to respect the wonderful books they deliver to us. Poetry is often disgracefully rendered. This exceptional 5-star translation by Robert Durling (I have the print version) is now an e-text dump, not an e-book. My Kindle can make no sense of a facing page translation with notes. What a shame. I would love to have this on my reader. Be sure to try the sample first. I look forward to a corrected version."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY NOW.","review":"Dante's *Il Commedia* is the greatest thing ever written.

Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynical, Mediocre account of the Captain's life","review":"A decent recapping of the events of the Captain's life, with little real insight, except that the author seems to want to write an expose. At times the criticisms are justified, but more times than not the jabs come off as petty, unsubstantiated, naive or tortuously rationalized from the available material. The glass is always half-empty, even if it takes half-truths to get there. One consistent theme is that Cousteau deliberately deceived the public, an interesting assertion since Munson's source for this is Cousteau's own published writings. The book spends as much time on family squabbles as ocean exploration, as if Kitty Kelly hit the water, pen in hand. There is a fair amount of information here, good if you are a Cousteau fan hungry for a few new tidbits about your hero. Beyond that limited audience the book has little appeal. The writing is competent but uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game [is bad]","review":"This game totally [is bad]. I played it for 2 ours and it got boring. It is so dumb.

I kept playing it. I got to the third level and just realized it was not a good game. It is hard and the music is horrible. I would recommend Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 over this any day. I don't think you should get this game. Save your money. The levels are dumb, the graphics are ok, the music and sound is horrible, and the story line is lame. It is just like any other sports game, where you have objectives. The objectives are really dumb. The board doesn't go as high as you would think. It is like a few inches from the ground. I thought I would be able to fly with the character. Doesn't turn out that way. The mobility is not too good. The game seems a bit old, too.
