I bought this several months ago so I am sorry I can't tell you exactly what the difference is.What I can tell you is is that the new foil cuts much closer. So much so that I swapped them a few times to be sure, maybe it was the older one was worn but still I noticed it right away and hadn't before when replacing older foils.The other difference was that I was unable to get the new foil to work with the cleaning system until I moved it around in the cleaner a bit. Also, when I removed the razor from the cleaner it had taken some of the finish off of the razor up by the foil. Not that I care about that or that the foil is a different color, its the results that count and I will continue to use the 7000's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand new razor again!!!","review":"Brand new razor again!!!Brand new razor again!!!!Brand new razor again!!!Brand new razor again!!!Brand new razor again!!!Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"Order was completed and shipped right away, will order from this vendor in the future.

Manual brushing can reduce soft tartar but has no effect on the hardened plaque that causes gums to recede and teeth to develop cavities.You should continue flossing and brushing manually 3 times a day, gently, for short periods of time. At the end of the week, brush and floss first, than carefully run the Braun plaque remover over of your teeth the same way your dentist does when he's cleaning them. Don't use toothpaste because that will only reduce the cleaning effect. If you use this product regularly, your plaque build-up will be much less of a problem, resulting in healthier teeth and gums, and less agony at the dentist's office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every day, feel like you just went to the dentist","review":"It's true -- I just received this a week ago, and I've used it every morning and night, and not only do you feel as if your teeth have just been professionally cleaned (without the nausea induced by swallowing the chemicals), plague does not build up on your teeth throughout the day.

The heroine, young Arvay Henson, is convinced she will never find true love and happiness, and defends herself from unwanted suitors by throwing hysterical fits and professing religious fervor. Arvay meets her match, however, in handsome Jim Meserve, a bright, enterprising young man who knows that Arvay is the woman for him, and refuses to allow her to convince him otherwise. With the same passion and understanding that have made Their Eyes Were Watching God a classic, Hurston explores the evolution of a marriage full of love but very little communication and the desires of a young woman in search of herself and her place in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun 5000/6000FC- Not good","review":"I am not happy..The replacement one does not work good...It does not shave clean..you have to use it 2-3 times...where as original one took one time shave...I guess afer wasting my 29$...I'll have to reinvest in a new electric shaver.Braun 5000/6000FC- XP 31B Flex Integral Foil/Cutterblock Replacement Pack, Black"},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun 5000/6000 FC -XP Flex foil and cutter","review":"I am not sure this is the right foil for my shaver.

I expected the Samsung to be even better, but this is definitely not the case. Sitting in front of the monitor, it's wonderful. Very bright and sharp running at the native resolution. But, stand up and the brightness and contrast rapidly drop off. The horizontal viewing angle isn't as bad, but it noticably drops off as well. With the Dell, it looks nearly the same from even extreme viewing angles.Bottom line, I agree with the consensus that this is a great monitor for the price. I would likely buy it again. Just realize the difference between this and a display like the Dells with 178 degree viewing angles--if you have to have that, pay the extra premium."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Samsung customer service","review":"My one star is not because this is a bad monitor, but because Samsung will not stand by their product and warranty claims.

I will buy from DealStop again.I originally bought one of these brand new off the shelf a couple of years ago...and it's such a great monitor, that I didn't really want to bother getting anything else when I decided I wanted to run dual monitors. If you look out there at current monitor models, the only real advantage to getting a new one is a higher contrast ratio.

The cleaning cartridges last a good 5 months or so. Now to the shave. It is great...close and fast and a joy to use. Very comfortable on the skin. The LCD even tells you when to oil the head (just place a drop of machine oil on your finger and let the razor run as you slide your finger over the head). And, wonder of wonders, the part number for the replacement head is even included in the display. No more fishing out the owner's manual every 12 months. I really cannot say enough good things about this shaver, and I have owned them all. But now I would never own another.

Imagine never having to brush whiskers out of your blades again! It even leaves the shaver smelling nice, and is self-oiling. I have no idea how it works, but all you do is set the shaver inside and in a few minutes every whisker is automatically removed and the thing looks brand new -- without having to tap the head in your sink or brush anything.The shave itself is excellent. Of course it's not as good as a blade (no shaver is), but it's a heck of a lot easier and cleaner than lathering up every day.My only minor complaint is that the replacement cartridges are a tad expensive (about ($$$) a month if you self-clean every day... although you certainly don't need to clean it daily). I guess that's really not that bad, especially if you compare it to razors.Anyway, in spite of that very minor flaw, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"two thumbs down","review":"i wish i had back my old panasonic. the braun syncro cleaning system is nice, but not worth the poor shave the razor offers. i have owned my braun syncro for over a year now and am disappointed with the shave. the razor ignores hairs every once and a while (especially if they are longer from not shaving for a day or two) in random locations and is unable to give a decent shave under the chin and around my adam's apple. since i started using the braun system i have also had problems with in-grown hairs. this is a problem i never had with my old electric razor. even though i like the idea of a self-cleaning razor it is of little benefit when the razor doesn't give you a decent shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to blades","review":"This was an expensive razor, my first electric. I read alot of reviews and was expecting a good product based on what I read and the amount of money I paid. Boy was I wrong. The razor simply does not cut hair close to the skin. If you attempt to get close to the skin, you will get the hairs, but you will also get a bad nick on your face.An acceptable shave with this razor takes just as long as it takes me to get a good shave with a good news 2 blade razor.

Luckily I got my money back in full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"My Braun 7570 arrived yesterday. I owned a Braun electric razor many years ago and was disappointed with it, so I quickly went back to shaving with a blade. I recently decided to give electric razors another chance and following some research, I ended up buying another Braun. After my first shave, I noticed two things: (1) electric razors seem to have improved over the years in terms of their ability to provide a close shave, but not by much; (2) my Braun \\"Clean & Charge\\" unit was broken and will probably have to be replaced. Apparently some flimsy rubber part inside the shaver receptacle has broken off or was missing in the first place.You would be best advised to stay away from this razor but if you are determined to buy one, you probably won't find a better price than Amazon.com's.

It all sounds good, but it doesn't deliever when you need a shave. It took on average about 10 minutes for me to shave with this \\"shaver\\". I would have to dig into my face and under my chin for it to actually work. I used it for about 9 months, that's right, 9 months. At first I figured it was a bad shave because my face need to adjust from my old electric razor to this new Braun. Then I thought I was shaving incorrectly. I did everything in the manual, shaved before showering, then I tried after, etc. Nothing worked. So finally a few days ago I sent Braun.com a message telling them how bad it is and then called me and are having me send this piece of [junk] back to them so they can send me a refund.

I shouldn't have. The shave that I get from the Braun is much less smooth than from the Norelco (although a regular safety razor like a Mach 3 beats them both by a decent margin, regardless of what the ads say). This one has a fancy electronic cleaning system that requires buying a cleaning cartridge every month or so. It still doesn't seem to be any cleaner than the Norelco, which just needs to be washed. I find myself having to shave the same areas of my face over and over and over to get a semi-reasonable shave. Trust me, just buy the 6885XL instead, and you most likely won't be disappointed.

The recipes were very well done and I did find great relief from menopausal symptoms. However, while traveling I relied on several \\"portable\\" flax seed foods for my daily \\"portions\\" for estrogen. Shortly thereafter, I was found to have a very irregular heart beat. I have no history of heart problems and, in fact, am an athlete. Research into flax seed showed that more than 2 ounces or 60 grams a day should not be taken internally. It can cause increased respitory rate, gasping, staggering, or convulsions. In early history, it was used as a heart medication - indicating a heart link. There is no warning in the book and in fact, the book encourages higher doses. Please use extreme caution in using these flax seed foods. Use only small amounts per day. There are beneficial amounts (very low doses), but it is toxic in small amounts as well if consumed regularly. There are no warnings on the flax seed bags in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"RV sink saver","review":"Fits our RV sink perfectly. However, watch out for tomatoe sauce.

I was looking for a good quality outdoor ping-pong table, which would be easy to put together, and this one seemed just what I wanted as a present for my husband. What I overlooked, its WEIGHT! Not only we could not put it together, the two of us were not even able to move it at all. Also, we realized, there was no way we could have rolled it on the grass and put it on our lawn, as we planned, especially because of all the rain we've got here in Albany area the soil was a mess. The table's weight will definitely need a more sturdy surface. COSTLY mistake, since we had to call Amazon and send the table back for a steep shipping cost. Amazon was good and arranged a pick-up, but because the mistake was ours, we had to pay for the return. So, if you have a good paved spot and a team of heavylifters, this table maybe for you.

The illustrations are eye-catching, the colours are bright, the paper is thick and glossy, and the book is a nice size for parent and child to read together at bedtime. My child has no interest in math, and I found that appealling to her more imaginative side as this book does sparked her curiosity. The method the author has used to pique children's interest in solving basic mathematical problems is creative and engaging.The reason I have given this book 4 stars rather than 5 is that after going through the book twice or three times and, more importantly, solving the problems, the book no longer held my child's interest. It has been sitting on the shelf untouched for months."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I loved this product, until my 2yr old son unscrewed the maraca. I was worried he had swallowed some, because he is the type of child to put things in his mouth. The balls are made of steel. I called the company to ask them. I had a difficult time cleaning up the metal balls. There are about 30 of them in each maraca and are about a mm in size. I didn't even see them at first. I actually took the second maraca and busted it open (it took one good hit on the floor for me to open it) to see what I was looking for.Though the steel balls are not toxic, poisin control said that I should take my son to the Dr & get him an Xray.. The doctor said if the Xray came back positive they would do a led test on him in two weeks, to make sure the balls didn't have led in them. We would also have to monitor him to make sure they passed....I would not recomend this product for any child..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for a child - do not buy","review":"My son loved these maracas. They are attractive looking, and they are fun to use. However, one day we began to notice that there were little metal pellets lying around the house. We couldn't figure out where it was coming from, until one day, we caught him unscrewing the maraca and dumping some shiny metal pellets out. The company is using metal pellets to make the sound. This concerns me, because it was very easy for him to unscrew; he simply had to hold the base with one hand and turn the head of it with the other. We had to throw them away. I really wish the company would make the maracas with more solid construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy killed Baenoo!","review":"I got this along with the bongos for my 2 year old daughter, Baenoo, and she cracked the maracas in 2 minutes, spewing little metal balls everywhere!

Given that, except for Waylon, these Old Dogs can't get record labels to roll over for them, it's disappointing that this heavily marketed effort isn't better. The blame, in my opinion, rests soley on Shel Silverstein's silly shoulders. With only a couple of exceptions, this is a weak bunch of songs. Reed and Jennings have written far better material on their recent outtings, and this one could have benefited by some of their talents. \\"Nashville is Rough on the Living\\" and \\"Me and Jimmie Rogers\\" are fine songs. But, Bare's cut them before -- and with more elan, too.

Well, a sticky non-stick pan kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? So to me that is not the definition of dishwasher-safe.That being said, my roommate forgot my instructions and put it in the dishwasher soon after I bought the pan. Argh!

It would have been nice to have had some stereographic projection and phase diagram problems just to name a few.

We play very intense, mostly night time games in an urban environment occasionally involving hand to hand combat. For our purposes the flashlight looks nice and works well for room clearing but gives away your position when outside, the laser doesn't work, the sling breaks but can still be used, the removable handle sits in the box, and the gun is very accurate and works well with .12 gram bbs and leaves good welts from close range. The collapsible buttstock is great for close quarters combat but I have learned from personal experience that it can easily break, especially in hand to hand combat. Take care of this gun and it will take care of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund, please.","review":"The gun is durable and lightweight. However, it is a spring powered gun.

The problem is the lever used to caulk the gun, when you pull it back, the cheap plastic piece just beaks off. All three broke in the exact same spot, just a really poorly made guns. The company Airsplat who sells these are even worse that the gun, do yourself a favor, if you buy an airsoft gun, don't order it from Airsplat.I also ordered some AEG guns from another company as well, they worked awesome and are still working. My advise to anyone buying AirSoft guns, the less moving parts the better. Don't buy a gun that requires caulking anything, get the electric/automatic style guns, they seem to work a lot better. We had several kids who had guns that required caulking them, and all but 1 broke, all the kids who had electric/automatic guns they never broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"M16-A4","review":"This gun is a great gun, when i first got it it was very easy to assemble and it was very powerful.

We told him he needed to save his allowance and pay for it himself if he wanted a gift so soon after Christmas. He searched the web for several weeks until he found this gun. He begged and I finally relented since he had waited a sufficient amount of time and had saved his own money. There were several issues immediately. This cheap piece of cr@p will load a pellet into the chamber on rare occasions, and you'll never know when it will fire. In addition, the laser light was broken and has never worked. Instructions are in Chinese so good luck figuring that out. Tell your children this is a single-shot rifle (if you get lucky and it happens to fire), it's deceptive and has a lever for single shot and multiple shot, but it does not work in that manner. This thing is built cheap, VERY flimsy. DO NOT BUY THIS! Buying this is equivalent to flushing your money down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless POS","review":"This is a worthless toy. The ad says its made of steel and electric but when we got the guns they are just plastic and they are NOT electric. They are spring and you have to cock it for every single BB.

Once I got this product for my son, the red flags went off. The package, from China. The writing, in chinese. The english translations, not properly translated. The gun arrived with no laser. The gun is not a semi-auto, nor is it an auto, even though it has a moving switch for those. It has single spring loaded rail that holds about 5 or 6 bb's. You can put the rest of the bbs in the magazine, but it's just for storage. You have to pull a tab each time you want to fire. When your spring is empty, you have to pull the magazine out, shake it, and pray you get more bb's in the rail. It is that bad. It is a beginner gun alright, if you are a 5 year old.Not worth packaging for a refund or even talking with the person that actually sells this garbage. There.

All the attachments are there and easy to build. Includes a strap & 50 BB's. The strap is although small and not for guys that are for 5 foot or bigger and it is easy to brake. With the laser, you need to adjust it by turning the knob at the end, so it can be zeroed, but it won't be zeroed for all distances so keep that in mind. The sight is small so if you want you could buy a sight and put it on, though I don't know if it will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gun","review":"This gun is probaly one of the best spring begginer guns. It shoots around 300 fps with .20 bbs and it goes up to 125 ft. It does not have adjustable hop up but with .2 bbs it shoots very straight and accurate. I do not recomend using .12 bbs, they are horrible....it goes at most 50 ft and then goes straight up into the air. The fore grip is a little wiggly but that doesn't matter so much and if it realy bothers you, you could just put a screw into it. I've had this gun for about a year now and it still shoots great. Only 1 time it got clogged up and i just had to take it apart to fix it but it still worked great. The mag is prety anoying to load bbs but its not that bad wen you get used to it.....i recomend buying extra mags.Overall this gun is great and i have no complaints"},{"rating":"1","title":"hey buddy","review":"that kid that says hes an expert at airsoft is so wrong. i know what im doing and you buddy are a fish out of water. im the expert and ive played for over 5 years and im older than you. and also you admitted that this is cheap plastic and it is not a great gun. so you know how you said write a review to ask you a question on airsoft well i have on WHY DONT YOU EVER SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This gun is pretty cool looking, and shoots pretty nice and accurate.

I payed $30 for this gun and wasted my gift card for my birthday...Complete waste. The laser's wires split, the gun does not shoot fully automatic and the FPS (feet per second) is slower than my Berretta Pistol.

The laser pointer was the best thing about the gun, but even that was off. The flashlight shined all of two inches. and the foregrip came loose on the third day. Also, I couldn't find any instructions for adjusting the hop-up, which, I think, was not included. The only reason this gun gets two stars instead of one is because the customer-service from netlink enerprises was great. I can't say the same for airsplat because I have never had to return anything to them. I suggest saving your money and getting a UHC gun.

Laser and LED light are powerful. You have to pull the charging handle back everytime you fire and it appears to be semi and auto but it is not. This weapon is an M4 though, not an M16. The plastic is a little cheap but will last unless you're an idiot run into a tree with it or drop it on concrete like other buyers have written. The BBs that are sent with the weapon are not good though, so don't expect to use them. Buy good BBs for the weapon or it will not fire right.

I had read the reviews on the HFC gun and everyone said it was really good, this one however... isn't so great. After firing the gun several times I found that the BBs went straight for about 15 yards, after that they would curve straight into the ground. When I turned the weapon upside down and fired, the BB went straight and then upwards. It seems that this gun has a \\"Hop-Down\\" system rather than a hop-up. Firing the .12 BB the accuracy is diminished to a unforgivable degree. Overall, the gun looks cool, is sturdy enough to survive normal conditions (it could be stronger though), has a decent clip, shoots fast, and is accurate up to about 25-30 feet. It is this lack of accuracy and the \\"hop-down\\" that drags the rating down to a two. If you want this gun, you should look into the HFC M16-A4(I am awaiting the arrival of mine). I returned this gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"I purchased this gun for my son for Christmas.

He passed the gun onto me and I have to say, I can see why it broke.-Power- Poor, some of the worst I have seen in a rifle. You might expect this kind of power from a pistol, but on a rifle, it is just sad.-Looks- The M16-A4 doesn't look bad, but it's doesn't look great either. The black finish on the gun looks a bit cheap when you get close.-Design- The laser pointer and LED light do not fit very well on the RIS rail. Expect some frustrating moments when they fall off while your using it. The forgrip slowly becomes lose after time. This is a problem if you plan to have this gun for a while.-Verdict- I would reccomend the M16-A4 to someone who was planning on using it for a month or so, but if you really plan on using this for an extended period of time, then I dont reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy anything from this place@!!!!","review":"i was sent a gun that broke immediadtely but i like how it fired before i broke it i did the mistake of orderinf another one took it back to the shop and they told me all of theryre gun were defective they purposely unload crappy guns on you do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"DO NOT GET THIS GUN!!! this is the worst item I ever got off amazon and i want my money back! its not automatic OR semi aoutomatic, you gotta pull the leaver back after every shot, the directions are in chineese, everything is loose, its spirng powered, and TERRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"I'm 13 years old and I bought this gun.

Everyone one out there this gun to me is the worst but not to the other kid and i respect that. Im not going to call names and be jerk like that kid is.I think this gun is horrible. At 290 fps yeah its a little strong but it gets jammed easily and ends up shooting horribley. After a while it becomes unfixible and is worthless.And the PLASTIC is extremely cheap your handle will come off or the back will who knows but i gurentee you something will come off.That kids gun is prbably in pieces to but he denies it HA HA. If you think this gun is auto then your wrong you have to cock it every time. A good gun would be the UTG CQB Sawed Off Combat shotgun it has a total of 5 stars not 3 like this one.

Even though there is a deceptive switch for, Semi and Automatic. If you're looking for an automatic one, look else where.Second, the instructions that come with it are laughable. A single piece of paper, one side has pictures of other types of guns (I'm assuming other products the company sells). The other, has the directions. But low and behold, the instructions aren't just for this gun. I could be mistaken though, since there is very little English and you must rely on the TINY pictures, and SMALL print to assemble.The accessories are nice, though seemingly pointless, and the gun seems to be made from a hard plastic. Once you do figure it out, it is relatively easy to assemble and disassemble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I am a single mom of 2 boys. I know nothing about air soft guns, assembly, how to modify and make better, etc. The spring inside needs to be adjusted or modified but not sure how to do it.

I waited an extra 3 days for a gun that came with an awful packaging finish. The gun was covered in styrofoam in the little spaces and areas that made it hard to clean. The fore grip, stock, and magazine were loose, and not to mention there was no instructions anywhere about the gun. Once you finished loading your gun and put the mag. into the gun and cock it. It will feel as if the gun would break in your hand. I tried shooting and cocking back very carefully. Half the times the ammunition didn't even come out (.12 gram bbs that were supplied), and the ones that did skyrocketed up and swished every which way. This would be a great example of something you do not want.

Now doesnt work at all.When you fill your magazine it says it could hold up 475 bbs. Not really,it only hold up to only about 20-30 bbs.It has mistakenly set to semi,auto,and safe. The auto is actually the safe,and the safe and semi switches are just to fire.It is plastic.Summary:People say its good for beginners. I am a beginner but im the type who wants to be satisfied with this gun... You get what you'd pay for? Why sure if you like a piece of crap gun with attachments that dont do any good.

The hand grip is loose with no way to tighten it.The clip holds a lot of bb's, but is you have to keep tipping it to attempt to reload the 20-30 bb's that can actually be shot.I will never purchase and item like this again without seeing it in person first.I am extremely disappointed, and got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Had no instructions with it total waste of money if you ask me plus it doesn't even shoot def not satisfied"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Purchase!!!!

I went back to the ad to see if I had missed something and verified it with my daughter that there is nothing in the add indicating it to be a spring loaded or otherwise.

The bb's that it came with blew apart when they hit hard objects though. The only thing I didn't like about this gun is I thought it would be automatic because it has a automatic setting button. I also had to contact the seller to send me a laser because they didn't include one. The laser is off so you have to aim a foot to the opposite side the laser is on. The adjustable stock is also very nice.

Their sound owes a lot to Jesus & Mary Chain and dancey dream-pop, but they pull off a vibe that's entirely their own.

It floats, but doesn't disappear. 13 tracks, no bad songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Beginning of A Stellar Group","review":"Lesser Matters is a phenomenal first effort by the Radio Dept. More raw and driving than their later works, this LP is a luscious entry in the Shoegaze genre.

If you are a fan of noisepop, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love!","review":"I wish I knew Susan Paul's secret for creating such fabulous heroes. I have fallen in love with every one of them (including the heroes she created as Mary Spencer). Here we have Kayne the Unknown who is of course noble and strong - we expect that. But he is so much more, and Susan's skill at slowly peeling away the layers of so complex and exciting a hero, compelling the reader to keep turning those pages, boggles the mind. Susan Paul's writing is always fresh and crisp without ever falling into cliché, her characters real and engaging, her atmospheres uncannily vivid. Like her other works, \\"Stolen Bride\\" grips you from the very start and doesn't release you until the final breathlessly romantic page. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Details well known places","review":"I felt the organization of this book left much to be desired. The table of contents is a full six pages long - and you need it. The book sometimes organizes locations by region, sometimes not.For a book that depends on the regions so much for it's organization, they are not well explained or mapped. There is a description of neighbourhoods about 40 pages into the book - but several neighborhoods (Ansley Park, Inman Park, etc.) are listed that are not included in the regional organization, so it is hard to determine which ones are important (at least for finding things in the book) and which ones are not.I also found the restaurant section to be lacking in both the amount of text allocated to each restaurant as well as missing a huge host of good restaurants. Fodor's Cityguide Atlanta is head and shoulders above this book in that respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"We cant all be Intergalactic Rockstars","review":"Robin Black and the Intergalactic RockStars.

Funny how, in a superhero story such as this, the most intriguing chapter should be one revolving around politics.This book just focuses on a great selection of the most memorable characters from the Wild Cards universe, and to this day, to me at least, screams to be a movie. The whole series reads out very cinematically, but this book in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to owls","review":"Owls: Whoo are they? is a very good introductory book for young children on the fascinating subject of owls.

The book doesn't do her justice as she has a great deal more class than the book would leave you thinking. Why include a street fight that she had as a child? We know more about the food she ate than important details that are glossed over, such as the men in her life and a certain diva that she didn't get along with at a White House appearance. Aretha seems to be defending herself from so many comments made about her mother and what others said about her in the press without giving us enough of her side of the story. Many instances are brought up about various people in her life without giving us enough information and leaving us dissatisfied. Will someone please write a definitive biography about this fascinating woman? This one doesn't add anything to our knowledge of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'D GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I COULD","review":"Aretha is full of it and full of herself. Growing up, I adored this woman musically. Sure, she wasn't the greatest role model -- PK with two kids by the time she was 16 -- hmm -- and wasn't a style or fashion paragon by any means -- can I get an amen? -- and no she didn't have the greatest morals or the greatest taste in men -- but boy, there was a time there when the lady could SING. But as we all know, that time was a couple generations ago. As many have long been saying, she has been coasting on her laurels for a long time. But this book -- STAY AWAY FROM IT ALL COSTS! If you really want it, it'll be in the clearance bins right after Christmas. This book is a total waste of time. She may be able to sing but she is not a nice person. She is petty. Not a very happy person.

I did not buy your book to read about your father.

I have adored Aretha since I was a child, and as far as I am concerned, her voice and her interpretation of music are both unparalleled. Reading her book, however, is another matter. Here is a serious case of TMI--too much information--about someone you want to put up on a pedestal. I have read several other books on which Mr. Ritz collaborated, notably the recent B.B. King autobiography, and I have to assume that Ms. Franklin didn't choose to avail herself adequately of his services. The Aretha you will find here is no queen; she is all too human.

Let's tell it like it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Unrevealing--very un-Aretha-esque","review":"If you have a general knowledge of Franklin's history you this book is wholly unnecessary because it sheds no new or itneresting light on her as a performer or human being.The writing style is tight and insular with little beyond generic descriptors. Its as though she can't fully recall experiences and gives up on the details. I don't mean gossip-y stuff I mean basic descriptive language beyond \\"I felt this..\\" or \\"I felt that...\\"Franklin also reveals an unnecessarily catty side toward Gladys Knight, Cissy Houston and Natalie Cole, all undeniable talents in their own right. She also glosses over the recording process beyond a handful of albums and never discusses her pregancies or marriage with much depth.This was clearly an attempt to cash in on the R&B singer autobiography trend and her good name because it is strangely heartless and shallow. If one is not interested in being open and accessible what is the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aretha's From These Roots Just Made Me Hungry!","review":"This book was a disappointment and I should have known it would be. Aretha is never candid or openly confessional in her interviews on television or print, so I should have known she wouldn't be too forthcoming about her personal life.I was also amused by the numerous references to all the food she's eaten. Hell, all those memories of her favorite foods just made me hungry. I must say, she didn't lie about how tasty a Vernor's Float (a beverage made of Vernor's Ginger Ale and vanilla ice cream). I'm a former Detroiter and have had many of those sweet treats.This has to be one of the most disappointing rock biographies off all time.

It takes much less time, costs next to nothing and has about as much to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I, too, have been an Aretha fan forever. But, boy was I disappointed, long before I finished reading her book. I feel Aretha left me hanging in a lot of areas that she touched on and indicated \\"more on that later\\" which never came. There was waaaaaay too much information on her father, more detailed than I needed. She could remember and describe the names, taste and places to buy good food, but she could not remember why she had words with or cannot remember why she and Gladys Knight no longer get along. Amazing! I went out and bought this book the day after her appearance on Oprah. I wish I had waited, because I'm sure this book will be given away on the Clearance tables by Christmas. The book had no direction and was very poorly written. Mr. Ritz must have had his eyes closed when he read/reviewed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Respect A Book This Slight","review":"The Queen of Soul turns out not to be the Queen of books -- this seems like a blown opportunity. Hard to respect -- or care much -- about a book this slight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aretha Franklin \\"From These Roots\\"","review":"I Love Aretha. I think this book was Ok and I MEAN JUST Ok. Being a fan I would have like to know more about her. It just scaled the surface. Didn't share enough about her as a person. I felt like it was a peek (very small peek) into her life as a mother , a woman. But more than anything the singer/entertainer. You don't have to tell it all Aretha, but we wished you would let your readers know more about you. What you think about things of life, music etc. As a reader I was left unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aretha: These roots need a re-touch.","review":"I did not like this book. I regret spending one penny on it. I started reading it under the dryer at the beauty shop. It was so boring that I put it down. I hate to waste money so I forced myself to read it. (It took about a month.)Although she gives some lovely historcal accounts of the 60's & 70's, I bought this book to hear her \\"dish out the dirt\\" and \\"give me the 411\\". On too many occasions, Aretha leaves the reader hanging by refusing to name names. The book read more like a page from her diary than an autobiograhpy of a singer. I was especially let down near the closing of the book, the words to her sisters. She should have just written them a letter rather than waste print. I bought this book to learn more about Aretha. From reading this book, I gathered that Aretha is a man crazy singer who loves to eat and is afraid to fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why an Autobiography","review":"I was truly disappointed in this autobiography! The book was poorly written and recounted many petty incidents that seemed to have absolutely no significance. Also, I got very, very tired of Aretha remembering almost every morsel of food that's ever entered her mouth! Who told Aretha she should write an autobiography! If she has trouble discussing the private details of her life and she's a private person, why on earth would you choose to write an autobiography?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Queen of Soul is full of herself.","review":"Son of a preacher man and popping babies at 14. Drops out of high school. Yes, glosses over that by saying \\"Babies are gifts from God.\\"Marries a man who makes Ike Turner look like Ghandi. And basically says nothing about this whole period. And ironically, it was during this same period with Ted White that she became the Queen of Soul and recorded the very career-making and legend-making material that has allowed her to coast with the title ever since.Has feuds with everyone from Natalie Cole to Mavis Staples. Not a nice person. Not a truthful person. She's becoming the music world's version of Norma Desmond. In Plus-Plus-Plus Sizes.A total disappoinment. Maybe someone else will tell her story one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DETAIL","review":"This book could have been a great book if Aretha didn't keep jumping around the detail. With all the people she met she could have really included some wonderful pictures in this book. It was unfortunately rather boring, since she didn't want to mention names or any detail about her personal life. Aretha kept mentioning that she didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, well, she shouldn't have bother to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"No respect for this book!","review":"I LOVE Aretha Franklin. When you think of soul music, if you don't think of her, you'd have to be crazy. I was hoping that this book would give us insight into a career that has spanned the last four decades but I was totally disappointed. The entire book is spotty at best. It is poorly written with too much hidden from the readers and has to be one of the worst autobiographies I've ever read. You would think a life as interesting as the \\"Queen of Soul\\" would be enough to fill two volumes but if this is it, I think we better stick to her singing.

I was deceived by the cover showing a beautifully coiffed impecabbly applied makeup Aretha Franklin which is in complete contrast to the sweat rolling fat garrish costume wearing diva whose singing I grew up on and absolutely adore. She is as elusive in the book as she is in interviews....you go girl! 251 pages long and revealed nothing of who you really are....and by the way I don't buy that \\"sheltered life bit\\" cmon pregnant at 13! I love you just the same"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"This book was easy reading because there was not much there to read. Story lines left unfinished and the book jumps back and forth. There is no doubt that Areatha Franklin is the Queen of Soul, but this book did not and could not have done her justice. I've read magazine articles that portray her as a more warm and complete person.The Queen deserves a better written biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"PR-fluff being passed off as autobigraphy","review":"Don't waste your time. I've loved Aretha since I was a child, but boy, it's getting harder and harder to justify the acclaim. I see why people are dissing her everywhere. Overrated, overinflated ego, coasting on a reputation. She may have been the Queen of Soul in the '60s -- whatever the heck that means -- but there are so many other fine vocalists who can out-sing her any day of the week -- Patti Labelle, Jennifer Holliday, Chaka Khan, just to name a few -- and this autobiography will do nothing to regain her crown. She comes off as a pompous, unlikable b-word. A very unhappy woman. And a very out-of-touch woman. Like someone said, the Norma Desmond of popular music.Don't waste your time with this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply dreadful","review":"I preface this review the way I always do when I write about Aretha Franklin. I am a long time fan and admirer. Lord knows the Queen of Soul has a heck of a story to tell. What's disappointing is that she doesn't really tell it. This is lightweight, to say the very least. SO MUCH is left to speculate, Aretha is cagey about many events, many people. In other words, if you're not gonna write a warts and all autobiography, and leave yourself open to the world, to your FANS, who really want the details, then don't do one at all. The only impression this book left me with is the enormity of Aretha Franklin's self-importance, and utter self-righteousness. A much better book is \\"Queen of Soul.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good reading!","review":"I am a big fan of Lady Soul and I found this book opened a lot about her personal life; some good and some not so good. I am very happy that the part of about her mother leaving her has been made clear. I can not imagine her having to deal with all the negatives lies that have been told about her mother all these years. She revealed what she felt so should reveal since after all she in entitles to a private life too. I really did so enjoy hearing about all the old black stars like Sam Cooke,Dianh Washington to name a few that she learned so much from.

It refused to connect to any network wired or wireless. I tried to contact the company 2 times with 0 response.Bottom line is the company is not customer friendly, could care less about post sale support, and has a poorly made product for the price.In the near future I am planning on giving a slim devices product a try and hope to have a better experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent network music player","review":"I found the Roku M1001 pretty easy to setup, and had connected to my iTunes library in less than 10 minutes.Searching for music via the Soundbridge is not as easy as searching on an iPod, but that is to be expected given the 1-2 line display (depending on font size) on the device. A web interface that lets users select music over the internet would have been nice.The Soundbridge is connected to my amp over digital coax, and sound quality is my only real beef with the Roku. The sound of mp3 files (192kbps) is great - involving and full-bodied - but AAC files (192kbps) sound anemic and thin.

On the positive side, if you have a compatible wireless router and don't mind restarting it once a month or so (not really a big deal since a recent software release) it was fine.

This book is so much more! I could not put it down. The dialogue makes the characters come to life. The book is exceptionally well researched (for example, Kevin's discussion with his future father-in-law about the impact of war on civilians).The main character, Kevin O'Dea, is a bright young fighter pilot who looks at the world in terms of right and wrong. As he experiences life as an adult, he comes to realize right and wrong are not absolutes, but degrees. For anyone who came of age in the 1960s/1970s, the drama and emotions we experienced are conveyed in this book in a very powerful way.Steve Dotson has done a masterful job with this his first book. I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding me right?","review":"This book reads like a bad W.E.B Griffin/Harlequin romance all wrapped in one cheesy package.

It shaves quicker and closer and has a better trimmer. (I am comparing a new Braun with a new Norelco.) It also has far fewer parts to clean than the rotary head Norelco. Cleaning the Norelco WAS A CHORE! The battery capacity is about the same in terms of number of shaves per charge. I suspect the battery lifetime will also be about the same, e.g., 4-6 years. The Braun is lighter and feels better in the hand. The norelco has a better traveling case though- it fits into my toilet travel case easier. The ultra high speed feature of the Braun is a must. If you want to shave quicker one tends to move the shaver rapidly across the beard area usually resulting in a poor shave with the Norelco thus requiring another pass which takes more time. Not so with the ultra speed Braun. I would recommend the ultra speed Braun models (6000 or above) to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun 6520 Disappoints","review":"Purchased in December, 2000, I looked forward to another superior Braun shaver product.

This is really a nice shaver. Shaves quickly, the charge lasts forever, easy to clean, and so easy on the face that I never dread shaving anymore. Is it as close as a blade? No, definitely not. I'm not even sure it is as close as my old rotary, but I know that my face definitely prefers it to the blade or the rotary, and the shaver is so good I really don't mind doing a touch-up shave if I have to go back out in the evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shave, Great features, Super price","review":"I've been using the 6520 since it was a new model, probably 10 years ago. It shaves close, is easy to use, is easy to keep clean, and works both with the cord and without (some other rechargables won't work with the cord plugged in).This last point is important because there is no such thing as a rechargable shaver battery that stays \\"like new\\" forever. After a couple of years, they start holding their charge for less and less time, until ultimately after several years you pretty much have to recharge them every day. At that point, you can just keep the thing plugged in all the time (when it's plugged in, it performs as if it has a full charge), OR you can replace the motor (which is expensive), OR you can just order a new one (That's what I've done. Refurbished models can be found for less than the cost of a replacement screen and cutter.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great shaver - if it works","review":"The 6520 actually shaves closer than the new self cleaning shaver the 7680. However I have had reliability problems with both of them. My 7680 stopped recharging after a month or so, so I bought a 6520 instead. I have now had an incredible three in a row of these all stop recharging after a month or so.

I also use the second blank hanging board to add pictures and special messages. I do wish it had a clip to hold a dry erase marker. Other than that, it's a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chart","review":"Very easy to use and helpful. I use it every day to track my 4 year olds behavior.

I use this responsibility chart as a way to reward him with computer time or money. It didn't keep his interest at first but once I mentioned that it will help me decide how much computer time he would be having, he was in.The magnets with the responsibility name arent so great. Most of them we don't use. This would be better if the majority were blank and if a marker was provided, one that won't smudge. In all, I won't complain. I got this fairly quickly and it's usable. I just wonder if I would have been better off searching in stores or just making one myself with a poster board and stickers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chore Chart","review":"My sister got one of these chore charts for her family and wished she had two. I purchased two and have not regreted it one bit. We are able to change the responsibilities on a weekly basis depending on what needs to be worked on. My two kids are able to recognize their responsibilites and complete them without so much intervention. Last night when we were changing out the responsibilities my 6 year old said \\"I don't need to have the 'make the bed' tile because I can do that without being reminded. AWESOME!!! Other chore tiles include: NO WHINING, Keep hands to yourself, say please and thank you, apologize to someone, load the dishwasher, unload the dishwasher, take care of pet, help with outside chores, help with inside chores, do homework, clear the table, set the table, share, put away toys, clean up room, and more.. There are also blank tiles so you can write in chores that are just specific for your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is just what we needed to get our 5 yr old on track.

The highlight to her day is placing the smiley faces next to the responsiblities she has completed each day. If she didn't complete a responsibility, however, no smiley face. Let's say it is a rare day she doesn't earn a smiley face. It has greatly helped her to take her responsibilities seriously and with great pride. The sense of accomplishment she receives at the end of the day is all over her face and is absolutely priceless. In addition to teaching her to pick up her toys, there are other \\"responsiblities\\" such as, keeping hands to self, brushing teeth, setting table, saying please and thank you, apologizing to someone, and many more. We change them up about once a week to keep her interested.

It was at first difficult to administer - However, after purchasing this chart it became a breeze. We have placed the chart in the kitchen on a wall near our dinner table. We review the chart, and her accomplishments each night. She gets $.25 for each item that she is able to mark with a magnet. She absolutely loves it - she can see her progress and track how much allowance she's eligible for at the end of each week. We use the dry erase board on the bottom to write her notes when does done an excellent job (cleaning her bedroom or bathroom or clearing the dinner table). The positive reinforcement is wonderful! I would highly recommend this item for any elementary aged child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Toddlers!","review":"My daughter has always been a very good girl and we don't have to nag her to pick up, be nice, etc. But she has always wanted to \\"help\\" do things.

This is a fantastic product..I highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"magnetic chart review","review":"This product is great my kids just love it. They are really doing a great job with picking up toys. I do not have to be as much of an authority the board also helps with that part. The set up of the chart is awesome. The only part I feel needs improvement is that I feel there needs to be one more place to store the magnets. Maybe a tri fold. The 2nd area below the chart could be used as a white board area for the kids for extra special tasks etc. I was very pleased though with this product. You could always put the magnets in a baggie and use a tack to keep it beside the chart or one of those hooks and put the magnets in a cloth bag with drawstring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa and Doug toys","review":"Love the Melissa and Doug responsibility chart.

Trashing it made my 5 year old sad but the papers piling up made me unhappy. The magnetic chart is perfect because he gets to reuse the same pieces over and over and I don't have to pay for reward charts and more stickers that wind up on everything.

The responsibility \\"title\\" tiles are perfect. Unlike some \\"chore\\" charts this one has things that a child can achieve. I am not a big believer of making your children into your slave so I like the titles like, \\"get ready for bed, brush your teeth, help with the pet, get dressed, share your toys, etc\\". These are perfect for my 5 year old. There are also tiles that will work as she gets older like, \\"put your clothes in the wash, empty the dishwasher, etc\\" Things that are not appropriate for my 5 year old but would be more appropriate as she gets older. She even looks forward to putting the \\"job well done, excellent\\" circle \\"stickers - magnets\\" on the chart at the end of the day for the things she accomplished (which I will add isn't everything everyday). I would highly recommend this to anyone with young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chart!","review":"I got this when it was on sale for $10.00. What a great deal!

Stylistically this disc is all over the place, bouncing from house to pop to blues to rap to folk to tr*p-h*p.

However, the American perspective upon the subject provided by the authors is to be welcomed. Also welcome are the numerous photographs, beautifully capturing an educational ethos which is now, somewhat sadly, in decline. The limited number of stunning colour plates show how even more impressive the book would be if printed throughout in colour. However, considering the modest price of the book one must not grumble too much: there is much here to reward the mind and delight the eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hummus chips","review":"Everyone I have shared this product with has liked it.

However, I did not like them because they taste like they are made with powder ingredients. The reason for that is that they are ACTUALLY MADE WITH: \\"GARBANZO FLOUR, GARLIC POWDER, ONION POWDER, SOY FLOUR, POTATO STARCH & CORN STARCH\\". Hence the reason for the powdery taste. Yuck!

I was panicked that the implant had failed, but I did some googling and found some information that the vibrations from the toothbrush can loosen dental implant screws. I don't want to take the chance that this will happen again, I don't want the screw to become stripped. So I will not be using this toothbrush, or any electric toothbrush for that matter.

However, I will use this product until it is dead. I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.If there were no hiccups, I'd give it a 4. that's the main defect (with mine at least).

My dentist recommended the oral B electric toothbrush and I can now see why. It does a great job and I am impressed when I brush, it is just like going to the dentist. I will be interested in the comments I get from the dentist on my next visit. This particular model came with two types of heads, has the 30 second timer feature and dual action heads. All in all this is just what the dentist recommended and it has worked as advertised. By the way the product I ordered was the excel model and I received the 7440 Professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Buyers","review":"Although I ordered the model 7550, I received model 7400. From the Amazon opinion survey, I knew this was a very common complaint among buyers of this product, but I didn't heed their warnings. It was too late to return the items (I bought two) before Christmas so Amazon offered me a discount for the mistake. I took the discount, then found the model 7400 two days later at a cheaper price in the local Bed, Bath & Beyond. In the end, I paid shipping charges to receive the wrong product at a rotten price. Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toothbrush","review":"This toothbrush is awesome. I've had it for 1 1/2 years not and it's still going strong. I got this after having a Rotodent my dentist recommended. I got tired of paying $25 ea. for replacement brushes so I decided to try this. It does an awesome job and has a great two minute timer; which is the amount of time recommended for tooth brushing. My only issue - which I've seen no one else discuss - is how the post gets yucky unless you completely dry the toothbrush with a towel after each use. Maybe it only happens to me?? Anyway, the refills are affordable and it does a fabulous job - nuf' said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly recommended","review":"I purchased this product over 2 years ago. This is my first electric toothbrush. I am extremely happy with the product. My teeth have gotten healthier since the time I started using it.Its superfast pulsating, oscillating, and rotating actions loosen and remove plaque from teeth and gum very effectively, and remove stains too. It has two speed settings, and an automatic timer that makes the brush stutter when the recommended two minute brushing time is reached. The bristles are so soft that it is a pleasure to use the brush to massage the gum. My brush is still going strong -- thanks to Braun's quality.The only regret is when I bought this brush, I paid a much higher price. The price has come down over the years. But I have saved on toothpaste consumption (electric brushheads can hold much less toothpaste than manual toothbrushes)!I strongly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great T-Brush!","review":"We like the Oral-B's and this one has tons of power, looks sleek and does a great cleaning job.

The gel part of the sleeve and the fabric looked really nice, but the band at the top (ankle/lower calf) was tiny! I cannot imagine what a small/medium would be!

It is durable, nothing broken after 5 years, neither on the cleaning system nor on the shaver, charges perfectly every time.

I use Braun shavers for over 20 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I received this shaver as a gift a couple of months ago. The cleaning system is overrated. The alcohol burns and only lasts a few weeks before having to be replaced (at $15 a pop). The shaver itself is not bad, but it has cut me way too many times.I prefer an electric shaver so that I can get a clean shave while I'm bleary eyed in the mornings. But the poor design, especially the middle portion of the floating facade which is stationary, is the cause of the multiple cuts i've received.I would not recommend the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful of the switch","review":"First, I claim partial responsibility for the thing falling apart. I should not have put it in my carry-on without wrapping it in something soft.

This unit has always had problems with areas like the neck. I always have to \\"touch up\\" by hand to get a consistent close shave. Most recently, the arm that holds the unit in place for cleaning and charging stopped working. I did a little research on the web and this is a VERY common problem for this model, but of course Braun hasn't done anything to help their customers with this defective product. You can purchase a replacement part for about $14, or spend $40 on a whole new base. But quite frankly, since I never really got a good shave from the thing, I'm going to toss it and try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for young men!","review":"We bought this shaver for our son's 21st birthday. He just loves it. The cleaning system makes it practical for men in a hurry to keep the unit clean and sharp. The only down side is the cleaning trays that need to be changed regularly to keep the unit working properly. A suggestion would be to buy a few to keep on hand so you aren't caught without one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Waste of Money. Poorly Made","review":"This razor didnt even last a year. First the charging unit broke and then the razor itself died and couldnt even use it plugged in.

The latch broke that holds the shaver in, and so it can't be cleaned or charged in the stand. I contacted Braun, and apparently, I'm not \\"technically inclined\\" enough to replace the entire charging stand.

The razor works great but we have had to get the clean & charge base repaired 3 times in less than 1 year. The service time from Braun is awful. We have been waiting 3 weeks so far for our 3rd repair and my husband has been cleaning the razor manually which is a pain over long periods of time and the razor doesn't work as well when it is cleaned manually.

When I first got it everything was great; good shave, the cleaning stand works well and I was very satisfied. However as time went on the screen that protects your face from the blades has become loose, mine actually had a hole wear through it. I replaced the blades and the screen with the kit from Braun, this helped a little but the screen was still very loose and rattles around while I shave. This makes it sound something like a chain saw and about as comfortable. The only thing I can do is to physically hold the guard down while I shave, this helps but the shave is still poor, and I get nicked quite often when shaving.Overall I am not happy with this product, and will probably not buy a braun again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it if your beard hair isn't straight","review":"I'm african-american and my beard growth is light but this shaver can't cut it.

But I am underwhelmed, and now--6 months later--I see several mediocre reviews here! I agree with them. It does take a long time to shave, and I don't find that the shave is very close, especially on the neck.The cleaning stand is nice, and hopefully it won't break anytime soon.Perhaps I am asking too much from an electric. I bought a standard Norelco first and returned it for the money back guarantee. But my very old Braun did much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This shaver is terrible.

The head on this shaver is a little thinner and that is taking some getting used to. I do like the shaver as it gives a very close shave, and when you're done you drop it in the cleaning module, lock it in and away it goes. It cleans, lubricates the shaver, and even leaves it smelling pleasant. Nice shaver, and a good gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great untill it broke","review":"I bought this razor 2 months ago and have been very impressed with the closeness and ease of shaving. Almost exactly close as a blade but with no water, cream or mess. However in the last couple of weeks the part that latches the shaver in only will stay clamped occasionly. When I went to the store to exchange it I noticed there was a new model (8500 series) which did not even have the defective part as part of the unit. My suggestion is to buy the new model that won't break on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and doesn't last","review":"I recieved one of these for Christmass in 2002 and for the first 6 months it was great. Close shave (although not as a close as a $1.00 disposable blade but convienient) and east to use. However, at 6 months the foil somehow got a hole in it. I didn't notice it and the first pass of the razor left a long bloody scratch in my face. The new foil and blades were about $30.00. About 6 months later the same thing happened, then in April 2004 the cleaner stopped working. Counting up the refills and the repairs this thing has cost be almost $100.00 in a year, almost the cost of a new one. Feels like this little scheme is a revenue stream for Braun. I would seriously pass on this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shaver","review":"I bought the Braun 7526 shaver for my fiance for Christmas. He has sensitive skin so shaving wasn't something he did very frequently (much to my dismay). This shaver has worked out very well for him. I would rate it with 5 stars except he has had some trouble getting the hairs right under his chin on his neck trimmed. He loves the cleaning system. We forgot the cord at his parents' house for 2 weeks so it had gotten pretty grimy with hair in the meantime. Once we got cord he cleaned it and it came out looking brand new. He's shaving daily now so it seems to work well for him and he isn't experiencing any irritation at all. The thing people say about your face needing to \\"adjust to the razor\\" is true. I can't explain why, maybe it's just getting used to shaving with an electric razor, but he wasn't getting a close shave at all at first and now he is as smooth as if he had used a straight blade. Nice product and we're recommending it to our other male family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shaver but not a blade replacement","review":"From my experience this shaver best serves its purpose as an \\"I'm late for work and gotta shave quick\\" shaver. The shave closeness on my face is no doubt the best I've experienced with an electric shaver but the neck leaves much to be desired. The cleaning ability is the strongest feature of the Synro. Overall good shaver for occaisional use but not strong enough to replace the blade for every day use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointed","review":"I bought the 7526 shaver and am very dissappointed. The worstproblem is the shaving head doesn't stay on. It's verydifficult to use when the shaving head pops off. The headattachment system if very badly designed.

The whole cleaning apparatus broke apart & made a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last","review":"I have had this razor for three years. It has just died. The battery got extremely hot just before it quit working. Luckily, I came home and noticed it. It had a burned electrical smell. I'm not saying it would have caught on fire, but who knows. Also, the charging stand broke after using it about two years. It would not lock down on the razor. I was able to charge the razor by plugging the cord directly into it. I could not use the auto cleaning feature as well. The razor worked well for me and gave a close shave. It shaved closer than the Norelco's that I have had. The Norelco did shave faster with less passes and still keeps on working after many years. The Braun just doesn't seem to have good quality for the high price. I expected it to last longer than it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-term reliability sucks","review":"For anyone who has read each of the reviews, you must ask yourself how long the people reviewing this product have owned it. I owned one for about a year, and I can honestly say that it is an over-priced peice of junk.First, the refills are hard to find, and you can't use the cleaner/recharger without the refills. Second, it takes up a lot of vanity space. Third, and most important, it doesn't last very long.I bought the razor and I loved it. Six months later, it needed a new shaver head replacement. Six months after that the shaver started vibrating excessively, it sounded more like clippers than a razor. It was the end, it was broken. A replacement shaver costs $70 or more... I decided to buy a Norelco..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pricey disappointment","review":"OK now, don't get too excited about the Braun 7526. It looks fancy with all its features, such as automatically cleaning itself, but guess what - it misses out on one much more important aspects - providing a good shave.I used a Remington R-845 razor prior to the Braun. It usually sells at aroung $35 (or some $70 lower than the Braun). I decided to upgrade and was tremendously disappointed. The Braun cuts my face almost every time I shave and doesn't shave as closely! The neck is especially problematic - the Braun leaves almost everything on even after going over the area for minutes. I found myself going back to the Remington for this area, which is obviously ridiculous.Otherwise, the Braun looks very sturdy and is a good piece of machinery with all its lith indicators and good materials used. However, unless your beard is really soft and your skin is totally insensitive to cuts - it is not a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive gimmick","review":"As others have reported, base quit working and left me with several spare expensive tanks.

The hairs that this shaver cuts are indeed cut very close. Unfortunately, it only cuts about half of your remaining hair in each pass, so you never get all of your stubble removed. You end up isolated stubble here and there, smooth skin in between, and irritated skin everywhere from making so many passes (at high pressure). I bought this for the cleaning system, thinking it would be cleaner and save me time in the morning. It may be cleaner, but it actually takes longer to shave. I'll be buying a Norelco that I can rinse with water and save my skin and the money I would otherwise spend on cleaning cartridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 years and still going strong!","review":"I got this razor before I went to college about 6 years ago. I first used it and I loved it; close shave, clean feeling. Unfortunately I started to get very bad razor burn from it after a bit. Didn't know what it was from. I went back to a regular blade for years. One day I found the razor again and decided to give it another shot (years older and wiser;) ). I noticed I never changed the blade, so I did that, and tried it again and it worked like it was new again. I also noticed that it wasn't getting as close as a regular blade until I started using pre-shave. As soon as I started the pre-shave the irritation and the \\"closeness issue\\" went away!So just make sure you keep it clean, keep the blade fresh (I think once every 18 months), and use pre-shave!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and inefective.","review":"I have hyper sensitive skin, and this shaver did not work for me.

The cleaning and charge mechanism is a great bonus too.My only complaint has been the lifespan of the foil that covers the blades. My first foil last almost a year -- as expected. I then changed the foil and blades as recommended by Braun. My replacement foil, however, has lastet less than 6 months.

The most frustrating problem that I encountered was the housing that contains the shaver for storage and cleaning. After 1 1/2 years the arm that locks the shaver in place would not stay down and lock the shaver into position. The locking mechanism simply wore out from removing and replacing the shaver after use. Once the arm is unlockable, the shaver cannot be cleaned or recharged in the housing. You have essentially lost cleaning and charging capability.

The coating on the second one started bubbling and chipping off after the same 2 to 3 year period. So at this point we're ready to try another manufacturer. It's difficult to find pans like this with lids that vent. The Swiss Diamond one does have that but the ventilation is fairly limited.

The pictures are lively and colorful and have lots of details. The text is really well done. You know how sometimes you read a kids' book and think anyone could have written it, this isn't one of those. It's clear that the author took care to flush it out. The word choices are excellent with clever repetition (but not too much) and gentle alliteration. You can feel the thought behind each word choice, as when pig \\"gazes\\" at giraffe who is \\"grazing\\" and pig doesn't just fall in the mud, he falls \\"slap bang\\" in the mud.

The repetition of these word patterns is a pre-reading step for kids and this one is a lot of fun.My 6 yr old gd will love the pictures and the words and the humor of it all.

The child is to first enter casting, then wardrobe to dress the character. Once she has done that, she is to enter the scene editor where she constructs a story. Next, it is off to editing where she is to crop and splice certain scenes to construct her move.Ages 4-9?? No, I don't think so.The rest of them simply aren't much better.I can see where it might be fun for older girls with advanced reading/critical thinking skills.

Unlike what the previous reviewer received, I received a three-pack of all the same type. It's a microfiber mitt, nicely sized to fit a large hand with an elastic wrist band to keep it on your hand. COnstruction is decent -- not as well-made as others, but since you get three for just a bit over $5, it's a good value. While a nicer one (which usually costs more than the three pack) would last longer, it won't last three times as long, so the 3-pack wins out on the value equation.I use mine for car washing - works well, no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Waste of Time","review":"If it were possible to give this book a negative rating, I wouldn't hesitate to do so. What might have been a poignant, touching story, instead morphs into a rambling, unrealistic series of thoughts/feelings without any substance to speak of. I was determined to read this book, as the reviews I had read were somewhat glowing. What I found were characters without character and a plot that had gone MIA. The idea behind this book had great potential, but I found myself not caring in the least what happened to any of these superficial, immature characters. If you feel compelled to read this one, at least get it from the library. Even at amazon prices, it is extremely over-priced for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is the first time I have ever had to to put a book down.

I couldn't keep track of who was who. I would not recommend this book. If I still had my receipt, I would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing love story ...","review":"While the story line was what caught my attention, being a true romantic at heart, the effort in separating her present day delirium from the wedding weekend, her children from her past friends from her lovers, and everything in between, took away the enjoyment, as well as the anguish, of Ann's life. I found it difficult to connect to any of the characters with either feelings of like or dislike. If Minot's main message was that Ann never had depth for anyone or anything in her life other than Harris, then she succeeded, because neither did I. Perhaps if read cover to cover, with no interruptions, I would have gained more, but it was difficult to read over a week's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Vacuous and Boring!","review":"Is it possible to give a book zero stars? This one would merit it. After 100 pages I was still waiting for something of interest to happen. After that I stuck with it just to say I had perserverance. Ann, 65 years old, dying of cancer,drifts through a haze of memory to the highlight of her insipid life - a weekend of love with Harris Arden one summer weekend at a friends wedding. Arden is as vacuous as Ann. I didn't care about any of the characters in this book. In fact I had trouble telling them apart, as they were all cut from the same dull mold. The author tries to be artsy with her lack of punctuation, but endless run-on sentences hardly make for a fine novel. Save you money and your eyesight and read something else instead. I was happy when this dreadful book was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virginia Woolf Rip Off","review":"While Minot shoots for the stars, her abtruse prose lacks clarity and insight that is essential in the success of a literary novel. The plot and characters, which do have potential, are actually hindered by the overly precious, purple prose. Monkeys still stands as Minot's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and confusing","review":"While the premise of this story is intriguing, the style with which it is written left me cold.

There was no depth to any of the characters and Ann, the main character, was tedious and shallow in her perceptions of life and love.

Without any warning, I would have read a page before I realized I had stumbled upon one of Ann Grant's memories from the past. Even though Ann suffered from a terrible illness, I had no compassion for this character or her life. My mind wandered a lot while trying to read this book. The book was not interesting to me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"an average novel","review":"I was sorely disappointed in Evening. The concept was interesting and parts of the novel contained beautiful descriptions and dialouge, but other sections just seemed incoherent. An even larger problem for me was that the \\"love story\\" centered around a very problematic situation. I'll avoid spoiling the book, but let's just say that unless you are a die-hard romantic you might want to try something else. By the way, this was my office's book club selection for August and no one enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Evening-Difficult to follow","review":"I found the book to be very hard to follow.

At first, a bit difficult to get into, due to the punctuation or rather the lack of it, and then as a reader you let go and tumble into the lyrical flow of her words and images.

My mother, like the narrator, recently died of cancer and had a similiar \\"love lost\\" experience in her 20s. I felt like this book was describing parts of my mother, or any woman for that matter, that others usually can't see. When Ann Lord remembered her affair with Harris Arden, I got goosebumps; when she drifts in and out of coherence on her deathbed, it smacked of an experience I\\"ve just gone through. But somehow, this book is uplifting, not depressing. The use of Faulknerian stream-of-consciousness is deft, and there's just enough of it. The shifts in time and place are brilliant. These people who give this book only a couple of stars just don't get it...maybe they need to stick with Maeve Binchy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel magnificently captures the fugue state of reverie","review":"Minot's storytelling ability is phenomenal. The fugue state of reverie and love are captivating. It made me remember my own first encounter with love. Highly readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING","review":"Although Susan Minot attempts to weave a spell with her sophisticated use of language, the emptiness of her often interchangeable characters undercuts her ambition. This is the story of Ann Lord: a boring, shallow woman who has yet to outgrow her twenty-five year old self. Although she is sixty-five years old, on her deathbed, and drifting in and out of a delirium of morphine-induced memory, she seems to have learned nothing of the power of enduring love. Her children, her three husbands, are of minor importance compared to the power of a single weekend of great sex with a deceitful womanizer. I do not understand what I am supposed to take away from this novel. It is impossible to form an attachment to any character, because the prose is all surface glitter. I believe that most great books take their strength from the power of love, which is absent from this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evening","review":"I saw the movie and thought I'd like to read the book but I just can't get into it.

Or could the author just not find a thesaurus? Some sentences go on and on, free of any punctuation, and some are three words long. How can anyone read this?

The author has a lot of flashbacks and her punctuation is really confusing. The main character Ann appears to be on her deathbed and is having flasbacks of a life with regrets. Ann had three marriages and she stews about these marriages but for me I had a hard time piecing together which husband came in what order, not to mention the admirers along the way. What was annoying about this book were the intermittent italicized sentences with no punction that seemed to run on, and trail off into space. I am an avid reader, and I usually eat up books fast, but this one was painstakingly frustrating to finish so I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Lame","review":"I buy 95% of my books online from Amazon and much of the time based on reader reviews, which is how I decided on Evening. What did I miss?? I was extremely disappointed in this book. The \\"images\\" Ann saw from her medicated state included dinosaurs, aspargus, syringes, martini glasses, Chinese men, etc, etc. Sometimes I would have to read an entire page to determine \\"where\\" Ann was in her life and the pages without punctuation were horrible to read.

It really is worth the diving into, and when I turned the last page I immediately went back and re-read the opening chapters and got a lot more out of them, both in terms of the characters and some of the recurring imagery. There are multiple story strands, but the main two--passionate love discovered and lost and the fact that one's loved ones never really know you or your inner life--I found incredibly moving, and even now, writing this, am tearing up again! While I couldn't totally get into the morphine-induced poetry-like stream of consciousness passages I found there were poignant nuggets strewn throughout them, so don't skip them. I guess I'll rent the film soon but there's no way it could match the interior loveliness of this moving novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evening","review":"I found this to be an poignant story of a dying woman who reflects on the loves and losses in her life. The point of view changes to include her childrens' perspectives as well.I look forward to seeing how the film portrays the events in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air Poetry","review":"Susan Minot has a fine command of the English language, but she wastes it on this story. Her prose has been compared to poetry; in the absence of a compelling story and sympathetic characters, her writing is precious and pretentious. I had difficulty developing a feeling for the main character, Ann, with whose impending death we are expected to sympathize. The unraveling of her tale, centering on a weekend love affair many years before, is a protracted tease that ultimately amounts to little more than air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating to read","review":"It had potential to be a good book given the storyline, but where are the punctuation marks? I know the author was trying to establish a certain lyricism, but I think one can accomplish that with quotation marks. I had to read lines over and over, particularly after a long day at work. Additionally, it was \\"cut up.\\" I personally do not enjoy books that shift from past to present throughout the entire book. Not a satisfying read for those wanting a smooth ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disappointment","review":"The author's style of writing, 5 sentences run together without punctuation, is so annoying I had to reread each sentence to understand what she was saying. You will never really get to know the characters as its like looking at it through a window, not experiencing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the fuss about?","review":"Minot begins her novel well but seems to mishandle a number of the themes throughout. She allows cliche to rule the overall theme. There is a rushed or thoughtless quality to a number of important passages where her author's hand disturbs, if you will, the surface of the water into which we peer. At times her assertions undercut the events and weaken the prose and narrative.While I can see Minot has talent, I am left wondering why so many critics (in published reviews) have gone gaw-gaw over her stylistic ability. I think that is her greatest weakness- the plot is strong, the story and characters interesting, but her writing is without clarity, focus, and true insight.I judge her so harshly only because she has clearly attempted to write in a literary and timeless vein- it is my opinion that so far she has yet to fulfill the glittering praise she has harvested and this book will not stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the book...but LOVE the movie.","review":"I recently saw the movie \\"Evening\\" on tv and loved so I ordered the dvd from Amazon.

Book is very different, and a bit disappointing. Adds little depth to the story or characters, which is what I would have expected from the book, even if it is very different than the movie. I don't think I would have liked the book even if I never saw the movie. Too many characters and an empty ending, just the rambling thoughts of a dying woman. First time ever that I liked the movie more than the book. However, with Claire Dane, Hugh Dancy, Vanessa Redgrave, Mamie Mummer, Natasha Richardson, & Meryl Streep, it would be pretty hard to come out with a bad movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, attenuated tale based on romantic cliche","review":"Minot lumbers her way through present and past, teasing out the wedding weekend exasperatingly. I was skimming the sick room scenes, then even the scenes of the past. I kept thinking \\"Bridges of Madison County,\\" except here it was three days instead of four. Plus, if you want to be lauded for aesthetic sensibilities, surely you, or your editor, ought to get some rudimentary grammar right--the right verb forms for lay and lie, using ground, rather than grinded for the past tense of ground, and a million alright misuses. It's ALL RIGHT. These pesky irritants were like mosquitoes swarming over an already unsavory bog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time and Memory Unfolding and Altered","review":"Ann Lord relives a passionate weekend from long ago, that had to be forgotten to live the life she was meant to live. Hard to understand, yet universally recognizable, this story weaves a web of magic and sadness....wondering how things would have fit together in a better more hopeful way. Minot writing could be clearer, but once the reader is able to flow with her style, it becomes mesmerizing and almost like living a three dimentional dream. I recommend it for romantics and not for realists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dying woman remembers her greatest love","review":"A wonderful story by a wonderful writer. Anne Lord is on her deathbed and during the last night of her life remembers the man she loved most. While various nurses and family members wander through her bedroom she recalls being married three times but her most important memory is of one weekend at a wedding in Maine when she instantly fell in love with another guest who returns her affection but is already engaged to another woman. A chain of events occur during the weekend that result in a tragedy giving more meaning to her affair. I read this book in one sitting I was so caught up in her memories, my only problem with the book was it jumped around so much from present to the wedding weekend to other events in her life that at times I was confused and had to read sentences twice to understand where we were. I enjoyed seeing her life pass before my eyes before her death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrical prose, shallow characters, ultimately disappointing","review":"\\"Evening\\" was tantalizing and sensual, but ultimately disappointing. Susan Minot's lyrical style seems to capture how I would imagine the experience of dying slowly. Yet the plot and characters were too thin for the novel to take hold. The minor characters--Ann's children and her friends of 40 years ago--were cardboard and interchangeable. In fact, I felt no sorrow when Ann died, because she was shallow, caring little for her children, untouched by the experience of motherhood, and having no other accomplishments to speak of. Harris, the love of her life with nothing more than good looks to offer, seems undeserving of Ann's extraordinary deathbed passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew....What An Album!!!

To start with, to set the clock you must be very fast and dexterous or the setting times out and you have to start all over. It is not easy to set, and every time there is a power fluctuation the clock must be reset since there is now memory or battery backup. The two tape players were adequate and worked fine. The CD changer has a belt drive, the belt being a small rubber band-like part that broke during the first year of use. The CD player is useless.

But, it is soothing and will work out until the real thing is finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing and great bath experience!","review":"I'm not sure why some of the previous reviewers had such trouble getting the mat to attach to the tub. Mine attaches just fine. You have to put a little water on the tub and get the suction cups wet for them to attach well, but they stay on just fine. The mat is very comfortable to lay on and the bath is even more pleasing if you get a nice bath pillow to lay your head on. There is a dial to set either a very low pressure of bubbles on up to a high pressure, and I found the low to medium pressure very relaxing, and the high pressure to be great for a nice back and neck massage. When jacuzzi's cost thousands of dollars and you can get the same experience for a hundred bucks, I consider this to be a piece of heaven at a very inexpensive cost! One of the best gifts I've ever received!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely worth your while","review":"A very good book. Grusa writes with a very Czech sense of humor and combines it with a Grassian sense of magic. Although I'll try to avoid plot summary, a little is necessary: the protagonist, in his search for a job, is required to fill out a questionnaire with explicit instructions to not leave anything out. With these orders in mind, he then tells the history of his family from the beginning. This is typical of the Czech means of resistance to whatever oppression they face, and you can see it in Hasek's \\"The Good Soldier Svejk\\" and Hrabal's \\"Closely Watched Trains.\\" Overall, it's funny, magical, epic (in its own way) and a lot of fun to read. As I said before, it's definitely worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to TA","review":"This book cuts through the hype of TA and provides an outstanding introduction to transactional analysis.

First and foremost, it is lacking in detail. There's no way you can take what you \\"learn\\" in this book and then immediately sell your home FSBO. You need a lot more information on closing, home inspection, and numerous other issues on which this book barely touches. Furthermore, the formatting of the book, which highlights the opinions of \\"experts,\\" is often contradictory without any insight into or explanation of the contrary opinions. Rather, mutually exclusive opinions (and facts!) are presented side-by-side. Finally, there are tons of typos and grammatical errors in this book -- which is predominantly fluff, any way. The type face is large and the book is thin. Although there isn't a lot of material to be found on selling FSBO (for obvious reasons), would-be FSBO sellers would be smart to continue their searches rather than stopping here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"Piper does an amazing job of describing, in detail, every single thing you need to know about selling your house on your own.

The books were literate in their context, never watered down, but not so abstract that a high school student couldn't read and follow. The Teacher's Edition's were the best of any series (until Houghton Mifflin changed the format, and made them less teacher friendly). I still have 2 TE's of this book and the solutions key, and still refer to it when I need to...it beats any precalculus book out today.

The really surprising thing about it that these are not freaks. Such people are not common and they are not met with by many. That is perhaps because they associate with those who serve their ends and they are mostly those who are under their spell. But they are not rare. I believe that if history were examined with the purpose of identifying such people and following the course of their lives much would be learned about the dynamics of human events.

She wishes she had a grandma, and a doll(Holly) she sees in a toy store window, after getting off the train early, in a little town called Mill Vally. She does this because of what happened with the lights there, thinking it was for her. She had been told not to get off of the train before reaching where she was sent.

However, two of these pieces were previously released on the \\"Glassworks\\" collection and as such fit better in their original context. And the cycle \\"In the Upper Room\\" is here not presented en toto...which is a major point of irritation, given the extended playing time of CDs. However, this is the only place you can find the ensemble version of the 'Funeral' from \\"Akhenaten\\", which was a show-stopper from Glass's ensemble concerts of the mid-80s. So, while this is a plus, the inclusion of the 'recycled' \\"Glassworks\\" tracks is annoying, and the chop-up of the \\"In the Upper Room\\" cycle should be considered criminal, and someone at CBS needs their head examined for continuing the vinyl sequencing present here.

Now I'm back at Amazon to purchase it. It's one I want to read again in leisure time, to savor, not only for the wealth of history it provides, and the painfully honest look into family self-deceptions, but for the absolutely beautiful writing it offers. The courage she shows in telling this story, and the honest treatment of her family (which I expected her to protect and make excuses for) and painstaking fairness to other characters, sometimes at the expense of her own history, is breath taking. Many of Ms. Lessard's descriptive passages are almost musical in quality, without ever falling to sappiness, and they bleed a depth of insight that one sometimes grasps only at a second glance. Her metaphorical passages are the most beautiful - I will never forget many of them. A joy and a privilege to read.

Billed as being \\"part memoir, part biography,\\" it is actually about 5/6 rambling, disjointed ruminations about the author's own life and only maybe 1/6 about White's life (and that part contains noting revelatory, insightful or new). Some passages are written about twice, pieces of different stories are inserted randomly at several different (and inexplicably non-chronological) places, and the parts about White and Nesbit are taken (without question or analysis) almost verbatim from Nesbit's own memoirs.

I like it because it will work with only a few days worth of hair growth. When I use it on my arms, some of the hair seems to break off instead of being pulled out so that part grows back rather quickly. I can see areas on my legs where hair doesn't grow any more and it's thanks to this epilator. The annoying thing about epilators is they can only do a small section at a time while with waxing you get to remove larger strips at one go. It draws out the pain.

It presents more of how the Order of Hermes *should* be, with the flavor of the middle ages steeped in its rituals and areas of study. It presents rules that magi may use to develop or join secret societies that teach special magic (\\"mystae magic\\"), and in doing so introduces a balanced method for magical characters to \\"develop\\" magical Virtues and Flaws long after the character creation process. The powers are very strong, definitely intended for experienced players. The book is very wordy and cerebral, but inspiring nonetheless. Like all Ars Magica books, the layout is concise and simple, and easy to read, but the topic is a bit esoteric and so requires multiple sessions to really \\"get\\" it.

Although if the twang is going to be surgically removed, there needs to be something of substance to fill the emptiness and Joe Goldmark leaves a soulless void. Goldmark's predictable songs are often punctuated with a Kenny G sounding saxophone or vocals that are simply embarrassing. The overall mood is light and happy as the tunes project a powerful optimism. If you enjoy light instrumental rock, you may dig this; if you're a steel guitar buff, run like hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Like Bull, But Sensitive Like Squirrel","review":"If you are searching for some great steel guitar instrumental music that goes in a different direction from the usual steel, this Joe Goldmark CD is totally enjoyable. By \\"different direction\\" I am referring to other than \\"country\\". Joe writes and plays a lot of his own wonderful rock and pop originals, plus throws in some offbeat covers. He plays a wacky version of the jazz standard \\"Take Five,\\" but plays it in 4/4 time, and does a beautiful version of Brian Wilson's \\"Bells Of Madness.\\" He also does a strong cover of the Blind Faith \\"Presence Of The Lord,\\" and ends the album with Elvis Costello's \\"Peace Love and Understanding.\\" As you can see, this is not your standard country steel album, but I would bet the ranch that even pure country enthusiasts will come around to this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important lesson for Christians today","review":"After listening to Chuck Missler describe Daniel's vision, I feel like I was right there seeing it myself!

Recently I have done research and noticed that many vets say that those mixes are not good for them because they contain corn and also rats tend to only pick certain things out so they don't get a complete diet. So I decided to by Regal Rat as it seems to be the best complete diet out there that doesn't contain corn. Would have rated this 5 stars but I can't get my rats to eat it, they simply don't like it and would rather starve than eat this food. It's been about a week and I'll keep trying to transition them to this food but so far no luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"George likes it!","review":"Our rescue rat, George, really likes this food.

Like most people said, many rats will not like this food, so when getting a pet rat it may be wise to get them when they reach 4 months (the protein in tis food is too low to give to younger rats). I gave my rats LM Animal Farms Mouse & Rat Food (although this food is not very good the protein is very high) until they reached 4 months and I gradually switched them over. They were so young so I guess they have an acquired taste for it, they actually really like it now.This product is definitely worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"My rats are very picky","review":"My rats are very picky about what food they will and won't eat.

Yummy!","review":"We recently became the guardian of our son's rat. The rat disliked his previous food (starts with K, available at pet stores). We bought Oxbow Regal Rat Food based on Amazon reviews. The rat really likes the stuff, and shows real enthusiasm for eating it. This is a rat who recently lost his only brother, and who has no hobbies other than eating - he doesn't really want to be out of his cage. We have spoiled him with yummy table scraps like turkey with gravy, poached salmon, and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Nevertheless, he really enjoys the Oxbow food.The shape of the Oxbow food is different than most pellets. It is triangular, about .5 inches (13 mm) on each side, and about .1 inches (3mm) thick. It is a handy size for a rat.Bottom line: Yummy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rats Like it","review":"My wife is the rat lover. She is very picky about what she will feed her pets.

It will not get you past the test by itself, get the Exam Cram book also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"Don't bother to buy this book unless you are willing to invest at least one thousand dollars in incredibly expensive software.

I purchased this book for them and the kindergarten Spanish class I am teaching. I'd recommend it for native or fluent Spanish speaking children.

I do not want to teach my child that animals actually like zoos. It'd be much better if he came from a circus and ended up at a reserve, or something. This is just horrible and I think I'm going to burn it. I do not want to teach my son those values."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor judgement","review":"I had never read this book as I child but since I knew it was a classic I decided to buy it for my daughter. I never realized that Curious George and his owner smoke pipes and make it look appealing. I guess this has to do with the fact that this book is very old.

Ms Fowler seems to have thrown them in for a chapter or two just to say \\"hi,\\" which is not good enough for me. I too am tired of Hud. I want Benni to remain faithful to Gabe, and the silly flirting with Hud is a waste of space. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quilting Mysteries","review":"If you like quilting or arts & crafts and also like a good read, you'll enjoy this series by Earlene Fowler. All the books are light reading and enjoyable but still keep you guessing right to the end. Benni Harper is a very likeable character and easy to identify with, especially if you have an insatiable curosity about everything that gets you into occasionable trouble with someone. Books all have a little humor and not a lot of violence & bad language. Just an easy and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll fall in love with the music from Shakespeare in Love","review":"This is my favorite romantic movie, and the soundtrack delivers beautiful, soul-stirring classical music, taken from Stephen Warbeck's score. I love to listen to this album when relaxing and studying (or having a candlelit dinner). ;) If you are a classical music fan, or if you just want to relive the beauty of the motion picture \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", pop this CD into your player and get ready for your heart to be captured once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful outing for Warbeck","review":"Stephen Warbeck's score is magnificent; the only problem, albeit relatively small, I have with it is that he neglects to develop the sweeping opening theme, found in track 1, and to a lesser degree track 7, further. I kept waiting for it to reappear and go somewhere new and exciting, only to be somewhat let down at the end of the CD. Once past this, however, and in all other respects, the score makes for wonderful and engaging listening. I hear new subtle nuances every time I play it.

Being a fan of Medieval/Renaissance music, I expected very much to enjoy this CD. I was extremely dissapointed. It was terribly dull. Nothing sounded unique at all, or had any kind of Renaissance flare to it. To be blunt, it bored the hell out of me. I definitely didn't notice this music at all even as I was watching the movie. It never captured my attention in any way. Now I know why it didn't. Its the same wishy washy theme to every romantic movie.

There are even some \\"special\\" recipes that take more steps but you'd want to make them for a special occasion. I wouldn't cook every single meal out of this book (who uses a recipe book for every meal anyway?) but when I have time or a hankering for something a little more put together than a sandwich or beans and rice I pull it out. Some of my favourites are the \\"cheese\\" sauce and the tofu walnut loaf. There are some ingredients used that might be hard to find outside the US (like egg replacer or agar agar) but they are only found in some of the recipes.

Mr. Franscell has a beautiful way with words that touch a heart while they tell a story, too. The whole journey in the book was like a journey for me back to a place I haven't really seen for more than 20 years just like these characters in the book. The story is funny and sad, and familiar and shocking. It doesn't let you rest very long.I recommend this novel to anyone who wants to read a good book that does more than entertain.

That seems like the mark of a great book to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Born Storyteller","review":"Ron Franscell is the master of his domain--words and Wyoming. Angel Fire is a novel of perfect symmetry that details the destruction of one village in Vietnam and the survival of another in the Western Plains of Wyoming. Mr. Franchell's story is told through the lives of two brothers whose journey takes them into the dark places of a collective soul and reveals a bond that goes beyond time and space. The story is told with compassion, grace, and a master's use of the language. Reminiscent of N. Scott Momaday's, House Made of Dawn.

This could be the most beautiful book I've ever read. Period. Ron Franscell's writing is poetry in prose-form. I felt like I was reading one of the great American novels from the golden age of literature, but yet this is a story from our own time. This novel about two brothers' love and loyalty for each other transcends time, but it is still a sensual experience for anybody who grew up in a small town (like me) or during the tumultuous 50s and 60s (like me, too). It's all here, so close you can taste it and smell it. You want to read a future classic? Read this provocative story from Ron Franscell, whose name I hope to see on many more book jackets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A profound and thoughtful novel","review":"This poignant story of the bond between two brothers and their distinct, but separate journeys through life is simply magnificent! Every page is full of insight. Written in an eloquent style, the book tackles all the major themes: love, life, death, war, insanity. The timeless aspect of Angel Fire gives it its appeal as do the characters who populate it. The ghost stories that prevail throughout are cleverly designed to correspond to the inner ghosts that inhabit each of the various characters, and the different ways in which the respective characters deal with their own private pain makes for fascinating reading. Angel Fire is about the ebb and flow of life; it is about divergence and convergence. Above all, it is about establishing a center of gravity, a place of stability from which to fend off the demons that lie within each of us. A gem of a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful character development, surprise ending...","review":"This definitely makes my top 10 list of great novels of the nineties.

It's good. A story of two brothers who lost each other in the Vietnam war and are now struggling to find the frayed ends of their connecting wires. The wires were snapped into by the terror of the war and the awesome distance between those you love back home and those you fear, who surround you in the dark. One brother waits in the quiet netherworld, while the other steadfastly searches the unlit corners, and gently tries to bind each fray, one by one, back together. It seems almost hopeless at times. Still there continues a faint ray of hope as though lit by the fire of an angel.This story took me on a soft-hurt kind of journey, moving restlessly over the memories of a childhood. The way was not easy. It moved the heart.

I watched them as they started to mosey off the property, I called and they didnt listen. I sent a low charge to the collars and still no response. I got to level 5 they yelped, I cringed, but both came running back. OMG...after two times of having to send a signal to their collars they now come when called. Neither try to leave the property and the both stay by my side. The one dog likes to chase the horses, but with SportDog she now has been trained not to. This product has made my life and worries so much easier. It is simple to use, directions & training guide is very easy to follow. If your a dog owner with behavior problems I DEFINETLY recommend getting the SportDog field training collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality","review":"Use this paper to make die cut aliens.

My 2 and 4-year-old girls have so much fun playing on it together (and they don't fight over this toy because they need each other to play on it). It's light, and extremely easy to assemble - the main frame and two handles - no screws needed. The price is affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naturally Playful Teeter Totter","review":"Several months ago, I purchased this gift for my two toddler grandsons ages 2 and 3 1/2. Since it looks like an outdoor toy, I thought that it wouldn't be used until the weather up north improved. I was wrong. It is in the playroom and used every day. Although they don't use it for long stretches of time, it is used several times a day. Young visitors always try it out, too. The toy still looks brand. It is sturdy and supports older children as well. It provides active play for the boys even on cold dreary days when the boys can't go outside to play. I highly recommend this quality toy for its durability, good looks and appeal to all young children. Three small children can use it at one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great teamwork toy for toddlers.","review":"This toy is extremely durable and my kids love it.

I wasnt sure at first because the box was so small and i thought \\"how could that fit even 2?\\" but when I got it home and the girls sat on it, it was perfect. they go up and down far more than the other one did. and no asembly. just snap the handles on. my girls are 5, 3, and 1 the box says weight limit is 40 lbs per child and my 5 year old is 52lbs, and it seems to hold her ok. but to warn you... when my 1 year old 23 lbs sat on it. and my 3 year old sat with her the poor dear went flying in the air and landed in the middle.just remember its for 2 year olds and up lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre School Director","review":"I purchased this for our pre school at church.

I was trying to find something she could play on by herself or if she has a friend over. She lasted about 2 minutes and was bored. So were her friends. They tell you 3 kids can play on this and that is NOT so! We tried 3 and they would easily have knocked their heads together and these are little framed kids. Not so pleased! Would return it but she likes to stand up on it and jump off of it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teeter Totter....tips...","review":"This is a really fun toy for my 2.5 and 4.5 year olds but it can be dangerous. My son can easily topple my younger daughter over backwards just by getting off it quickly. The teeter totter then pops up in the air and crashes down on top of her. I would still say that it is a fun and fairly safe toy. It just works better (obviously) with kids that are fairly similar in size and weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Toy","review":"This toy is fun, and it was all I wanted it to be for my kiddos. Kids do need supervising and rules, however, because they did get to rocking pretty high - the teeter totter says right on it that children should be cautioned against rocking too high and I could see why, especially if there are mixed ages riding on it - the older one(s) can handle more than the younger one(s). Assembly was VERY easy - no tools, it snapped together very easily. I feared that the handles would come loose, but they haven't. It seems very sturdy and the kids love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this toy","review":"I have a two year old, and he can rock alone in the middle, or with friends when they come over. One complaint though is that the handles are black and get very hot in the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Right Out Of The Box!","review":"Fun right out of the box! We bought this teeter totter for my son's second birthday. All we had to do was pop on the handles and it was ready to go. ( Nice feature when a kids are waiting to try it out.) My son (2yrs) and my daughter (6 yrs) immediately hopped on and were teeter tottering in no time. There was no fighting over who would try it first since it can accomodate up to three children (up to 40 lbs. ea.) If one of them did want to rock alone, they could by using the center seat. I did have to remind my daughter not to rock too fast or get off suddenly or her brother would go flying. But that's just a general rule for a teeter totter. I love the fact that it is done in earth tones and made to look like stone and wood. It's a nice addition to the backyard. I feel it was money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy!","review":"I bought this toy for my two daughters, ages 2 and 4-1/2. They really like riding on it, although my older daughter isn't quite as interested in it. I really like that it's a natural color and it blends in with our backyard. It's also got a cool design and is very sturdy (sometimes I \\"sit\\" on one side while my younger daughter is on the other side and it holds me fine). The other thing I like about this toy is it can be used by one, two or three kids at a time so it's very versatile.

I am also a trance artist (Alpha Project), so I think my opinion holds some weight. When you're talking music like trance always be skeptical when you see a CD or double CD that has 17-20 songs per CD. This Compilation has 20 songs on each CD. Now a lot of these songs are great but this mix really stinks. Every time a nice groove gets going it transitions to the next cut. We're not talking smooth transitions here, we're talking four bars and you're completely in the next song (basically no transition). It's like they cut out the intro and outro and just left the main theme of each song. Trance music is all about building up the tention, and this double CD definitely doesn't do that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shirt made in wrong size,and fit,but it was cute","review":"I purchased this shirt when I was preganat and it was way too small it looked like a kids shirt.

Every network administrator I've ever talked to removes those tools for security reasons.I was hoping to learn new tricks for setting up secure Linux network servers and services. At the very least I was looking to have a good reference around for various services and programs. I was very disappointed to find that the book covered things in very small detail. So disappointed that I sent it back for a refund. In my opinion this book does not reflect the real world environment as shown by the 4+ years I've been working with Linux in a networked environment.

As noted in several other reviews, however, the stand that comes packaged with the Quickcam Pro 3000 leaves something to be desired. To be blunt: the stand is functionally worthless, and Logitech should know better than to pair a top-of-the-line webcam with such seriously flawed accessory equipment.If you own this cam (or any cam with a standard female screw-mount base) an excellent and inexpensive mounting option is the Ambico V-0615 Multi-Purpose Mini-Tripod. This 4.25 inch tripod fits the cam perfectly and allows free rotation and swivel, yet is also able to be locked into position.

The only reason I give this webcam 4 stars is because it has some problems with the msn messenger. For some reason I can't get it on.. and the stand of this cam.

So I tend to average it out and if the temperature is at or over a 100, I also double check with the underarm thermometer. It's a very convient device and you can take your childs temparature when they are sleeping or distracted.

I can take it 5 times in different ears, and get all completely different numbers. Then take rectal and have something altogether different!other than that its very quick, quiet, and built well.but i had to go with 1 star, since accuracy is this tools only job .. and it fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless toy","review":"The thermometerthat gives you different temperature every time you measure is useless and cannot even be called a thermometer. It's just a well built useless toy that dings into your ear and into your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate","review":"This thermometer does not accurately measure body temperature. Repeatedly, I took my temperature (using the same ear each time), and each time I got a different result. The range was significant - up to 2 degrees Fahrenheit!I performed a comparison test using an oral thermometer, and the result was consistent. Unfortunately, I can't use an oral thermometer on an infant, so I need to find another thermometer to use with my daughter - this one is simply not accurate enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solve All Your Problems","review":"In this clearly written and easy to understand format, Pastor Abergel explains not only the source of problems, but how to overcome and live above them.

Get this Book!!","review":"This book is a down-to-earth, right to the heart of the matter guide on God's ways to overcome every problem that we encounter in life. As I read the book, I was challenged to confront my problems with the word of God, and encouraged that I, too, despite my shortcomings, could grow and mature, and be used of God. I love the way Dr. Abergel has layed out the book. I have used it as a reference many times when I wanted to look up what God says about a specific problem I was having. I could find the solution to my problem easily in the book, with the scripture reference right there. Then I applied the instructions! This book is such a great tool for anyone who wants to overcome their problems instead of just learn to cope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"If you are looking for the perfect boot, this is it.

Barbra Is More Than A Beautful Vocalist, She Is One HECK Of A Singer!! She Can Sing Anything And Sing It Well. Ballads, Broadway, Pop, Rock, Disco & Standards, No Other Singer Will Ever Be Able To Do What She Has!! She Is A National Treasure!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbra's worst!!!","review":"I love Barbra, and I especially love hwer pop recordings ('70's stuff). I bought this album the minute it came out and I DO love it because I love her. But it sucks! It is so scattered and non-essential. Sooooo commercial. It is Barbra's MTV album - she tried 2 music videos from this album - her ifrst- and they are terrible. She is no Madonna when it comes to music videos, that's for sure. Of course, worse albums were coming up (Til He Loved Me, ALL of her latest albums) but I can forgive her since The Broadway Album came next and redeemed my faith in Barbra. I'd buy it for a few songs and as a curiosity but it should never be taken as representative of Barbra. Try Lazy Afternoon instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented as any other album from her","review":"As some of people already mentioned in their reviews, this Streisand album is very peculiar and recurrently underestimated by music experts. From my persective it has its own value, setting clearly her capability to sing whatever she wants with no restrains to predefined musical genre. Definetively an album I enjoy and I will recommend for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth another listen","review":"Emotion has been criticized as the worst Barbra album. I don't agree with that estimation. There are some beautiful songs on this album. I agree with another reviewer that \\"Heart Don't Change My Mind\\" should have been the major single from this album. It was co-written by megawriter Diane Warren and has a John Robinson drum track. I remember requesting this song on the radio when I was attending graduate school in the mid-80s; the song got a lot of airplay on that station. I also like \\"Best I Could\\" (same writers as \\"Comin' In and Out of Your Life\\"), \\"Here We Are at Last,\\" \\"Emotion\\" with the Pointer Sisters in the background, and \\"When I Dream.\\" I would say that out of the ten songs featured on this album, I really like eight of them. That's not too bad in my opinion. Take another listen to Emotion. It has some beautiful songs and Barbra's vocals are strong on most tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must have recording on all scales!","review":"This is Barbra's best \\"pop\\" work that showcases her many styles. The music is fun and upbeat and at times \\"haunting\\".(like Left in the dark) Heart Don't Change my Mind should have been a hit record because no one could pull this song off like Barbra can. Time Machine and Make No Mistake... are instant favorites! NO ONE can match Barbra's style and voice even in the year 2002 and listening back to this recording makes you long for more!! EMOTION is a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a mess","review":"I am a Barbra Streisand fan, not fanatic, but fan. I enjoy her music and movies, but find this album confusing. There are too many different producers all doing different styles of songs. There is no continuity to this album. There is a John Mellencamp tune, \\"you are a step in the right direction\\" that was totally in the wrong direction of the album. \\"When I dream\\" is so lush that you almost fall asleep, but it is so bad that you don't. That being said, this is Streiand and there are also some good tracks on the album as well. Jim Steinman's \\"Left in the Dark again\\" and the Kim Carnes written and duet partner on \\"Make no Mistake, He's Mine\\" are both wonderful songs. The rest of the album is simply stuff we've heard before, not bad, not memorable. Which is sad for an artist like Streisand. Fortunately, she rebounded with \\"The Broadway Album\\" a couple of years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of EMOTION","review":"As a devoted fan I can only say that the title track with the Pointer Sisters is the ONLY redeemable moment on this album.What truly baffles me however is why this album is here at #45, and there is no mention of Streisand's classic 1963 debut album on the list. EMOTION lacks the honesty and experimentation of her debut and it has lasted far better than this, thing, which sounded dated the day I bought it as a college student in 1984."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Emotion\\" album by Barbra Streisand","review":"In my opinion, this was one of Barbra's best albums. Years ago I wore out the cassette tape - happiness is being able to hear these great songs and relive the memories that go with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steisand Soaring Vocals are magic","review":"Streisand Soars on fantastic vocals. This album came out in 1984 after Yentle the Previous year. It is pure Streisand Magic. It has an upbeat song Emotion with a classy video with Roger Daltry as Babs love interest. a Great duet with Kim Carnes. THe lovely Clear Sailing hits an emotional note since it is a song my ex and I shared as one of ours. Barbra's voice is a gift from heaven and any album of hers is worth a listen. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"1980's Barbra\\"","review":"Barbra Streisand's \\"Emotion\\" album came out in October, 1984 and went to #19 on Billboard and eventually was certified Platinum selling a million copies making this release a certified hit.Three songs were released as singles with the biggest being \\"Make No Mistake, He's Mine\\", a duet with Kim Carnes (also written by her) that would be recorded by many other artists most notably Kenny Rogers and Ronnie Milsap. Other highlights here include the Barbra Streisand/John Melencamp written song \\"Your a Step in the Right Direction\\", an upbeat rock number. My favorite track from \\"Emotion is the Diane Warren/Robbie Buchanan number \\"Heart Don't Change My Mind\\".This record was followed in 1985 by the blockbuster \\"The Broadway Album\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and worth a read","review":"As a major Disney fan I was excited to give this a read. I won't rehash much of the plot as you can gather that from other reviews here, but I will say the writer has a very readable style and the pages turn fast. It's an entertaining premise and it did have me wondering page after page how it was all going to turn out.My main complaint was I didn't feel the characters as a whole were developed as well as they could have been. They did not come across as alive or 'real' which surprised me given the overall strength of the writing. The main character that did seem real was 'Walt', and I felt that this may have been helped by my familiarity with him from other books.Still, I'd definitely say it's worth a read for Disney fans who would like to see this iconic individual brought to life in a bit of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"If you are looking for a fun and fascinating read then by all means get a hold of Waking Walt. A fascinating premise is pulled off successfully in this thriller that kept me up more than one night as I could not put it down.The premise is an excellent one. What if the urban legend was true? What if Walt Disney really was placed into a cryogenic deep freeze and was revived some 40 years after his death? What would he think of all the advancements and what would he think about the current state of his \\"dream project\\" the Experimental Prototype City of Tomorrow?In this book, you get to find out.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. There were some very funny parts, some terrific characters and more than one point where I was genuinely moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, wonderfully brought to life!","review":"I just finished this book and I'm wondering why it took me so long to buy it! Pamela Holm's characters are lifelike and likeable-very important aspects when you are reading a novel and have to spend 200-plus pages with these people! I even really liked the little girl, Jewel! To me, children are hard characters to make likable and are often depicted as too cute or precocious, but not so here! The story takes place in San Francisco and Holm knows her city well! The writing is extremely descriptive, but taut. This was a very enjoyable read and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good, well written story of relationships, friendships and the struggles and joys of getting through this life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about the movie Tanya","review":"The movie is absolutely hilarious.

I enjoyed his style of writing and his ability to reach the reader on several levels. I am looking forward to implement many of his suggestions, and I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in improving and perfecting both their physical and mental conditions. It is an overall excellent book. The other author that I highly recommend is Dr. Tombak. He is as much down-to-earth as Dr. Weil.

(4 stars, the 1 star is a typo) ****","review":"Inside the book Dr. Andrew Weil provides information in a clear way (I like the way he writes) that should help his readers age in a healthy way. But for the front cover I subtract one star. The doctor tries to hide how big and round he really is on the cover by dressing in black. And the big white beard makes his body covered in black appear smaller relative to his head, an illusion of fitness. By not admitting that he has a weight problem Dr. Weil may tend to redefine obesity in an unhealthy direction (maybe that is why he is so popular with his \\"large\\" public). Weil should demonstrate some real self-discipline (meditating apparently is not enough) to his readers by eating less and excercising more (even if that means one less book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Don't EVEN bother buying this book.

It's completely unnecessary. And, I don't think that reviews that are decisive help anybody. You can see a subject matter from many angles. But this man is fat! I don't care how many pills he takes. You simply don't eat so much food! Once he became fat, he then realized that he had to stop being fat. So what did he do? He dressed in black. Like Orson Welles. So he would look less fat when he goes on TV. It doesn't matter if you eat 77 nutritious foods or are taking 700 pills. You eat less. This is a no brainer. You lead by example. And if you keep adding fat to your system; you will be unhealthy. Weil is a very good doctor. He is very smart. But I think that you have to walk your talk. Just think about it.

I believe that you will read with great interest how the cause of a number of chronic diseases are the result of the inflammatory process (I concur) and what you need to do to combat inflammation. I have had a number of patients tell me that they have changed their diet and started an exercise program after reading this book. They have changed because this book makes a strong case WHY they need to change.

Then he goes on to talk about how natural the aging process is and how it should be viewed as positive in many ways.

If we armed ourselves with dictionaries, medical school textbooks and were willing to take volumnious amounts of notes, perhaps we would learn as much about the topic of aging as Dr. Weil labors to teach us. I'll never know because I not only became bored beyond belief after the first few chapters, but Dr. Weil's relentless message of, \\"age is not fun but there is nothing you can do about it, so accept it....\\" dragged me into despair at times.

However I find this new musical effort a vast improvement from other previous recent ones, which in my opinion, missed the mark.Listening to this new album it is obvious that America's new director and bass player Jorge Machado Duran has added his great musical expertise to the musical arrangements and sound of this great charanga ensemble, a much needed improvement. The strings, percussion, piano and chorus are impeccable. The orquesta's flute player, the dynamic Manuel Sanchez Wanbrug masters his instrument, leaving nothing to be desired and matching the talents of all his America predecessors. I recommend this great album and I hope more \\"REAL RHYTMS\\" CD's by Cuba's great new \\"ORQUESTA AMERICA\\" are forthcoming, along with a world tour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic excuse for a jacuzzi","review":"I am very disappointed with this product.

I inadvertently tightened a thumb screw when I replaced the batteries. I have never been able to accurately realign the center target, and $90 is going in the trash. I cannot see any reason to have such a wide range of adjustments possible on an eyepiece used to center for initial alignment to begin with. Additionally, there was so much lubricant on the recitile frame, a tiny amount smeared when moving the adjustment screws. There is now a distortion when illuminated. I am switching to an Orion with a fixed rectile."},{"rating":"1","title":"it doesent do the job","review":"the print date is not legible, and it is realy small, better to buy a self ink one than this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"AFTER A CONCERT","review":"This item is wonderfull.

Bloodflowers was the final studio album due on the contract. Bloodflowers and the accompanying tour was going to be the good bye from Robert and the boys. The tour went so well, and Robert and the boys had so much fun, that the last word was rumored to be....it's NOT the end. The catalog of Cure songs was only to be available for two years past the end of the tour. It was more the record companies idea for this Greatest Hits collection, and Robert did what he thought best under the constraints upon him.I'm not overjoyed with this collection, but do like that they were all remastered, and I think the bonus disc is pretty good. Accustic versions of all the songs, name one other band willing to do that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY IT FOR LESS","review":"I gave this 4 stars originally, but I have to re-rate it. The acoustic disc is unecessary, and sorry, but the material The Cure has been putting out the last few years is really disappointing (to me at least...same thing with U2 and Smashing Pumpkins). I don't feel it deserved to be on this set. Plus they left out a few older, great songs so that there could be room for those newer, mediocre ones. It's just my opinion, and if any of you want to buy it for less AND get it in just a few days, I'm putting my copy up for sale on this site as of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disk 2 is what makes this worth while.","review":"Disk 2 is what makes this worth while for The Cure fan. It has the same songs as on disk 1, but in alternative arrangements. With a little work, you can find videos to some of these tracks on YouTube.As a greatest hits package, it is deficient. There are too many songs that are not included. If you are new to the band you may want to pass on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Smith at his best","review":"Robert Smith and the Boys shows their masterpiece works in this latest Cure endeavor. With 18 tracks ranging from their early years as starving musicians to the latest addition on their repertoire as a cult-hero pop icons, \\"The Cure: Greatest Hits\\" encapsulates the influential legacy the group has made in the music industry. The repackaged and remastered selections features two new song \\"17.Cut Here\\" and \\"18.Just Say Yes\\", both of whom reflects the evolved style; quasi-electronica which the Cure has adopted in their previous releases.CD2 in this compilation features acoustic variations in the songs that they present in this greatest hits album. Effectively doing so, and perhaps showing their age, Robert Smith and the gang transforms their music to a more refined and sophisticated version by showing their true musical prowess without the aid of synthesizers and such. In all, this album is a must have for Cure aficionados, and new fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh, it's ALRIGHT...","review":"The Cure is a versatile and unique band whose history spans the many different styles that they exemplify. Saying that, this disc is kinda blah at best. The fact that several key songs were left off this disc to make room for a few tracks from the \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" album is simply astounding, not to mention the fact that it appears that they completely left out ANY tracks off of \\"Bloodflowers\\"!The second disc with acoustic versions of all the tracks on the first disc is also blah at best. The edge and drama are missing, leaving a Vegas lounge feel to them.If you wish to check out a truly good Cure \\"greatest hits\\" disc, get either \\"Staring At The Sea\\" (singles 77-87) or \\"Galore\\" (singles 87-97), in that order."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure Greatest Hits (The Cliff Notes Version)","review":"\\"Greatest Hits\\" is really the Cliff Notes version of the band's two vastly superior compilations: \\"Staring at the Sea\\" and \\"Galore.\\" You're better off getting those two discs than spending your cash on this one, even with the bonus disc of acoustic tracks which feature the Cure at its most perfunctory. For the diehard fan, the flaws are obvious: it completely bypasses the \\"Pornography\\" LP, neglects \\"Hot Hot Hot,\\" and omits \\"Pictures of You.\\" There's no \\"Catepillar,\\" \\"Killing an Arab,\\" or \\"Fascination Street.\\" Getting back to the live disc, it's pointless and the songs are done without passion. It's as if a covers band filled in for them in the studio and did the songs. If the record label had to include a second disc, it should have been a collection of b-sides such as obscure cuts like \\"Harold and Joe\\" or \\"Fear of Ghosts.\\" All in all, this disc is a missed opportunity and should be avoided by first-time listeners of the Cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute drivel from an amazing band.","review":"Unfortunately, this is not the album to give you a retrospective of The Cure's greatest hits. It is an abysmal repackaging of 2 of their other compliations, with many of their signature songs left off. Plus, the Acoustic versions of the 'hits' are atrocious. They are dry, uninspired, and plain hard to listen to. Look to The Cure's other albums (all of them - except for this one) and you will find a truly astonishing band. Don't let this album ruin them for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD1: repackaged, CD2: *yawn*","review":"As the owner of over 60 cure CDs, of course I had to add this to my collection. Now, I wish I'd spent the (money) on something worth while.CD1: Been there, done that.CD2:It's always good to hear familiar songs done in a different way. BUT, there is just NO soul in any of these recordings. I swear I can hear Robert yawning in many of these songs. It's just plain painful to listen to. If it's not clear, these 'unplugged' songs are NOT the same as the absolutely beautiful \\"MTV Unplugged\\" session (not commercially available).Note to Robert: you don't have to e-n-u-n-c-i-a-t-e to the point of speaking the words my friend.Note to Cure fans: Don't purchase this only to ruin your impression of this otherwise great group.Note to Cure curious: Investigate ANY other Cure CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NEED FOR THIS CD IF YOU HAVE \\"galore\\"!","review":"This CD is a joke, they put out a greatest hits compilation a few years ago called \\"Galore\\".This is THE SAME CD! end of story.Save your money.

Lets review the CURE's output - 1978 to 1992 - 9 studio albums, 3 collections (Boys dont cry was a compilation, Japanese Whispers, Standing on the Beach), 2 live albums, 1 remix album. 1993 to 2001 - 2 studio albums, 2 live albums, 1 live EP, 1 instrumental cassette, 2 hit collections, and handful of tracks for movies. the cure are the next rolling stones. pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reverse the discs and you'll like it a LOT more.","review":"Yes, as posted here by many others, this is not a really strong representation of The Cure. It completely zaps a few important songs that WERE hits, like \\"Pictures of You\\" and \\"Hot Hot Hot,\\" and hardly scratches the surface of the pre-MTV era Cure. If you need those songs, get \\"Staring At The Sea\\" and \\"Galore\\" as a twofer.On the other hand, if you're a Cure buff, the bonus disc is a treat. All 18 songs from the \\"Hits\\" disc, played out acoustically and live in studio. The band sounds loose and chipper, obviously having a jolly good time with songs they've done to death. I'd have bought THAT as a single disc without any complaints! So just consider the live CD the main attraction and the studio \\"A\\" disc as the bonus. You'll like \\"Greatest Hits\\" a lot more that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"for newbies only","review":"I have only recently gotten into the Cure, but they have quickly become one of my favorite bands. Their sound is unique and instantly appealing. That having been said, this album is NOT their best work. As a compilation, it is incomplete, tossing out some of their best songs for some irritating ones. The objective was to make a road map of the Cure's developement, but were songs like \\"the Walk\\" and \\"Never Enough\\" really that popular? As an album, it is too dissconnected. the songs don't fit together, and don't flow at all.The accoustic disc is dissappointing, as well. The performances are drab and emotionless, like Robert and the band were too tired to care. The production and arrangements are boring and uninspired. There are much better live albums out there.If you are looking for a primer to the Cure's mountain of work, this is your album. Otherwise, don't bother. \\"Cut Here\\", one of the new songs on this album, is great, but the rest is terribly sub-par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly The Cure's \\"greatest\\" greatest!","review":"Attention Cure fans: RUSH, RUSH, RUSH to your local cd store (or right here at Amazon) and BUY THIS CD! It's terrific!! I must admit, I am a HUGE Cure fan (going back to 1985), and I was a bit skeptical about \\"another\\" greatest hits cd (so close to Galore??). When I heard about a bonus disc of acoustic versions, my interest peaked considerably and wisely, I bought the cd (not here though, sorry Amazon). A wise investment to get the double-disk set though, Cure fans will LOVE the acoustic versions of older songs, done with a fresh twist (even \\"Boys Don't Cry\\"-really!). The new songs are wonderful, although I liked \\"Just Say Yes\\" more on the acoustic cd. Saffron and Smith harmonize nicely enough, but the version with just Robert's vocals is far better. \\"Cut Here\\" adds a little \\"New Order\\" sound, by way of guitar which is really nice. You'll love it all though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Smooth!","review":"For me , this album is one of a kind, just to hear the acoustic versions of the classics (A forest, The Walk, Close to me...) are worth the time you're taking on buying it.

If you've spent a considerable amount of time reading about homeschooling then you probably wouldn't need this book.

But this particular recording isn't of her best, Barbirolli conducting the London Symphony Orchestra is highly regarded as the best. No two performances were exactly alike and the recording on this disc being her second performance, but it still paints a superb picture of a artist in full bloom.Barrington Pheloung's score enhances the intense emotions portrayed in the film whether it's anger, pain, joy, depair or hope.

After rechecking the settings, I tried with another computer with the same result. Not sure if it was a bandwidth issue with the USB (I had my network and one USB device pugged in) or a defective unit. I contacted the manufactuer who was no help to say the least and only went through the same steps in the booklet to set up the settings.

It is, to my recollection, only the second of a mountain of books in the erotic fiction genre that I have not found enough interest in to finish.I wish this book had lived up to my expectations.

There's so much baggage that comes with her name alone that it's enough to frighten off most people. But listen to the sample amazon gives you and ignore all the tabloid nonsense.

I was really confused. So I eventually went on her website and watched the video for Mono and LOVED it. Everything about it was great! I went out and bought the cd the next and liked it alot. I don't think any of the other song are as good as Mono but their still good.

Every grrl in the world should pick up a guitar and start screaming! Order this album and put it on repeat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtney Love is America's Sweetheart","review":"America's Sweetheart is very similar to Courtney Love's former band, Hole. Their last album, Celebrity Skin, shares many of the sounds that Courtney has polished on her own in this solo album. Although many people may criticize her public image there is no denying that her confrontational, honest lyrics make this an entertaining and enjoyable listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great CD..","review":"I let this Cd slip past me on the inital release and I am annoyed at myself for not getting it earlier. Great variance of tone, intensity, and lyrics. Courtney Love's got another hit. I can't wait until the next cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I consider myself to be quite a huge fan of CL. Hole's Live through this was a genius album, everyone can relate to. But the only reason it was good is because Kurt made it good, now that her chief songwriter is dead she has no good lyrical structure left. She claims that she wrote better than him, but lets face it, she cant sing anymore. There's one song on there that is so totally annoying that I have to turn the cd off. Mono is the only listenable track, I dont anticipate this album to sell well. When they pushed the release date back, its true they should have not even released the album. Boring, asinine screaming. Sounds like a monkey, she is too old to be putting out garbage like this.. COurtney can do better, she is one heck of a singer, I dont know if she can play guitar but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vixen","review":"I remember growning up in high school that the best fights were among women. This cd is like a catfight. She sounds crazed and possessed like many personalities from hell are trying to take over. Awesome"},{"rating":"1","title":"what the...","review":"This is quite possibly one of the most unoriginal albums I have ever listened to, \\"COURTNEY IS BACK, AND BETTER THAN EVER\\" yeah, she is back, doing what she does best, ripping off guitar riffs from her late husband and Silverchair songs. Rock hasn't gone anywhere, just put in an old Nirvana or Hole album and voila."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry excuse for music","review":"Once again, Courtney displays her lack of talent for the world. Listening to this CD, you'll come to the realization (if you have not already) that she never did have any talent. Any song she released in the past that had any taste or creativity was obviously the work of \\"you know who\\". Don't waste your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of 2004","review":"This album is the proof that Courtney Love is a real rock goddess. When Hole broke up I was sure I'd never have listened again to some good music. But I was wrong. She is growing up, and her music is growing up with her. America's Sweetheart is full of passion, rage, love, sadness like in the grunge years, but the feelings now are just more mature. You can sing and scream in your car while listening to All the Drugs, Hello, Mono or But Julian. But you can still cry when her voice touches your heart in songs like Uncool,Hold on to me,Sunset Strip or the beautiful Life Despite God. Thank you Courtney cause I swear to God I wasn't feeling so ALIVE since the Live Through This era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Courtney, great album","review":"I love this album, you can hear every emotion in Courtney's voice from rage to pleasure to past pain... Sing on Miss World."},{"rating":"2","title":"whoa!","review":"it's like she's waxing philosphic at the top of her lungs. the stankout tracks are mono, sunset strip, almost golden, and but julian, i'm a little older than you. comes with a free pullout poster of the cover and (thank god) actual lyrics in the liner notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly anticipated CD and highly disappointed fan","review":"I am a huge Hole fan and think Courtney is the best thing since Siouxie Sioux. I have many pre-Miss World single albums and have loved them all. I couldn't wait to get my hands on America's Sweetheart. Listened to it once and wasn't sure, listened again and frowned, and after the third time I put it away to collect dust or perhaps sell on Amazon Marketplace. What a huge let down. C'mon Courtney, actually try next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Car tune Princess","review":"This album kicks in the same vein as Jane's Addictions new one. Hard, eighties rock with a little grunge tinge. Yeah, her voice is shot, but it was better on her previous stuff? My complaint is it's a bit too eighties, a bit too slick metal pop. At her best Courtney sounds like the Donna's with a more polished backing band (which isn't a criticism, actually), at her worst, she sounds like the drunken, drugged spoiled Hollywood creation that we see staggering in and out of the media. Do these artists really need Linda Perry? What exactly did she bring to the Courtney table Hole couldn't? \\"You know, Courtney darling, you need at least one more drug reference and I'll mix in the proper glossy veneer, and we'll sell billions, Love...) I said, Hey. What's going on? Kurt would tap Courtney on the shoulder and say, \\"Tell Linda to leave. We can handle this.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen is Back","review":"IT'S BEEN LONG OVER DUE FOR COURTNEY LOVE TO COME AND BLAST US WITH SUCH A PIECE OF WORK.... MEANING OF COURSE.. AMERICAN SWEETHEART.. THE LYRICS RIP LIKE THE OLD COURTNEY, WITH RIFFS TO MATCH... IT'S DEFINATELY A CD WORTH BUYING IF NOT IN YOUR COLLECTION..ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS.. \\"COURTNEY, YOU'VE PROVEN ONCE AGAIN THAT GREATNESS CAN BE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Sweetheart Indeed","review":"WOW! That is the best way to describe Courtney's new cd, America's Sweetheart. Not only is this cd very courtney-esque with her hard rocking vocals, but she shows her soft side in songs such as \\"Sunset Strip\\". Deep lyrics like \\"Nature took my soul, and sin left a scar so wide\\" (Life Despite God) stick to your mind. It is rare to find a cd that you can actually listen to straight through, every song, but this is definitly one of them. America's Sweetheart is a cd you will not take out of your player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Talent and Not","review":"Like the former rate'E, I have to say that I am a big fan of \\"Live through This\\" and also \\"My Body the Hand Grenade,\\" but this new album was just UN-listenable. How old is Courtney Love again? 39-40? Musically it was not too shabby, but LYRICALLY it was pigvomit. I sounded like a teenage girl going through puberty and filled with teen angst wrote the lyrics to this album. It's chessy....I'm sorry....but its chessy. God Bless you, Courtney!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i really like it!","review":"so i guess i wouldnt consider myself a huge Courtney Love fan, but my friend is, and she played me the album when she got it...and i really love it!! I think my favorite song is the Zeplin one!! i was really suprised this time around for Ms. Love...i thought i would hate it, but she actually kept my interest long enough to buy the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore all five star reviews (teenage street team cretins)","review":"This album is lame, from the production to the \\"singing\\" to the lyrics. Lame. Bad 80s hairmetal crap. This is not some big comeback, this is a weak attempt in every way.Courtney Love is not \\"back to save the day\\", etc. etc. *fill in the cliche the street team is clogging this site with*. This album is so bad even the Olivia illustration is lousy (why the drawing of the late Dorothy Stratten on the cover? Why not show the Joan Rivers of Rock in all her plasticized glory with a photo?)Bad. Bad. Bad. One would think she'd have made a better album in the six years it took to get this one out.Buy \\"Pretty On The Inside\\" instead. Or \\"Live Thru This\\", if you don't already own it.But not this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, but the vocals lose it","review":"I really like the music as it has to be one of the best instrumental arrangements out there in popular music. Is she even trying to sing though?? I really wish it was just an instrumental CD or that someone else was singing. She's fine with normal ranges, but when she tries to hit the higher notes, it comes across as a cat with emphezema being strangles. Although the positive aspect with that is that if she does actually tour for this album, you'll know *exactly* what the songs will sound like onstage. I find myself not wanting to listen to songs just becuase I can not take that constant screeching for the length of each song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Still Rocks","review":"From the first song to the last this CD rocks. If your looking for something like the last hole CD this is not it. This CD is more like the \\"Live Through This\\" CD. That is raw and rocking.This is great work and some bad words. Buy it and ROCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just listen to?","review":"I have been a Hole/Courtney fan for a long time, and I was so excited about this album. I remember last year when the release date was getting pushed back all the time, I thought it was just unfair to make us all wait. Well... I think this album should not have been released at all. I really did not like it. I know some other people liked it, and that's good, but personally, I was really, really disappointed.Either Courtney was asleep or higher than high when she recorded the album but she never sounded so bad. The songs aren't great except \\"Hold on to me\\" and \\"Uncool\\", but buying a CD for 2 songs is just not worth it. If you can listen to it before buying, it's highly recommended.OK Courtney, I'll forget about this one, and I'll be waiting for the next one. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is amazing","review":"I totally love this new CD by Love. Hole fans should enjoy this as well as any regular Courtney fans. The lyrics are great and each song is carefully crafted. I say 5 stars for a great solo debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it or white hot hate it!","review":"Most have reveiwed this CD as either a 1 or 5 star and seems to be no middle ground here. For all of us ex CBGB, anti-Brittany non-Kabbalah bracelet wearing children book writing ex-punks who have lived and breathed in the real world, Courtney is surely the sweetheart of our America. Love her or hate her but can we all agree that she is never dull. In my opinion, neither is this CD. I would recommend the explicit lyric version for sure and let's not forget about the cool cover art. Thanks CL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Courtney Love has lost her touch and it really shows on this album. It's messy, mediocre, painful to listen to and just plain disappointing. She's just not the same and neither is her music, something I find incredibly sad. I wanted to like this album, I really did, but I just can't get past how awful and humdrum it is. And by the way, don't be fooled by all these positive reviews seen on this site. Love's record label has assigned members of her street team to come onto online retail sites like this and write postive reviews in order to persuade people to buy the album. Regardless of the reviews the music speaks for itself. Give a listen and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"viciously lovely","review":"Miss Love does it again.

Don't waste your money on garbage like this....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"I liked Hole, and I don't care what anybody says about Kurt and Courtney, it all comes down to the music, and this music stinks! As Neil Young sang, \\"Saw it on the tube/Bought in on the phone/when I got it home/it was a piece of crap!\\" Thankfully I checked it out of my local library. My, oh my. She has lost her way here.

It has great grunge tracks(Mono, I'll Do Anything, But Julian...), some blues(Sunset Strip, Life Despite God), and the one of the best ballads of probably her entire catalouge(Never Gonna Be the Same.) I highly suggest this to any Hole/Courtney fan, and anyone else who is sick of the sugar-coated pop music that's been out for too long. Pick up America's Sweetheart now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrisist Genius Rockstar Goddess","review":"America's Sweetheart is a great album. There are a couple weak songs (Zeplin Song for sure) But some absolutely amazing ones.Hold On To Me is quite possibly the best song Courtney has ever written. It's a beautiful rock ballad. Sunset Strip is a masterpiece. Life Despite God is a great raw rock n roll song. It's rough and huntingly beautiful. Courtney howls through the entire record with the most incredible passion.Courtney deserves more credit for this album. It's one of the best rock records I've heard in a very long time. I think the album suffered because of her legal troubles, and the fact that it got barely any promotion.The thing with Courtney is that her persona is so big that it overshadows her music. You have to forget everything you've heard about her and just listen to her music. She's a troubled genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"her BEST work by far!!","review":"if hole's breakin up is the result of that: it was damn worth it!!

Its all ready been proven that she does not have talent playing, performing, or creating. She stole Kurt Cobains lyrics which rightfully belong to Nirvana, and tryed to pass them off as her own. It would not of been so bad if she had talent, but she kills every singe song. That is why I recomend for you not to get this album, do it for Kurt Cobain, or Nirvana. ... P.S.

As one reviewer stated before, most of the lyrics are atrocious, just stupid and silly. Yet in this corrupted album are two songs worth a listen.The first is Hold Onto Me. I feel this is a personal song for Love and she expresses herself well. The other is the fiery Life Despite God. I noticed other reviewers critisized this song...I dont know why, yes Courtney wails and wails, but this song, this is Hole as we remember it. This is the real Courtney Love. Its these two tracks that make my purchase so worthwhile, giving a taste of the old Hole, the old Courtney we loved.Anyway, if you want more of the real Courtney Love I suggest you pick yourself up a copy of Hole's Live Through This. Taking you back to the days of smeared red lipstick, babydoll dresses two sizes too small and empowering lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, We Missed Her","review":"Courtney Love is back and is driving a stake through the heart of bland teen pop and nu-metal angst.

Well sorry to burst your bubble, but it does neither.What it does do, however, is deliver over 40 minutes of quality music from Courtney and the gang that help her wrote it. Better than her previous effort (Hole's Celebrity Skin), most of the tracks are standout tracks that shine in their own way. The only thing that keeps this album from getting 5 stars is her lyrical pool has apparently been sucked dry. After 5 years, I was expecting the great lyrics from her that she has always supplied. Still, the album is well worth it and for fans of her's, you probably wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Celebrity Skin, babe","review":"In my opinion, this is an excellent follow up to Celebrity Skin.1. 5/52. 5/53. 5/54. 5/55. 5/56. 5/57. 5/58. 5/59. 5/510. 5/511. 5/512. 4/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets boring after a few times..","review":"This is the end for courtney love's career.

She killed him, period. And her music has, and always will be the most vomitous filth on the planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, trite, boring","review":"Courtney Love shouldn't even be allowed to walk the streets considering how bad her new album is. I heard the single and thought... over produced. It is no wonder that so many bands have disbanded because of her attitude. Although it's not an attitude, it's a drug habit. Kurt Cobain should have never touched this beast of a women, I feel horrible for Kurt's child. Then again, Courtney could have kept dating Billy Corgan and then we wouldn't have him alive today. I love Billy just as much as Kurt. So lets just remember Kurt and forget Courtney. Don't spend money on this album. Please don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn For Having Kurt Murdered Courtney","review":"Terrible music. If she wasnt who she is then she would never have gotten a record deal. No talent.

First Kurt Cobain helped write Live Through This, then she got Billy Corgan to help write Celebrity Skin, now she gets Linda Perry from 4 Non Blondes fame, whom is also responsible for getting models with fair to less-than-fair voices such as Christina Aguilara and Pink to write her music... and after all that she calls herself an artist? Courtney Love is all about playing the corporate game, she knows who to talk to to get what she wants, including writing her album (and not a very good one I might add), she would have made a very successful salesman. I think Courtney should have stuck with Billy Corgan writing her stuff, at least then Billy would be employed. And needless to say, without Kurt she wouldnt have a career. Out of respect of rock music as a whole, i will not buy or even download Courtney Loves music, no matter how good it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"COURTNEY, YOU'RE 15 MINUTES ARE UP.....","review":"I will admit that when Hole first burst on the musicallandscape, they caught my attention. \\"Live Through This\\"had some great moments. But come on, this woman is pushing40, and has the point of view of a self-obsessed teenager.When you think about it, all Courtney really has now (besidesa freakish desire for the spotlight) is an \\"image\\" and avery little bit of real talent. Screaming and caterwaulingare fine if there's some substance to back it up, but thisis just empty posing. It's silly! Mrs. Cobain, it's timeto grow up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy it...","review":"I used to be a big Hole fan. Huge. I thought Courtney Love was one of the most interesting artists in rock music and Hole really had something going. But this album... I'm surprised her record company let her release it.Her voice, while never and far from perfect, was still good in that rock/punk sense, and I enjoyed it. She can still scream, which is all fair and good, but cannot hit any key on softer, more melodic songs. The music itself is middle of the road punk/rock... nothing special. The lyrics (I always thought she was a great lyricist) are awful and boring, and don't even fit the music.It's so sad what's happened to her, and I don't mean personally (but, that too). She had a lot of musical potential. What happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtney is finally back!!!","review":"I'd been waiting for this cd for ages! It's always interesting to listen to an album for the first time, there is so much to take in. After my first listening I wasn't sure what to think, but now I've listened to it a few times and I really like it. Did anyone notice the lyrics for Mono in the booklet?? It's a bit different to what she actually sings on the cd. She mentions Eminem for instance. I agree with another reviewer here: Courtney has some of Kurt Cobain in her. I especially think that the song Hello is very Kurt Cobain. Almost Golden is absolutely amazing. But I do think that it sounds like she's on drugs sometimes during the sessions (or got a cold). I'm pretty impressed though, she's got a powerful voice. Mono is probably my favourite song on the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOODY VULTURES!","review":"You all need to back the F off! Fuel your unsightly hatred elsewhere. In a world of Britney, Jessica, & Paris you vultures attack Courtney? It needs to stop! Stop blaming her for Kurt. If anything she helped keep him alive and inspired his best songwriting. She's an artist. The real deal. Does that threaten you? Have you even listened to this album? It's effing brilliant! As thumping as the Stooges, as acid-tongued as Dylan, as beautifully gloomy as Echo & the Bunnymen. Not one bad cut (okay, the beginning of \\"Life Despite God\\" is a little painful, but you can't even pick a favorite there's so much to choose from). She has stripped herself inside out for you heathens. Thrown herself to the lions, and you want to burn her at the stake like Joan Of Arc. Typical. You never know what you have until you kill it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtney Love's America's Sweetheart","review":"Courtney Love's debut album America's Sweetheart is definitely NOT a disappointment. The whole album is worth its money, from the catchy fast tracks like the first single, \\"Mono\\" and \\"But Julian, I'm a Little Bit Older Than You,\\" to slower tracks like, \\"Hold On To Me,\\" and \\"Never Gonna Be the Same.\\" This album shows Courtney's growth as a songwriter and this will definitely go down as one of the best albums of 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solo album that fails on about every single level","review":"Courtney Love is many things but IMO talentless is not one of them, and being a fan of Hole's \\"Live Through This\\" and \\"Celebrity Skin\\" I was really anticipating this album. Unfortunately, it's just another case of a brilliant frontperson going solo and sounding really bad without a band that could give her music some identity. Lyrically, Courtney has lost none of her bite, but it's just a shame that the lyrics are accompanied by the music which is generic, lame and boring, with no interesting hooks and melodies to write home about. While I never thought Courtney a great singer, her howling vocals can sound right when married to the right music. But here she just sounds awful, especially when she tries to sing a ballad that she simply can't pull off. I'm still interested to see what she does musically in the future, but this album is a definite pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Solo Effort","review":"Courtney Love's voice is torn up, but not too much to rock out like a 70's rock star. Courtney has channeled many old school rock songs into some very moody, melodic rock songs. I particularly like \\"Sunset Strip,\\" which, in my opinion, is the best track on the album. It sounds like a Stevie Nicks song to me, as do \\"Never Be the Same Again\\" and \\"Uncool.\\" I know Courtney has mentioned Stevie in past interviews as an influence, and I can hear it here. \\"Mono,\\" the lead single, is not my favorite of the songs and an odd choice, in my opinion, as a lead-off single. But, the album is very good and I recommend it highly for any rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy Courtney's work and aren't expecting Hole...","review":"Its different, but its a nice change to all the fluffy stuff being pushed by AOL/Time/Warner/Infinity/Viacom.If you like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Distillers, or you can appreciate an old-school r&r album, purchase this CD.Do NOT purchase the \\"clean\\" version.

Yes, we did.","review":"I bought the CD the first day it was released.Sensational.If you crave an abrasively melodic ALBUM [not just cd's with singles], a full-on masterpiece charting the convtroversial expedition of a warrior beast of a woman- buy it. No one wails like Courtney. Courtney is a vorcaious screamale who isn't here to sing you processed lullabies. She's here to bring rock back.The array of songs on the album vary from punk to ballads- If you can't catch a hook, you'll still be blown away by the raw power in her voice.She makes my spine tingle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boundless Love","review":"It seems apparent to me that an artist like Courtney love, who receives more attention for her actions than her work, rarely gets the opportunity to back up the hoopla she often creates. This album proves without a doubt, through the drugs, the tragedies, and the controversy surrounding her life, Ms. Love has the one thing she is least credited with, the talent. From beginning to end, Courtney dished out the goods, with songs like \\"Mono,\\" \\"But Julian,\\" and \\"All The Drugs,\\" Love has no boundaries. \\"Mono\\", a song about Courtney saving rock n roll as we know it, has a pop/punk feel to it and some of the best lyrics she's written. My favorite song would be the song titled, \\"Life Despite God,\\" with Robert Plant style vocals so awful you have to love it. A little \\"Celebrity Skin\\" and a little bit of female Zeppelin makes \\"America's Sweetheart\\" a great album. My only complaint would be that it doesn't have a few more tracks but other than that I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should silence the critics...","review":"No-one else could have created this powerful, moving and oddly intelligent album.

We all want to blame her for Kurt's death, but this album is brilliant. When I first played it I didn't love it, even though I love all of her past work, but after playing it a couple of times, listening to the lyrics, etc. I realize it's probably her best work. She's the real deal and we're just not ready to accept a female rock star. There really has never been one and probably never will be. (Sorry Madonna and Britney are NOT rock stars!) Every single cut on this album (except maybe Zep song) are genius. I love Courtney!!! I hope she lives a long time and can keep working and doing what she does best--making great rock music!

It is comfortable to sit on and the bubbles are really relaxing. I had the Con Air Mat and is was uncomfortable to sit on. I also like the remote so I don't have to touch anything that is electric. The noise of this is not bad. I have a whirpool tub at home and it is allot louder. I got this for my vacation home because I missed my whirlpool tub. I would recommend it to you. I wish it was a little heavier so it would stay down in the tub. It does float, but so did the Con Air and it was heavier. I can live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the concept Hate the product","review":"I,too was excited to receive what I refer to as my White Trash Jacuzzi. Couldn't wait to lay back in the tub after a long day on the farm. Much to my disapointment the suction cups DO NOT STICK to my tub. I thought it may have been a problem with soap buildup. Scrubbed the tub Still didn't stick. However the 3 large pieces with huge suction cups stick very nicely. Wonder why the tennie tiny ones were even put there to start with? Don't waste the money on buying one with the small suction cups as I know of no one that it works for. The place where the hose attaches to the mat never stayed, only long enough to get layed back. Noise also was a problem. Couldn't hear a thing and could wake sleeping children. My suggestion: Don't use duct tape and Start saving for a real tub"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLUTION TO THE BUBBLE MAT THAT WON'T STICK!","review":"My husband and I love the deluxe bubble spa! It 's much better than the wimpy jet spa that sticks on the side of the tub. But we also found it frustrating that the suction cups were too small and wouldn't stick to our non-slip tub. WE HAVE THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM! If you love the bubbble spa idea, but hate that it won't stick because you have a non-slip tub, TRY PUTTING TWO MAGNETIC SIGNS (the kind that stick to the sides of trucks) BACK TO BACK on the tub floor and then sticking the suction cups to that. It works! Also, roll and sit on a hand towel for extra comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud and floated in tub rather than stuck to bottom","review":"I bought this product because I love spas and I figured it was an affordable alternative. It worked for the most part, but it shot cold bubbles and did not stick to the bottom of my tub. It will only stick if you have an old timey porcelan tub, if there are any grooves to prevent you from slipping, it will not stick and will float to the top. I was trying to enjoy my spa experience, but had limbs everywhere trying to hold it down and meanwhile my water was getting cold. I did not think it was worth the money. It was a good idea, I just wish they could make it work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product!","review":"Have to agree with everything that was said by the previous reviewer. The suction cups are useless, especially around where the tube comes in (where the air pressure is very powerful).I also found the heat feature useless. The air passing through the tube gets warm enough to make the tube hot, but by the time it gets into the mat the air is cold (if you feel the air coming out of the holes it is not warm). So the overall effect is that it cools your once hot bath down even more quickly than usual as you struggle to keep the mat flat beneath your body.Clean-up is a huge chore as well and cancels out any relaxing advantages this product might (but doesn't) offer.What a waste of a lot of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was so looking forward to my new Bubblespa....what a disappointment!

It was not out of the box 15 minutes, before we had to give it a try. As with the other reviews, it does not stick to your tub. Thought it was maybe my type of tub, but I see not. The clean up of the unit does take away from it's ability to relax, as stated by another reviewers. A great idea. But has a very long way to go.

I live in a new house, and all of my tubs have a anti-slip finish (made not smooth on purpose). This tub design is fairly common. HoMedics should of taken into consideration when designing the suction cups. The cups would NOT stick to the tub. You eventually end up play with a mat that wants to float to the top of the water, but you wanted to lay on the it. Just like another user said, the floating part end up spraying water mist at ya. It will not relax you, but drive you crazy. SKIP THIS PRODUCT ALL TOGETHER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SPA","review":"I bought this item and was quite disappointed in it.

I can't keep the mat to stay on the bottom of the bathtub. I have to hold it down with my feet. The hose that attaches to the mat does not stay in the mat. As soon as you turn the machine on high it blows off the mat resulting in water spraying all over the floor.

Yes, many of the songs on here are on the cheesy side, especially the last track, \\"Do You Want To Dance.\\" I love the harmonica on \\"Eyes Of Innocence.\\" \\"When Someone Comes Into Your Life\\" is a pretty and emotional ballad. Gloria's voice sounds very nice on that one. In the end, this is a good CD, even better than Primitive Love, which was the next release, and it had three big hits on it.

How do you determine whether to draw, raise, or fold? What cards should you throw away? How good a hand do you need to open? It's all in here.This book is cheap but packed full on excellent information.

People who DON'T know a piece of knowledge and encounter it, tend to RESEARCH. Thus, this book serves as a stimulation for research, wisdom, and knowledge.Secondly, Wicca is not supposed to be a dry, stodgy, boring religion the professed reviewer claims so strongly to heart. Wicca is serious, but fun is serious, thus Wicca is also fun. The last thing our faith needs is unbending law and order.

I'm really appalled at the number of people who do not see where a book like this is detrimental to Wicca, and I'm even more afraid that these people don't even care. Technically, this book tests objective information on a very subjective matter.

Firstly, it's made of some of the cheapest webbing I've encountered lately, and secondly, it is not user friendly. The buckles are cheap, so they're not in any hurry to go on or off, and the thing is completely shapeless.

The Bear was tame and I got $50 for Spraying it on a Bear. Didn't seem to work at all, it sneezed a few times but it didn't do a thing. If it hadn't been tame (w/ a trainer), I would have been torn to pieces.Occasion two was when I went hiking in the mountains. I came across a brown bear near a small creek and he came at me. I froze, reacted calmly, took the Bear Defense Spray and used it. The only thing it did was startle the Bear, it retreated but eventually came at me again, but I had time enough to run back to my truck where I hid for safety.Bear adrenaline, either from male 'heat' or anger, is enough to override the effects of a little pepper spray burst, just like a man on drugs or alcohol can still attack if hit with pepper spray.In all, I wouldn't recommend these Bear Defense Sprays at all unless you are dealing with a Bear cub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel about early Hollywood","review":"The Golden Egg is the story of the rise and fall of one man in the movie business.

If you have an idea of what you want to do or have done ABs before, then this a book that you will want to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun book!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The instructions are very good, there are many creative ideas and the photography is wonderful. There are some really unique approaoches to wall art using altered books, as well as using CDs, picture frames, etc. What I like best is that this book has some new and refreshing ideas which I haven't seen before and that always gets my creative juices flowing. There is also a great gallery which showcases the work of other artists. For those just beginning, the book starts with how to choose the right book for altering. For the more advanced enthusiast, there is a section that asks, \\"What if...? and explores new possibilities with other artists. Something for everyone and definitely one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but sort of hobbyist- oriented","review":"I guess altered books are a hobbyists' realm.

It won't hold a charge anymore. I hope Homedics is aware of all these bad reviews of their product. This product is simply not made to withstand a typical bathroom environment. The housing is made such that water and toothpast will seep in no matter how you use it. The brushhead will stop working in about a months worth of use as the combined water and grime will stop it from working. Did they even test this thing themselves? What were they thinking......... A bathroom product that is not waterproof and is intended to be used near water is just mind boggling. Brushing with it was okay, but the quality and design of the product leave MUCH to be desired.

Although the book is awesome based alone on the fact that it has tons of new ways to work out your stomach, there are also great chapters dedicated to proper nutrition, hydration, warming up, and mental wellness.

I was hoping to be told. \\"This particular situp is the best one for suchnsuch...\\"Instead they were all lumped together, none standing out above the rest.

Peppered with more anecdotes than a Reagan press conference, you will learn how Microsoft employees handled specific situations. It is chock full of good ideas and cautionary tales of how not to do things.While this book relates some of the best practices of the successful software juggernaut some of it feels like Monday morning quarterbacking. Who is to say that some of these products mentioned didn't eventually succeed due to Microsoft's market share or on the strength of the Microsoft name.

This was a time when new ideas counted, when creative effort was rewarded, when individual and company excitement were almost indistinguishable. Bick's book celebrates those time with advice that will last, regardless where the market goes or which fad is hot. Because it is written for the individual it applies to relations, activities and good practice in all kinds of business settings. The writing is direct, tied to examples, free of jargon and spiced with more than occasional humor. The sharpest instruction don't need embellishment or hype.

Instead, it flits from topic to topic and never covers any subject in depth. I don't doubt that many fresh-out-of-college Microsofties could use a management primer, but this is more like shmoozing at the water cooler with your mother. \\"Be nice to others.\\" \\"Manage your manager.\\" \\"Don't run with scissors.\\" Or email, in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Dorky and Incomplete","review":"I found some of the anecdotes insightful, but with those few that were, they were not detailed enough for me to trust the resulting outcomes of following Bick's advice as legitimate.

If you turn the unit on the default setting is for it to stay on continuously. It's amazing the things you can learn if you actually read the instructions!The fan on the aromatherapy unit is a bit louder than I'd like and it vibrates a bit, but it doesn't drown out the sounds unless you have the volume turned down to the lowest point possible.

The machine does have a timer mode, but you can also just let it run all the time if you want. The machine was very simple and easy to run and I don't think I had to read the instruction book.The armoatherapy isn't a strong scent, however, aromatherapy isn't supposed to be over powering. It works great for me.I would agree with criticism on the quality of the sounds. The babbling brook sounds like a microphone under water at a swimming pool. The only sounds I can handle listening too are the ocean, white noise and rain. These three all sound a like and the ocean definitely doesn't sound like the ocean. But, it works for me.

I have heard many people talk about Job and his misery, but Piper has not only wrote about Job's misery but about the mercy and Sovereignty of God. The Sovereignty aspect is often left out of the picture when people talk about Job. This poem, especially the last pages, demonstrates that God has, is, and always will be in control of every thought and action. I would reccomend this to anyone but especially to the one going through difficulties, not in order to get his mind off of his problems and onto Job's, but rather to get his mind off of his problems and onto to God's Sovereignty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"This book is a wonderful account of the Job story that puts it the storty in great poetic narrative. A very beautiful book with artwork and text that will leave you captured and emotionally filled.

After poor customer service, numerous problems, and no assistance after the ninety-day warranty we had to trash the unit after four months. While the idea of aquatic sculptures is a truly great one, I find Homedics' interpretation of MIDWEST TROPICAL's products crude and cheap. If you're looking for a piece of aquatic artwork, go to the people who invented the idea of indoor water products, Midwest Tropical. MIDWEST TROPICAL's designs are exceptional, staff gracious, and most importantly their quality is second to none.

It has gained some noteriety over the years, because Sun Ra and members of The Blues Project played on it. Musically, however, it is nothing special. Most of the tracks don't have much of a melody, and just feature the musicians jamming. This is okay to listen to, but it doesn't really represent the best of either Sun Ra or The Blues Project. However, I do have to say that the nearly 7 minute \\"Batman and Robin Over the Roofs\\" is pretty wild, cool and swinging. One unfortunate thing about this CD is that it is in mono. I think that a good stereo mix would really enhance this recording. This CD is really for hardcore Batman, Sun Ra or Blues Project fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Swings Hard","review":"Most noted because Sun Ra and some of his Arkestra members are present, along with a rock band called \\"The Blues Project\\". This was an LP being made to be bought by kids into \\"Batman\\", with the musicians trying to provide music that recalled the \\"BANG! POW! K-SHAM!\\" atmosphere of the TV show, while riffing around on mostly public domain themes.Given those humble roots, knowing that's what this was ... you'll be surprised at how hard this swings! It kicks! It rocks! Seriously, it's a pretty decent collection of hard rock/funk groove."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm getting this even though I still have the original","review":"...not my original. I got mine in 1970 as part of this weird Batman Back to School Package, complete with Batman clear pencilcase gun. Like I said, weird. I lost the record in Baltimore and bought another off a classmate in '77. Anyway, its a great listen and importantly you learn to admire updated jams of public domain classical music. Rockin! Buy this album and you won't really need -50 beloved classical pieces- as seen on tv anymore. You will also be compelled to dance like Adam West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great surprising reissue","review":"Since 1966 I owned the original Stereo Tifton LP of this album, so while I was very glad to obtain it on CD I am disappointed that it is in mono.It really did sound good in Stereo. I, of course, never knew who was truly on the recording (Dan and Dale reminds me of Dick Dale). Once again Amazon.com comes through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking In Every Possible Area","review":"Good God, this is the worst book ever written. The prose is terrible, there is no intelligent plot here and, for that matter, there is nothing intelligent in this book at all. The author must either be in elementary school or be mentally ill to produce something this thoroughly awful. Reading through this book I got the impression that the author composed this work while he was bored at his job sometime and couldnt think of anything better to do. Indeed, it shows remarkably little inspiration and sounds like the ramblings of a disturbed individual. I would highly recommend that all stay away from this book as it is a large waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2-year-old loves this video.","review":"I bought the DVD version of this recently because I was at Eichler's looking for something else and my 2-year-old became utterly transfixed by the Muppet-like creatures singing Dayyeinu on the in-store TV screen. I had been trying to get him psyched for the upcoming holiday, using various books and just telling him about it myself, but wasn't getting very far, so the fact that he was interested was important to me. Anyway, I just bought it two days ago, and now he asks again and again to see \\"Matah Ball\\" and goes around singing Dayyeinu. The storyline is perfect for a 2-year-old -- which is to say, pretty hard to take for an adult. But the video is doing what I was looking for -- getting him psyched for the holiday -- so I'm happy. (I just wish they sang the four questions in the video, so he'd be trying to do them as well! That would be cool.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waist of money","review":"I bought this item thinking it was going to protect my Garmin screen.

The musicianship is excellent. I like the different genres of music that MC covers, particularly the rock sound. I have a feeling that MC will do more rock songs on future releases, which is not a bad thing because songs like Runaway and Falling apart are awesome. My favorites songs are My sista, Love your tears, I'm Ready, Luxury Brown, Fallin apart, Runaway and Sad Girl. If you like real music played by real musicians then go get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The TRUTH!!!","review":"I'm late with this review, but I'm from a neck of the woods where good, solid R&B isn't fully appreciated.

One of those rare CD's where you can let it rock from beginning to end. My favorites in order: Half An Hour, I'm Ready, Look Whachu Done 2 Me, Fallin Apart, What Happened, Sad Girl, Love Your Tears, Runaway, Whoaa & Sista.(Damn, was that all of them?)If you don't have it, go get it, and while you're out, pick up the Live From The 9:30 CLub DVD.

Stokely's voice is amazing....but on this CD, you don't hear his range...you know that Mint Condition we all know and love. His range on these songs are what anyone who can carry a tune can sing. The first single, \\"I'm Ready,\\" gives you a taste...a \\"very small,\\" taste of that range, which dies out during that very first song and it's not picked back up at all. This CD didn't click with me. The music or the lyrics...It was just too all over the place.

Describing the genre itself is perhaps not so simple... for the informed, tech-house will suffice. For those unfamiliar, think well-produced, crisp 4-4 dancefloor beats with a keen sense of glitchy detail. What Twerk has done is crispened up his sound to create an album that is both strong for dancefloor purposes but even stronger (in my opinion) for home or headphones listening. Rather than using convention as a rulebook, he has used it as a starting point and taken off from there into something very exciting. One of the best from the Mille Plateaux/Force Inc catalogue.... Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just a boring kind of house..................","review":"I think this is just a boring kind of house.

The numerous modes make it such that you can get a good shot in almost any environment. The simultaneous natural/flash mode is especially useful. As far as video is concerned, the sound quality in much better than I expected; it's not nearly as garbled as video I've seen taken from other digital cameras. The only sticking point is that the photo quality is merely sufficient. This camera won't get any shots that take your breath away, but for the price, the quality is about what I expected. Overall, I'm definitely satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Scuba","review":"On the 4mp setting this camera works awesome in low light conditions, such as underwater.

Not a lot of settings to it, it takes care of most of it for you. If you're a serious photographer, then this might be a turn off. If you just want to take pictures of vacations, special occasions, etc. like the rest of us, then this is the perfect solution.FYI: My camera came with outdated firmware that only allowed 2 GB memory cards.

Not so. I am extremely disappointed with this camera. The pictures come out grainy at ALL ISO levels, and get worse as you increase the ISO level. The pictures also lack sharpness. I have tried all settings, and have yet to get a decent photo from this camera. It is much worse than the 3 year old Canon S400 Powershot that I have.

I was excited to think I had found a book that would help me build a diet of items that were 'safe' to eat. This book, however, gave the typical lists of what not to eat. It is also pretty confusing because one page will list good foods to eat, for example, that are high in magnesium but includes standard trigger foods such as chocolate and nuts that are noted on other pages as being possible problems. It is like the author just copied the list from somewhere and didn't even bother to note which items are thought to be triggers for migraines. The book also has, in my opinion, a too light-hearted feel to it. I was hoping for some solid advice on what to eat in a no-nonsense tone...but didn't find here unfortunately.

But I needed something larger for storing grain and other staples.So I had high hopes for these things (and paid a good deal more for them than the price given here). Even new, every one of them has failed to keep it's seal over the long term. I filled one with brown sugar -- I might as well have left it out in the open, it's now rock hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foodsaver Canisters are Great!","review":"I don't know what these other reviewers were doing, but I have been using these containers and other FoodSaver canisters for years. Unless one has a crack in it(and I only have one that has a crack....I dropped it), they hold their seal. I've never had one that didn't hold the seal! Are you people putting these in the dishwasher????? Are you dropping them repeatedly on the floor???? People do some really weird things with products so I wouldn't be surprised. These canisters are a perfectly fine product if taken care of properly. You need to read the instructions for care when you purchase them. Also, they were not meant to keep food vacuum packed indefinitely!!!! They only delay food spoilage. That is true of ANY food vacuum storage system. EeeGods and Little Fishes people!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you want to waste food & $","review":"Definitely a waste of money because they are not reliable. A product that cannot be relied on to function and perform as advertised is not worth the Chinese junk it is made of. You cant tell by looking at them if they are holding their seal ( which half the time they do NOT)so you find that out when you go to open them and find your food is spoiled or stale. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE OR THIER SEALER EITHER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"We have two of these and they work well. The only difficulty has been when we try to seal flour.

They were carefully handled by one adult, following all instructions of no dishwasher, freezer nor hot foods. I have all the clear and black models.

Just put the jar with disk on top and seal away-- the pressure should make the mason jar lid flutter a little as air escapes. Release the pressure in the canister and see if you can lift the jar out by the lid. It might take two tries, but it's very handy; for the price of this 3-pack, you could get two dozen mason jars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice until they crack. Not recommmended.","review":"The canisters work very well at keeping food fresh. EXCEPT they crack after using a few times with just hand washing. Small cracks develop at the bottom center radiating out. They will continue to hold a seal for a short while until the cracks become larger then no more seal. The attachment to vacuum seal canning jars works very well but is not practical for storing items that are used frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much wasted money on these, they invariably crack for no reason","review":"As many other users here, I've purchased a number of these canisters and they all seem to eventually get cracks. I've tried to treat them with kid gloves, not putting them in the dishwasher, being careful not to overseal them, etc. Doesn't matter, some crack even after just a few uses. I have one tall one that still seems to be okay, and the square marinator, but these round canisters are just very unreliable. With all the complaints, I'm surprised there hasn't been a class action suit against the company for knowingly continuing to sell such defective products! I now generally use medium and large mason jars and seal them with the handheld unit and jar sealers. This works so much better, but has limited space of course, even with larger jars. It's a shame Tilia can't get their act together and make canisters that will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do work, you just can't abuse them.","review":"After reading the reviews of this item I was skeptical it would be both durable and useful, but after using them for two months I can say that they really do work on a variety of food and non-food items, and they are pretty easy to use with the FoodSaver. I would NOT suggest putting these in the dishwasher. I can tell from the kind of plastic it's constructed of that it wouldn't last 20 cycles without cracking. I've been gently washing them out by hand with warm water and a little bit of detergent, and it takes only seconds to get them clean. My one gripe with this product, and the reason I didn't give it a 5/5 star rating, is because there's no way to tell if the jar is sealed by just looking at it. You have to give the lid a little tug to test the seal. If you have a lot of these jars, it can be annoying to not know at a glance whether something is sealed or not. Other than that, these jars work wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"No warranty on cracked jars","review":"Be aware that the manufacturer does not warranty the cannisters! As a \\"one-time courtesy\\" they agreed to replace my small cannister when it developed hairline cracks after a couple of months of use. Love the concept, but the product really needs a re-design.

Just be warned that the money you spend may be for throw away products."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont stand up","review":"The canister (bottom) part not dishwasher safe as advertised.

Crack and leak!","review":"The vacuum seal concept is great. It allow me to save left over much longer. But all the hard plastic containers are badly design. All of my containers (various shape and size) failed within four months of usage. All of them develop cracks. The bad thing about it, Food Saver does not sell the container by itself. You have to buy both the lid and container together. The only container that can withstand the usage are those soft plastic lunch containers. I guess softer plastic allow it to flex and withstand the force of vacuum better... Food Saver should design better containers.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Salsa Spill of 2009","review":"It was bound to happen; it was only a matter of time. Making home made salsa is something we love to do. I decided to store some in a medium canister and vacuum seal it. Well, we knew the top was not the place to hold in picking up the canister when it was full. The top comes off! But one morning I forgot and picked up the salsa by the top of the container and the resulting spill of bright red immediately decorated my kitchen from inside the refrigerator to halfway across the kitchen floor. I was busy for almost an hour cleaning it all up. The containers will do ok for chips and crackers, but forget about liquids! I use glass jars now to store salsa. Much safer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They do crack or implode","review":"I have some of these I bought years ago and some larger that are smoked colored they don't make anymore. I never had a problem with those buttttttttt. I bought three sets of these and have had one medium size actually implode at the bottom and one small one crack across the bottom. If you buy any be prepared for that to happen and possible food loss. That can become expensive plus renders the external port on a foodsaver useless except for sealing Ball or Mason jar lids on glass. Now for long term storage that works well but if you want fairly frequent access to the food doesn't work well (using a lot of lids). I was truly disappointed in these."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing to complain about... everything to write home about","review":"We bought three sets of the previous version of these canisters over ten years ago. I bought two sets of the current version (difference is old version required the Mason Jar adaptor and the current version has a port that the accessory hose inserts into) for my away from home work apartment.

They also lose their seal without visible cracks. As the owner of about 10 of these containers, I'd say two of them still work reliably for me after six years of use. Another two are a crapshoot. The rest don't work at all and I just store things in them with no vacuum. I'd recommend against buying these but if you do, be sure to buy extra because it's likely most of the ones you get will not work for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I got one with my foodsaver. I like the foodsaver but their canisters crack after a few of uses. Also the manufacture is not handy friendly. I was injured and can't speak. When I tried to get help by email they told me I needed to get friend or family member to call them if I wanted help. That just wrong. I guess they haven't heard about the equal access laws.Almost 2 years after the fact I sent them another nastygram about this product. They sent me a new set of these containers. After about a months use they failed too. They know they have a problem but they do nothing.They say that Insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over but you expect different results.

I love my Foodsaver vacuum sealer and use it often. It does a wonderful job of vacuum sealing wet or dry foods, and even vacuum sealing non-food items for storage. I bought the jar vacuuming attachments (wide and regular mouth) and use them with great success when I vacuum seal dry goods in canning jars.But the canisters and marinating container were a waste of money. None of them would hold a seal, and the clips on the marinating dish broke after the second use, making it useless. I had a huge mess all over the kitchen floor when I picked up a canister of dried lentils and the loose, non-vacuum-sealed lid flew off. I bought my canisters directly from Foodsaver, but wanted to give a warning here on Amazon. Luckily lots and lots of other unhappy customers were here before me. Don't buy these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fair value for the money","review":"My friend gave me these canisters for my birthday 5 years ago and I have just started using them. I have been trying to find a airtight container to store powdered buttermilk in and there just is not anything out there that does the job. Out of despiration I grabbed the foodsaver container and my handheld foodsaver vacuum and tried it. To my surprise it worked even though by the rulebook, it should not have. The cansister holds a vacuum well enough to keep the powder from clumping and going bad. I doubt I would use these to store anthing in other than my bread supplies and I would not wash them in the dishwasher. Overall I have been happy with them, but do not ask all that much of them.

The musicians are marvelous, the songs stick in your head for weeks, and the audience is totally engaged; what more can a couch listener ask for. This is an excellent holiday gift too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce keeps on trucking!","review":"I wasn't sure Bruce would be as good with the Sessions Band as with the E Street,but I was wrong. He is strong and his musical support is outstanding. If you like Bruce you won't be dissapointed. This DVD makes a great Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful concert","review":"As I said before, all the Springsteen CDs were a Christmas gift. The person I sent them to really enjoys them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"I am not a Bruce Springsteen fan and had not purchased any of his CDs or DVDs before. While visiting my sister, she raved about the Live in Dublin DVD. She has good taste in music so I decided to buy the DVD with some trepidation. As soon as it arrived, I watched it and was amazed. I can't remember the last time that I saw such a phenomenal collection of great musicians on the stage together giving a concert. The songs by and large were a joy to listen to and the talent of each musician awesome. It all came together beautifully. If you like good music and great entertainment, this DVD should be in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating the Product, Not the Artist or the Genre...","review":"I am a big fan of Bruce and have seen him in concert multiple times. Additionally, I really enjoy this genre of music (check out \\"Vision Shared\\" the story of Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly for a truly great DVD and value). That being said, the editing on this DVD is terrible. There isn't any natural flow and you don't get the feel of actually being at a concert.Within a 10 second span you get 5 or 6 different shots in basically this sequence - Medium close up of Bruce Singing, followed by an extreme close up of the drummers hands...back to Bruce and then quickly to the back up singers and then to an extreme close up of hands playing a guitar. The promo for this product talks about how many cameras they used - in this case more is less because all the switching detracts from the DVD.Bottom line: This isn't a slam against one of the greatest artists of all time or this type of music but...beware that this DVD is borderline unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"best ever","review":"Even if you don't care for Springsteen singing, this band is thebest I have seen live or otherwise. It is a very long show besides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I'm a fan of folk music and classic Springsteen but it was a chore to sit through this DVD. No one can question the musical skill or energy of this performance. The engineering production was also very good.But the performance was conceptually flawed in my opinion. Most of the folk tunes would have sounded better solo or with a minimal accompaniment. Instead we get a huge band with a huge sound that seemed out of place to me. Simple tunes can easily lose their simple charm under such conditions.There are some Springsteen classics in the mix. I usually enjoy the retreatment he gives to his classics in a live concert but this time he missed with every single one. Given the other (high) ratings for this DVD I must put all this down to a matter of taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce.....Live","review":"This is one of the hopeless concert ever seen on the bluray.Pls dont buy it,waist of money....If ur Bruce fans better go for Live at Bercelona....Ryan Vaz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is one of our favorite Kidsongs DVD's. The baby animals are completely irresistable, and the kids are too. The video is very good quality and it's just overall FUN! My 15 month old has been mesmerized by it for months now. She loves all seven Kidsongs DVD's we own. They are pure, innocent, quality programming for young people. There is so much over-done, computer generated entertainment out there these days, it's refreshing to see REAL children with real animals, singing and dancing and being creative! I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"smallman superb","review":"This is an amazing collection of transcriptions for the guitar by John Williams. But while the transcriptions are superb, and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, under the able direction of Kenneth Sillito, performed with their dependable profesionalism, it is the craftmanship of Greg Smallman that stands out. And can he play? It is almost as though it was John Williams himself whose fingertips were upon the frets. Smallman is worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"beat chuggers","review":"I thought this had the original Eric Clapton version of Forever Man and was disappointed to find out it wasn't on it.

Hot coffee or tea goes right in, with a handle to keep your hand cool. They go through an automatic dishwasher super, and are sturdy as well. I love them, and use them daily.

I could not even finish the movie because I became so annoyed with the characters. The movie seemed ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible plot, script and acting","review":"First movie I've ever turned off half way through. The writing was terrible and not once did it make me giggle. Go for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardshell mandolin case","review":"This is a good case for the money. The safety catches are secure and won't wear out before the case does. The fit is snug, but quite big enough. The pocket for holding picks, etc. is large, and the cover holds securely. The case is lined with ample plush to keep the instrument protected. There is room to tuck in a soft cloth for wiping the strings, and I have also fitted in a small chord book. Good protection, light to carry, fastens securely--I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad news","review":"Vintage Gibson A-models won't fit in it. Other brands won't either.

It was a great little case for a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Back Hits","review":"This is a great single from Rick. He gives a strong & confident vocal proformance overall. It's a shame it was not released in the U.S. because it would have done major damage on the Club/Dance charts. Get \\"Sleeping\\" cd single & the full length cd which the song came from \\"Keep It Turned On\\" now, you don't regret it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Todd Terry's Best...","review":"I'm no big fan of Rick Astley, but man can he get you off your feet with this FANTASTIC song!!!. His voice has changed too, I didn't even know it was Rick Astley the first time I heard it on the radio. My favorite mix is Todd Terry's Mix, it's got the classic house stream but put together in a successful manner, as-well as Rick's voice sounds deeply-assuring and almost buzzing, the song goes through moments when Astley's lines ''On and On and On....'' becomes a bit too repetitive, but the mix still rocks!. This sounds allot like the mix Todd Terry did for The Cardigans with ''Love Fool''. And!! you get other great mixes to follow-up, Tiefschwarz Wake Up Mix, HIFI Crash, and a few edits of the included mixes.This is the only song I like by Rick Astley...Honestly, I never liked him before, but when I realized that it was him who was singing ''Sleeping'' over the radio, I thought WOW...what a great song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter, the best medicine, and what better doctors","review":"For us Three Stooges' fans, this newest rerelease on DVD is a welcome and overdue treat. The quality is very good on most and always satisfactory. The 7 selections presented here are highly enjoyable, some surprising choices, and all within the boys' best years. It is interesting to note that Curly was noticably ill and a tad sluggish during the filming of \\"Three Little Pirates\\" yet he still gives a highly enjoyable performance. It is oft regarded as his last great performance with the trio, as he suffered a stroke shortly after. If you are a Stooges' fan, you don't even need to read anyone's review to convince you...I'm sure you have already ordered this DVD !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Picture Quality !!!","review":"I was shocked and saddened to see the film quality of the stooge film titled \\"three Little Pirates\\" on this DVD. Throughout the entire stooge film there are 5 thick white vertical lines running through the film. It was so distracting to see lines running through Curly's face, that I couldnt focus on the dialogue.

Over the years, I've come to find spinach and brussels sprouts not too bad. But folks, these guys just are not funny! Not only does every scrap of set dressing and costuming look bargain-basement, but the labored schtick the protagonists go through over and over lacks all wit or imagination. It must have been torture for all concerned to grind out these preposterous exercises day in and day out. And remember, during shooting and before the sound editor's ministrations, there were no juicy bonks, smacks, doinks, rips, and sproings to punctuate and enliven the goings on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Are You? : 101 Ways of Seeing Yourself","review":"I'd like to say \\"0\\" stars, but I did find this book interesting and provocative. However, the author does not understand the Enneagram and has written erroneous information about it. I enjoyed the book until I hit this section. I immediately slammed the book and took it back. My logic is that if the Enneagram information is incorrect, how can I depend on any of the material?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stochastic Calculus","review":"Very gentle introduction to basic elements to do stochastic calculus.

The reviewer that said there was no power must of just got a really weird pack or wasn't putting batteries in right. These are well worth the money and I plan on buying more from Amazon at this price. I don't think Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Amazon or anyone else would sell batteries that didn't have power...seems really odd..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tendency to leak?","review":"My experience has been that these batteries leak more than other brands like Duracell, Energizer, and Kirkland. And the battery was even dated DEC 2012 (it was Dec 2008 when this happened). I am not buying these anymore. See the photo I uploaded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries leaked way before date","review":"We live in a vary rural area and in tornado alley, so power outages are frequent, and we require our batteries to be ready for the task when called upon, Today January 2013 while inspecting our batteries noticed we had two unopened packages of Ray-o-vac betteries that had leaked despite the date on the betteries which was Dec 2016. Can't count on them in pinch. Won't be buying this brand anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rayovac leaks!","review":"I've used all the major brands of alkaline batteries and they all leak, but Rayovac batteries leak sooner than others. Why are Rayovac batteries so much cheaper than the other brands? I'm guessing that it is not because of their superiority in manufacturing productivity. More likely, they use a thinner metal casing that corrodes faster. No more Rayovac for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"Well, it's Christmas night and I almost had very disappointed kids. I purchased a pack of these batteries when I ordered some toys. Most of the batteries in this pack didn't even work. A few worked but most of the batteries had NO POWER! It's just lucky I had a few Duracells on hand. It's too bad there isn't a rating of zero because that's the rating these batteries deserve. I'll never buy this brand again. I sure hope no one else had this experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those Of You Who Like To Come Home From Work...","review":"...And do absolutely nothing but sit on your couch - this is the perfect gift to yourself. I actually just stared at the bubbles rising as the colors changed from blue to green to yellow to red for about 45 minutes. Extremely relaxing. The tube is made of acrylic, not glass, so there's less of a chance of actually breaking it if it tips. The top screws on so it won't come off in case that tipping I just mentioned happens. The base is sturdy and supports the tube well, therefore, you'd have to give it a pretty good push for it to fall over. I had initially thought that the motor was too loud, but a pressure valve is attached that reduced any noise to a very, very low hum. So, if you wanna get in some sort of Zen state and relax, or you are easily satisfied, like myself (short attention span), this makes a great gift. It's better then a lava lamp and about 20 bucks more. Can't lose. And it looks pretty damn cool in my livingroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is awesome!","review":"I just got my bubble light for Xmas....a little early! LOL! I love it! The colors are vivid and the fish are so cute. It is one of the most relaxing things I have owned. You can just stare at it for hours!! The pump is nice and quiet and runs great. It looks to be well made. They provide you with three halogen bulbs and I found replacements on their web page...if I ever need them. I would highly recommend this product. It's the lava lamp of the 21 century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry After Auschwitz","review":"Adorno was wrong. There is poetry after Auschwitz, and this is what it looks like. Celan's short poems are compressed visions of horror. He tears at the fabric of language in order to render the torn fabric of reality. Reading Celan, I think of the best paintings by the contemporary German artist Anselm Kiefer, an artist who, like Celan, attacks his materials with fire, sometimes even burning gaping holes into his vast canvases. Art after Auschwitz must be prepared to show the damage, the tears in the fabric of what makes us human. Celan--and Kiefer, at his best--points toward a new way to be human. I cannot praise an artist more highly than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I cannot imagine anyone who like words and don't like Celan.This great Edition, bilingual, allows us to compare the original with what we can read in English - letting us enjoy also the sounds of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great","review":"This is one of my favorite cd's of all time.

The other TSOL was OK at best, and seemed much to interested in \\"making it\\" as a glam rock band. Getting Allday/Deadbeat Dad drummer Jay O'Brien to guest on this album was way cool. Nice work - look forward to more albums to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I got into TSOL a little while ago and I love \\"Dance With Me\\" and \\"Weathered Statues/TSOL EP\\". But TSOL has changed so much...maybe its their age. The thing that hurts the most is Jack's voice. He had such a great voice in the older days, it was a deeper booming voice that I've grown to love with songs like \\"Code Blue\\", \\"Silent Scream\\", \\"Abolish Government\\" and the rest. Even in the album \\"Beneath the Shadows\\", a wild departure musically, his voice was great. But in \\"Disappear\\" all he does is sing high. Most of the songs lack that TSOL flavor. Its really sad, but I still like this album. The guitars are incredible on it. Its just the lyrics and vocals aren't up to par. Needless to say, if you're a TSOL fan you'll appreciate this album as I do, but you'll love their much older stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfactory","review":"I am very happy with the price of this item.

This is such an essential book for understanding not only the importance of myth, but Africa's far-reaching contribution. Ford's book traces the genesis of myth and belief systems and shows an evolution that not only surfaces in other cultures, but even in the bible. A masterful documentary that takes us all on a hero's and heroine's journey"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb piece of non-fiction","review":"This is an excellent book. I'd give it 100 stars if I could. Like another reader wrote, I wish I had found this book sooner. Every African and African-American should read this book. Thank you so much, Mr. Ford. I'll keep my review simple because I could go on forever. This book puts African myths in their rightful place: as legitimate, awesome, powerful stories that explain the human condition and our connection to the creator. All myths sprang from the African ones and Ford does a masterful job in explaining why myths are important to our lives today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take A Walk With The Masta","review":"After a 6 year hiatus, Masta Ace comes back(strictly underground) with \\"Disposable Arts\\" originally released in 2001.(Re-released in 2004 along with the sequel \\"A Long Hot Summer\\")Ace, a hip hop veteran bringing 14 years of experience to the table at the time this album was originally released. Listeners not familiar to Ace and his style of flow will easily compare his tone of voice to sounding the same as Eminem's, fortunately, there is not comparison to Ace. Ace keeps it simple in his lyrical display and his topics of discussion are always about everyday life as seen through his eyes. Disposable Arts also displays Ace taking shots at the mainstream and fake thuggery in such cuts as \\"Don't Understand\\". Several guest appearances including Punch & Words, Jane Doe, Apocalypse, Rah Digga, The Outsidaz and Greg Nice make this one to add to the collection and guaranteed to get a consistent play in any tape deck, record or CD player(whatever you prefer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTA ACE SPEAKS TRUTH","review":"THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW RAP CDS WHERE GOOD LYRICS AND NICE BEATS ARE BOTH TOGETHER ON ALL THE SONGS.MASTA ACES LYRICS ARE REAL AND TELL A STORY.

These days the rap game seems kinda unfair. They feel as though you have to rap about guns, jewlery, and cars. If you don't then the media won't accept you. And thats where Masta Ace is put, right in the underground, or as I like to call it \\"The overlooked & slept-on\\" category. Either way take my advice, and don't sleep on artist like Masta Ace. Go out and buy his Cd's, and prove to the world that rappers have more to talk about, than guns, bi--h's, & drugs. I give it 5 stars, for thoughtful lyrics, great beats, and for Masta Ace staying true to the art of hip-hop. Thanks Masta Ace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to have him back..............","review":".......even if it is Ace's last album (as the rumor goes). This guy has always been one of hip-hop's best kept secrets. Not quite \\"underground\\", but nowhere near commercial! Nice beats, good lyrics. It's such a relief to hear rap without having to hear all about how much ice somebody has, or how much cash you got. Just real lyrics with something real to say. Standout tracks include \\"Don't Understand\\", \\"Hold U\\", \\"Unfriendly Game\\", \\"Alphabet Soup\\" and \\"No Regrets\\"Also, what's with this so called sounding like Eminem thing. I heard a little of that on MAYBE one track. But I had to really listen to hear it, I would never have noticed it if it wasn't written in Oliver Wangs review. Must be an Eminem fan.

Production, Lyrics, and the storyline skit to go along with it. Ace sounds very focus on this project and it is good to see him back and stronger than ever. He's been out even before we even heard of Eminem. Of course Ace has been puttin'it down since he was in the Juice Crew but I always heard him doing freestyles on college radio stations back in NY. He had that flow and cadence in the mid 90's.(94 to 96). That's before anyone, even Dr. Dre heard or saw Eminem. Not hating on Em and yeah Ace and Em do sound alike but you think he doesn't know that. That is probably why he did a \\"Dear Stan\\"type song. Get this album. It's hot from beginning to end.

You can listen to this cd from beginning to end without wanting to skip any songs, and her lyrics are powerful, as always. Whether you're a long-time fan of Pink, or someone just wanting to take a listen because you heard a couple good songs on the radio from this album, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented, but in the end a judgemental hypocrite","review":"It's sad. Pink could be good, but makes a living by running around talking trash on pop stars. Not only is this judgemental, but it's very ironic becuase PINK IS A POP STAR. One more time...PINK IS A POP STAR. She is a marketing campiagn with legs. I would call her a sell-out, but I can't. You have to have made something original in the past....and then sell-out. REMEMBER...actions speak louder than words. I wish Pink would quit telling us how much cooler she is than the \\"other\\" pop stars, and show us by coming up with something original and outside of the box.

Now I gotta try and flog it on Ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dead CD from a Dead Singer in Denial About Being Dead","review":"Let me tell you something about this CD: BLAND, BORING, and TOTALLY FORGETABLE. Just a bunch of noise and insipid lyrics with no type of melodies. I've heard *way* better pop albums. Pink is no different and no better than anyone else out there right now. I don't even know why she came back- no one really missed her. Maybe I would take her seriously if she played an instrument and wasn't hypocritical and boastful. Why cry about \\"the homeless in the streets\\" in \\"Dear Mr. President\\" and then boast about your rims, diamonds, and someone's house fitting in your swimming pool in \\"Cuz I Can\\"? Since Pink is concerned about the homeless, she should invite them to live with her in her big house and ride in her expensive whips. Skip this juvenile album from this Janis Joplin wanksta at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Only More Crap","review":"You cant call this \\"music\\".For comfort the people call this \\"music\\", but in fact is only an aproximation, the composition and creativity of the songs are very poor.So what is the music? where i find it?. Well if you wanna learn about music listen Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Hendrix, Weather Report, Clapton, Tribal Tech, JEFF BECK, Paco De Lucia, Miles Davis. Remember, all the types of music or almost all are good rock, blues, funk, hard rock, pop, flamenco, tango, bossa nova, fusion.The problem not is the genre, the problem is the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great songs","review":"I like several songs in the CD (not all of them though).

You go girl!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"I really wanted to write a scathing review, but I'm going to refrain because I looove Pink and I think she is totally rad, but this album is not up to snuff. I don't know if her label threatened to drop her if she didn't churn out a few hits or what, but the album is lyrically trite and melodically hackneyed-- the bad kind of pop. To me, her fist 2 albums were the good kind. Even the third had redeeming songs. (Duet w/ Peaches? Awesome.) She gets 2 stars instead of 1 for the duet w/ the Indigo Girls.And that is my nice review."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cussing ruins this CD [Explicit Lyrics version]","review":"The cussing in a few Explicit songs simply ruin this CD.

A must have immediately for all P!nk fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for You and Your Hand, but others are good too","review":"I bought this mostly for \\"You and Your Hand\\". However, while that's still a favorite, \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is excellent as well as the \\"Stupid Girls\\" which is being played on air. There is also a bonus track not listed that is done by Pink and her dad about his Vietnam War experience which is very good. The insert to the cd (the paper thing with the lyrics) is also quite interesting. It has many pictures and her \\"insights\\" to the cd, life, etc. I would definitely recommend it, am glad I bought it and I will NOT be putting it on eBay as I do many cds I buy and don't care for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Yet","review":"Pink's new album \\"I'm Not Dead\\" is her best yet! 5/5 stars. With hits such as \\"U + Ur Hand,\\" \\"Cuz I Can,\\" \\"Who Knew,\\" her open letter to President Bush \\"Dear Mr President,\\" and the smash hit \\"Stupid Girls.\\" She's combined new beats with fresh new lyrics, that anyone could relate to. This item is a definite buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad at all...","review":"This cd is a big step up from miss Pink's last record. It has some great beats, and while it is still rocked out in true \\"Pink\\" style....it delves back a little into the r&b style she was first discovered for. I liked her better when she was the new voice of r&b so to hear songs that exhibited the natural soul in her voice was a great treat. Also, most evident to me, was the fact that this record was in fact the first time this artist has been so truthful and honest in her music. She has thoughts and ideas and feelings and messages for the world to hear and they are very well interpreted onto this cd (*note- Dear Mr President) There were only two songs that I didn't like but other than that I would hugely recommend this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink ain't dead","review":"Pink, along with Britney and Beyonce, is the new female voice of the 21st century.

Nothing wrong with diagreeing with anyone, but how about making a difference instead of just complaining..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Not Dead, But Can Be Arranged","review":"This was by far the dumbest album I've ever had the displeasure of purchasing. As a Pink fan, I could not remember why I haven't bought the album. This is why shopping at the Walmart Supercenter at about 2:30 a.m. is not the best idea because after listening to the album, I rediscovered why I'm no longer a Pink fan. Stupid Girls is supposedly a stab at the other girls and girl bands in the industry. At least they found a genre and stuck to it. Pink went from wannabe R&B to sample pop/rock to rock to I don't know what the hell this is. She is maybe one of the fakest singers out there, so I hardly think stupid gilrs was the best first single. She now sucks and I must disengage from my memory in T-30 seconds. Must Destroy For All Listening-Kind!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HELL,NO","review":"I want to remind all reviewers that the only good music created by anthing with the name pink has the word FLOYD after it.I'm not dead is most certainly the worst album of 2006 by a mile.Each and every song is boring,pathetic and awful.Definetely not worth a listen.Get ON AN ISLAND from DAVID GILMOUR instead which is the best release of 2006."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I used to like Pink but I think her music has gone downhill.

It's an acoustic guitar version of a song that she performs with a dad. Full of harmony. Beautiful.I also received it right on time.The only concern I have - and this is not about the CD per se, is that whenever I order CDs on line by Amazon, I get numerous e-mails written in other languages, other alphabets, some of which contain potential viruses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink is very much alive!","review":"In my opinion, Pink keeps getting better with each CD. \\"Stupid Girls\\" is not indicitive of the whole CD at all. The song has fine lyrics, but a shopworn style. My favorite songs are \\"Dear Mr. President,\\" \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\", \\"Who Knew,\\" and \\"The One That Got Away.\\" If you love power pop, \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" is a real treat. \\"Who Knew\\" is driving rock that has a folky touch. Pink does pure folk/pop on \\"Dear Mr. President.\\" The rest of the faster songs are an R&B, rock, and dance combo. Understated ballads end the album, and they are Pink's most soulful songs yet. There really were no songs I didn't like! One of the best CDs of 2006 so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"P!NK ROCKS!!!","review":"I'M NOT DEAD is another ROCKIN' ALBUM by the one and only P!NK! I would give this album 10 stars if I could. Anytime- you buy a P!NK CD it is worth EVERY PENNY SPENT!!! I am a HUGE fan!!! I have all of her records and I can't wait for her World Tour starting in September. One thing you can always count on is her \\"tell it like it is\\" attitude. I really appreciate that in an artist. Someone who is not afraid to voice their opinions and views. So- if you do not have this CD yet. BUY IT NOW!!! You will not regret it!!! While you are at it- if you do not have all of her other albums- BUY THOSE TOO!!! MISUNDASTOOD is my FAVORITE CD in the ENTIRE WORLD!!! I'M NOT DEAD is going to be added to that list!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Pink","review":"If you love \\"The Truth about Love\\" you'll adore this.

Worth the wait !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Rocks","review":"I had lost faith in my girl with Try This. I had to force myself to listen to that CD more than once to make sure that I really hated it as much as I thought I did. Because of that, I waited a long time to pick up I'm Not Dead.I wish I hadn't waited. I'm Not Dead is the best Pink yet. I love the bluesy parts, the rock kicks serious ass too.

It is going to be one of my favorite albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Underdog in the Pop Icon Race","review":"No one has ever said that \\"Pink\\" will be the next Madonna. In the rush to crown Britney or Christina or Jessica, Pink has snuck in and is not only stealing the crown from them all, she's mocking them while she does it.The album is not perfect and it hits low point that do suck. However, the high points are so high that it doesn't matter. This is a pitch-perfect pop album. Gwen Stefani meets Kelly Clarkson with a dash of Britney's producer thrown in for kicks.The best songs are: \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\", \\"U + Ur Hand\\", and \\"Long Way to Happy\\".Bravo Pink. One more album of this caliber and the crown is yours. Britney who?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew?","review":"Until today, I didn't concider myself a PINK fan. I knew of her, heard a few of her songs, and really didn't think one way or another about her. Then I saw the video live performance of Dear Mr. President floating around on the web and literally had tears in my eyes. Wow, what's wrong me? When was the last time a song movd me to tears? So, no joke I raced to buy the CD, praying the whole time that there will be more than just one good song. My prayers were answered. The song Who Knew, once again had more tears in my ears. Long way to happy-had me thinking she snuck a peek into my diaries. I completely jived with The One that got away and conversatins with my 13 year old self-is just pure genius. Pink has grown tremenously as an artist and I'm just awed by this CD. Bravo, Pink.

But Pink shouldn't sing about being a Stupid Girl because Pink acts just like a stupid girl. Pink's immature and Pink dropped out of high school. At least all the other blonde party girls graduated from high school. Oh... Pink drinks and have done drugs in the past and she claims she not a stupid girl but a smart girl. She even admitted to the MTV Video awards audience back in 2003 that she was to drunk to make an acceptance speech when she won an award for best pop video. Pink is the stupid girl.

It can be painful if rubbed over bony areas such as directly over the spine or tip of the shoulder area. However, when kept of the \\"meaty\\" tissue, it does a good job of massaging and it is a much deeper massage than with an other home unit that I have tried. It has 4 different tips that are easy to change on the head of the massager. Heat is also included on this unit and comes with specific tips for the heat mode. There is a soft, medium and aggressive tip also included. Don't get me wrong, nothing will replace human hands when it comes to having a massage, but this is a nice thing to have when you want your back rubbed and there is no one to do it. It also works if you have that significant other that is just too tired to massage you but is willing to rub this up and down on your back, or your legs, or wherever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest!","review":"This is the best massager I have ever bought.

The health aspects of this popcorn has been commented on before in other reviews, however I will say, it seems that the overall fat content is in fact relatively low.

The difference is 7.44 ounces, or enough for another 2.57 bags of popcorn! It would also be nice if one could call up the Nutrition Facts of food products on Amazon - then I would have known O.R.'s Natural has 300mg of sodium per serving, compared to O.R.'s Light Butter at only 190mg of sodium/serving.

It started well, setting the stage for Geronimo's rise. Adams lays out the geography and politics of the time very well. But then the story begins to get very dull.Every battle and every agreement is painstakingly set up. The author notes that the white man shamefully broke every promise (Geronimo was a clever tactician when he broke promises). After a few of these, it gets a little dull. No, very dull. That may, in fact, be the history of the Southwest, but it doesn't mean that it is interesting reading.Good setup, poor payoff. I would recommend finding another biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I have heard Twink described as an egomaniac and though I never knew him, this album is assuredly by a guy with a healthy if not more sense of self.Which works just fine.

In this fine book, there are lessons to be learned for all who wish to lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anders vs. Burrows","review":"As someone who followed the HP acquisition of Compaq in the press, it was interesting to read two very different accounts of it in the books by Anders and Burrows. Both were well-written. The difference is that Anders was relatively objective and balanced; Burrows wrote an anti-Fiorina manifesto. There are no bad guys in Anders' book: he portrays the pro- and anti-merger forces in fair terms, warts and all. Burrows appears to be smarting over not having as full access to the HP side as he did to the Hewlett side, and it permeates his book. Reading about the same event or discussion in each, one comes away with a much more in-depth, balanced view of the item from Anders. No surprise that Anders is the one who has won a Pulitzer Prize for prior work."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous propaganda","review":"Carly Fiorina's tenure as CEO at HP was one of the worst performances in the history of Silicon Valley.

She repeatedly blames HP's recent leadership ills on Lew Platt yet there is so much more that could have been written of Fiorina's view of the leadership at HP such as why the executives of struggling businesses (computers, services) were retained when their peers in the vastly successful printing businesses chose to \\"seek opportunities elsewhere\\".

I just find it so unbelievably pretentious that I can't stand it. There does not seem to be an honest emotion in her. She reminds me of many of Whitney Houston and Maria Carey CDs, emotionally vapid vocal gymnastics. Instead of running all over the scale, she has a \\"sound\\". She has a great voice, just like Maria and Whitney, but there is no substance in her style. Millions of people buy their bad CDs' and think they are great.

The techniques of effective writing are very different from those of effective speaking. Hoff takes pages and pages to make even the simplest point, something that could have been communicated in three sentences perfectly well. He can't simply just come out and state a something and be content with the fact that he's just shared something extremely useful. He comes off as trying to entertain more than inform. If you're making a presentation to high school students, maybe that's a good idea. But after 50 pages in a book, it starts to feel incredibly condescending.

The book is a collection of stories told from the perspective of second class passenger Lawrence Beesly, first class passenger Col. Archibold Gracie, Second Officer Charles Lightoller, and Junior Marconi Operator Harold Bride respectively. Each telling the tale of the foundering of the great ship from his own experience during the hours of 11:20pm April 14 to 8:30am April 15, 1912.

East meets West, dance rhythms and ambients sequences, Celtic and tablas, the beautiful, the exotic (and erotic!), the dark and the atmospheric. All of this together shouldn't work, but for the most part, it does! And it does so because the composer treats all these elements as if they were natural to the music and the compositions. It is that subtlety that sets David Wright apart from the rest! So, there is no \\"look at my world influences\\" or other indulgencies here. It is simply about creating a musical soundscape that draws you in to it and ultimately satisfies on just about every level.

Kenya, and then snuck back into camp several weeks later. Unfortunately, while their adventure was undoubtedly remarkable, it never really comes alive in Benuzzi's book. I suspect much of the problem for me is that I know nothing about mountaineering and don't particularly find it interesting. The other difficulty I had was with the flatness of the prose, whether this is due to a weak translation or to Benuzzi's writing in a foreign language I don't know, but in any event, I found it rather tepid.

As simple as that can be, feng shui is about physics, intuition and scientific data that corroborates the effects of the application. Coordinanting the right angles to create a contrast with the energy we give and receive. In this book the author does not corroborate any of his data, and assumes that feng shui is the same for everyone, dividing areas of the home in different areas of prosperity. I have certaintly learn to be more carefull of what a buy, and understand the unreliable information in the market about feng shui.

A strong, no-nonsense female lead and plenty of action (think \\"Alias\\" if you need a frame of reference). A little romance thrown in. Good use of cliff-hangers at the end of chapters.

Baldwin is a new author worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Pursuit","review":"I really enjoy Kim Baldwin's books, but unfortunately this is not one of them. When it comes to a love story with a lot of action, I'm usually willing to overlook some minor illogical plot points, but in this case, there were just too many things that seemed forced as well as implausible. First, we are asked to believe that a highly trained, hardened assassin is willing to put her own security on the line to rescue a stranger and bring her back to her bunker. Second, the two women fall deeply in love after only a handful of exchanges. Third, how is it that Hunter has managed to build a very high-tech, modern bunker into the side of a mountain without drawing any notice? Four, why does Scout take so long to make her move? And finally, the resolution at the end of the book was way too easy and tidy for me. I don't relish writing bad reviews, but you should save your money and time and read something else written by Baldwin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!","review":"Hunter's Pursuit will keep your interest right to the last word.

But Heart's Ease is an early Stuart that misses on a lot of levels. There are so many you've-gotta-be-kidding moments, when serious misunderstandings could easily and quickly be righted with a simple explanation. But that doesn't happen with this hero and heroine -- each decides he (or she) isn't going to make the attempt because, obviously, the other person wouldn't listen to facts. I also find it hard to believe that a research scientist would not attempt to defend herself against allegations that she had falsified test results, a claim that, if true, would end her career. It was also unsettling how these two almost-strangers, who hated one another, kept coming together physically. If you want to see how far Ms. Stuart has come since this early work - and she certainly has developed into a wonderful writer - then this might be an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great beginner for piano","review":"I learned from the earlier version of this book over 30 years ago (it was chosen by my wonderful piano teacher back then)...I wasn't able to find my original one and decided to buy the new one in order to help my children learn some piano and expand their musical interests.

There are missing particles, punctuation errors, and a host of other typos. The bold italics are inconsistent and there is at least one passage of the root text that is just plain garbled. A scholar with a reputation like Stephen Hodge should have his work proofread BEFORE it goes to press. The \\"Mahavairocana Tantra\\" is clearly not for the tenderfoot, but one should be able to read this text without always having to wonder: \\"is that another typo or did the author really mean to say that.\\" Unfortunately, the sloppy presentation does not inspire confidence in the translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Reference & Resource for the Miniature Crafter","review":"This book is charming, fun, endearing, funny and thoroughly helpful to anyone wishing to make miniature items for their to-scale dollhouse or for any other purpose. The author presents her instructions with a measure of tongue-in-cheek self-deprecation (as I recall the hobby horse came out a little more Rubensesque than she had intended) but also pride in her accomplishment and in her craftsmanship, which is well deserved.Projects as simple as dipping candles or as complex as soldering cookware are offered. The design of the house is unique and intriguing - stairways leading to secret rooms, doorways to nowhere, and an odd assortment of residents make this a book of fantasy and fire for the imagination. This book has been in my library for more years than I can count. I highly recommend it as a resource or just as a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This book will help any therapist become better at understanding and working with clients.

It's immensely obvious but yet you don't hear anyone else sharing this viewpoint. Certainly it's a key to living a more meaningful spiritual life.This viewpioint is evident in each and every quote in this book. I especially loved the quote, \\"As Soul you are like a ballon that rises above the ground. The higher you go, the farther you can see. And the farther you can see, the better you can plan your life.\\"This is a great book that I highly recommend to other spiritual seekers.

Once the alarm goes off and you push snooze, the sound machine part does not automatically come back on, so you go from a reasonably nice sound, to an awful buzzer (whose volume depends on which volume you had the nature sounds volume at), to dead silence. Plus, the angle of the snooze button (on the front rather than the top) makes it hard to easily push with one hand. Most of the buttons are small and hard to use.If you enjoy waking up with a jolt, this is for you.A previous reviewer was totally correct about the Wind sound being scary!

Maybe if you just use it for 30 or so minutes at a time, it would last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all I was expecting","review":"This is an odd item. I got it for the sounds (to cover noise in my bedroom), but they are less than I was expecting. For example the sounds repeat every 5 seconds. Once I heard the pattern, it started to be annoying in stead of relaxing. Also it requires 2 AAA batteries EVEN WHEN you have it plugged into the AC outlet. This wasn't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Major problem with this product. I bought it so that I could sleep to the spa sounds, but the alarm clock only works if no sounds (or radio) are on. What good is that? The previous version of the product was great and I had it for many years. Now I had to buy an alarm clock so that I can sleep to the spa sounds. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within minutes!","review":"I bought this for our guest room, primarily for the sound spa. My daughter visited, and set up the machine. She got a soothing sound for about 30 minutes, but then it quit. She assumed that she had set the timer by accident, but could not get the sound to come back on.She tried the next morning, but gave up. I tried several times over the next two days, but could not get any sounds, either the sound spa or the radio. The clock was working, and the \\"sound\\" button would cause the display to show different sounds--but not a sound from the machine! The \\"on-off\\" button (which is supposed to light up when on) does not seem to be working. I tried all new batteries, plugged in or battery power, etc., but it is not working at all.I am very disappointed. In my own bedroom, I have an inexpensive Phillips clock/soundspa that has been working flawlessly for at least 10 years, playing sounds all night, every night! I wish I could find that model for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had a better experience. . .","review":"I wanted to like this clock, but after a few months, the radio started randomly turning itself on at all hours of day or night. Additionally, the alarm would sometimes reset itself. I tried to figure out if something else was interfering with it but was never able to identify the problem. Then after less than a year, the radio came on and I was unable to ever turn it off again without cutting the power. At the same time, the display went blank. It's too bad, because other than the fact that it became useless after a few months, it was perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second time I used it, it went dead","review":"This was not all that impressive a sound machine when it worked, but on top of that, it died last week when I used it for only the second time. The power is there, and the light comes on, but it's deader than Julius Caesar and won't make a noise. For an item this large and bulky, this thing just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible quality","review":"- Sounds like statics, nothing like nature sounds- Time is off by a minute every day- un-readable from lying down position- timer totally unpredictableSummary: totally useless"},{"rating":"1","title":"static from a radio","review":"Bought this and I thought it was static from a radio.

ALso when I turn volume wheel, it makes weired noises and volume control is gone almost. Clock display is so small that you can not read it in the morning (though I have 20/20 eyesight). Though it is still working after two years and I daily wake up using beep alarm. I tell you, having pleasurable sounds in home is a nice idea in theory but after some time you just do not use it.and how thehell you setup this rating/voting ON ? While giving review, I do not see any option like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad button design and unreliable tuner","review":"This clock radio suffers from several problems.1) The button design is such that you must grab the radio to keep it from moving away from you when you try to hit the on/off and snooze buttons.2) The tuner gets dust in it very quickly and it becomes very hard to tune to a particular station...ditto on the volume control.3) The actual clock has small digits and poor lighting. This makes it hard to see in the middle of the night.On a personal note the nature sounds didn't wake me up anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I have the same problems with the display, etc. as everyone else mentioned, plus I would like to add the following:1. Buttons require too much force to press down and are awkward;2. Radio and nature sounds share the same volume knob, which means if you turn the nature sounds down a bit and your alarm is set for radio or buzzer, you may not hear your alarm in the morning (this happened to me and made me late to work);3. The only way to 'un-set' the alarm is to cycle through all sound settings;4. The Snooze button and the sound On/Off button are right next to each other and similar in shape, meaning you can very easily turn the alarm sound off instead of hitting Snooze as intended (this also happened to me).I strongly dislike this item and am sending it back. The sounds and FM reception are OK, but it is very poorly designed and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a month","review":"It was nice while it lasted, but it broke after about a month of use. The sounds loop after about one second, which on some of them gives them a rhythm that I found hard to sleep to. But other sounds are good and restful. I haven't tried to get any kind of warranty service, but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after only a few days","review":"We bought this to try and help our baby sleep - friends told us white noise might help. Well, it seemed to help our baby to sleep for the few days that it worked. Only 4 days later, none of the white noise functions work anymore. Tried changing the batteries, that didn't help. We are hoping to return this item to the retail store where it was bought, since the $5 handling fee for the warranty is too much to spend on a $20 dollar item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"Beware - this is a piece of garbage. It is cheaply made, and it only works about half of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought THREE of them, all of them broke!","review":"This is very cheaply made and really a defective product. I bought this to help my baby sleep with repetitive sounds and to block out the dog barking and other children in the house. The volume control was very sketchy, it would be quite and then cut-out and then be loud and then cut out again. After only a month it stopped working completely. I took it back to the store and exchanged it. The same thing happened two more times with two different units. I finally gave up and returned it for good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad product with a side of deception","review":"I recieved my package today, and to my major dissappointment, the sound quality produced by this nature alarm clock is horrific. After listening to my new clock for the first time a buzz developed that I have been unable to get rid of also. Probably the biggest dissappointment though was the fact that the alarm clock that I got was not the one pictured. The buttons on the top are different, and there are no dials on the left side. It appears like I was sent an earlier model then what is pictured, so buyers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth cheap price","review":"this is my second one, don't ask why the second. i've had this one for 6 months now and the clock is broken and the sounds are terrible. trust me, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, but this is junk","review":"I don't like to be negative, but will be just possibly to save anyone else from wasting their money. I agree that the sounds were good, but these are available on so many other products. If you used it only for the sounds, perhaps you won't be totally disappointed. Similar to a previous reviewer, my stand broke as well (and you basically have to lay it flat without a stand - it would be tough to repair given it's construction). Furthermore, the radio tuner is terrible. I receive a strong signal to a particular station, but it kept drifting in and out of static on this radio because the tuning band is so narrow. That was really irritating. Finally, the clock did not even keep proper time; it was off about 15 minutes per month. Hope these comments help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this unit to use only for the sound function.I have ringing in my ears and need white noise playing in the background in order to help me sleep. I use the sound \\"Falls\\"I am already on my second unit after 10 days of use. The 1st unit was returned after 5 days because the unit will not stay on all night even though the timer is set to \\"0\\" , which according to the owners manual, will keep the sound playing continiously until you manually shut it off. However, it turns its self off every night, sometimes after 3 hours sometimes it will go 6 hours and then shut off and when it does, I wake up ! Both units have done this so I have no faith in this product.I am going to return this unit (the 2nd one for me)and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the task","review":"Unfortunately, this product was not a good option for blocking out outside noise so our little one could sleep. Although it should stay on contiuously through the night (if set to) it would turn off sporadically causing disruptions in sleep rather than a good night's rest. Also the clock is poorly lighted for viewing in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work after a few months","review":"I did not get to use the HoMedics much before it was totally non-functional. Neither the sound machine nor the clock work with new batteries, after only 10 or so uses. Plugging in the AC Adapter does not help.I looked at the warranty, since I bought the unit only a few months ago. I am supposed to mail the unit postage paid, along with a certified check or money order for five dollars. HoMedics has successfully made the warranty almost useless for a twenty dollar item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 1 month","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and it broke in exactly one month.

Not much use for a clock that doesn't let you tell time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper than it looks.","review":"I bought this item for my husband because he often has trouble relaxing and getting to sleep. It looks like a flimsy plastic radio and while it has several different sound settings, the all pretty much sound alike, because there's static drowning out all of them. If you really want a sound machine, I would suggest going with a pricier Sharper Image type model."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"The designers of this clock forgot a few things, like making sure the clock doesn't slide away when you try to turn off the alarm. They also didn't think that someone might want to actually see what time it is in the dark.Worst design ever, and the sound quality is pretty poor too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can hear radio sounds when sound machine is on","review":"I used to love this machine. As time went on, however, when I listen to the \\"ocean sounds\\" to fall asleep to, I can hear the noise of a radio station in the background (when the ocean sound lulls every few seconds). Nothing that I have tried to do to fix this problem works (I could handle static, but even if I tune the radio to an AM station with no reception, when I turn on the sound part of the machine, I can still hear someone singing or talking in the background). Currently, I have jammed the radio tuner halfway between AM and FM which worked for about a week until some random station started playing again. Also, if the alarm mode is set to \\"off,\\" the sound machine will still turn off at whatever time the alarm was last set to (which will wake up the light sleepers among us)."},{"rating":"2","title":"waterfoul studies","review":"as a taxidermist this book has great detail. there are soo many ducks that not all could be included in one book. the idea of splitting the ducks into categories is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, interesting writing style","review":"I am enjoying reading this book because it's easy to read and the subject matter keeps my interest.

My only issue with this book is how it's written. You can really tell Pam is not a writer. The thing that gets me is that there are actually grammatical errors throughout the book, and Pam uses words like \\"like\\" and \\"sort of\\", \\"kind of\\", \\"really, really\\", etc....lots of terms that sound like she's just rambling on to you about things over the phone.

It is full of wisdom and spiritual insight.It shows how what we think and feel become our health, and how changing those old patterns can bring a new picture of health. There is a chart that lists each chakra and what fears are held in each as well as how each is healed.It is not a fast read. You will sit and contemplate often. One spiritual exercise I have done is to spend a whole day with a healing affirmation from the chart: Appreciation, Sincerity, Unselfishness (ie unselfconsciousness), idealism, devotion, personal effort, acceptance. Then the next day go on to the next word. It is life changing. Like climbing Jacob's ladder.Hope it means as much to you as it has to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compelling for kids","review":"I just can't see a group of kids wanting to listen to this, nor can I see one picking it up to read.

It briefly mentions abortion, the Dark Ages, suicide bombers, religious intolerance, 9/11, school prayer, a child's death, bigotry, women's rights, Kurt Vonnegut - yes Kurt Vonnegut, and on and on. All of these are mentioned in a book(pamphlet really) you can read in less than 15 minutes. Not things I want to discuss with a young child.I also don't like the tone, which I consider a bit righteous. I don't want to \\"sell\\" humanism, I just want to explain it.I won't show the book to my child and would like to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this book","review":"I found this book to be preachy, patronizing, and a bit snotty.

For example, my printer had 128 MB of memory from the factory, plus this 256 MB upgrade, equals 384 MB total. Out of these the printer reported 352.39 MB available to the user.

I grew up watching Dead Poet's Society and of course Before Sunrise/Sunset and Waking Life. I came to this novel not expecting much but was quite pleasantly surprised. It's not exactly going to win the Pulitzer Prize, but it was an interesting read and eerily captures the worries and doubts of the MTV'd-out, tripped-out, relationshiped-out twenty-something mind. This book is helpful if you're going through the maelstrom that is a young marriage in America. Also I liked that he referenced both the Beat Poets and Thomas Merton in his acknowledgement section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life and Love and the Harrowing Pursuit of Happiness.","review":"I went to see Ethan do a reading of this book in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago, and was suprised to find him engaging and thoughtful and funny... I had gone with the expectation of seeing a typical evasive \\"poser\\" Hollywood publicity appearance, but he was great! Oh, and he wore WHITE socks with dark shoes and green pants. Such nerve.As a writer, I was encouraged when he said that this novel took five years to complete (good things take time, even when you have fabulous connections and a gorgeous wife! Imagine!). Even more heartening, this is a enormous leap forward from his first novel, which was stilted and difficult to finish.Ethan, you pressed on and created a second book that is *well* worth reading. I'm 29, so maybe it spoke perfectly to the angst about relationships and love that people my age have, but I've actually gone back and searched for certain thoughts since I finished the book a week ago... I don't usually do that.Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay! A good book.","review":"Ethan Hawke wrote a good book about love, the fear of losing that love, and then coming to realize what both of those things mean to a person. Thoughtful insights into becoming a parent, also. Plus, as an Ohioan, I love to read things or hear things that mention my state (we're bored here in Ohio, okay?!). Jimmy and Christy are full characters, and the split narrative is effective and, I believe, necessary to feel and understand their complexities as separate characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Waste of Time!","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this novel. After reading Hawke's, The Hottest State, and loving it...I was expecting to have a similar experience with Ash Wednesday. Boy, was I ever wrong!

Please, don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great effort","review":"After enjoying The Hottest State, I looked forward to reading Ash Wednesday and was not disappointed.The intriguing use of first person narrative works well, giving equal time to understanding the actions of the main characters.Christy's voice is especially strong.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please take this moron's pen away","review":"Acting is a worthy profession. It takes skill, talent and, motivation. However, it's not that hard, it isn't something that compares to air traffic controlling, emergency surgery, or writing. So why is it that actors think they can do all sorts of things? They tell us who to vote for, who to give our charity money to, or in this instance, write novels? This is the biggest waste of ink and paper since \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul.\\" This is a self-indulgent farce. Just because he can stand on a desk, doesn't mean his cliche stupidities should be immortalized. I'd like to think that the publishing industry wouldn't infilict such tripe on us if it wasn't for his celebrity. If you are thinking of purchasing this book, please consider something else, perhaps a punch in the mouth (believe me, it would hurt less). This book, and Mr. Hawke, are a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"This story does not say a lot and what it does say is not said well. The plot is derivative. The characters are hollow and unlikable. The male character's narcissistic self-reflections grate unmercifully. The female in particular is reduced to a hollow caricature. The tone strikes me as somehow false in that the story's \\"honesty\\" seems a pose. A good actor does not a good writer make. Forego this book and read the classics. F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Tender is the Night\\" and \\"The Beautiful and the Damned\\" are good places to start. Sprinkle in Hemingway's short stories. Throw in D.H. Lawrence; he wrote obsessively about male/female interactions and did so with great insight and honesty. Add Sam Shepard's plays to your list. These are the real McCoys. Sadly, it seems that Hawke's publisher wants to cash in on his celebrity status, because if this book were written by a non-famous type it would have been promptly rejected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thou Shall Not Read","review":"What an original plot Ethan Hawke has come up with: Two young people who were meant to be together and love one another for the rest of their lives just can't seem to get it together (what with all the obstacles thrown in their way), unless they make a serious effort. To make it really interesting(?), let's have the guy be AWOL from committments: his 'career'(The Army), his family, and even his religion. As for the girl - why she has 'committment issues' with men, due to her tattered relationship with her daddy, that she has yet to come to grips with. Throw in an unwanted preganancy and what do you have? A story that has been done many times before - only better from more capable writers (not to mention screen-writers, too). Sorry Mr. Hawke, don't give up your day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I made it through the entire book","review":"This is not an easy task with Hawke's book b/c the characters are narcissistic and stifling. The writing is not revelatory, but there is a heart to the book and that is offered quite sincerely. Neither character is one you'd necessarily like to sit down with for dinner (well maybe Christy, b/c she is depicted as being very sexually-attractive and her mood changes are interesting).But this is a book I felt like putting down a couple of times b/c it doesn't have a real strong narrative drive, but I stayed with it, found the male character endearing and honest, and ended up enjoying it pretty much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again","review":"If the myth about 100 monkeys at 100 typewriters is true - then Ethan Hawke is monkey #1.Ethan Hawke types, he does not write (thank you Truman Capote).

This book is not a contribution to literature, it is a expression of vanity, ego and Hollywood name value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Actor, Very Good Writer","review":"Ethan Hawke has always been a strong actor in such movies as Dead Poet's Society, Reality Bites and Training Day. I was a little skeptical about giving this book a try, but I'm glad that I did. It was a very compelling story about a young couple trying to get started in a world that wanted to throw obstacles in their way, right and left. Relationships aren't easy, love isn't easy and marriage is flat-out HARD. More books need to paint this picture. The characters were interesting and multi-dimensional.

I got this so I could lay the tablet flat on a desk, so I can type and write on my tablet. This keyboard really makes an excellent setup for note taking.Pros: Good design overall, not too expensive, very portable and lightweight without feeling cheap, keys are full sized except for arrow keys, overall very good.Cons: The spacebar is \\"cut in half\\" to allow folding of the keyboard (it is sometimes annoying when typing fast), also the arrow buttons are kinda cheap and not very useful, they don't have a good feel and are hard to press compared to all the other keys.

If I was still had morning sickness I do not think I could use it. I do like how it absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft.

Would actually be fairly nice for a temporary solution to the hot sun heating up my house if it didn't fall down every day.

It was very easy to cut it to the length that I needed with a utility knife. I did make a slight alteration in that I applied the adhesive tape to 2 pieces of very thin wood that I cut to the length that I needed. This allows me to put up the shade in the window in the summer when it is needed, but I will be able to easily take it down and when the weather turns cooler and allow for the sunlight to come through the window again. I will be able to easily pack it away for use again next summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"an ok solution","review":"The instructions on how to measure and cut were pretty helpful.

You just better measure it before you cut it and not rely on the measurement printed on the shade because mine was of by over an inch. I measured the window and came up with 31.5 inches. I then used the measurement printed on the shade and cut it only to find out that it was over an inch off.

Some people mention problems with either the measuring or the stickiness of the product, but I haven't had an issue with either and here's why:* Yes, the measuring tape on the product itself is off by an inch or more, but this is intentional to accommodate the little arch at the bottom-center of the fan as it goes over the plastic holder. Use the measurements on the fan - they're trustworthy.* Clean the surface of the area you want to apply the fan to THOROUGHLY. Adhesive that is applied to dust won't hold well and will come loose. I scrubbed the ledge where I wanted to mount my fan with warm, soapy water. The original binding is still holding, even after 7 months.Keep these two things in mind and you should be satisfied by what you get for what you spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product... great price","review":"This works great.

The leather case arrives with a couple of note pads, however, getting refills has been very difficult. I sent an email to Handspring in early November to ask how to obtain refills.

The protection my Visor receives is excellent due to the bi-fold feature and the note pads. However, the biggest challenge with this is you can't put your money in the pocket without folding it over once. Also, there are only six slots for credit cards, ID's, etc so I had to take the extra 20 or so I don't use on a regular basis and keep them in my checkbook. After some use, the tight credit card slots loosen up, with the exception of the one with the clear front (which I use for my Driver's License). I have used this case on a daily basis for about 3 months and the wear and tear is minimal.

She is an heiress and knows Lewis wants her for the money. After a blizzard, the train stops in Montana, Trey's home. While attracted to each other, Miranda does not trust men and is more concerned with finding a way to get moving on the train, to get further away from the two men she is fleeing. This is a story of a doctor who learns she is an heiress and doesn't feel she would ever consider life with a small town doctor and she is a woman who feels men would only want her for her money. I enjoyed it thoroughly and think others will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Montana Man","review":"At first, I really enjoyed the book, but it upset me when Trey took Miranda into his bed.

She describes the murky deep areas of human emotion. A place where few of us have the courage to go, even with our inner-most thoughts.

For most mainstream americans, this will be a difficult book to read because there is not much of a storyline, compared with light-weight american novels.

The problems is, after the third timetransforming it, it will now only transform into super robot mode. It will not go into the base-station mode at all.

After a few hours rassling the thing out of the package and trying to figure out the transformation instructions (think IKEA furniture, but harder), I've concluded that the thing just isn't made that well. Stuff that should snap together doesn't stay snapped, and the electronics, other than the blinking light in the arm, remain a mystery. The truck unit is supposed to fold automatically and appropriately in response to the state of the cab unit, but mostly it just lurches into half-positions at times that I still can't figure out. I can see the trigger button that must start the electronics, but pushing it doesn't do anything.It's kind of cool looking, but it doesn't even have stiff enough joints to use as a doll - you put it into a standing or fighting position and it just sighs over and collapses.

There is an off switch on the trailer if you don't care about the self transforming feature, and the trailer can be transformed by you or with batteries it can transform by itself. The only problems I found is the super robot mode isn't to sturdy and has limited articulation in the arms and legs. Also the smokestacks on his arms tend to fall off now and again.

Great, warm, comfortable boots; dry happy feet! They are not boots for the frail footed, these are serious, cool boots. Wearing 4 days a week, awaiting a thaw!! Great no slip soles! Great on packed, slippery snow and even ice. Highly recommend. I read mixed comments about sizing; I found them to be true to size. Ordered my normal size; they fit perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great boots, but not quite what I was expecting","review":"These boots are totally waterproof and can handle the snow!

Amazingly poor customer service and product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Boot","review":"The boot fits perfectly. I wear a 7 or 7 1/2 if for running. I read they ran small and almost ordered an 8. Glad I didn't. They were a little snug when I first put them on and they didn't slide off easily like I wanted but I found that the lining is tapered in the heel. I wanted to be able to step in and out of the boot easily even without untieing them if possible. I found that if I tied them loosely half way after a day or two at the most, I could do just that, yet the tapered heel keeps my foot in there perfectly. I know if I tie them up completely they will keep my feet and pants that fit right in dry and warm even in 2-3' of snow. We live in Syracuse, NY :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Returned but nice boot","review":"This is a really nice boot (felt warm and well made). It does run on the large size, so I would order one size down or it might fit okay if you wear really thick socks. I think this boot would be great for being outside in snow with the kids, etc. However, the toe section has really thick rubber and feels big and clunky (for lack of a better word at the moment), so I wasn't sure if I could drive safetly in this boot. I would give it a good rating, but personally I decided to return it and go with a more versatile boot that would be more practical for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these boots!!!!","review":"I absolutely love these sorels. I had tried on the Joan of arctic at an REI store and they were cute but definitely not as warm as these. The caribou is a classic boot and in black it looks great with leggings. I really don't care that much how they look since these boots have made walking my dog in the snow an absolute pleasure. I even bundled up and walked to the grocery store in a snowstorm the other day because the boots make me feel so confident that I will stay warm and there is no chance of slipping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pac boot","review":"[...] This is a great pac boot and is definetly water proof. I have accidentally tested it by stepping in some pretty deep water. These boots are very stiff when you first get them, but the uppers soften up quickly the first time or two that you wear them.

Perfect for me and can still wear 2 pairs of socks comfortably in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I am satisfied with the Caribou boots I purchased. They are a bit heavy if worn for a long period of time. They are warm, however, I live in Chicago and didn't have the opportunity to wear them outside, since the weather is not what we normally get. For the price I would suggest these boots to anyone who has had Chicago weather. I'm a size 7 and I ordered a size 8 which fit me perfectly.

Each child chooses one of the attached colored ribbons and pulls them at the same time. The catch is only one of the ribbons is attached to a release switch that opens a hidden compartment thus allowing the candy to fall out. If you try to use this pinata the traditional way, depending on how heavy it is, the pinata may fall to the floor after a few good whacks and the hanging loop on top will break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pinata","review":"This pinata held a lot of candy and the children enjoyed it.

It wasnt on there very long...Less that 1 min.. and when it was wiped up i noticed that it ate the finish off of the table. Now my question is this... if it can eat the finish off of a table what is it doing to your teeth and stomach?? not to mention you skin where you put it on..

I add in any leftover veggies and cut up the leftover meats along with some water and have gumbo in about thirty minutes.The next day it tastes even better!My only complaint is that the gumbo is somewhat underseasoned for my tastes.

And it you follow the directions for gray hair it turns out beautiful. What is still brown remains brown, but the gray turns into red highlights and looks so neat especially in natural lighting. And Rainbow Research Inc's web site is a great tool also- has color charts and extra instructions. If you have short hair, a 4 o.z. jar will give you 4 applications.

I love every book that I've read by Beverly Barton, but this book had to be the best. They loved each other, but her family got in their way and would not let go.

I was hoping if I paid a bit more than my Harbor Freight special I would get my money's worth. I was wrong. This tester quit after the second time I used it. As always Amazon has a great return policy so I can shop again. I will be sure not to buy anything from this mfg. again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working immediately","review":"Pricey junk. It worked once (the green light flared and dimmed), then it stopped working altogether. No lights, no matter which outlet I plug it into.

This tester is a useless paperweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight to Read!","review":"I bought this book on impulse as another addition to my ever-growing nautical library. When I began reading the book, I was delighted to see that the story takes place in the same waters I cruise. Joe Coomer's book tells of the uncertainty a new captain feels when taking command of their first boat. I laughed as he described the very same things I've felt and experienced as a new skipper. My only regret is that I didn't buy the book before getting my cabin cruiser. It showed me that I'm not the only one these things happen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sailor I am Not!","review":"Having only sailed a few times with friends, I consider myself an armchair sailor. I picked up this book at a friend's house and couldn't put it down. The story about the wooden boat is wonderful, but the stories about friends and family are so interwoven that you feel you are a part of Mr. Coomer's family. I look forward to reading more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I've read the book from my library at least four times. I think it's a wonderful look at the man behind the music. Most people complain that he didn't talk about the Beatles enough, personally, I think he talked about them as much as he needed to. I recommend it for anyone who wants to know more about George Harrison the person and not Beatle George."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite Beatle","review":"This book told a lot about George's early years, his family, his school and his love for music. I liked the song book and his telling how the songs came about. It explained some of the things that took him to his style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's like hanging out with George","review":"I love this book--to read it is like hanging out with a cordial and gregarious George, ready to tell you all about his life including how he wrote many of his amazing songs, and willing to show you the little scraps of paper on which he wrote them. Though George is not known as a writer, some of the things he says in this book have really stuck with me, i.e. somewhere in there (I can't find the reference because the index sucks) he says that the #1 problem is the ego--the way people believe they are controlling things--and don't realize that life so much bigger than that. Anyway, the book also has great photographs. Overall, I'd say it's a must for anyone who wants to get to know the man behind the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"It takes alot to keep me interested in a book, and this does that, and much more. I have always been a fan of George Harrison, and this is just one more thing to add to his list of accomplishments. A must read for any beatles fan.RIP: George Harrison"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Read","review":"With characteristic humility, George limits his own narrative to less than 75 pages, the remainder of the book being personal photos and pages of his original lyrics. The stories behind the lyrics are enlightening and definitely helped me understand his songs better.The entire book is great fun, even as George is serious in tone at times. His well known, deeply held religious beliefs are discussed, but certainly not ad nauseum. He pokes much fun at himself but in the end, says no more than he needs us to know. NOTE: The book was written before John's murder and should be read with that in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of Harrison....","review":"can be found in this book. The handwritten lyrics and crossed-out verses are pictured and each song is explained by George. For those who thought he was quiet because he had nothing to say, this book will come as a complete surprise. As a young and aspiring Beatle fan I can honestly say this book made me feel closer to what was such a huge phenomenon before I was born. George Harrison is definitely a legend, and not just because he is now dead. His gentle, colloquial speech and amazingly remarkable memory make this book a must for any music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only thing of interest in this book are the notes about how he wrote each of his songs or what they were about. Unfortunately, the song lyrics and notes account for about 80% of this book. If you're looking for an informative biography, especially regarding his Beatle years, don't look here. The autobiography section of the book has very little information of interest. a very disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story","review":"I was happy to read an autobiography not ghost written by a professional writer.

I have read other books on the Beatles and their solo careers, George's is the best so far. Although it's very light on the Beatles aspect of his career, the handwritten lyrics for the songs is the most interesting part of the book, and must know for all George Harrison and Beatle fanatics! I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A misguided, directionless effort","review":"Seldom have I been as disappointed in a book as Fields of Battle. From the book jacket material I expected a discussion of the effects of geography and economics on the various campaigns in North America. Instead the book is a mishmash of travelogue, personal reminiscences and recountings of selected battles. The connection between the last chapter of the book and what preceded it escapes me entirely.And there are enough errors in the book to make one doubt its credibility. Mr. Keegan asserts that the capital of Virginia had not yet been moved to Richmond in 1781; my source material from Williamsburg states that the removal of the capital to Richmond had been approved in 1779 and accomplished in 1780. Sloppily, too, Mr. Keegan at one point locates Cape Hatteras in South Carolina.Still, the book is written to keep the reader's attention. Unfortunately, the lack of a coherent purpose and the errors are fatal problems for this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keegan's Book is less a history than a commercial venture","review":"John Keegan has a pretty good reputation as an historian, but in this venture he has put together a hurried and clearly commercial product that does not do him justice. His understanding of the American Indian and how they made war is pitiful. He quotes Lewis & Clark as authority for the fact that the Blackfoot are part of the Sioux tribe, a mistake unlikely to be made by an American expert. He further considers the Sioux to have been the most warlike of the plains tribes, and in that he is just wrong. The Comanche hold that honor for their continued battles with the Spanish and then the Texans over a period of more than a hundred years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy over content","review":"While a very well written book full of interesting tales of the authors visits to America and insights into many of the major battles, for someone looking for details of America's battles this fell far short of the mark. I was sadly disappointed when compared to his other works. If you are looking for a historical travelogue buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly engrossing","review":"Although \\"Fields of Battle\\" is a little different from Keegan's other works, it certainly deserves a place on the bookshelf next to all of them. \\"Fields of Battle\\" reads like a travel journal as well as a history, and employs a style non-readers of history would appreciate. Keegan is not too in-depth with his discussion of the wars for North America, nor is he too vague. He provides an overview of American history that is basic, but not redundant. \\"Fields of Battle\\" should be required for every university-level freshman US History class."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't do it!","review":"I've read 3 other books written by Keegan and like them a lot. This one was, in my opinion, one of the worst represented books I've purchased. I thought this book was going to discuss the battlefields in North America....what I read was a diatribe regarding the personal travels of Keegan to Canada and the United States. It over indulges on the topography and demography of North America and spends way too much time discussing irrelevant information. I read 96 pages into the book but could go no further due to my uninterest in his personal revelations. I like his work but am getting rid of this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"America from an America-phile","review":"Few Americans could have written such a work. It is our great fortune as Americans to have Mr. Keegan to tell the story with such style and readability. It is a fascinating story of the wars that shaped the North American continent and the United States in particular. It also opens our eyes to how historical trends we might not have noticed oterhwise - such as the importance of fortifications in US expansion across the continent. Despite our belief and espousal of maneuver or mobile warfare, fortification has been a halmark of US military doctrine. Mr. Keegan brings out this paradox and helps us see our history in a different light. Mr. Keegan does not disappoint in this volume from the great expectations we might have from his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing series of personal memories","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I've enjoyed some of Keegan's other works, such as \\"A History of Warfare.\\" But this book is less history and more memoir of his love affair with the United Sates. The history that is included has many factual errors, such as thomas Jefferson living to 1833.Apparently this book was marketed appropriately in the UK, but the US publishers apparently wanted to cash in and gave it a misleading title and jacket. If you want to know about John Keegan, read this book. If you want to know about the wars of North America, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error rules here. A factual and typographical mess.","review":"This book wins in two dubious categories. It has more factual errors than any book I can recall and more typos than seem possible. This book could not possibly have ever met an editor. Did the Times reviewer actually read it? Could Keegan have really written it? No. He must have been compelled to sign the manuscript under duress. How else could the name of the world's foremost military historian become associated with this mess? The battle of Barrington? Come now"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappoint","review":"\\"Fields of Battle\\" by John Keegan is a disappointment if you expect the book to fulfill its basic thesis. The book is designed to explore and describe four major military battles that took place on the North American continent, instead what you get is a great deal of remembrance and travelogue interpersed with discussions of the battles. Additionally, the final chapter on the Wright Brothers invention of the airplane seems totally out of place.When the author stays on topic the material is quite interesting with the chapter on Custer's Last Stand the best written. Not having read any of Keegan's other works I am reluctant to read any others despite his fine reputation as a historian and military affairs journalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't forget your machete.","review":"While the book is a very informative one, Keegan is apparently talented in the art of digression. He spends the fist sixty-four pages of his literary labor extolling the virtues of America and its inhabitants, and describing (to what end, I cannot tell) his innumerable vacations, trips, and adventures in and about North America. He also (for reasons similarly ambiguous) chooses to include in this preface, a roundabout, labyrinthine discourse on his personal thoughts and experiences to do with England and France in addition to his lengthy (but vaguely on topic) treatise on America. These commentaries are, unlike the rest of the book, absolutely unreadable, forgettable, and just bad. One must plod through them, all the time conscious of mounting apathy and distaste. Their relevance is very near nihility and their pith very near brimful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Reno is the man","review":"Don Reno proves that he is the man on this CD.

From this premise I was subjected to an overwhealming ardous discription of the \\"cast of chracters\\" and there problems, interspersed with descriptions of there mission. My favorite parts of this book were the descriptions of the two ships; there loss; and the effort to find them.

His extensive annotations and commentary gave new depth to my readings of the Canon.I am glad to say that Klinger's _New Annotated Sherlock Holmes_ is a more than worthy heir to Baring-Gould's pioneering effort. As others have noted, the production values are indeed superb; the complete collection of the Paget drawings (themselves worthy of the purchase) have never looked better. The price is a bargain for 1,900 pages and two volumes of high-quality printing. If you have any interest at all in the greatest detective of all time, this is a must-buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the most important stories.","review":"I can't agree with the reviewers who praise this new set. It includes all the short stories, but leaves out ALL FOUR of the \\"novellas,\\" that is \\"A study in scarlet,\\" \\"The sign of the four,\\" \\"The hound of the Baskervilles\\" and \\"The valley of fear.\\" By virtue of their length these are the richest of the Holmes stories and would be the most interesting to have annotations of. But more important, the first two were the first published of the Holmes stories and gave Doyle the success needed to continue. Their position in the development of Holmes's and Watson's relationship is crucial; their description of the two men's histories is essential; and their role in the phenomenon that is Holmes's part in our culture is basic. To leave them out (with the promise that a third volume, in 2005, will finally complete the series) is, I think, to serve purchasers of the first two volumes very badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same pleasure than for The Novels volume","review":"Just great!The pleasure is the same than for The Annotated Sherlock Holmes Four novels.

Radia's book goes into the concepts and principles behind the technology, and in some cases, the history. This information will be very useful to students learning the technology, networking managers trying to improve their networks and product developers hoping to avoid past mistakes.

They lack all the subtle tones that are in real colognes. So they simply smell like one thing. I own Ferrari Black and Ferrari Red.

If you like smelling like you bought some little kid cologne, go ahead and use this. Otherwise you are better off with a designer brand.

Doris Day said that's when she fell in love with the Carmelarea and has lived there on a large ranch for many years. To me, this movie is what Iconsider to be a suspense/thriller. Quite different for Miss Day who usually starred inlight, fluffy comedy films (which I also adore). I was so glad to see that it was finallyremastered and released in November 2011. This movie is too much of a treasure to be putaway in a dusty vault.

This film definitelyqualifies as a movie classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voiceover Cheese","review":"This hokey vehicle features a never-ending, romance novel-type voiceover in the person of Doris Day's character, Julie. Instead of letting the images speak for themselves, we are spoon-fed explanations of every other scene as if we are kindergarten children. Julie's insane, murderous husband is played by Louis Jourdan with a blank stare that can hardly be called acting. If you pay attention closely, you will notice any number of scenes in which the boom mike or its shadow bob into the frame.

This guy can do everything on his own and he doesn't need anyone's help to do it. My issue is that following one guy who solves all the problems on his own gets old. And he isn't an especially engaging character. This book had promise, it HINTS at so much more. There ARE other characters but they never reach their potential and the interaction is bland. If he had a strong supporting cast this would be a fun romp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard space opera","review":"The book is mildly entertaining; the action moves briskly, maybe a little too briskly, and or or two of the characters are somewhat interesting. Unfortunately the main character is shallow, the entire setup is utterly unbelievable, and the complete lack of detail makes for a cartoonish environment.Compared to this novel, David Drake's RCN series with Lt. Leary, or David Weber's Honorverse are hard SF. The galaxy-spanning civilization is so poorly described that the reader needs a gargantuan amount of suspension of disbelief. There is not even a hint of the technology which is supposed to make it possible. Indeed, there is no feeling of what the technology can and cannot do; which makes it hard to understand why certain actions are supposed to be possible and others impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Flat","review":"This is an extremely weak effort at the science fiction genre known as \\"space opera\\".

The series' plot stumbles from highly unlikely to increasingly unbelievable, and ultimately to absurd. The cast of poster board characters endlessly repeat the same few thoughts. The central figure, Captain Cole, spends more time going for snacks and napping than fighting the enemy. Mr. Resnick (in his preface) and through his protagonist continually avows his preference for thinking ahead vs. blindly rushing in, then finds his captain in the midst of battle having overlooked some obvious flaw in his plan. There are long tedious stretches of dialog with the format: bla, bla, bla, he said; bla, bla, bla, she said; etc.A vastly better example of this sort of space opera is Jack Campbell's Lost Fleet Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second worst book I've ever read.","review":"This is the second-worst book I've read in my entire life.

I had it marked on my calendar and pre-ordered on Amazon.It was my own fault that I never examined the album more carefully before my immediate purchase, but I realized the whole CD was just songs from other bands that *inspired* the SFAs.While I am still interested in knowing who and what are the influences of my favorite band, I still had my heart set on hearing their *own* songs, their *own* sound. Personally, I think none of these songs or bands can even compare to the Furries, who I've loved and fan-worshipped for the past few years. I don't crave the Super Furry *style*, but the Super Furries them*selves*.Do not buy this CD if you are looking for music from the band, it is a mere soundtrack compiled of other artists! However, listen to samples of the songs and if you like them, go for it. Just don't expect to hear the wonted croonings of Gruff Rhys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is a scam","review":"What is this about? It's like qa mix tape by SFA? It's a very cheap and easy way to throw together an album, without actually doing any work. I've been a fan of SFA since the beginning but let's just hope that this is an album they had to throw together for contractual reasons or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference Book","review":"I haven't taken the PE exam yet. But it works as a good book for daily practice.Update:After I took and passed the exam.I think most problems in this book are too complicated for real PE exam preparation. I recommend use this for early practice. For the last week before exam, practice with NCEES' sample exam questions. Those questions are more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't seem like enough problems per chapter","review":"I opened up this book a few weekends ago for the upcoming test. I was really disappointed in that there were only 2 or 3 questions per chapter! It did not seem like enough for such a LARGE & expensive book (500+ pp). I was also told by my colleages that the questions do not mirror what you will encounter during the PE exam, so I really don't know how useful it will be to go through the sample problems when they won't prepare you for the exam. I suppose that is why it is titled, \\"Sample Problems\\" and NOT \\"Sample Exam Problems.\\" Skip this book and just get the ones geared towards giving you sample examination problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book is full of multi-part problems that take a lot of time. Many state in the problem one hour limit. While it's good to do review of the topics, nothing like this is on the test and it takes WAY too long to do these problems. I used it for a week and tossed it on the shelf. Six minute solutions are MUCH better- more realistic problems, more realistic time frames for problems. Definitely would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Manual","review":"This practice problem is great subsititute to practice more problem sfor your prfessional exam preparation.

This book contains the same problems as those shown in the 9th Ed. CERM, and also contains the solutions. However, the solutions do not always give a clear indication as to why the method was chosen to solve the problem. Sometimes an equation is manipultated to solve the problem but the explanation is left out as to why that equation works, which leaves you to look through another reference book to confirm that it does or else believe the author but remain uncertain how he arrived at the new manipulated equation. There are definitely other reference materials out there that are better study guides and make better use of one's study time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost color","review":"The red sheet bled very bad in the wash and came out a thin light red color. The original sheet before washing was a dark red thick sheet set. Would not get again and not using on bed since sheet is so thin now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I almost did not read this book because one of the reviews mentioned the heroine getting an abortion. Boy, am I glad I read it anyway! It was well written and kept my interest. Connor and Maggie were perfect for each other. Oh, and she did not have an abortion...she was given what she needed for one, but she wanted her baby more. I loved the way Connor's stepmother was redeemed as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have been good, but for one thing...","review":"I was thoroughly enjoying this book....until the abortion. I don't know why the author threw something so terribly taboo into a historical romance novel, especially when this is supposed to be romantic and happy. I was disgusted that the heroine injested the pills that would abort her baby when she could have kept it and faced the consequences of her actions. Other than that moment, I have already forgotten what I did read of it. It just totally turned me off. If you want great funny, tender, romanctic stories then read some of Gaelen Foley, Johanna Lindsey, Sabrina Jeffries, and Lisa Kleypas. Keep this one on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It","review":"I got one of these because I'm a bit on the overly organized side, but didn't want to shell out the necessary cash for an electronic labeler. That was a mistake. While this item does work and produce labels, you have to crush your fingers squeezing the handle to get the letters to imprint clearly, and getting the label to actually cut itself from the tape is nearly impossible without just using a pair of scissors. On top of that, the label itself isn't very sticky, and falls off shortly after you attach it. I still own this, just in case I need to label something insubstantial, but for the most part, it's sitting in my toolbox, gathering dust.If you're considering this, get into your word processing program, type up some nice text labels, and affix them with tape. That will produce better results than this does."},{"rating":"2","title":"very resourceful...","review":"a fun guide to Egyptian magic and mysteries. not the best and definitely not the worst... i have seen much worse. give this book a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother...","review":"this book promised much, but it gave a little. texts were horrible, and the sample rites in the book were too \\"new-age\\" for my taste. this is ideal book for the kid or to be given as a present, and that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Choice for Cable Viewers","review":"If you are mainly watching standard cable TV than the Sony KP-53HS10 is an excellent choice. Why? The scan doubler makes analog broadcasts look super. It upscales 480i to 960i. Same is true for VCR movies. Watch some DVD's? They'll look great w/ component input. You'll never wish you got a $1200 to $1800 conventional set . . . and HDTV is a long way away so why spend $4000 and up? This set is digital capable, too. How about PIP where you can use the joy stick on the remote to move/size the two displays? Or how about twelve channels displayed around the perimeter, with one in the middle? By the way, the sound is excellent also. Worth considering, especially if you lack a digital source such as satellite dish. Friends and neighbors have been very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great TV","review":"I've had this TV for almost 10 years now, am being tempted by the new technology out today, but unsure if it would be much better than this set.When properly setup and maintained, this set produces jaw-dropping images, smooth motion, and unusually full-range sound (which you absolutely cannot find in today's TVs). An early-adopter's HDTV, it is a 4:3 rear projection set with 3 CRT guns: red, green, blue. Therefore, images from HD sources will be letterboxed, and equivalent to about a 49 inch widescreen set.It is important to set this TV up properly, and on of the DVDs designed for this purpose can help (for example, Video Essentials). For maintenance, a periodic service-menu gun-convergence is necessary, as well as taking the back botton of the set of to clean the dust off the 3 guns once or twice a year, and also take the back top of every few years to clean the big mirror.At some point, I will move on (mostly for size), but until then, I am still enjoying this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifyingly, howlingly funny","review":"I first bought this book as a gag for some of the guys I work with as a river guide. I made the mistake of reading it first, and laughed so hard I cried on several of the stories. My daughters were awakened by my laughter and came to see what mom thought was so funny. We (myself and 2 daughters) shared the laughter for a little over an hour, and many times since. It is the most often asked for book at my house, and, it has gone, and will continue to go on river trips and camping trips with me. Some people gross out when the stories are read aloud, but nearly all will pick it up, read it, and laugh about it in private."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I have what has been described (by my mother) as a bathroom sense of humor, so I thought I would enjoy this book. Instead, in the approximately 30 minutes it takes to read, I was rewarded with only one small chuckle. Around the campfire, well lubricated by consciousness changing substances, some of these stories could probably be a hit. On paper they are, well, boring and sophmoric. And don't think you'll be able to read them, then tell them to your friends around the campfire -- they won't translate in that sense. You're better off just making up your own stories. If you can imagine just one instance when a relatively small amount of feces ended up on your own or someone else's flesh, you already know everything this book has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Loves Talking about Poo","review":"This is a very funny book. If you are involved with river rafting or if you are taking a river trip soon, this is the book for you. The stories, although a bit gross from time to time, are all true and would be wonderful when read aloud around the campfire. I feel certain that this will be a real buy for those who have a sense of humor and adventure.WithWhat's Your Poo Telling You?andHow to Poo at Work, this book is in my Top 3 Bathroom Reading Material"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good laughs","review":"I picked up this book as I was leaving the hiking section at the bookstore, I flipped a few pages and was laughing in the isle, its brief at 81 pages with glossary, cost more then I would normaly spend for such a book $7.95 when there is other books I would rather get but a laugh is always a good thing and you can pass it on. Learned a thing or two I guess about rafting as a bonus, worth a read if you can take a joke and don't mind being grossed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy","review":"I bought this book as bathroom reading humor and was very excited to have it for guests' amusement. However, I was terribly disappointed with the writer's style. It's simply too much detail and information.Every story is told in the same style - as if the author felt a need to drag out every page to the fullest; and sometimes that's just not necessary. A good story benefits from descriptive narrative, but it also suffers from being diluted with too many words.I will most likely sell my copy of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"This had to be one of the worst romance novels I've ever read.

It's an even bigger waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it Loud!","review":"This extremely cohesive album is something that should be cranked up in the car on a hot summer day.

I appreciate their music and consider myself a fan but I can't find one morsel of goodness on this cd. It is torture to sit through any full track. Flansburgh's voice is irritating as hell and makes me want to put a bullet in my brain. It upsets me that this cd is even related to TMBG, quite embarrassing actually. DO NOT (I repeat) DO NOT waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"It becomes quite obvious from this recording who is the creative genius of TMBG. It's John Linnell, full stop. This, on the other hand, is an awful-sounding bunch of demos, badly produced, with horridly superficial lyrics and featuring lots of disheartening funk bass onanism. I find it hard to believe a member of TMBG actually did this. Go get Linnell's wonderful (and intelligent!) State Songs instead of this uncommitted rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 but 1 is the lowest rating.","review":"Pros: Great resolution. Nice packaging.

The manual was inadequate, especially for the wireless stuff. I also had problems with Windows (Network Bridging, I think) that further complicated things.For the brief time the two units worked, I was pleased. The picture quality was good, and once running, I had no problems with the software.I take a lot of digital photos. This would have been the perfect compliment.I gave the Memory Frame two stars (instead of one) because, in between failures and configuration problems, I was pleased with the quality of the display.Too bad I couldn't say the same about the quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good specs, lousy performance, reliability","review":"I bought this because it was a terrific buy for the specs. The first unit failed quickly and was replaced though I was out some shipping costs. Both unit used embedded Windows CE which was unreliable and tended to freeze when the menus were accessed.The WiFi link was also not reliable. It worked with some routers and not others. Entering WEP or WPA keys is a real chore with the on screen, non-touch keypad.The screen is bright, but suffers from some artifacts and flickers during redraws. It also repeats the same shots too often. That is, the random photo subroutine is poorly coded."},{"rating":"1","title":"wifi reception horrible","review":"I could get the wifi working as advertised only after about three days of troubleshooting. I emailed customer support (ha!) and NEVER even received a reply.But the worst is that if you take the frame more than about 10 feet from your wireless router, there will be no signal and it won't work.I even have a signal booster on my router - enough so that my neighbors can see my network- but when I took this frame downstairs, no signal - no pictures wirelessly. It doesn't look like you can add an antenna which would look stupid anyway, but my advice is DON'T buy this thing if you want it to work wirelessly in another room in your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one bad thing...","review":"The one truly bad thing about the Prism is its cradle. The PDA doesn't snap into the cradle securely like the Palm V snaps into its cradle.

If you're not paying attention, you'll leave it there overnight and it won't get charged at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we rate this no stars?","review":"Yet another cheap attempt to make money off the Geisha name! Why is it that because geisha are Asian females and happen to be entertainers must they always end up associated with sex? If the authors of this blatant attempt to increase the audience for their shunga-philia really paid attention to Liza Dalby's book, Geisha (which they mined extensively for their Public Face section), they would have noted that training in the sexual arts has no place in world of real geisha! If they want to write about Japanese erotica, fine, but they shouldn't use it in a way to pander to Western fantasies that are patently false. It is a slap in the face to all true geisha who follow the road of artistic discipline and to the Japanese people whom they often represent. I'm sick of books like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of embarrassing inaccuracies...","review":"It should be noted 'pillow book' refers most specifically to a work by Sei Shonagon, a court lady of the Heian Era.The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon(Makura no soshi) was written sometime in the late 900s-early 1000s and is a collection of notes and personal thoughts about Heian court life, a diary. To my knowledge 'pillow book' is not commonly used as a general term and does not typically describe an erotic work.This glaring error as well as the others previous reviewers have mentioned should call into question the veracity of this book. If one simply wants to look at Japanese erotic (of questionable authenticity) then this book will suffice. If one is looking for accurate depictions of geisha or true antique Japanese erotica one would be advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masscre review","review":"awesome product. i've been looking everywhere. super fast shipping. great price for a rare item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"Speechless you will be after watching this.

There is an almost infectious joy written into the music, which is completely missing from the symphonic version. Listen to this disc and rediscover an old favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Beautiful, Energetic","review":"This album is a masterpiece of performance. Michael Tilson Thomas worked with Ira Gershwin to get at the core of George's ideas.

Set in a small Pennsylvania coal town, sixteen-year-old Rose is seduced by a coal miner. What follows is a shocking tale of a young girl who must endure great physical pain and face emotional neglect by those she counts on most. Booklovers are taken through a twisting chain of events that demonstrate just how life-defining the decisions they make are.While Rose grows from a nave young girl to a mature woman, readers also learn about the very real, yet little-known disease called Hyperemesis Gravidarum.

I called Fuji, and they shipped the part that day overnight mail. I received it the next day. I am a satisfied customer"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a pleasure.","review":"This is truly a great gun. Build quality is excellent, adjustment is smooth, plenty of power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality finish","review":"I bought this item about two years ago hoping it would spray lacquers. The finish quality was poor with the standard tip that came with the gun. I called the company and they called me back telling me I should thin the lacquer by 25%. I have used other spray guns (all with a compressor)and never had to thin the product I am using (at least not by as much as 25%). I have played with the controls and various amounts of thinner and have finally given up. It now sits in the corner of my shop as an expensive lesson - don't buy a tool unless you know someone who personally recommends it. I gave it two stars because the company called me back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lost Story from Doctor Who's Early Years","review":"For those uninitiated, these Doctor Who tv soundtracks are audio recordings from episodes of Doctor Who now lost (possibly) forever. These recording are used with new narration, usually by one of the actors who were in the original story, to help the listener visualize what is going on, since the story was initially on television. So, these are half-audio book and half-radio/audio adventure.The Faceless Ones is great story, in the vein of bodysnatchers. I was worried about the story would be too crowded, what with three companions, but Ben and Polly are only really in the first half of the story. Patrick Troughton is excellent as always.Six episodes spread out on two CDs. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-mobile MDA Vario","review":"Interesting keyboard extremely useful for quick sms texts. Good connection manager.

I'm a Cleo Laine fan, and her incredible artistry and sultry voice are showcased in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deluxe is NOT deluxe","review":"When I ordered this It is very misleading on the size and the accessories. When I ordered deluxe verses the regular one I was expecting the light sabor and the gloves..they did not come with it. Also my son is a size 6 slim and it said to order the medium..it is very very large. I doubt he will be unable to wear the mask because it falls off with the small velcro extra long strip that keeps coming off..perhaps if I tie it in a knot. Anyway..save your money and just go to the halloween store. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small, cheaply made and incomplete","review":"We bought a medium for 9 year old. It is tiny!Made with a very cheap material, with weak stitches.Back is wide open (from waist up - only Velcro on top(and on the wrong side too)) so plan to buy larger so child can wear shirts underneath.Cape is not usable - one velcro and slides offDoesn't include breather box or booties or gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't see out of the mask: horrible for children","review":"I received this today. The mask was out of the packaging and you can not see out of it. My child's eyes hurt after wearing it for one minute. Something was amiss with this.

The gloves are sold separately and I didn't think he would notice, but he did. He kept looking in the costume bag for the \\"missing\\" gloves. We had to decorate him with light sticks so we could see him since he blended in with the darkness.He still wears it around the house and will probably continue to do so until it breaks or he outgrows it.The price couldn't be beat. . .Costume Express had it for $49.99. . .Amazon sold it for about half that price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOOO BIG!","review":"We are so disappointed! This was a birthday gift. When we opened it, it looked like we had received an adult size costume. No lie-- I am 5'8\\" and it is a little long on me. But at least it fits me. My 5 year-old is irate and I'm a little perturbed myself. The sizing issue on this costume ruined the whole day and now I'm wondering if it's worth the hassle to exchange for a smaller size or if that size will be weird, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair quality for price","review":"This costume worked its purpose for us. I just wish the face mask was better quality. It only covers the front of the face with an elastic strap that is supposed to secure it to the head - except that the mask is front heavy and slips off easily. My son was very happy and excited to get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"less than hoped","review":"This costume is a lot cheaper looking than i thought. Almost looks like it was returned and resold.

But when I got the product, the package says \\"small (3-4 year old)\\".It turns out the thing is too small for my son. The information provided by seller is very confusing.Also, the product does not look even close to what the picture shows. For the money (I paid like $33 plus shiping $9 total about $42 something), it is NOT worth it at all. Go to a Holloween costume place like Partytown something, you can get a much nicer one with this much money. And you can see the product as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great costume, heavy mask. Light saber NOT included.","review":"My son loves this costume, but the mask has been a bit too heavy for him to wear in front of his face all Halloween night. The upside: the plastic is thick and sturdy, so this mask will hold up for a long time. NOT: they eyes are covered with clear plastic domes, which are warping the view. I found this annoying but my son had no problem with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size did not match description","review":"Small was way bigger than for 4-6 years. Cheap fabric. It arrived on the day beyond which you were not able to return it. Returned it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice costume","review":"i bought it for my thirteen year old, and he loved it. the material is of reasonable quality, and the size is accurate if you usually buy 12-14 size cloths for them. (for my son i usually have to buy 14-16 size cloths and this one was a \\"tiny\\" bit small, but still he could manage it)the only negative thing was the cap do not have anything behind it so it will look odd. you could manage it by wearing a black hoody under or a black cap though.overall, worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am disappointed with this costume. It is described as being deluxe with the 3-D molded belt. The costume I received looks nothing like the picture advertised. The version I received looks a lot cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Better","review":"Mr Joseph Antonelli was a brilliant defense attorney who had never lost a case. He was persuaded to come out of his retirement to prosecute a deputy district attorney for hiring a someone to murder his wife. Joseph Antonelli had never once doubted his own ability to win once he took up a case, but that did not mean that truth and justice would always prevail.The book had proven to be disappointing. I struggled through the first half of the book. While there were brilliant sparks during the courtroom argument, those failed to lift the story which was otherwise shallow and unexciting. I also remained neutral towards the central character, Joseph Antonelli. The book was more a narration of the trial and failed to provide insight into his personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I love mystery and court room drama. I did not like this book. I struggled through the first half, and I did not finish as I felt as if I were forcing myself to read. The story line seemed good and the characters often seemed promising, but the result was never delivered. The book seemed too slow paced due to the \\"sage\\" advice of another character to the main character, Antonelli. Why this was meandering from a side character was needed when Antonelli had been a lawyer for years, is beyond me. I would not pick up another book by this author again. My title says it all - very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glib practitioner","review":"I would guess that Mr Buffa had his plot flowchart well defined before he wrote that first word. Like Harlan Coban, his twists and surprises are ' clever ' and rarely disturbing. His attempts at giving the characters some depth is usually confined to describing how they sit, stand and stretch. Like Jefferson Parker, he has had to write two stories to fill the required number of pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pumpkin Giant is delightful!","review":"This is a wonderful book from my childhood- preserved with my Halloween decorations and brought out to share with my own children once a year. The story is charming- a kingdom, a castle, poor farmers, and a truly revolting Giant make this a delightful Halloween story to read aloud. Reminiscent of some of the milder Roald Dahl stories, it has elements of quasi-historical facts ( well, it COULD'VE happened like that) and just a touch of chilling evil. For ages 4 and up, the only possible objection being that the Giant likes to eat \\"fat little boys\\", certainly not any worse than anything Disney puts out year after year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It will rev you up!","review":"Maximum dance on this CD from beginning to end.The tracks are fresh and the rhythms set your hips to swaying non stop.

After going through many of the problems in the book I've learned not to trust this solutions manual. There are far too many errors in it. Therefor, it doesn't work very well because I feel like all it can do for me is confirm correct answers. If my answer doesn't agree with the book that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong.

It has become more a synopsis of the full story. So many wonderful scenes have been deleted which would not aid anyone in putting the story together if they did not watch it before.

I'm convinced this was NOT the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"they changed the formula :(","review":"This was my favorite conditioner by Kerastase for years!!!

I have been an avid user of this conditioner. The old formula was MILES better. It is now MUCH more watered down, has a completely different consistency, color, and odor, and the way my hair reacts to this new formula is not they way it did before. Now, it really over coats my hair making it limp and greasy looking. YUCK. (Only use a dime sized amount too!)I have read other reviews about loyal, disappointed customers of KERASTASE speaking of this new formula and how bad it is now. It is too bad. I now think this is an over priced, drug store type of product.In closing, this is NOT the sellers fault.

It has 2 levels of bass which are quite honestly moderate nothing special the hold button is quite useful when the discman is in your pocket so that it does not push the volume or skip buttons on the machine.

Who would care about an extra one millimeter in thread length ?Shipping cost is two high for such a small package. In addition, this item (pair) is too expensive (from the manufacturer) for its apparent c0st of materials and labor. After all, there are only 4 small components in these things !

However, they and their insect buddies don't love tea tree oil. Since I don't like using oily products such as insect repellent, this product seems heaven sent. I also use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner and combined with the soap it is a triple threat against unwanted bites and irritations.Tea tree oil has a somewhat astringent quality and scent which isn't unpleasant and is actually sort of fresh without having a flowery property. It is also good for facial outbreaks as it affectively fights oily residue on skin.My only gripe with this soap is its price. This soap dissolves quickly and at its price point it isn't really much of a deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"EVERYONE RATES AT HOW GREAT THIS SOAP IS... WELL ITS NOT!!!

As a monopod it is fine, and my camera (a Canon SLR) snaps onto the magnetic mount very securely and instantly so that is good. The height is also quick to adjust, also good. One problem for those people wishing to travel is the size- this just doesnt collapse like most monopods, the shortest size reaches to my chest and I am 5'11''. This makes it impossible to do anything with but carry in your hand, and even then it is larger and more conspicuous than you would like something like a walking stick to be. You can unscrew the legs and completely disassemble it, and then it just about fits in a suitcase for travel. Finally, it is not good as a tripod, it flexes and when the camera is positioned to portrait my camera rotates in the magnetic mount under the off-centre weight of the lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Scandalous","review":"I Enjoy reading Carly Phillips romance books.

I'm sorry, but I wish that I had read at least one before I bought all of them. I could hardly read through parts of these books because they were so trite.There were passages where Carly Phillips really grabbed my attention with her style. But the plots were just so boring. Also there were more sexual passages than I felt it needed. I felt it almost concentrated more on the sexual passages(for frustrated housewives?) rather than using the sex scenes to enhance the romance.I don't know. Maybe it is just me. This was the kind of book I probably could have enjoyed in maybe my very early 20's.If you are a mature woman (over 35) who has any semblance of depth - pass on this trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable","review":"Having met Catherine Luck in her sister Kayla's story, it's really nice to see that Cat ends up with her own hero in Assistant D.A.

But this book is a fatter target than most.Any children's librarian at any public library, and any bookseller at an independent bookstore, will give a parent far more help than this, and for free. Some of the choices are so obvious that it's sad to waste space on them -- what parent really needs to be told about Pat the Bunny?As to the overall selection of books, let's just say it's banal and uninteresting and leave it at that. Some of the choices are obvious sops to political correctness -- viz. Johnny Tremain. And any book claiming to list the 100 best children's books that doesn't include a single title by Arthur Ransome does a major disservice to parents trying to buy good books for their children.Save the price of the book and just spend a few minutes with a preschool or elementary school teacher, a librarian, or a good bookseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not very creative or interesting choices","review":"This list is pretty standard, I think a trip to the chinaberry catalog or website would provide much better suggestions. Many of the stories included are classic. The author included a good amount of text describing each of the stories suggested. But in the last few years some amazing children's stories have been written that I think are much better, especially for the younger crowd in the board book and picture book category. We have an amazing collection of children's literature, but as I am always looking for more, I took this book out of the library and I was very disappointed. In our collection of thousands of books for my children, we have 15 of the suggested titles. My suggestion, go to chinaberry on the web and go from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Bad Resource If You Know About Children's Books","review":"Silvey's book gives lots of wonderful books, lots and lots of books, but little concept of why (on an objective standard) she chose these books. For example why choose Roald Dahl's BFG rather than his more renowned CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY? Why did she exclude WHOSE MOUSE AM I, the MISS PICKERELL books, ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN? Where are the Scott Corbett, Bruce Coville, and Jay Williams classics? How can one compile a \\"Best\\" list of children's books without HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS or any Judy Blume book? Very few books on her list come from African-American (bell hooks, Irene Smalls), Asian American (Taro Yashima), or Latino American (Harriet Rohmer) authors.Hopefully when she updates this book she will make it more multi-cultural, historically respectful, and more objectively evaluated.

Jud does a great job of bridge-building between that world and this one.

But then I actually *read* it. I was horrified at the inaccuracies, especially the information about slavery, \\"mammies,\\" slave childhood, and education. In the \\"Children of Slavery\\" section, there was only one footnote, which led to a statement about Islamic law--entirely without context or source. There were no other sources identified for the blatantly inaccurate information.The book should be pulled from publication so the authors can do some research. In the meantime, the beauty of the cover shouldn't fool history-seekers: There are real works of scholarship out there. This book isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a copyeditor","review":"This is an ambitious book, as well as an expensive one. However, the text is appallingly full of editorial errors: There's a misspelling, dropped word, or sentence garbled to the point of incomprehensibility on nearly every page. For example, the name of the great Civil War photographer Mathew Brady is misspelled Matthew in both the text and the index.

Wish I found a pair exactly like them that were more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Exactly What I Expected","review":"I read this book because I really enjoyed Southgate's The Fall of Rome. Third Girl from the Left; however, is no Fall of Rome. Southgate attempts to create a link between three generations of women from the same family by imbuing each of them with a love film. Despite her valiant attempt, the stories just don't come together well. Yes, each of the characters finds escape/ solace at the movies, but in spite of this common link, as well as the link of emotional distance between mothers/daughters, and artistic aspirations, there are too many distractions in the book to make it work well. Southgate tries to cram too much into one book- a cursory look at the infamous Tulsa race riots; an exploration of Black women and lesbianism/sexuality; familial estrangement; and the history of the Blaxploitation movement in film. An entire novel could be written about any one of these topics, but to shove them altogether in one novel, gives short shrift to them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"how disappointing!","review":"I could not believe that this is the same Martha Southgate who wrote the superb Fall of Rome, a book that I've recommended to everyone I know for its remarkable characters and touching insights. Third Girl, by comparison, is a potboiler, with a cheesy plot, clichéed dialogue, and boring passages. The racial element is one-dimensional, completely lacking the power of the previous book. Let's hope Southgate regains her form with her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"digging the versatility of this Book","review":"Right on to Martha Southgate for bridging generations&Eras in this Book.I like How she goes from 1921 to the 70's era of Black Hollywood.I Love 70's Black films more than any other time period at all.ain't nothing on film still touching Pam Grier for my money&Eyeballs.

This is elecronica taken to a hyperkinetic extreme. Bizarre, complicated time signatures are thrown at the listener in the form of wiggy electronic noises. Most of the musicality of this album is fascinatingly derived from dense, spliced together rythms and sounds. Many will find this music too jarring or disconcerting while others will be totally tripped-out and captivated. This stuff will churn your head!IF this kind of music turns you on, I'd also recommend The Boredoms' SUPER AE which is also really wigged out but even more unique sounding than GO PLASTIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rhythm?","review":"Of all the praise I've heard of Squarepusher, when I first put the cd in the player, I expected to hear a remarkable cd.

This harness appears to be well constructed and has the correct mating connectors, but all four speaker connectors are on RCA male plugs. They should be straight wires. The leads on the plugs are spliced onto short color coded wires coming from the harness and the spliced wires are all the same color, so if you cut the connectors off, there is no way to determine which wire is positive and which is negative. Most radio wiring harnesses require bare wire for the speaker connections, not RCA plugs. I would have given this one star if not for the good construction. Since this harness is used for a number of Nissan cars, check on your model before you buy. Buy the Scosche wiring harness instead if you need bare wires instead of RCA plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support for XP makes this card worthless now","review":"I bought this card by mail order and was told by the salesperson (not from this store!) that I could download drivers for 2000 and XP.

The pill is slightly large, but nothing that a big gulp of water can't handle. There is a slightly \\"earthy\\" flavor to them, but it doesn't really bother me. The only reason I did not give this product five stars is because of the Dong Quai ingredient. There isn't a lot of research out about this product, but what what I've read about it so far is that it can effect estrogen products, like birth control. There is also some information out there stating that Dong Quai also can negatively effect anti-coagulant therapies, like warfarin.

With this multivitamin, I definitely notice a difference in my overall energy level and attitude. Oh, and my pee stays brighter, longer meaning it doesn't metabolize and disappear after an hour or two. I wasn't expecting anything but was definitely not disappointed.

But this one is not only huge, but not well coated, so it got caught in my throat probably 1 out of three times. The aftertaste is just way too herbal, grassy tasting for me. I suspect it is the spuralina. I mostly noticed the taste after the times I had to wrestle up and down my throat a few times to get it to cooperate. I did finish my order and will not reorder.

The kicker was the nausea I got from them. Not sure if I am just super sensitive but I tried with food, in the evening before bed, before I ate, right after I ate, with hot tea, with cold milk. Didn't matter, made me sick. However the ingredients are just what I want in a vitamin and I really tried to take them because I know they are good for you. I was able to choke down a half bottle but I can't do it anymore. Unfortunately I bought 2 bottles and now I have an unopened bottle and a half left.

The design is flawed -- one must hold down the on-off switch for a few seconds to turn off the unit, but it takes no effort at all to turn on the switch - it definately needs a better on-off switch.Also, after just one use, the small rubber pads on the bottom of the battery came off.Also, the unit I received has a label that indicates that it was made in CHENA --- I am not sure where CHENA is located, but the label may be indicative of the quality of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"M Fuel Defect","review":"it appears to be a great product however the universal adapter is incomplete and the product leaks energy badly.

The book compiles carefully selected words (some of which are almost like quotes) and prayers of His Holiness Pope John Paul II from different sources, and they are categorized into different sections like Prayer, Salvation, The Sacraments, and so forth, for easy reference. His talks about love, family, truth & freedom, God & the Holy Spirits & Mother Mary, hope and prayer are very inspirational and encouraging, and there’s also a short introduction about the background of the Pope.In all, this is a really nice book to add to your Christian collection, especially if you’re one of the many who have been touched, in one way or another, by the Pope."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful words that inform, enlighten and inspire","review":"Anthony Chiffolo has compiled the words of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II from many of the Pope's letters, speeches, presentations and encyclicals.

It has pretty low suction, but it would be adequate if I didn't have two dogs who shed so much. The filter gets very dirty even though it's in a separate compartment and it takes forever to clean decently. The power attachment is useless, even though I haven't had any problems with it not spinning. What works better is just to forgo using the power brush attachment and not use anything at all. I would not buy this vacuum again, and only give it two stars because of it's cheap price and that it picks up decently, even though it takes two or three passes to get really clean. Just FYI: Do Not use a powdered carpet freshener with this model. If you need to freshen after vacuuming, use some febreze.Edit: I wanted to add that I am writing this review 6 months after purchasing the vacuum and so have used it much longer than people who have reviewed this product after one use."},{"rating":"2","title":"vacumn sucks in a good way","review":"We are pleased with the hoover vacumn which we received from Amazon.

I don't beleive it's a feature, but it actually propels itself forward so it doesn't take much effort to push it around. The pet tool is perfect for the staircase and upholstery.

It is now early October 2007 and it's already on the curb. Why? Because it just gradually stopped working.We don't have many rugs (hardwood throughout), so the machine was used weekly on 5 throw rugs (you can't turn the beater off, so it was useless for hardwood). It started off strong, but within two months we found that we had to go over a spot several times to pick up the pet hair etc. Over the course of the following months, it got harder and harder to really clean a carpet. By the end of September, the hose/accessory function had completely ceased working as well.We replaced this vac on Oct 3rd with a Bissell Healthy Home vac. In cleaning the 5 throw rugs in the house for the first time, we produced 1.5 grocery bags of dust and pet hair that was left in the rug by the Hoover.

After a few weeks the belt snapped again. Ever since, there is practically no suction. All my floors are hardwood with a few low cut area rugs, so there is nothing that my flooring would have done to inhibit this vacuum. I was originally planning to buy the Dyson. My friend has one and let me borrow it. Wow...what a difference. There is no comparison. I plan on writing a letter to Hoover.

It has terrific suction especially in a home with mulitple pets. It is lightweight and dependable. The only improvements that I would make relate to the attachment. The hose pops off the main part of the vacuum to attach a couple of different heads onto it. The negative is the hose doesn't attach securely to the vacuum itself, so it will pop off when I am vacuuming regularly. The attachement holders are on the side and if you get too close to a wall they will break right off. That's an operator error...but speaks to the flimsy nature of the holder. Now all this said it is a great vacuum cleaner for the money...they do a better job at regular vacuuming than the more expensive Hoover models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four out of Five Stars","review":"Overall this vaccuum is a good buy.

No solos, no variation. i dont really think black metal is supposed to have solos but it would really have changed up a very boring disk. the songs are short too. way to short for a black metal cd. the best one is 2 minutes, 37 secs long. thats just a shame. their evil factor is up there, but it isnt worth payin the money. go buy a morbid angel cd or a bathory cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZON -WAY TOO EXPENSIVE ON THIS ONE!","review":"I just bought this set for 9.98 at KB Toys, This price is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!

I just heard one of the characters call someone a \\"Hateful hater\\" definitely not something I want to hear my daughter repeat.I wish movies for children would go back to what they used to be- I will have to \\"accidentally\\" lose this DVD tonight when she goes to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"i love barbie movies and i think it is inappropriate i like the story butken is gross some kids watch them kiss and want to have boyfriends ata young age its not healthy i don't like how much boyfriend stuff i can't watch itin front of my mom bad job mattel"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it away","review":"My 3yo received this from someone a gift and I just threw it away because there was nothing redeeming enough about the movie to pass it on to any older child! Even though it's not rated, there should've been an age suggestion on the box because, as other reviewers have stated, it was all about teen drama, break-ups, and fashion flair. Not appropriate for a young child. I've avoided Barbie products for my daughter until now, and this movie just confirmed why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the others","review":"We miss the other actress who voiced Barbie- and they change her looks. My 3 year old even noticed. This is also too modern for girls under 6 years old. Stick with the older Barbie movies- much better.

The contents of this movie is for teenagers dealing with breakups, losing jobs; etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected.","review":"I'm a huge Barbie fan and have all her movies! I really enjoyed \\"The Barbie Diaries\\" when it came out and hoped they would create another movie like it. Well \\"Barbie in a Fashion Fairytale\\" gave me that more teenage, coming of life feel with the fairytale aspect all in one. I throughly enjoyed and would recommend it, not necessarily for children. I mean a lot of people gave this movie a really bad review because they feel it's not geared towards children, but honestly what good cartoons are? Disney movies are not really for children and neither are the Shrek movies, yet kids love them! So don't put down Barbie just because they're trying to get with the times. At least no one is murdered and the bad people turn out good in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad and Disappointed","review":"My daughters and I have watched and purchased every Barbie movie they have made, and vowed that we would always watch them together even as they get older. Not sure we'll be doing that now after watching this movie. Why did they change the Barbie movies, when they were so good before? In this one, Barbie looks really weird, her voice is different (no more Kelly Sheridan), and the magic is gone. The previews for the next Barbie movie do not look good either (for Spring 2011). My girls and I are so sad at the end of the special Barbie movies that we have enjoyed all of these years. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor taste","review":"This movie is not for young girls. It is too realistic and the words used are poorly chosen. The characters get angry and yell at eachother and the content is more for adults. Not wholesome or fun at all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loved it","review":"This is not my favorite Barbie movie, but I am guessing that I am not the target audiance for Barbie movies. My daughter, who is not yet five LOVED the movie. We watched it together and at the end she was singing with the credits. The theme of the movie is very appropriate - to believe in yourself. The movie was slightly more complicated than most Barbie plots, there were three stories running simultaneously. The graphics were excellent, as usual and the music was catchy. Although I think Barbie and a mermaid tale and the barbie christmas carol movies are better, my daughter enjoyed this one much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I just turned this movie off and replaced it with Tangled. This movie is not for little girls. Kids don't stay kids long enough as it is; I'm not going to subject my daughters to teen/adult situations. Calling people haters, wearing skimpy clothing, talking about break ups?? No thank you. I glad I rented it instead of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the fairytales!! :(","review":"This one was horrible, I mean do we really want our little girls watching movies with \\"Twitter\\" mentioned? I mean come on they are still little kids, let's give them the old fashioned classics like Barbie as Rapunzel, Nutcracker, Swan Lake, Princess and the Pauper, Island Princess. I don't want my 4 year old wondering about cell phones & Twitter- what's next, let me guess, Barbie will be checking her Facebook in the next movie? And Barbie looks very old now, I do not understand why you guys changed her look so drastically from the old movies. She doesn't even look like Barbie anymore!! More like an ugly Bratz doll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrown in the trash.","review":"We love the Barbie movies. Normally we just rent them from the library. For Christmas, my daughter asked for this one. When we sat and watched it for the first time, we were sadly horrified. The movie is filled with just plain teenage drama garbage. Not what we were looking for. This movie just ended up in the garbage, not even worth donating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbue A Fashion Fairytale","review":"I ordered this movie on Sept 15th and still have not received it and it is 10-4-10. I am disappointed about it. I paid for it and now I have no movie, someone else might be watching our movie possibly delivered to wrong house. so I can not rate movie plus my granddaughter wanted the movie so bad I had to go to Target and buy it yesterday. so now I am scared to order movies again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, I agree!","review":"I have only seen a few Barbie movies. I was really surpised at how good Princess and the Pauper was as well as Mermaid Tale. I liked them because they weren't really dark or scary in any parts and they have great songs. Anyway, glad I rented this one rather than buying it. My 5 year old liked it but I don't want her to watch it again. The scary zombie peas in the beginning were rediculous and too much for my 3 year old. The story went on to be superficial, un-fun, lame attempt at humor with young adult/teenage issues that Barbie was dealing with. The dresses are very pretty and sparkly which I think is the real attraction to the movie. Get the paraphenalia for your kids if you want but skip the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Barbie, shame on Mattel","review":"Sadly, I did not screen this movie when I rented it for my daughter. The first scene I overheard was Barbie being broken up by Ken via text message. Sadly, this movie made it to my daughter's wish list to Santa. Thank you other Amazon reviews for reminding me what trash it was. Sad sad excuse for a Barbie movie, lowers the bar entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one may need to get \\"accidentally\\" scratched","review":"Two stars only because my daughter likes it and everything is right in the end. But I truly dislike the way Barbie is turning into Bratz. :( I'm embarrassed because I've stood up for the Barbie movies to other moms who said they would NEVER buy one. Well, not any more! The Barbie movies have now truly turned into the anorexia/low self esteem inducing movies that everyone thought they would be before ever seeing one.I just came on to check the reviews for the newer movie before buying it, because after Fashion there is no way I was going to buy it without looking into it first. Now I'm not going to buy it for her after reading the reviews. Sounds like it's even worse than this one. Barbie has lost a customer. Which is sad, because the earlier movies were so good, with good messages.They need to learn that the kids may like this drivel - but it's the MOMS WHO BUY THEM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"I totally agree with the first 3 \\"most helpful\\" reviews of this movie that advise staying away from this far-reaching, overly commercialzed excuse for a movie.I see that at least the recommended age for it is 7 and up, but my husband and I think is too mature for any girl who is young enough to play with Barbie dolls.Those first 3 reviews all give accurate synopsis' of what happens in this dreadful movie, so I am just reviewing to add my one star rating. Since I had to give it that one star, let's say that star is for the movie's song \\"life is a fairytale\\" which is catchy and can be taken as a song to encourage empowerment if you just listen to the lyrics w/o watching the movie.Keep your little daughters young and sweet, and try \\"Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!","review":"This barbie movie was the worst movie i have EVER seen! Teenage Drama? NOT APPROPRIATE FOR LITTLE KIDS! Kissing? in a Barbie movie? YUCK! come on Mattel, I got this to cheer me up because of breaking my arms, not to get disappointed! My Mom did not like it ether, So we gave it to my friend who liked it. this movie is HORRIBLE! barbie is a teenage BRAT in this movie, and some mean girl sends her a fake message from Ken, saying that they are breaking up! RIDICULOUS! DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie Fashion Fairytale","review":"My 6 year old daughter loves all the Barbie movies. She enjoyed this one but not as much as the others. It seemed a bit more sophisticated than the typical Barbie adventure. She has had it for a few weeks and only watched it the one time where as the others are viewed repeatedly. It may be loved at a later date but now not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...Probably Better for Older Girls...","review":"While I agree that this movie is geared towards the older Barbie fans, it's still fabulous! The storyline is cute (Barbie is HERSELF rather than playing another character) and my daughter loves all the characters.This is a MUST for all the Barbie fans out there. My daughter just turned 5 and she can handle the storyline with Barbie and Ken just fine...I think a little dose of reality mixed in with the magical stuff is just fine. The young ones can handle it better than we think!One thing that I LOVE is that the graphics get better as each year goes by. And the music is as good as ever. Always a visual and audio delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Movie for Barbie Fans","review":"What I Can Tell You:If you have a daughter, and you have not seen any of the Barbie Movies you are truly missing out. There is not a single Barbie Movie we haven't seen and I would love to own all of them.

She has watched it at least four times in three weeks.Some quality issues but not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Par","review":"Barbie is an integral part of this household. We have all the movies. Including this one. After the pleasant surprise of Mermaid Tale, I elected to buy this one, though I was as skeptical as with the Spring release. Why is this movie so rotten? Well...first: Kelly Sheridan is Barbie. NOT in this movie. Where did she go? I hate the voice of Barbie in this one. It's not Barbie at all. I even looked up Ms. Sheridan on Internet Movie Database. As of November 25, 2010, she is not credited for any further Barbie projects, though there is a movie projected for release in Spring 2011, second: the subject matter is way too mature for the age range of this series. Children that watch Barbie, in my opinion, do not need to watch mess with boyfriends and cheating. That's a little mature for them. If they already are exposed to it, why add to the needless drama? Avoid this Barbie movie like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the doctor ordered.","review":"My primary physician suggested this Horse Chestnut Seed Extract, one 300 mg capsule twice a day, to help relieve the swelling in my left leg. She said that another patient had brought it to her attention, saying it had helped a great deal. And it has. Elevation, periodically through out the day and at night is still the number one tactic to combat the swelling, but there is a noticeable difference with the Horse Chestnut Seed Extract compared to without it.NOW brand, as usual, has proven to be a quality product at less cost than most all of the competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for me","review":"I took this capsule two times and on both times I started feeling very dizzy and then I it made me vomit about twenty minutes later.

What this book is, however, is a book on new grand Texas homes, and they are for the most part quite spectacular. The images are vivid and well photographed and the homes chosen are some of the finest built in Texas in the last few years. I found the text to be interesting enough, but the real reason to get this book is the images, which are amazing. If you are someone intersted in the best new mansions built in the Lone Star State then you will not be disappointed in this book, if however, you are looking for a book on grand houses from diffent eras, then you will be disappointed indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Ore with love: old but instructive introduction to number theory.","review":"Pros:1. The book could teach basic number theory to a wide range of readers, from mathematically inclined high-school students to much more advanced lovers of mathematics. 2. It is enlivened by nice historical allusions.3.The author shows and shares his fascination with the subject in the writing.4. On a less lofty side, the font is large enough to avoid eye strain.Cons:1. First published 59 years ago, the book has to be dated. For example, many beautiful applications of number theory had been unknown at the time of writing.2. Not all exercises require creativity, many of them are routine drills.Bottom line:If number theory is not your fortress, the book could strike a balance between enjoyable reading and learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely biased","review":"I rented this ook at my local library after seeing that it discussed the colleges in an essay style. However, upon reading it, I found that the guide was much more focused upon politics than anything else. It looks at the political side from an extreme right wing view, making nasty comments about most schools, including the whole of the University of Michigan. That is why the top reviewers include Laura Schlessigner, Michael Medved, the National Catholic Register, a Fox News analyst, the author of Tenured Radicals: How Politics has corrupted our higher education and the author of How I Accidently Joined the Right Wing Party. This is not a college review book but a biased cynical look at liberalism at colleges from a radical view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"Choosing the Extreme Right Wing College\\"","review":"\\"Choosing the Right College\\" is written by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) with no authors listed. This is because there can't really be actual people around who feel that all advances in higher education made since the 1950's are bad. William Bennett & Cal Thomas praise the content of this book that seeks an Ozzie & Harriet University with no minority studies, no affirmative action programs, no women studies, and no student course choice. As I read this book I realized that the college that Mr. Bennett seeks to find doesn't exist and probably never did exist except in his own Republican dreams. And if did exist, boy would it be dull! I just hope that I can return the book to Amazon.con and avoid the financial support of the Right Wing (Stone Age) ISI before it's too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This book is terrible. I have two cheif beefs with it. First, I can only vouch for my schoos but the book misleads leads you about it. First at Davidson (where I attend) there is no sensitivity training as the book claims, the faculty is not 95 percent liberal democrat, the core curriculium is not 10 courses but 12 and the humanities department is not under fire in fact it is one of the most uniformaly praised departments on campus. My second problem is with the tone of the author. The author finds fault with my school for offering classes on Africa, South America and gender related issues and for the presence of a sexual harresment code. This kind of anglo-male centric attitude and the devaliution of women and minorities that comes with it is not only offensive to those who think but dangerious"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Horribly conservative, useless unless you're like minded.

It isn't complicated, but it has enough features to satisfy. I have some sound issues with some of my videos and when I turn up the volume, baby, this thing cranks! Clear crisp sound and several sound types (hall, live concert, surround, stereo, mono, analog, etc). The only thing holding it back is the display. My buddy has a Harmon Kardon and the display is a much cooler dark blue (but he paid 3 times as much as me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Yamaha HTR-5730","review":"Purchased Yamaha HTR-5730 receiver from Amazon based on price and other user reviews. As expected, it is made in China. Right out of the box and connected, the volume control knob on my unit does not work - so much for manufacturer's quality control. Volume can be adjusted by remote control only. All other features seem to be working. Sound is good. Turning on and switching between modes makes loud clicks. Remote control has strange layout and is unintuitive to use.Now that I have a Yamaha lemon on my hands, my only options are to pay extra to ship it back for a refund, or to a Service Center for repair. My emails to Yamaha are not returned. The customer support by phone is long-distance. The 800 number only repeats the contact info found on their website.Moral of the story: do not buy bottom-of-the-line products, even if they bear the Yamaha logo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for your soul","review":"This is music for the soul. Both artists are playing from a pure heart-felt source. Some reviews burn Bensusan for not taking more chances, but melodic variation is not less in value than reckless improvisation. Malherbe blends sensibilities of Bop, Mid-East, Far East, & Indian Raga and remains one of the greatest unknown wind instrumentalists active today. It's a shame that CD's such as \\"Fluvius\\" & \\"Fetish\\" by this artist are not available on Amazon or in most music stores.

It makes a major point that should be no surprise to any of us - that \\"shocks\\" have been opportunistic to the powers that are determined to promote their success above the general welfare. I appreciate this documentary because it focuses on important truths that too many of us refuse to accept even though the evidences are overwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy Theory","review":"For leftist intellectuals like Klein, there is really just one thing wrong with the world: they do not have the power to dictate what free people do. Free people work, they organize into companies, they make things, they compete with each other, some of them get rich if they make things the everyone likes. For people who do nothing productive but have enormous desire for power, it must be a nightmare.

I agree with another reviewer that blade does not stay attached to the handle. Also, it is very time consuming and tedious to use because it can only cut on the back stroke-when you are pulling the blade towards you. Any attempt at cutting on the push stroke and you will bend the blade within 5 minutes time, guaranteed. How Irwin can associate the words, \\"Pro\\" and \\"Multi\\" with this product is beyond me.Notice that I used the word \\"had\\" to describe this. I tried using it three times and that was enough.

This one has its own, unique slant. I loved it, and I'm sure you will, too. It's fascinating when a person with parents of any particular group can look back at their childhood and explain things as they saw them through the eyes of their childhood. Mr. Davis describes his young feelings with insight and clarity and makes you understand exactly where he's coming from. It's a wonderful book, made even more special by the rainbow of seldom-heard, but easy to read, descriptive vocabulary used throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art Noise","review":"It never ceases to amaze me that people find noise so interesting. I bought this CD based on various descriptions using the term \\"psychedelic\\" and on some articles I read praising Kawabata (lead guitarist). Before you buy this CD, make sure you listen to the samples. If you like noise, go for it. The first track is about 15 minutes long. You can call it improvisation if by that term you mean 6 or 7 people all playing different instruments at the same time with no coherent unifying theme. ...Now I like \\"psychedelic\\" and spacey music, ... But I can't imagine any drug that would make listening to this a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"Keeps CDs clean and safe. Removing system doesn't scratch CDs.

Some similar products I've seen if you open the cover all disks can fall out accidentally.I rated it 4/5 because it is not stackable. They look nice and I have two, but now I need more storage and I think if I buy more of these I will have to get a special shelf to put them on it. This same company now offers another product \\"Discgear Studio 100\\" which is stackable, but I don't like its CD storing mechanism. First I think accidental handling will make CDs fall out. Second the way CDs are stored is similar to the mechanism of regular CD/DVD boxes but it seems to be cheaply designed from some images I've seen on the net.So I think I will buy some more of these Romdex 80 units and just build a shelf for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute","review":"We saw this on our honeymoon in New Zealand and couldn't wait to have it.

It sounded interesting, so I purchased it.I found it fascinating. What I was not expecting to read was a first person account of a woman watching the \\"brewing\\" of WWII from within Europe, and subsequently Russia. And, it all came together by accident. Interesting to see the connections between seemingly unrelated events in seemingly unrelated places. Never mind what this woman accomplished before most women were in a position to accomplish anything close to what she acheived. After all, this was in the 1930s!This is a remarkable story, and very well written. I intend to read her other books.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting woman; boring book","review":"I bought this because I was interested in early women's lib-ers who \\"just did it\\" and in her 1930s era access to Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union. She certainly is an interesting woman with a will power, but her access and her insights into these two countries were minimal and superficial. While she ackowledges that she was a pawn, the information she does present adds nothing to the understanding of those two countries or to what it must have been like to BE there. The Artic adventures are more promising, but like the rest of the book suffer from a really quite juvenile writing style that does little to effectively or movingly capture the moments she experiences. Finally, her lack of introspection seem to suggest that she really did \\"just do it\\" without much of a real reason and without much struggle and that just isn't very interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahead of Time","review":"Unfortunately, I never received the book.

The wire itself contains 8 small color coded wires inside that must be connected indivudaly to the corresponding color on the other wire. These wires can't be soddered because the signal requires metal to metal contact, it won't work with lead sodder. Steady hands and loads of patience are required"},{"rating":"1","title":"What color do you want?","review":"I wanted a black cable. I thought this cable was black. I received a white cable. Be sure the seller is sending you the color you ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"Interesting, if you are a Fulci fan. But hardcore Fulci fans will find it boring.No movie clips, no artwork of posters, no stills...nothing.Sound on some of the interview clips are bad.Maybe Volume 2 will have all the bells and whistles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supplement","review":"Heard of the possible benefits on NPR thought I'd try it. I went a very long time without illness. I think it may be valid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Turkey Tail does it job!","review":"If you are in need of this product do not hesitate to purchase it! This is a top quality product that does what it is supposed to! The company that sells it ship very very quickly! Thank You for the fast service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly, a really good compilation album","review":"I'm normally an album purist who doesn't buy a lot of compilations, but this one makes sense to get. I don't know anywhere else to get the Neil Young duet \\"Are There Any More Real Cowboys?\\", which is fantastic. The other incredible songs on this compilation are \\"Seven Spanish Angels\\" (available on various Ray Charles collections) and \\"Pancho and Lefty\\" (also on the album of the same name, but this is a better buy). Every song is at least decent, though the Hank Williams \\"duet\\" is totally unnecessary just like his all the Hank Williams fake duets with his songs and grandsons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blend of Willie and those who help make him great.","review":"The entire album is filled with songs that Willie recorded with a variety of people. It is a great collection of duets performed over the years not only with the other outlaws but other people as well. It is a great \\"get in the car and just drive and listen\\" type of album. However it does tend to lack many of the great songs that we as listeners tend to relate to the realm of Willie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Willie","review":"You either like Willie Nelson or you do not. For Willie fans this is a grand accumulation of Willie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Monitor for the Price","review":"I purchased 4 of these monitors for office use and gaming. Compared to the CRT I had before, these monitors are incredibly bright and crisp. In order to get the colours to look right, I had to fiddle with the settings quite a bit, and turn the brightness down to about 25%. My games look sharp and there is no ghosting except when changing your view of bright light sources, much the same as if you looked at the sun and then looked away. Of the four, none had any bad pixels and worked perfectly out of the box. The only issue I've had with them is that, after hooking two up as analog and the others as digital, the digital monitors seem almost TOO sharp, to the point where text is hard to read. Prior to purchasing these monitors, I compared them to 19\\" Acers, Dells, and Viewsonics, and decided that these had the best look of the lot, and best price for the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor","review":"I bought a refurbished version of this monitor, and am completely pleased. It has accurate colors and appropriate brightness.It has both analog and digital input and I am using the digital. I had to switch the input mode from analog to digital.My only criticism is the menuing and its controls, which are less intuitive than other monitors -- but, you only go through that once."},{"rating":"1","title":"The viewing angle ruins it","review":"Just finished using a Spyder3 to calibrate it.Result? Exactly what I expected. The super-narrow viewing angle kills this thing completely. The bottom of the monitor is reddish and the top is greenish. Despite being in calibration.Avoid this. Plain and simple.I'm replacing it and selling this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Book!","review":"What a great read this is. Galbraith brings out a personal side of people we could only imagine exists. Of course, he reveals the same of himself. (Ever see a picture of him smiling?) The book reads quickly. In fact, my only complaint about the book is that I got so relaxed while reading it that I fell asleep too easily. (I read late at night). I'm sure, as I did, you'll be envious of Galbraith's acquaintances with the \\"characaters\\" of this book. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Requiem for an old Socialist","review":"My daughter gave me this book as a gift, I guess, because I'm an economist. I wish she hadn't. Others obviously think Galbraith's musings more than a little entertaining; I don't. He came across to me as asserting that the only people worth knowing were the ones he once served/worked with. I would rate some his ancedotes as amusing, but the flavor of the book seemed to be that of a very old man, whose core beliefs have been repudiated by history, claiming that the idea of a command economy just didn't get a fair shake. All these socialist countries just haven't done it right, and they just don't make 'em like they used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Acrostic Book","review":"This was a book of doggerel verse about the glories of the South during the Civil War by an old man with a long beard and wild-looking eyes -- no puzzles of any kind, let alone ACROSTICS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception","review":"Ad for this product implied that it was a puzzle book. Wrong. It was instead a reprint (broken type and all) of over-hundred-year-old acrostic puzzles which did not allow for buyer participation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hysterical","review":"I doubt I would ever make anything from this book, primarily because I like my arteries too much. But it is quite humorous. There are many smile-inducing touches to the recipes that make this a fun read for a cookbook, particularly that each recipe is accompanied by the name and trailer lot number from whom the recipe originated. Many of the recipes also are accompanied by small anecdotes about the trailer residents and their \\"bona fides\\" among their peers."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked it","review":"It's a fun book and I recv'd it just as advertised. Has some new and interesting recipes. Great gift idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book","review":"Another funny book from Ruby Ann. All of her books are hilarious and a good read. I keep them in my guest room when I am finished with them and they always bring a few laughs from guests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!","review":"I love this book! Its entertaining and the descriptions of all of the *trailer park* residences are hilarious. I glanced through it at a friend's and immediately bought one for myself and several of my family members. (my copy is autographed and has a big Ruby Ann lipstick print inside the front cover) We have a camping trip planned for next spring and everyone attending has to choose a recipe to make for the whole group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun cookbook","review":"My family and I bought this cookbook as a fun thing to do for Christmas. We all had to pick a recipe from the book and make it. Some of the recipes are pretty good. The best part of the book though is that we were all laughing as we read some of the recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"good booby prize","review":"funny title and cover picture. horrible recipes. great booby prize at a bridge party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny...","review":"Oh it had it's moments, but some references were over the top for me. I didn't save it for a white elephant. I put it in the trash. Highly over rated but to each his/her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is disappointing!","review":"The trailer trash thing is overdone. I was turned off by the on and on ramblings and making fun of trailer park residents. I can listen to jokes of any kind but I found this very distasteful. This is 2007 not 1950. I collect cookbooks and thought this might have some fresh ideas and purchased it based on the good reviews. Everyone can choose their own style of humor, I just happen to see this book as turning into a white elephant or into the recycle bin. I felt the recipes were unremarkable and shallow, just as the author's commentary. There are so many great cookbooks at Amazon,I would look a little farther next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only funny, but great recipes!","review":"I found this book at a yard sale...it's a fantastic cookbook--funny, and yet useful! GREAT recipes and you can bet someone will ask you, \\"WHERE did you find that recipe?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"LAUGHTER, TRAILER PARKS AND RECIPES!!!","review":"THIS IS ANOTHER AMAZING SUPER FUNNY RUBY ANN TRAILER PARK COOKBOOK. THE STORIES SHE TELLS AND THE SITUATIONS THAT HAPPEN AT HOME IN THE TRAILER PARK WILL HAVE YOU LAUGHING OUTLOUD. THE RECIPES ARE AN ADDED BONUS AND I MUST ADMIT, I HAVE TRIED A FEW AND THEY ARE GOOD!!! ALL THE BOOKS BY RUBY ANN ARE A GREAT READ AND A FUNNY ONE TO SHARE WITH THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy a copy for your house and car! Your'e not going to want to take it out!","review":"\\"The Book of Shadows\\" is filled with nothing but \\"Cool\\" music. The Donnas kick off the cd, followed by Liz Phair and the sexy sounds of Dido. Sarah McLachlan, Ashlee Simpson and other women make this soundtrack a powerful feminine statement.Every song captures the spirit of Charmed and throws the listener into a very mysterious, witchy mood. This cd is worthy of listening to over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Disc, Excellent Buy","review":"Great album, I did like the first more, but this one was very close to the first album. I didn't expect it to exceed the quality of the first or come close to it, but the audio producers from Charmed certainly know what they're doing. I have to say that my two favorite song selections were \\"Fallen\\" by Sarah McLachlan and \\"Take it Off\\" by The Donnas, but I suppose I'm a bit bias in those facts in that I like those bands. An excellent buy, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"charmed: the book of shows","review":"I got this cd and I love it there is a lot of cool songs and some of them is from the show COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Even my girlfriend dont like Charmed but she likes the CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD could be better...","review":"The CD was alright and while it had a lot of variety, it was missing the most important song of all: The theme song!! When I learned that it wasn't on there, I was really disappointed. But I still love the show regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"music that gets you in the mood","review":"When I listen to the charmed book of shaddows I feel like I want to go watch charmed. The artists blend well together. my favorite is Ashlee Simpson. She fits in well for charmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"New School GARBAGE!","review":"The ONLY \\"Decent\\" song on this \\"New\\" soundtrack is \\"I Can't Make Me\\". The First soundtrack is MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I bought this soundtrack when it first came out and I haven't been able to listen to anything else. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed SoundTrack","review":"The Charmed Soundtrack is the best...The music is great the the singers are outstanding!!! Of course I bought the album because I am the biggest Charmed Fan EVER!!!!!

I enjoy every song on the playlist. I have it on repeat in my car and I am still enjoy every minute of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"question","review":"When has Zero 7 been played in the episodes? Season, episode?Why is that song on the soundtrack? Same for Shivaree.My personal opinion: this album is pretty crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of the show will love the soundtrack!","review":"If you like the show Charmed, then you'll <u>love</u> the Charmed Book of Shadows Soundtrack.It really sets a charming mood. This soundtrack is a wonderful mix of different music that any fan of the show will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Favorite","review":"After I got \\"Charmed: The Book of Shadows Soundtrack\\" I couldn't put it down. I continued to listen to this album again and again. At first, I wasn't sure if it was a going to be good because I hadn't heard about it that much, but decided to get it anyway, and after I did, I was really glad that I did. All of the singers, did a great job and made the album related so much to the show. I'm sure that anyone that gets this album will be pleased with it and I'm also sure that whoevers listens to this album will want to start watching the show, because the music is so great and it relates to the show so much. I'm glad this album was put out, and I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound track","review":"This sound track is great i love all the songs i give it 5 stars it cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD","review":"I would highly reccomend this CD! If you're at all a fan of the show, it's a great companion to have!!!!! Go and get it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LadyBelle's Charmed Review","review":"I thought this album was great. It just showed how much the music and the show has grown and that women can do what ever we set a sites on. I'd recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent mix of music!","review":"I think this mix perfectly conveys all emotions we might experience while watching Charmed. It has that San Francisco vibe, and was very well selected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Metal from Iced Earth!!!!","review":"I first picked up Iced Earth in a store when I was looking for a new metal band. I picked up Night of the Stormrider and Iced Earth. They were great! Horror show is great too. My favorite songs are Phantom and Wolf.
