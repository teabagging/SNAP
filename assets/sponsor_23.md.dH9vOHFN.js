Yes Jackie Kennedy was an icon but also an regular women who had her faults and plus jsut as anyone else, but this book doesn't potray that it is almost an attack on the character of the very women it is writing about.

It hurts my heart and makes me lose faith in the American people that this book is even read. I have no illusions about who the Kennedys are. We all recognize that they have had more than their share of self-induced scandal. However, they have also had more than their share of tragedy. Now, in the light of their most recent lose, let us respect Caroline. Leave the family alone and stop looking for ways to rip up a family which is already ripped to peices."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book","review":"This is the last book I intend to read about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.I am thoroughly disgusted with the tales of her poor little rich girl story. Her parents divorced, her first husband cheated on her, her second husband did also. Who cares about who she supposedly had affairs with?She never had enough money to make up for not having enough love. So this is somehow unique? Somehow I can't feel sorry for her.The rest of us manage to muddle along with what life throws our way. We don't make such a production of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I now understand the previous generation's Kennedy fixation","review":"This book is a page turner from the beginning. I have never read Christopher Andersen before, and now am reading another novel of his, \\"An Affair to Remember\\" detailing the love story between Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. As someone who was not alive when JFK was shot, I never really understood this country's fascination with the Kennedy family.

This one I don't care for. This author is heavily influenced by Freud, and we get lots of psychobabble.

The alcoholic's drinking, argues Bateson, is often a symetrically schismogenic act....\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"where do I start?","review":"There is a reason the cliche is so popular. Obviously, a lot of women can relate to the \\"middle aged women getting stronger through a crisis\\" sort of thing.But this book was just so bad! Really poorly written, full of stereotypes, and so predictable. It read as though she were already planning the made for tv movie on the Lifetime channel. Just overly sappy, overly melodramatic. And why is it that in all these books, the women are of a certain sort of financial background? Do you want a real crisis? Try getting cancer and not being a successful attorney. Or cancer without even having insurance. Try leaving your husband and not being super wealthy.

I can relate specifically to the character Eve as I have also lost a significant person in my life. I could identify with her and through her strength, could find my own. Monroe excels at developing realistic characters who deal with the everyday hardships we can all identify with. I always pick up one of her novels whenever I need my spirits raised.

Worst of all, our book club selected this book to read thinking it might have some relevance to the club members and the vagaries of our daily lives. (We meet next week so the jury isn't in yet.) I feel this book belongs in the romance section of the grocery stores with some steamy cover. These characters were caricatures of real people. Maybe a good beach read ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to unwind with...","review":"Five friends share their lives with one another via their monthly bookclub. Five different women and their stories allow the strength of the story to come through.It is with humanity we share our lives and with humanity that we each keep secrets. These women are no different. Take a break with these women and it will refresh you. The characters work through the moments and dips in life, but having a support system in place pulls each of these women through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise","review":"The premise is interesting, the use of quotes for each chapter has promise and concentrating the book on 5 characters is intriguing.Unfortunately Monroe does not deliver - the dialog is trite and hackneyed. Who says \\"You Go Girl\\"???? I groaned every time that phrase was used.The quotes used as headings are interesting, but then the analogies during the chapter to support it are just too much. Especially grating was the reference to Jack London's Buck, leaders, the pack and Evie threatening to bite someone's finger.These female characters just do not ring true. Doris comes the closest, with Gabriellla not too far behind - but she also gets the least attention, the easiest problem that is all solved when her \\"friends\\" from the book club come over, clean her house and open a box of crackers.Who are these women? How did they meet and get to be friends? Are they really friends? It's never adequately explained or explored.This book comes close - but it's a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unlikely \\"sisterhood\\" of stereotypes.","review":"I was so hopeful when I picked this book and was initially pleased settling into the story line. All the women were about my age and I have faced some of the changes they faced in the story. Ms. Monroe's characters share their deep losses and challenges on such an intimate level with the reader, but for all the empathy inspired by their revelations when Monroe started folding the characters together, things seemed to fall apart. The mature, vibrant women I met in the beginning of the story became emotionally limited numbskulls as the story moved along.Good start, sloppy finish (quickly wrapped up and tied with a big, pink bow, and only a few loose ends)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Club","review":"I started a book club and used Mary Alice Monroe's \\"The Book Club\\" as our first book.

The production quality is terrible--it's one guy with a camera who shakily circles the trainer and the model the entire time. That wouldn't bother me, though, if the workout were any good. It literally consists of a 5 minute warm up at the beginning, a 3 minute cool down at the end, and the middle 12 minutes is ONE MOVE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. That is the workout. I felt terrible for the fitness model--she looks like she's about to die or punch the trainer in the face. It's also worth mentioning that you can't really do the move unless you have wood floors (you put a dish towel under one foot and have to slide that food back and forth on the floor).Seriously, do NOT buy this workout video. I think he re-vamped the workout recently (that's the $70+ video). It must be better than this early version..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"This DVD came in the a cardboard sleeve. No DVD case, which is very cheap. The workout was basically two exercises, squats and lunges with some variations. I was hoping for more variety. The camera left the girl working out to focus on the \\"host\\" and it was impossible to keep up. The camera needs to stay focused on the exercise, not him. Definitely not worth the price and for me, a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid. waste of money","review":"All this video is, is a 20 min side lunge routine.

It is the same exercise for the entire 20 min. I did not like having to use a towel. It kept bunching up and was a nuisance. I got more of a workout messing with the towel than I did from the exercises. This product is very expensive for poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many repetitive moves","review":"I was excited to try this DVD, but I was disappointed when I attempted to perform the moves. First, the moves he has you do on one leg/side are too many for as long as he has you doing them. I think the model who was in the video was even having a hard time with them. It would have been better to maybe perform 3-4 moves on one leg and then switch to the other leg. Sure, doing a ton on one leg at one time might get quicker results but it's very strenuous even for someone who is fit.Also, there wasn't much variety in the types of moves he showed. I would recommend doing these moves to your own rep/set preferences as they seem to be helpful in getting results, but will also make you not want to do the video out of dread of boredom with the same moves over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workoput for only 20 minutes","review":"OMG my legs were killing me (in a good way) each time after I used this DVD. I stopped using it because I dont stick to at home exercise regimens very long (I love the gym too much). But I would definitely recommend this for anyone who's a beginner and wants to exercise in the comfort of their own home. A hard, but effective workout that keeps your heart rate up."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Right","review":"Sawallisch is as great a conductor as any we have seen in our century--just ask any musician who's played for him.

The orchestra is fist class, with a rich, golden sound, anf the recording is masterful. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice for the Schubert Symphonies","review":"Sawalish's fifth is bright, vigorous, and graceful, especially in the slow movements. You get a rich sound from the woodwinds in this recording which is absolutely gorgeous in the eighth and ninth symphonies. The sound was nice, a little close, which is interesting as it reveals the interplay between the strings and woodwinds.

Hopefully a well written book will be published about Sal Mineo but this is not it. There was no insight at all on Sal Mineo and the type of person he was.

I strongly recommend that anyone wanting to read a biography on Sal Mineo read the newer biography as it is far superior to this book. It actually has detailed interviews with Sal's partners unlike this one and seems much more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover","review":"When I found this book in a now defunct bookseller/emporium I snatched it up. I have long been a fan of the actor and the beautiful dustjacket with a clear black and white photo of the star looked like a wonderful package.After reading it I have to say that I was extremely disappointed. This was a dreary and dreadful story! I didn't feel that it was researched very well, it contained no interviews done with the family save some interviews done by other publications back in the 50s and 60s. But there was just so much repetion of a few ideas thrown out over and over. By the time I came to the end of the book I also felt that the writer, who claimed a personal friendship with the late star, had created an ugly and unflattering vision of the man. I really wish I hadn't read this book and don't recommend it to anyone unless you love dreary and dreadfulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sals disappointment","review":"What a disappointment this book is. There is little mention of two very important people in Sals life, and several inaccurate details. This book is about a small portion of the man named Sal Mineo. Wait for the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"below average.","review":"I've waited a long time to see a book written about the wonderful,Sal Mineo. Now,an author with respectable credits,has written this sloppy,one dimensional view,of an actor that deserves much more! Some of the book is interesting,but always goes back to Sal's homosexuality,and the fact the author had a few one night stands with him.And the way the author exploits Sal's sex life,it seems that wasn't a big accomplishment. I don't think Sal Mineo was properly depicted in this book,as the author obviously has some obession with the fact he had sex with him.I hope a more respectful author will come along,and not try to exploit Sal's sex life,for the sake of selling-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal Clip Job","review":"Sal Mineo and those interested in his life and career deserve better than this tawdry clip job. There is no evidence that the author conducted any interviews with friends, family or colleagues of Mineo. He plays up Mineo's gay sexuality till it becomes tiresome. The A&E Biography is much better, as is E!'s episode of Mysteries and Scandals devoted to Mineo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering Sal Mineo","review":"This was a very interested biography on the life of Sal Mineo. I was introduced to Sal Mineo when I first saw the classic film, rebel without a cause. In my opinion, I believe Sal's tragic death is still a mystery. It's a great biography to remembering the young handsome actor who should never be forgotten. Even though, he was gay, he was very a handsome young man and very talented.RIP SAL. Can't wait until they do a movie about this talented late actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy and lifeless cereal box biography","review":"The author claims to have slept with Sal Mineo and yet offers nothing about what made him tick. This is probably the emptiest biography I've ever read, lacking in any research or interviews with Mineo's family, friends and professional associates. The most atrocious aspect of the book, however, is Jeffer's spoilers of the Mineo film endings. One by one, he sets about revealing the ending of each of Mineo's films and then - at the end of the book - has the audacity to suggest that his readers seek out Sal Mineo's film work. Fortunately, I was wise to Jeffer's game and just skimmed over the film descriptions for those I haven't seen yet. It's sad that this is the only biography available for such a great actor, 'cos it's a terrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Play Detective","review":"TWISTED is a story about three cousins - Damietta, Tiffany and Aj - who are determined to play detectives. They try to solve the mystery of why people are stealing biblical artifacts and why they don't want the Christian religion to exist. The thieves try to steal anything that proves the Holy Bible to be true, in hopes to erase the Christian religion forever. Damietta, Tiffany and Aj feel if the thieves succeed, it would be dangerous and harmful to all Christians who exist.TWISTED is a story that I recommend for teenagers, like myself, to read. I enjoyed the book and could relate to the story especially since I always play detective. In fact, my mother calls me inquisitive since I'm always trying to find out things that don't concern me.

That said, I thought the book started off very well. The first four years (the book covers a ten year period) was well written and very enjoyable. The fifth year, which dealt with Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite, was fun. Unfortunatly, the book goes down hill from there. I found the ending to be silly and completely unsatisfying.

Despite the potential for some good stories, the show doesn't really hold my interest. The abysmal quality of mid-70s TV animation doesn't help, as everything is very stiff and static, and certain shots are repeated again and again.The cost of animation was skyrocketing in the 1970s, and with a limited budget there was not much the producers could do. When computers began to take over in the late 80s, animation could once again delight and amaze, but this only emphasizes the stodgy quality of 70s cartoons.The live action series was much more interesting and enjoyable. As a POTA enthusiast, I suppose I should give the cartoon another try, but it's just not compelling viewing. I'd recommend this only for hard-core fans of the films."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD de Coleccion Para FANS de El Planeta de los Simios","review":"Realmente me sorprendio mucho encontrar que el DVD venia hablado en Español(Mono), la calidad de la imagen es excelente, lastimosamente la serie consta de pocos capitulos, lo recomiendo ampliamente si eres un Fan de El Planeta de Los Simios y si hablas español."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to the Planet of the Apes","review":"The animated Saturday Morning Show still is worth watching.

For the Planet of the Apes completist you must have this as it is a \\" Apes\\" and cartoon collectors gem, for the curious it is a great example of early 1970's cartoon sci-fi, and for the high octane ADHD X-Box generation who expect to view everything like film never existed and all must be HD Blue-Ray to be watchable then the eclectic value here might escape them."},{"rating":"2","title":"General Urko has a driver's licence!","review":"Doug Wildey, creator of Hanna Barberra's JONY QUEST, returns to animated series television with this undiscovered jewel! His take on POTA has the simians driving cars (instead of riding horseback like in the films)flying airplanes,and broadcasting tv!

A must have for all POTA FANS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Apes Forever!","review":"This kids' version of the Planet of the Apes franchise came out after the live-action TV series.

The Apes in this show match up more closely with Pierre Boulles original vision but then throw in the mutant human beings from \\"Beneath\\" and giant monsters (in two episodes only) and ou have got the making of a great sci-fi adventure cartoon series. The animation is very...nostalgic for this time period but that only adds to the charm of the show for me.Listen for Henry Corden who plays General Urko whom some of you may remember as the voice of Fred Flintstone in the late 70's.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!","review":"Ok the quality of the animation leaves a lot be desired, but the story is really enjoyable. Have just watched the 13 episodes over two days and want more!!Haven't seen the remastered episodes as I watched the ones in the \`Ultimate' box-set.Highly recommended if you've seen the films and the live action tv series."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Return\\" a good idea.","review":"Return to the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic animated reworking of the live action movie/television series. It's good to see the breadth of ideas that come when a live action budget is not an issue. Although the animation is simple, the art work is detailed and interesting. Inclusion of General Urko from the TV series amongst ape characters like Cornelius and Zira from the movies is a nice touch. Despite being a continuity nightmare when placed alongside the rest of the franchise, it is trumps when it comes to being evolutions nightmare. It's also more faithful to the original novel's vision of an Ape Planet than it's predecessors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful littel book","review":"This was such a cute book.

I literally shook so hard from laughter reading her story about the mis-pronounced poorhouse (p. 87) that I had to put the book down until I recovered! A rare combination of insight, wit, and wisdom--all in easy-to-read language--makes this book both a great read and a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for savings","review":"I could not put it down when I started. It is well writing and funny I laugh myself silly with the story of the eggplans. Very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Read","review":"This book was very difficult to read from the beginning. I also do not appreciate having religion shoved down my throat which this book likes to do. Ignoring that part of it and skipping around made parts of the book bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just plain annoying!","review":"I'm sorry but this is just not good! I mean, her money saving tips are creative but honestly , it takes hours to cut enough coupons to save that much money off of a grocery bill -- I don't know what her time is worth an hour but it's more than 10 dollars in my life. I also grew up wearing thrift store clothes (before it was cool) and hearing the kids taunt \\"your mama shops at K-Mart\\" -- if only my family had the money to shop at K Mart!The point is, this woman is rediculous and incorrect in her statements at the least. If you can handle the god references and obsessive coupons and rebates (if you got that kind of time) than this IS the book for you. It's definitely NOT the book for me. I want my 10.50 and the two hours of my life back that this book cost me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like discovering a gold mine","review":"A whirlwind of great ideas. I love her stories, they made the rest of the book more fun to read. Some books are so idea oriented that they become boring. Ellie Kay is funny! I wish I could sit across the kitchen table from her and get to know her better.Buy this book! I have save tons of money by following only a few of her ideas. I wish I had this book three years ago before we started having money problems. Because of Ellie we can now see the light at the end of the tunnel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellie Kay","review":"This book did have a few good ideas but the more I read the more I was put off by her constant plugs for her other book and her website, this occurs on nearly EVERY page. There are also several biblical references, which are fine I guess since that is her audience but will put off the non-Christian reader. \\"More with Less\\", \\"Extending the Table\\", \\"Tightwad Gazette\\" are by far better choices. I checked this out at the library and would suggest you do that before purchasing for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I stumbled across this one on my library shelf.I like how the author writes alittle story about what she is talking about before she helps you with ideas on how to save on all different subjects.She give web addresses for the internet and how to save, and at the end, she has letters from readers and how she has helped them.Great fast read, with useful information.Ellen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellie Kay is fabulous!","review":"With four children 10 and under, I am always trying to find ways to save money. I have just recently bought both of Ellie Kay's books and enjoy both of them tremendously! I can't wait to share what I've learned with my family and friends. I am going to recommend to everyone I know to go out and get these books. These suggestions will help out so much, especially with only one income( my husband is a SGT in the US Army) and seven people in our house. Ellie, thank you so much for sharing with others what you know about saving money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving money in college!","review":"Ellie Kay's latest book is a great way to save money in very specific areas. I read the first one and am now using the knowledge I gained from it, along with the saving tips found in How to Save Money Every Day, to save money and share with my friends. It's really wonderful to be saving money everyday and be wise about spending...as a college student, this is incredibly helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargain of a Book!","review":"Saving money every day--now THERE'S a concept that makes my husbands wallet glow with affection! Whether it's appliances or zinnias you need, Ellie Kay can save you cash. This book is a bargain hunter's dream.

This is such a great read and it has the added benefit of much laughter to be had. It gives me hope if I follow Gods plan that has been simply put in this book,not only I will be blessed but those who God puts in my path. Thanks Ellie for writing a book, that is like Gods plan of salvation. Follow the simple steps and blessings will abound!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much, much, much too slow!","review":"Satie's beautifully melancholic piano music is made sooooo dull by Mr Leeuw's elephantine playing, and this lethargic speed completely ruins my enjoyment of it. There is nothing in the music to warrant such a gross miscalculation of tempo. I'd recommend other recordings of Satie's music which more faithfully adhere to his intentions (Roge etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You're Both Correct!","review":"Those who love and detest these unique renderings are both, in a sense, correct. Just because an interpretation deviates from what we expect it to sound like doesn't make it wrong. Necessarily. Sure, excessive interpretive freedom can wreck the enjoyment of an otherwise fine piece of music. Witness Ivo Pogorelich's nonsensically detached, self-indulgent performances of Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto that he toured with a few years ago. Ultimately, though, either it \\"works\\" or doesn't, a purely subjective determination. Robert de Leuw's rendering (or rending, as the case may be) can be experienced either as pure bliss or torture. I err on the side of the former, but appreciate the contrary view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erik Satie CD","review":"This CD replaced an LP I had years ago. It has everything from the LP on it and more. I was glad to have a chance to listen to samples of the pieces before I bought it. The liner notes are extremely informative. I'm very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Beautiful at the same time!","review":"I heard \\"Gymnopedies\\" no. 1 & 2 about 10 years ago and since then I have never forgotten the soul stirring force of this composition. Even after the passing of this time I still feel enough of its effects to finally buy this piece of artistic beauty on cd; I can now enjoy with my ears too (my memory and soul have been \\"hearing\\" it since that first time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"The sound quality of this recording was very disappointing. It sounds as if it had been recorded in a cave. I chose this disc for the Gymnopedies, which I love, but I found the tempo glacial. You could almost lose the thread of the melody from one note to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"I guess you either 'get' Satie or you dont, but Robert de Leeuw's interpretation and playing is unsurpassable. This CD which has all my required Satie pieces is a treasure. I bought it for the Gnossiennes but every work transcends the one before it. I cant recommend another version other than de Leeuw's sheer perfection. Exquisite"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of de Leeuw's greatest achievements","review":"An amazing set, one of the best Satie's Piano Works recordings out there, definitely first rate. These are wonderful interpretations of some of the most beautiful pieces in the whole piano literature. de Leeuw's performances are breathtaking. The slow movements are poignant and heart-rending.If you're searching for a quintessential recording of Satie's wonderful compositions, then you can't go wrong with this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Back Cover","review":"IT'S CHRISTMAS IN MONTANA....What Child is This? - Melanie Briggs and her baby daughter create quite a stir when they suddenly arrive to stay at the Stone Ranch.

However, McGraw-Hill falsely advertises about the online learning tools such as online quizzes, etc. You can spend $132.00 but you are NOT getting the online learning tools as they said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"deplorable","review":"Absolutely the driest textbook I've ever owned. Not even my teacher liked the book, but she used the publisher's slides and required that we buy the book anyways. Is there nothing else better out there? His descriptions required my teacher to constantly provide \\"In other words...\\" to clarify what the heck he was talking about. It's written in a way that requires a person to reread the text a couple of times to \\"get it.\\" I ended up getting an A in the class, but I relied heavily on both my anatomy and physiology teachers to explain difficult concepts that Fox couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I used this book for a Physiology class. The book was absolutely terrible. I used my anatomy book all the time and I felt it was very straightforward. This book, however, was not. It is choppy and difficult to understand. I will admit that the lab book that went with it was more helpful than the textbook, both both were lacking. It also speaks to the professor and the book that the book was hardly mentioned and the professor used her own explanations and did not supplement with book material. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful book","review":"The entire section on DNA transcription is wrong. It also does a terrible job at explaining or skimping on certain topics. For example, in hemodynamics, the author does not explain the difference between blood flow and velocity of blood flow. This is key to understanding why blood travels much slower in the capillary beds even though the overall resistance is very low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of you guys need to learn better study habits","review":"Guys, it's a pre-req for Nursing, of course the material is going to be a difficult. Many of you who rate the book low are ignorant students who have yet to develop their study skills. You're looking for a scapegoat, someone to blame. Well guess what? You cannot blame a book for your failure to understand concepts... instead of bashing a knowledgeable book blame your lack of discipline and find another major, make it easy for us who put the time into the class. \\"You live in the age of technology; it has made people lazy, but you also have many more resources available to you. so If you fail a class blame yourself, never blame a book or an instructor, they set the foundation for the material.

It is the most complete and logically organized text I have found as a professor. In general, this is a tough subject but the illustrations and the McGraw Hill website make this text the most student friendly. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to happy","review":"I recently purchased tne human physiology book and tho it was a great deal... the cd that is suppose to accompany it did not come with book and that is a major part that is needed.. so in all actuality it is better to just buy the books from college book store to be sure you get what you need"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Book","review":"It was the wrong book. The book I received isn't even supposed to be sold in North America. The picture for the book on this ad was not the same as the cover of the book. I needed the book picture for my class and I did NOT receive that book. VERY unhappy!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Video, definitely worth the price","review":"The video did a great job of explaining the biology of snakes, a little on their evolution, and the variety of species. However, where it really excelled was in the video of snakes in action. Great camera work. The opening scene was very dramatic and attention getting. The narration was very good as well. Although it won't offer much, if any information for advanced herpetologists and snake enthusiasts, the price is justified by dramatic scenes. It is 50 minutes long (don't know why Amazon doesn't list running times)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Dichter plays the best of Liszt.","review":"There is no better Liszt recording on the market at any price.

No smoke in the kitchen. Smoky flavor given to foods is subtle, not a deep smoke-- but that is tobe expected. The only problem is that the stainless pan takes a little effort to clean up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokin' Stovetop Smoker!","review":"As a traditional smoker enthusiast, I was reluctant to smoke indoors on the stove, but during inclement weather there is no alternative if you don't want to change the menu at the last minute. This smoker performed fabulously! I have used it over and over with excellent results. It can also be used for poaching large fish, etc.The one thing I would caution about it's use is that you need to keep a close eye on it. It works much faster than traditional outdoor smokers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute staple.","review":"For the eco-friendly, anti-corporate, slacker \\"freegan\\", this is the ultimate bachelor grub.Make it with soy milk and ground veggie burger crumbles for a sweet meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter garbage","review":"I cannot believe how anyone could invest time, let alone money, in this complete and utter dross. I've just made my son switch it off because I just couldn't bear another single second of the stupid and pathetic screaming of the Idiot character Fred.This must be one of the worst films of all time. It simply beggars belief that someone actually got paid for making it.This is definitely one of those times when a negative rating should be available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right To The Point: This Movie Sucked.","review":"I had the misfortune of sitting through the whole movie, and I began to contemplate gouging my eyes out. After the end credits, I sat in disbelief that I actually wasted 83 minutes of my life watching this piece of festering crap. I honestly don't know how I haven't gone deaf, or at least insane at the sound of his incessant squeaking voice. If ever you find yourself in the same situation as I was, immediately leave the room.

THIS MOVIE IS BEYOND BAD!!!!! O_O","review":"As you may already know that this movie is based on a character named Fred Figglehorn created and played by Lucas Cruikshank who has his own youtube channel featuring this character and his overly, hyperactive, high-pitched, chipmunk sounding voiced glory. These youtube vids of Fred are funny, entertaining, and so are his music videos and songs in genereal. These youtube vids of Fred are good and worth watching but this movie on the other hand is the exact opposite.\\"Fred: the movie\\" has nothing but problems such as bad acting, bad singing, zero percent comedy and none of the charm, humor or high-pitched chipmunk voice that Fred had in his youtube vids. In his youtube videos, he was funny but here he totally isn't, it doesn't even look like Fred enjoys being in this movie considering how bad the comedy and script is. If you truly wish to watch Fred Figglehorn; watch his youtube vids, skip this movie. It is physically painful to watch, its beyond bad. 0/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 15 yr old dd absolutely loves Fred and loves his movie.","review":"My daughter has been a \\"Fred\\" lover for a long time now. If you don't like the movie and you don't get the humor, then you don't know the origins of Fred. Fred has a high pitched voice and acts totally immature because when he started on his youtube episodes, he was acting like a six year old. In keeping somewhat with his youtube character, he has mixed a teenage character with the elementary school character together. My daughter and I watched it together and then my daughter watched it at least a couple more times within the first 24 hours. She wants the DVD. It will be a Christmas present. I thought the kid in the forest was the best part. That made me crack up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fred The Movie","review":"I think the movie is funny and cool. I like it when Fred decided to go on a dangerous adventure to Judy's house since she moved to 56 meadows lane. I will recommend this movie to people who likes the character \\"Fred\\" and enjoys Fred The show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaw-droppingly awful","review":"This is excruciating for adults, and disturbing that kids like it. This film managed to be insulting to Asians and gay people, and actually makes a joke about a child's disappearance (in a chilling scene in which the title character is so frightened that he pees in his pants).Fred's high-pitched screaming is more annoying than funny. And his mother walking around in a drunken stupor is sad, not funny.If you are an adult and are forced to sit through this, have some aspirin on-hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be rated PG or PG-13","review":"My children watched this on the TV premier and I was appalled by this movie. It was rated G so I didn't think it would be anything to worry about, I was wrong. I sat down with them to watch then end because I cannot handle all of the screaming so when I was watching the party scene with the puking, spin the bottle, making out, and a lot of other behavior I don't call G-rated I was really mad. I deleted it from the DVR and told all the other parents who I know have kids not to be fooled by the Nickelodeon name. My kids are 6 and 8, this movie isn't designed for that age group, but coming from the Family Guy creator, what could we expect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST film ever made - bar none","review":"Anyone who thought this film was entertaining or amusing should be tied to a chair and forced to watch it non-stop till their eyes bleed. If I could have given it ZERO stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess kids like it, I hated It","review":"This movie is about a kid named Fred who is infatuated with a girl who is his neighbor, and is being bullied by the kid across the street.I don't usually write movie reviews, but this movie was so awful and irritating, I had to write a review. I'm sitting here watching this movie with my kids, and I'm overcome by an urge to smack Fred. Fred has a squeaky, high-pitched voice (which I can only hope is faked), and is constantly screaming and running around with his arms in the air like an six year-old girl. I am now openly rooting for the bully across the street to beat the hell out of him.I'm struggling to find anything funny about this movie. Whoever the target audience is for this movie, clearly I'm not in it. If I had to rank the most annoying movies ever, this would definitely be in my top five."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might kill myself","review":"Save yourself and don't watch this. It is easily the worst thing to buy. I don't even suggest downloading it.

It reminds ofDisaster Movie (Unrated Widescreen)because of the stupidity of the movie. But I liked it. It was funny and just flat out stupid.

If you enjoy Fred, that's fantastic. Get all your friends together and have a Fred/Star Wars Prequels Double Feature night. Just don't expect me to be there."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!!!","review":"My kids (6 year old boy/girl twins and an 8 year old boy) have been begging me to watch the movie. I kept putting it off after seeing some of the YouTube videos. His voice is horrendous, making me want to lock myself in a padded cell. But worse than that are the depictions made throughout the movie. In one video he had his mother's used underwear on his head. Disgusting!! Partying like a frat boy with vomiting and sexual innuendos is not appropriate for young kids. It's not ok for children to see a kid that is obviously emotionally and socially unstable deal with his drug and alcohol addicted mother and a father who's supposedly on death row. WHY??? There is no way I am letting my children see this garbage. There are many other, more positive things I can be doing with my kids besides watching this idiot make a fool of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your children","review":"If any parent is even thinking of buying this for their child please dont. If you love your children this is the one person you need to shelter them from. I would rather let my kids watch all the saw movies before I let them watch friend.

However, I did not factor in just HOW annoying a whole movie would be. This was a regretful parenting permission, even as a streaming download. As soon as I put on the movie I wished I had not given in to the request. Fred's voice can make any adult feel like their head is about to explode, within the first two seconds of hearing it (from any room in the house, no matter how distant!). This movie isn't just bad, it's excruciating. Just say \\"NO\\" to Fred: The Movie, and reclaim 84 minutes of your family's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and Hilarious","review":"As someone who's been in the Hollywood scene for 12 years, I have to say that Lucas Cruikshank is brilliant. This entire movie is based off of his own writing from his Youtube skits. The kid can write, act, and obviously has a passion for making people laugh. Of course this movie is stupid - it's a COMEDY! Aimed at kids and teens! To me, it's brilliantly stupid and I shamelessly watch it at age 31. If you're not able to enjoy something light-hearted and tame your ego enough to enjoy some clean cut comedy, then don't bother. Otherwise, check out this movie and watch some comedy that is actually creative and funny instead of comedy that is just making fun of other people or full of vulgarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, cooks well, some parts flimsy","review":"Assembly without a helper took me 3-4 hours. The box it comes in is big, and cannot be moved without strong help after it is delivered. It looks nice and cooks well. The burner knobs are a little flimsy and one of them does not line up well with the body, such that it is difficult to tell whether the burner has been shut off all the way. It is designed to look a lot sturdier than it actually is. The stainless steel that you see in the picture is just decorative and provides little to no structural support. All of the structural support comes from the thin frame that everything else bolts into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy assembly!","review":"I agree with the other reviews regarding ability of this grill to cook. It does great. I would like to point out that this thing was incredibly easy to assemble. So if you are hesitant to buy this thing because you want to the guy at home depot to build your grill for you ... don't be. It took less than an hour with a screw driver and a socket set (you can use the wrench that it came with, but a socket wrench really saves time).Frankly, this thing was easier to assemble than that piece of crap char-broil that it is replacing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grill, fantastic price","review":"This grill was last year's model and, as such, was sold at a significant discount (over 20% discount). The main difference was that the control knobs on this module were located on the side tray instead of the front of the grill (like the new model). While this utilizes valuable tray space, it is safer because small children can't reach the knobs. The other difference was that the old model has more BTUs...a definite advantage. My last Weber grill lasted nearly 20 years and I expect this one to do the same. Assembly was not difficult. So far, the grill has performed wonderfully. The temperature gauge seems to be accurate and the grill is cooking evenly. So far, I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"No expert griller, but I love this grill!","review":"Putting this grill together gives you a sense of the quality of this product. Ceramic coated metal parts, where other grills would use plastic. All the holes for bolts and screws line up correctly. It took 2-3 hours, but I didn't have any problems.I got a chance to use it last night and it was a joy! It heated up fast! the temperature on the grates is even, no hot and cold spots. The flavorizer bars are designed to create a lot of smoke to add flavor to what you are cooking (use in the open or a well ventilated area).And by the way, Natural Gas is the way to go! We will now be grilling much more often knowing that we won't be depleting some tank (that seem to be less filled now that they prefill and exchange). I look forward to many years of using this grill, and am excited to try a variety of new meats and vegetable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 15 years","review":"I bought this grill to replace another Weber Genesis that lasted 15 years. Hopefully, this will last another 15. I looked at less expensive grills but figured if I have to buy a cheaper grill every few years, why not spend a little more and have it last longer. It wasn't a 10 minute assembly process like other manufacturers claim but it was still easy to assemble and the documentation was clear. Parts are ruggedly made and of high quality. Very pleased; no complaints whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grill","review":"Great product and great service. I was able to assemble and use the Weber within two hours of its arrival. The delivery was prompt and on schedule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Drip Pan","review":"Received the grill and am surprisingly happy with the way it cooks. I was concerned about my ability to move the food around on the grill from hot to colder spots due to the burners running horizontally (left to right)rather than vertically (front to back)but it has not been an issue. I have two issues however. The stainless drip tray is fantastic and is easy to keep clean. We spray it with a non stick spray after each cleaning. The concern is that the edges of the tray are very sharp and WILL CUT YOU. The manufacturer really should do something. The other issue was that the stainless steel by the side burner was covered with white a plastic protector sheet and the sheet was so neat it looked like paint so I left it on the first time I used the side burner and it melted to the stainless steel and made an ugly mess. Never thought I'd complain about such a neat job of applying the plastic but they really should leave a corner folded over for idiots like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This was delivered in good shape and we built it in less than an hour. It cooks evenly and browns food well. By far, the best bbq we've tried. Our last Weber lasted for years so we hope this one will do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best grill I've ever owned!","review":"This is a top-notch grill. I had a propane Weber Genesis before that I converted to natural gas. This one is bigger, warms up faster, cooks evenly and overall great quality grill. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good science done in a place known for hysteria","review":"This video (Loch Ness discovered)presents the excellent science done in order to understand the ecology of Loch Ness. It shows that the lake (and limnology) is fascinating, regardless of whether there's a \\"monster\\" lurking in it. It also indicates that the lake COULD support a group of large, fish-eating creatures. Does it?--The video prudently doesn't go beyond its own good science to try to opine on that. The only sour note: the bogus conclusion of the psychologist, who opines that the \\"revelatory\\" attitude of witnesses makes the experience hallucinatory (the ones who aren't implicated as outright liars). Germans who went to hear Hitler in the 30's often had the same reaction, and it (unfortunately) didn't make HIM a hallucination! Unusual events are not reacted to in blase' fashion; and one feels sorry for the psychologist who needs the \\"real\\" world to be so terribly mundane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective","review":"I used the \\"Everyone rides the carousel\\" video in my high school psychology class and it was very effective. It provides an excellent visual componenet to accompany Erickson's stages of development. While it is a bit outdated the message and impact are still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if You're into Psychology","review":"I am 17 and I took a psych class last year. We watched the intro to this movie and I found it interesting, so I bought it. It is great. There isn't necessarily a plot. Each section shows a real life example of what each of Erikson's stages are like. Great for the classroom or the psychology enthusiast.Also, as an animation buff there were pats of it that were very well done.

The authors' style is inviting and takes all the fears away in an entertaining way and by using examples that just plainly make sense!Even for me, who I have experience in programming, it has been an excellent tool to clarify some of the basic concepts of OOP and other Java principles.I liked it so much, that I even got my cousin a copy of it.Must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure about this one...","review":"I am new to java but not to programming, so maybe this wasn't the book for me. While the style is new and innovative, I eventually got worn down by the constant humor, margin notes, and bizarre analogies. I also found that trying to use this book as a reference was nearly impossible. When the book did have a clear answer to what I was looking for, it was buried in the same quagmire I mentioned above.I suppose that if you are completely new to writing any form of code, this may be the right book for you. I would tend to think, however, that you will quickly grow out of it, and then its use as a reference later will hardly justify the space on your shelf. As an alternative, I would suggest \\"Learning Java\\" 2nd Edition (also published by O'Reilly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Head first? Not so fast....","review":"I buy a lot of techinical books and found this one to be missing the mark both on content and format. There was too much effort on dumbing down the information with pictures while trying to maintain the technical vocabulary of object oriented programming. This strange mixture of geek-bonics and unrelated graphics created a major disconnect between the graphics, text, and example codes.There are other books out there with more information and better formated for learning and for less money.I will be selling this book shortly.Joe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide to learning Java","review":"I really wish more subjects were covered by the \\"Head First\\" series.

It is very effective book and besides it you will have a lot of fun. That is what I usually miss at my work place :-)The book uses a lot of pictures and graphics. At first sight you could think (as I did) that is not worth of it at all ! But the contrary is true and you will learn Java very easily and deeply.

Rather than having pages and pages of dull technical details, the book is filled with exciting graphics, excellent examples with visual aids as well as source code, and, most important, an almost constant stream of questions, quizes, and exercises to help the reader gauge how much of the information he or she is absorbing.The book does more than just explain the technical capabilities of the language. Through various dialogs and examples, the authors lead the readers to discover how to use the language properly using good techniques and avoiding many common pitfalls.In short, although not a reference manual, this book is an excellent introductory book on Java."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mom could learn Java with this book","review":"This is--by far--the most \\"different\\" way of presenting computer programming concepts and a programming language. I have programmed in C/C++ for a long time now, and I used this book to quickly pick up the ins and outs of Java. It is very easy to read, not like a textbook at all.Keep in mind that this book is an introduction. You can learn the basics and use it as a reference for the basics, but if you want to dive into Java you'll need some additional books (and a lot of practice).There are some errors in the book, and some discussions are incomplete (layouts under Swing, for example), but hopefully the recent (2005) edition has corrected these errors and omissions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like book?","review":"This book can and will only appeal to people who are used to the frenetic pace of MTV.

I called Customer Service again, thinking they must have heard about this problem before, but they said that must just be how the unit works, and they denied having had a lot of complaints about it.

Try this combination on your word processor and you will see what I mean. The picture of the product on the Amazon.com website gives you the impression that it has black writing on a white background but this is not the case. In addition, the speaking voice is distorted, unclear, and the volume is too low. I don't see how Franklin could possibly put this product on the market, and especially at a suggested list price of $129.00! I would give this unit zero stars but the lowest you can give is 1 star.

The volume is so low, its very hard to hear. The speaker is about 1/2\\" wide, so to say the sound is bad is an understatement.So, other than the fact that you can't see it or hear it, is it good? Nope. I thought that a device which costs this much could at least translate a sentence. This one can't. Words only.

So it really is only 5 or 6 individual pieces. Also, I didn't find the music to be very graceful. That said, it is nicely detailed.The problem is the outer pieces are attached only by their two legs and very fragile. Upon opening the package, I found the woodsman broken off from the base.I requested a replacement, and one was shipped immediately.

Can You?\\" and other Dr. Seuss books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"This is a short book, but still is one of our son's favorites that he received for his 2nd birthday. He had it memorized in no time at all. Because the pictures are mono-tone, it is a fun book to explore and talk about the shapes. I also like the message that it sends (or at least what I get out of it and elaborate on in my own words) about how people come in all shapes and sizes, and that we should celebrate them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting experiment from Dr. Seuss","review":"In \\"The Shape of Me and Other Stuff,\\" Dr. Seuss experiments with an artistic approach that is very different from that of his best-known work. This book teaches about shapes, and the illustrations consist entirely of silhouettes of various items: people, elephants, boats, keys, etc.The shadow-like illustrations are accompanied by rhymes in the familiar Seussian style: \\"Peanuts and pineapples / noses and grapes. / Everything comes in different shapes.\\" While the book is educational and entertaining, I felt that the silhouettes-only art lacked some of the wacky charm of the full Seussian illustration technique. Nevertheless, I recommend \\"The Shape of Me and Other Stuff\\" as a fun addition to the family or classroom library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shape of Me","review":"Children love Dr.Seuss!

For example, Gulda uses very slow tempos, never recorded before.Except for some peices, P&F can (and to my mind) should be played much slower on piano then what we are used to.Also, Gulda manages true counterpoint and voice separation is perfect.Some people would say Gulda is being ffff especially in fugue expositions but the way he does it makes sense to me.If you need a single example of the greatness of Gulda listen to the P&F in c (Do minor) of WTC II.If you can afford it - buy Gould , Gulda and Tureck and listen to each P&F and compare them.Gulda has put so much musical knowledge, broadness of horizons and inner vision to these pieces that it may take more then one listening session to grasp how monumental his performance can be.This is a desert island CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Charles?","review":"Boo! These Fethering mysteries are way below par. What makes Brett's other work so great is the wit and polish of writing and the great characterization. Neither quality is apparent in this series. The two main characters are shallow stereotypes of the middle-class civil servant and the free spirit who have somehow come together over an interminable glass of white wine. To compare these to a Miss Marple is ludicrous. This one is particularly inane...the deep, dark family secret, the weak nephew, the vicious do-gooder, the ambitious administrator, the self-important bureaucrat, the unprincipled American academic (by the way, Americans do not pronounce \\"God\\" as \\"Gard\\"), the escaped convict and even the handicapped child! Please. Can we have more Charles Paris? Less white wine and more Bell's??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon Brett Fethering mysteries","review":"I really enjoy this series of mysteries by Simon Brett, featuring two very different women who constantly encounter dead bodies as they go about their daily lives! They team up to solve the mysterious deaths. Simon Brett gives a very tongue in cheek satiric presentation of middle class English life, that is for the most part applicable to Americans, as well. His depictions of committees, boards, clubs, etc., and the types of people who populate these organizations, are dead on.The mysteries are interesting, and the character studies even more so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want Charles Paris back!","review":"I have read all the Charles Paris and Mrs. Pargeter books in hardcover. I loved them all and looked forward to the latest series. I find it hard to believe they are written by the same author. The main characters are shallow and, in the case of one, mean spirited and jealous. The other, Jude, is just strange. I find no suspense; maybe because I don't care what happens to these two sad and unfulfilled women. After buying the first couple in hardcover I purchased next in paperback. I don't think I will buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"oregon is bad","review":"i like to drive around with the cd in and pretend i'm driving through the various states when i'm really just trying to drive in unfamiliar parts of my neighborhood that look like they could be states different than the one i'm in.i should note that linnell put on a good show at the troubador, too. i hope he returns soon with more state songs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurd brilliance","review":"Not unlike They Might Be Giants' work generally, John Linnell's State Songs are catchy, silly, often absurd, clever and witty. Not surprisingly, the songs have only marginal connections to their subjects. The best song on the album, \\"South Carolina,\\" for instance, is about a person who gets injured in a bike accident and sues (someone) for money damages. As an attorney, I found this one most humorous -- spot on -- as the bike accident victim has a neighbor take photos of his injuries, describes the police clearing the accident scene, and tells of winning \\"punitive\\" damages in court. \\"Maine\\" has a funny chorus:MaineIs the world that went southMaineIs a punch in the mouthMaine at the top of the chartHas crushed my evil heartMaineIs the devil you knowMaineIs the heaven belowMaineAt the top of the chartHas crushed my evil heartAnd so goes most of the rest of the songs.If you're a fan of TMBG, State Songs is a must for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"state songs","review":"I bought this item for my son for christmas.It arrived on time,but I'mnot sure what condition it was in because my son didn't open it until thenbut the plastic sleave that it came in was damaged.Also the record wouldn't play on his turntable.So it was pretty much a useless gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"really, really, good","review":"if you like John's work in TMBG, get this. you heard me. what's your problem, anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant concept, stunning execution","review":"Linnell creates a purely abstract framework to test his songwriting skills against and hangs one after another perfect pop songs upon it. This is a concept album with a deliberately absurd concept (unless I'm simply missing it). However, there are few songs not to love here. There's the bizarre Arkansas which touches the patriotism and pride gland for a non-existent object. There's South Carolina which actually seems to reflect an actual severe bike wreck that Linnell was involved in. Everything there is to like about TMBG is here in spades, on the surface a good listen. However, the album seems much more impressive upon reflection when you realize that the world is large enough to produce someone to attempt something so bizarre, take it seriously, and succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Album from the best Band ever!","review":"Now as I'm writing this, I notice the lack of words to describe an album as grandiose as this. This is true Progressive Metal, taking innovation onto a new level! Every single song of this epic production will grow on you, every time you'll listen you enjoy this Album even more - and it has been my favorite one for almost 8 months (and I _still_ listen to it). You'll experience that one can actually _understand_ music as a whole if it's composed in this way. The perfect, highly emotional voice of Daniel Gildenlöw brought me near tears in some songs, you can almost grab the tension of this very complex written storyline.But don't think you would be blown away after your first listen - the music is much too deep to be explored in a short amount of time.I recommend this Album to basically everyone (as well as the other 2)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best prog-metal record ?","review":"This record is amazing, dealing with pure prog-metal but with the addition of thrash metal influences (Machine Head, Pantera) in some intonations of the voice. The music is intricate, with lots of rhythm changes and unpredictible moments, fabulous keyboards (sounding like Jordan Rudess at times), and superb guitar. Voices, sung by the extraordinarily gifted Daniel Gildenlow, range from high tones remembering Geoff Tate's singing to low growling (the Machine Head or Pantera influence). The low tones may annoy fans of the prog side of metal who want only clear voices, but they are a sign of Daniel's revolt against those who are responsible for pollution, wars and other blameworthy deeds. Overall, there are no weak songs in this CD, and fans of dynamic prog-metal in the vein of Dream Theater should give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain of Salvation's masterpiece.","review":"While many fans may disagree, I consider this album to be far and away Pain of Salvation's best album. It expanded upon the unique and eclectic stylings of \\"Entropia\\", and made it a bit more melodic and accessible. Not since have they struck such an excellent balance of their strongpoints. Every song on here is amazing, and full of simmering dynamics. It's also very tastefully done, despite the extreme complexity. This is a masterpiece worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as King Crimson's \\"Discipline\\", or Dream Theater's \\"Images and Words\\". However, the band would soon descend into mediocrity following this album's release. \\"The Perfect Element\\" was good, but far from the caliber of this or the debut, and \\"Remedy Lane\\" is basically worthless. For quality progressive music, the older material is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain Of Salvation - Another Dense Conceptual Work","review":"Pain Of Salvations second album is another concept piece by mastermind Daniel Gildenlow. The story is rather complicated so I am not going to go into it in my review, but suffice to say it covers a lot of social and political ground. This is probably the band's heaviest album, and does not contain us much variety in the music as some of their other stuff. This is not a criticism however; as the music here fits the overall feel of the material to a t. Along with the dense lyrics and vocals there are plenty of instrumental fireworks throughout the disc for anyone who enjoys quality prog metal. This is not my favorite POS album, but it is definitely a must own for fans of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say controversial?","review":"This is a very thought provoking book. It will make you question Christianity and its true sources. What's interesting is that this book was written back in 1923 by a Muslim. Most modern authors do not refer to this book or one of his references, \\"Pagan Christs\\" by Robertson. However, there are some discrepancies in the section that compares Buddha to Jesus that are taken from another book. I also have questions about the assertion that Paul was influenced by the writings of Philo. But don't let that stop you from reading this book, its an easy read, unless you take the Bible literally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Scholastic","review":"It's one of the most scholastic literature I have read in a long time. The hard work of this author's research can be felt. It has been written with such dedication and quite simple to relate to at the same time. It's filled with historical information followed by referrence (not the author's opinion) from authoritative sources. I recommended this book to anyone who seek knowledge in obtaining true salvation; anyone who needs to know the true 'SOURCES OF CHRISTIANITY.' There are tons of information for both Muslims and Christians. Especially those who believe that Jesus Christ is a divine being or is still alive in heaven. Well, after reading this book, you will realize that it's not him (Jesus Christ) but the Sun gods from paganism that you believe in."},{"rating":"2","title":"de nuevo blass dura","review":"A merengue classic bachata merengue one of the first.

I've since gone back and found factual errors or a misleading representation inside it. I wouldn't recommend the book, save your money on someone else.Instead, I got \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Islam\\" by Yahiya Emerick, and found him a much more articulate author, who explained it in plain english; something that this \\"For Dummies\\" author didn't do so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intro to Islam","review":"I have been deeply saddened by the ongoing conflict between Christianity and Islam - when I thought we shared so many beliefs.

But I am learning a lot about the beliefs, history and internal structure of Isalm, about the Prophet Muhammad and of the different sects within Islam. (some times too much history of names and dates and who did what to whom believing they were the next in line to lead Islam).Bottom line is that I learned a lot - about Islam, and also about their issues and concerns about Jesus and (separately) about the Christian churches and their beleifs/dogma.

I bought both this book and The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Islam, which is written by a convert to Islam. Reading this book is like reading about evolution from a creationist's point of view or vice versa. The professor who wrote Islam for Dummies is learned, but his learning doesn't ring true. He takes Christian categories and tries to make Islam fit into them. I decided to shred Islam for Dummies rather than re-sell it and give someone else an opportunity to be misled about Islam.

It's a pretty broad brush that might be okay for a short story or for a minor character, but there's nowhere near enough information for a fully-fleshed character in a novel-length work.Personally, I would recommend looking in the Career/Job Search section of your library or bookstore, and at the government's Occupational Outlook Handbook.

Ritchie is also considered one of today's supreme organists playing Bach's works.Years ago, I had some of Walcha's recordings of Bach's organ music on the Archiv label, on LPs of course. Now that this set is available on CD, and not even very expensive, it's a treat to become reacquainted with Bach and Walcha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skewers Noughties Metropolitan Life","review":"Peep Show, now into its 5th series is perfectly pitched to capture the woes of the 20 something generation currently living in London. Mark (safe, conservative, anxious) lives with Jeremy (lazy, self-obsessed, hopelessly naive) in a grotty flat in Croydon (none of the palpably unrealistic 'Friends' style luxury apartments here). Their lives unfold hitting all the touchstones of modern life - the vanity, the junk nature of food and relationships, the self-obsession, the contractual ethos of sexual relationships.The difference between their lives and yours is that theirs is much more tragic, farcical and funny. They don't get any wiser with time - they just plunge hopelessly from one messy enganglement to another, with hillarious results."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never laughed so hard in public...","review":"I came across \\"Peep Show\\" on a Virgin flight from London to Los Angeles. They had all of the episodes from the first series, and I thought I'd watch an episode to see how I liked it. Five minutes in, I was laughing hysterically. I know I was making a fool of myself, as I was laughing uncontrollably at something only on my screen that no one else could hear!The Office (UK) is my favorite TV show of all time, but \\"Peep Show\\" may be catching up...It's just so candid and truthful I can't believe it. I wish they had it here to rent, because I keep recommending it to my friends but no one seems to carry it (i.e. Blockbuster). I had to buy it so that I could let my friends borrow it, and I always have such a hard time getting my copy back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer genius!","review":"This is the kind of show you're either going to get and love, or not and hate (a-la the office). As other reviewers have said, it follows the life of these two sad individual roommates. Yes, there is a fair amount of swearing in the show, but people do tend to swear more in London (where this is set) compared to many places in the USA (in general conversation). It is very quirky and certain parts make you feel uncomfortable for the characters, but again, this is not meant to be a laugh out loud comedy show, the humor is far more subtle.So, if you need a laugh track to help you on your way, don't bother, however if you can appreciate clever, sometimes subtle humor from the U.K, then this might be right up your alley!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this show will have you DYING with laughter....","review":"Im an American and was living in London last fall... I happened upon Peep Show just flipping through my 5 channels, and was instantly hooked... Mark and Jeremy are F-ing HILARIOUS, at least their thoughts are, and this show is so true to life and wacky it will have you in stitches! I only happened to see like 2 and a half episodes, and saw one commercial saying that the first season is coming on DVD, and i cant wait to get it and watch the rest... its so much fun, you gotta see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show I've ever seen","review":"Makes me laugh out loud more than any other.P.S. This is my first review in years and I just noticed how embarrassing my username is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating Characters Make This Unwatchable","review":"Peep Show takes a new angle on the traditional roommate comedy by allowing us to hear the lead characters inner thoughts and feelings, along with the regular dialogue. Jeremy (Robert Webb) is the slacker roommate whose main desires are to have sex as much as possible and become a pop star without actually working at it. Mark (David Mitchell) is a shy and awkward nebbish who works for a faceless corporation. As with most roommates, Jeremy and Mark alternate between liking and hating each other as they encounter the typical sit-com situations - getting a job, getting a date, etc. Hearing their inner thoughts unfortunately wears thin quickly as most of their inner thoughts consist of repeated obscenities. In fact, I believe they break George Carlin's record for the most times saying \\"f***\\" in a cable show. The roommates are so unlikable that they grate on you almost immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time","review":"A couple of friends recommended this and so I checked it out and I'll never listen to their recommendations again. Every other word out of the character's mouths (or minds) is a curse word. I don't mind cursing, but when it's used in place of a joke or funny situation, it's worthless and annoying. Jeremy's character is a part-time musician and full-time jerk who spends his time making terrible music and trying to score. The only funny bit in the whole first show was when Mark and his date listened to Jeremy's music and couldn't stop themselves from laughing. Unfortunately, what could have been a great scene mainly became an exchange of curse words in Jeremy and Mark's minds. If this series had gone for laughs instead of cheap trash talk, it really could have been funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"If you have heard lots of traditional Sephardic music performed on traditional Arabic and/or medieval instruments by early music ensembles, and you like the sound of the oud, frame drum, ney flute and rebec, then you will probably not like this album. Cantor Ramon Tasat has used mainly arrangements of Sephardic music by Alberto Hemsi and other early 20th century musicians. Hemsi was naturally influenced by his European classical music training, and the Italian opera and German lieder which was popular among 'educated' European audiences of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Alberto Hemsi rearranged Sephardic music for piano. This may have made the music more popular among European audiences 1900-1950. However, if you like the 'Arabic' sound of traditional Sephardic music this album will be a jolt."},{"rating":"2","title":"good video","review":"This is a VHS tape and is in good condition.

If there is a weak link in the rest of the cast it can all be overlooked if the Lucia is top notch. There are plenty of Lucia's that ARE top notch... Maria Callas, June Anderson ... BEVERLY SILLS! I mean they are out there. Caballe is just not suited to this role. I love her vioce it just can't hit the notes that Lucia requires. The crowning accomplishment of any Lucia is the mad scene.... I have to ask the question, what happened to it... it is almost have gone, it is cut so she doesn't have to tangle with the difficult and rather high ending. Don't waste your time here move on to Beverly Sills recording with the famous glass harmonica in the mad scene, it will be released by Westminster in March 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Lucia","review":"No one can deny that this or any other disc of Lucia will ever replace the major Callas recordings. Her performance, both vocally and dramatically, has no equal. Nonetheless, this recording is a worthy document, both musicologically and vocally.First of all is its completeness. All the extant Callas recordings are cut, sometimes heavily so. Lucia, to be fully appreciated, must be heard without cuts or embellishments. True, no glass harmonica in the Mad Scene -- only Sills' set includes that marvelously wierd effect. That aside, this edition give's Cameranno's exciting structure its full due.Caballe may not be the most fluid in her coloratura, but she does give the poor mad girl's character poise and exquisite fragility. Above all there can be no arguement about Carreras. This is one of his finest albums.At the budget price, this set can be added as an affordable suppliment to any of the Callas performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"Great book! For the first 20+ pages the reader is not sure what is happening or where it will lead. Stick with it! As with any good roller coaster ride, things get more lively after the top of the first hill. The book is consistently interesting and thrilling throughout. \\"Lost Hunters\\" is a good scary book while managing to be thoughtful at the same time - I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Recording","review":"As far as I'm concerned, this is the definitive recording of Rachmaninov's third concerto. Forget Horowitz 1951, this is BETTER. And it's hardly \\"out of control\\", just so fast and furious, it seems that way sometimes. I'd probably use Ashkenazy or Bronfman to \\"introduce\\" somebody to this work, but when they were ready for the hardcore stuff, I'd give them a taste of Argerich. The third movement in particular is unbelievably well played, with blinding speed and perfect precision. And it's all live. There's simply no better recording out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is at height of her potential-musical, mercurial,Tops","review":"Agree on last customer review that she should stick to DG. However, new disc with Bartok No.3 and Prokofiev's No.1 on EMI will be a hit. Her Rach is the best I've heard to date, the speed, the fingering and her overall command of technique is and will continue being unique and beyond comparison to that of other keyboard artists. The fact that I am Argentine born, has nothing whatsoever to do with my admiration for her. Your previous reviewer made reference to Dutoit. He is not the conductor for the Rach. However, she has now recorded the Bartok and Prokofiev under him with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. All her recordings are always revealing to those of us who have played from childhood. Pity is she never performs in Argentina. And I have not heard her live since 1986, last time she appeared at the Colón Theatre in Buenos Aires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the pinnacle effort of this outstanding work!","review":"The force, the power, the passion, all rolled into one.

A treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rach #3 I've ever heard","review":"Before hearing Argerich's rendition of the Rach #3, I had always agreed with the great pianist Josef Hoffman (to whom Rachmaninoff dedicated this piece). Hoffman never played the Rach #3 because he didn't care for it, claiming that the piece \\"lacked form\\".Argerich clearly understands this piece, and has technique to do it justice. It is now one of my very favorite piano concertos. This is a performance to cherish. But why settle for just the audio feast, when you can get the DVD of this landmark performance through Classical Video Rarities? The visual is as intriguing as the audio. She's the master!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Argerich shine","review":"Ms. Argerich plays two of the standard piano concertos in almost any soloist's repetoire. She does not play them mechanically or with the standard interpretation. With the two conductors and the orchestras she makes a statement in each composition about the music that is an experience that even those who have heard these played by other reknown soloists should not be missed. She touches the emotion and passion that both Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky brought to the music they composed. Purchase these and enjoy the experience of a musical event, beautiful and unforgetable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Argerich!!!!","review":"This recording of Rachmoninoff 3rd by Martha Argerich is simply amazing.. She seems be totally unrestricted and way she phrase is avsolutely mouth watering.... Even though Rach #3 is one of the hardest piece available in the realm of piano literature, Martha Argerich has so much freedom playing this piece because she is a absolute vultuouso. This is the best Rach #3 recording I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music does not get any better","review":"There is no piece of music that can drive me as wild as Rach's 3rd concerto. I can barely contain myself while listening to it -- just thinking of it is giving me goosebumps right now. For me, this recording is the ultimate performance. I don't even care that the sound quality is sometimes muddy, because Argerich's fiery passion more than compensates. Her technique, musicality, control, everything, it's just perfect. This CD is absolutely a must own. Do NOT hesitate to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Argerich 5+, Conductor 3!","review":"I have yet to hear any Chailly recordings that I have liked. They all sound long-winded, lush, and heavy-something whale-like! What he is doing paired with the sparkling, passionate, brilliant Argerich? ...in the Rachmaninov 3rd? It's like champagne and mud. In the 2nd movement, about 's in, there is a scherzo, and Argerich is magnificent in pointing out detail. The orchestra by contrast sounds drugged and ill, the conductor needed to crack a whip or toss a firecracker under their seats and get some sparks flying! Listen to what Ormandy does in this same spot-that orchestra is intensely sensitive and alive. I have no idea or suggestions what anyone can do with a boring conductor-but Argerich managed to turn it all into a definitive recording! If anyone thinks that Argerich was too heavy-handed, let them take Chailly, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"immature interpretation","review":"These are two of my favorite concertos but all I hear on these recordings is a pianist playing too fast and sloppy with no regard to the \\"meaning\\" of the music.

Even if it is not the best recording of the Rach 3 (I suspect it is) it is still an absolutely must-hear performance.The only problem is that this disc uses copy protection. If you wish to rip this to your hard drive (for legal purposes, of course) you simply may not be able to.

It was aggravating after a while.

That a novel of such length takes place in the course of just slightly over one year -- while never bogging down -- is amazing. I have always been fascinated by India's diverse cultures, and enjoyed delving into the era Seth writes about. A glossary would be helpful for those not as familiar with various cultural terms...The funeral scene of Mrs. M.K. was one of the most poignant pieces I've ever read, and it has stayed with me.

Thank you, Vikram Seth, for this awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art and utterly enjoyable","review":"This is a very long book for sure and some have criticized Vikram Seth for having the audacity to take over 1,400 pages to write what in a nutshell is a long Indian soap opera. A soap opera it is, a glorious, vivid, fast paced, juicy one with exciting plots and dramas. I found it very interesting to immerse myself in a slice of post-colonial India, and the book to me was a sheer joy to read. I actually cannot remember when I last read a book that I enjoyed reading so much. I am utterly impressed at Seth's genius in intertwining,then taking apart, and then intertwining again, and again, the multiple stories, characters and plots in this great Indian saga. I gave it five stars because it is to me a work of art, a genius to write a book of this length where you can captivate a reader continuously, and utterly enjoyable. Definitely Vikram Seth's greatest debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book until 4 am every night until I finished it.","review":"Beautiful prose.

I come from a very different culture, South American so I really enjoyed learing and being exposed to a different culture. Very well written, you could smell the cooking and hear the music as you read along the pages that go by very fast. And for me to say fast, is rare due to a learing desability. He has described the family life and values; ceremonies; religion, in a way that is easy for those that are not from India to understand.

I constantly find that sort of thing in translations, for some reason, but I presume that Seth wrote this book in English, so I'm at a loss as to why he would commit such blatant errors. I've read a few of his other books, namely \\"From Heaven Lake\\" and \\"The Golden Gate\\", both of which I loved; however, it's been many years since I read them and I honestly don't remember if he made such errors in those books.

However, Vikram Seth fails miserably! I have had to force my self to finish the book, turning each page with the anticipation the next chapter would be more interesting and not so boring. I was gravely disappointed. Seth penned pages and pages of useless details; for example, Seth describes in lengthy detail a meeting between Amit Chaudry and a Spanish diplomat. However, fails draw the reader into the lives of the flat characters he has created- I could not tell you a single defining characteristic of Amit Chaudry. Seth focuses on four different families, without telling the reader any thing about them. Any interesting plot twist or scandal is buried under unnecessary detail. I would rather visit the dentist than read another novel by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there something wrong with me?","review":"There obviously has to be something terribly wrong with me in the face of all the rave reviews-I simply found this to be the most boring,tedious book I've ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to get into, but worth it once you do","review":"As was the experience of an earlier reviewer, the first time I tried to read this book, I had a lot of difficulty getting into it and eventually gave up. A tropical island holiday last year gave me the opportunity to try again, and I'm glad I did.Its an Indian novel, so it has been compared it to Arundhati Roy's 'The God of Small Things', which does neither justice. I feel this book is far wider in scope, painting a richer picture of the external world inhabited by the central characters. They share beautiful use of Indian English - in some ways quaint, but powerfully expressive.It is slow to get started, perhaps the sheer size is forbidding, and drags out for a while during the chapters discussing the civil disturbances. Once you're into it, caught up in the decisions faced by Lata, getting to know her family, it becomes hard to put down.Make the effort, it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its in the characters not the country","review":"While its' enjoyable to understand India through this book the real beauty of the book lies in Seth's development of the characters and how by the end of the book you think you feel like you just want to know more and more about them. Its similar in that way to Arundati Roy. Its' the characters rather than the Indian background that make both books excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this novel a great book or only a great read?","review":"I am not qualified to judge, but bring on the sequel. That such a long and (physicallly) heavy book could be so delightful and charming , so light in its execution makes you feel it can't be serious literature. Time will tell.

As it is a culture that I am not familiar with, it was difficult, at times to grasp the continuity of the plot and subplots. However, this did not stop me from being drawn into the storylines, eagerly reading one page so that I could turn to the other. It is a rich, rich, rich book that requires a comfy chair and a cup of tea to devote yourself to it. Some things were left unresolved but the purpose of the book is not to tell you about these characters start to finish. Things go unresolved, that's life. I was heartbroken at the ending but again, that's life. Ideally, for me, it would have gone the other way but that would have been me imposing my life and times onto a different era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compulsive reading","review":"Many reviewers here evidently know much more about India than I do. I did not in fact approach this book as about India but about people who happen to live in India. Indeed, the manner in which a match was to be found for the girl (i.e., a suitable boy) reminded me of stories I heard about matchmakers in Jewish tradition and I guess some of it might remind one of Jane Austen. Anyway, I found that I simply could not put this long book down - it devoured several days of my life but very pleasantly (at least until the end, which like many others, I disliked - actually, I hated it, which is why I took a star away). I only wish I could find more books like it with characters I found believable and, in many cases, congenial.

I have read it 3 times in the past three years and am always sorry to come to the end, in spite of a length (1400 pages) that would be daunting in another book. Seth is one of the best writers in the English language today, with a style reminiscent of Jane Austen, although he tackles rather more complex political and social issues than Austen. This book is not only the best book about India that I have seen, but it is one of the best books I have ever read--it's certainly a modern \\"classic\\". I stocked up on several copies--it makes a wonderful gift for my favorite people. Needless to say, I'm waiting rather impatiently for Vikram Seth's next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a suitable boy-what i think by holly o'farrell","review":"i thought a suitable boy by vikrem seth was a bit ramboling. it took me a while to get into it and even then my concentration wavered. i had been recomended to read the book by my mothers friend who thought it was wonderful. i however found it less than interesting. don't think \\"oh she's only young she doesn't understand what it is about , the deeper meaning\\" i am an avid reader and although i don't want to sound big headed i have read hundreds of books that are mainly written for adults. i may not have particuarly enjoyed some of them but at least i could say that it held my attention whereas 'a suitable boy' couldn't even grab it for a full 5 minutes. it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"I am sorry but after reading all those praises about this book i could not resist.

There are so many interesting characters that at the end of the book you would wish you knew more about many of them. Any reader will fall in love with the characters of this book. The book also presents a good and authentic picture of India and its culture.

I enjoy the way he can harp about any topic to excruciating detail and manage to keep up the attention of the reader..In particular, i liked the characters of Rupa mehra and Lata and found it possible to empathize with them. Also the Chatterji family was a pleasure to be with.. In short, this book has filled me with enough interest to read the other books written by Seth."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITEM NOT RECEIVED","review":"I CANCELLED ONE OF THE TWO COPIES OF THE CD.

I was sorely dissapointed. McNair sounds exhausted. Not ragged or raw, but tired, completely lacking in energy. On many of the tracks she is barely audible. And if there's any acting going on here, it's not readily apparent.

It must be a God send.Sylvia sure knows how to sing a love song. Her style is such a relaxed style. She sings with very little effort or so it seems. Her voice is not an over powering voice, but one that will make you think of love and romance. I do wish there were some more of this type of cds with Sylvia's beautiful voice.The only concern I have for this cd was the repertoire. It could have been better.

Purchased at a boutique baby store in Dallas - at a premium price. All was fine until we started using it. The cup holder fell off immediately - and could not be reattached. The name plates peeled off the front - within reach of our 11 month old (she immediately peeled it off to try to eat). The straps will not stay attached to the seat. Each time we use, we must re-loop them in to the seat back. Moreover, it is hit or miss as to whether it will easily close or open. There are times when it will not close and we have to stow it half closed. Other times we cannot get it opened - usually when we are in a hurry. When it does open - it opens easily; however it is most often a struggle. Our $20 (single) stroller from Babies 'R Us is much more reliable.

First off the speakers are simple to connect. You simply plug a cable into the subwoofer, one plugs into the computer, and of course it needs to be plugged into a power outlet. The power button, volume knob, and headphone jack are on the front of the right speaker and are easy to access. The knob for the bass is on the back of the subwoofer, which can be annoying if you need to adjust the bass. The sound quality is excellent for the price. The bass from the subwoofer sounds great and packs quite a punch! I had the bass settings on my computer turned way up from my last speakers, but had to turn it down because of the strong bass of the x-230. Overall, these are great speakers for the money. I never thought of Logitech as being a company for audio equipment, but that was money well spent on a great set of speakers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Craft Project!","review":"We got this for my niece who loves crafts and she really enjoyed it.

But do not, under any circumstances, buy this book. It is one of the worst scholarly works I've ever had the displeasure of reading. The author's prose is tortous, pedantic, and often laughable thanks to his absurdly bad metaphors.

The series starts off well, but quickly goes downhill and eventually becomes pure torture to watch. The fifth hour, \\"Birth of the Special Forces\\" consists entirely of interviews with veterans (which is OK) but uses the same 30 second soundtrack looping over and over for the entire hour! I gritted it out to the end but was left with the feeling that I had been listening to DVD \\"intro music\\" over and over and it couldn't be turned off. To turn the sound off would have made the speakers inaudible.

My favorites are 'Chopin and Champagne' and 'Tschaikovsky at Teatime' and the prices are a steal for quality, timeless music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Jazz Find...","review":"The title track of the album (Little Jazz Bird) is a very very obscure Gerswhin song. It really swings after a slow verse introduction and then you wonder how come it is so obscure. Other tracks are a mixture of ballads and medium up tempo. The string quartet is used tastefully and appears on a few tracks it adds to the overall depth of sound. Ocasionally, there is an alto or clarinet that gets in the way. This is a good introduction if you've never heard any Meredith before. (I wish she'd come to the UK more often!) The great thing about this album is that it is quiet and understated. It is not \\"in your face\\" jazz. It has lots of gently reflective songs but the humour shines through from time to time. Best tracks : title track, There's a Lull in my life, Cliches, Songbird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photographer NOT Cinematographer","review":"Unfortunately, the creator of this DVD had \\"fade\\"-itis!

Mr. Jacobson sounds like a salesman for outdoor equipment companies throughout the whole book. I have been camping for over 30 years and he didn't tell me anything helpful that I didn't learn to do, or not do, after my first camping trip. Many of his ideas and suggestions are well into the ridiculous range. Anybody that followed what he says in his book word for word would spend a lot of money on unnecessary expensive equipment camping equipment and most probably have the worst time of their life camping. He thus would turn a happy camper into a person that would never camp again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Guide for the Boundary Waters","review":"An excellent book that touches on all aspects of canoe camping in the boundary waters. The author interjects humor throughout as he provides the reader with excellent advice. The book is filled with wonderful illustrations that show you exactly how or what to do, which text alone could not provide. The book also has great appendixes that provide checklists, equipment suppliers, a map index, and even a copy of a permit! Overall, I feel if you buy only one book for the Boundary Waters, this should be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great prepay service","review":"I've been using EasySpeak T-Mobile cards since I bought my phone, almost a year ago. I don't use my phone often enough to justify the expense of a monthly plan, although I do use it several times a week. I buy a new card about once a month or so. The service is great; I've never had a dropped call or even a static-y connection. They have a Rewards plan, too, in which, after you buy a certain number of cards, you get discounts on future cards. I'm quite happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate.....but barely","review":"If T-Mobile can afford to have the lovely & talented Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas be their spokesbabe, you'd think they could afford to widen their service coverage area. You cannot roam using one of these pre-paid babies, subsequently if you are only slightly off the beaten track, you are S.O.L.Here's my example: Driving down 101 from Oregon, there was NO service for over 400 miles, until Santa Rosa, Ca., & driving up I-5 no service for 200+ miles south of Ashland, Or. Not being accustomed to service as poor as this, I called support, and after being given a run-around to the max, the \\"bimbette\\" explained I had \\"Nation-wide service\\", but only in T-mobile's immediate cell areas. Their coverage map shows they only have coverage in tiny areas of North America, chiefly top-50 Metro areas. BTW, when I crossed the border into Canada, there was NO service at all. Don't bother with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best prepaid program for casual users","review":"This is definitely the best prepaid program for casual users. I wanted a plan that did not require me to constantly \\"top up\\" to maintain the minutes and nothing else came close to the 1-year arrangement from T-mobile (offered in December and again in the spring). It's easy to get confused by price per minute comparisons and such but for someone who only wants availability for occasional or emergency use, this is really the best plan.We are using it in a major metropolitan area and have never had any problems with signal quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virgin is many times better","review":"I see absolutely no reason to pick t-mobile as your prepay service provider. Virgin Mobile has a much, much better plan. It has better coverage to boot (using Sprint's national network). Long distance is always included with Virgin. No charge for leaving voicemail or checking voicemail from another phone. Lower per-minute rates (esp. after 10 minutes per day), and includes long distance. And you don't need to recharge for 90 days, plus you get 60-day grace.T-mobile is much worse so I recommend you go with Virgin Mobile if you want pay-as-you-go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good program, but...","review":"This should be a good solution for those in my family who need phone access but would use very few monthly minutes -- but the minutes expire in unreasonably short periods. If I top up a card for $25 or $50 why should the minutes ever expire?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expiry is stupid","review":"I'm with the last reviewer, what a shock to discover my minutes expire only a month after charging the phone.

She does not need a lot of minutes and it is a way to break her into the wireless world. If she has too many minutes then she will be on the phone constantly. Her last card of $... lasted her about one month and if I needed to contact her at school, at the basketball game I can. Not great for long term due to expiring minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm really confused","review":"On the refill card, it says expire in 30 days. But on T-mobile website, it says \\"unused minutes are valid for 90 days, except with the $10 card\\". Which one is correct? Too confusing.Also I don't think long distance cost more than local calls.

As mentioned earlier, Mary Tudor is described as having \\"raven\\" hair, Katharine of Aragon is called the \\"Duchess\\", not \\"Dowager Princess\\" of Wales, and Jane Parker is known as Jane Rochford in her maidenhood, when she did not acquire that title until much later and then only through her husband. I also thought having Mary become Francois's mistress before she married and became Henry's was a bit too much. Mary is not as likable as in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\". On the whole, I would recommend this book to readers who have already read that title and would like to compare the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Boleyn","review":"I read this book years ago and loaned it out to several friends but did not get it back. I enjoyed it then and it is as good on this second read as it was the first time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise although as stated before there were a few historical discrepancies (not enough to annoy me personally, but enough to notice). I thought the interpersonal relationships she had with all the royals made the characters seem more real and fulfilled my visions of what they should be. I preferred this portrayal of Anne better than Gergorys' The Other Boleyn Girl which made her seem evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Boleyn","review":"This book was an enjoyable addition to the growing list of books on this topic. It explored the life and times of the Tudors with a decided slant on today's attitudes about the place of women in society. The totally unscrupulous and uncaring ambitions of Sir Thomas Boleyn seems to be the underlying cause of the reformation and it totally credible, based on historical fact. The fact that the reader was treated to a most satisfying exposure of this, however fictional the conversations may have been, added to the enjoyment of the book as well as giving a deeper understanding of how fragile life was in those times. The power of some individuals over others in those times makes us thankful today that this is no longer the way of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good...","review":"I just didn't think this was a very well written or well researched book. There were several errors (you would think they could have fixed them in the reprint) such as calling Katherine of Aragon the Duchess of Wales (she was the Dowager Princess of Wales after her \\"divorce\\".) There were also several instances of historical inaccuracy. I realize that a writer of historical fiction must embroider the bare facts to bring the story to life, but you would think that with some basic research the author could have figured out which prominant people were at court over the period of time she was writing about. Case in point, Anne Bassett was not at court until the reign of Jane Seymour, 3rd wife of Henry VIII, yet she is portrayed prominantly in several scenes with Mary and Anne Boleyn."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This is a wonderful book I really enjoyed reading it and I recommend it to anyone who loves Anne Boleyn.

When I first heard this record in 1968 I was as much taken by Nyro's voice as I was by the energy and thoughtfulness of her lyrics. From the most well known songs such as \\"Sweet Blindness\\", \\"Stoned Soul Picnic\\", and the song she used to close her shows with, \\"Emmie\\" to those seldom heard such as \\"Poverty Train\\" and \\"The Confession\\". She remains both a master composer and unfortunately, an often overlooked musical genius.This disc holds the same power it did as when it was originally released over 30 years ago. Laura is no longer with us but she has left this as well as a very rick musical catalogue. The only thing missing from this collection is the perfume that was used in the original album packaging.Buy it! Listen to it........over and over and over. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ambiguity of Genius","review":"Laura Nyro was a gifted song writer and I loved the sound of her voice. If she was guilty of suicidal screeching, as has been suggested by some, what does that say about every other over paid rock diva? But honestly, this album has always left me a bit chilled. The landscape is bleak. There is a good groove going on Lucky, I never understood 'Dig those potatoes.' I wish I could have been there to talk her out of that line. Timer has wonderful potential, but oh that introduction. The recording of Sweet Blindness, endearing song, is a mess. There are under-appreciated gems here, December's Boudoir and The Confession. Don't dismiss this album out of hand, no artist could make a more penetrating statement about urban life. Some say it took them years to \\"Get\\" Laura Nyro. She grabbed me on my first hearing as a young teen-ager and never let go. If there is a more gifted singer-song writer out there, I don't know who it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Brilliant","review":"I still remember the first time I heard Laura Nyro. I was an alienated teenager in the 1960s, and her music- like nothing I'd heard before- just grabbed me, even though it was nothing I'd ever heard before. This was straight-from-the-heart gospel that spoke to me.I own all her CD (and the LPs before that, too) but these new remastered CDs add a dimension to the sound- particularly on the quietr, more intimate pieces like \\"Lonely Women\\".

Now in 2003 and alot older her album is still awesome. For many years I thought Laura was the struggling young woman in NYC, coping with all of life's horrors (and great joys) yet I know now she was a very gifted girl (attended School of Performing Arts?) and lived a comfortable lifestyle. Well, at first a little betrayed, yet any contradictory feeling for Laura goes as soon as I listen to the outstanding music she created. If you've heard the versions of her music that Three Dog Night, Barbra Streisand and the Fifth Dimension performed, do yourself a much needed favor and listen to her originals.

The handsets also have excellent battery life.Some other nice features: the LCD combined with memory is a visual dialing directory; you can use speakerphone on the cordless handset (this is useful if you're put on hold by customer service) ; a MUTE feature; intercom feature between the handsets.My only concern is the volume control, which doesn't have a large range.

The powerpack for the main unit is rather large and is grey, not white, like the rest of the phone.I don't like the way the wall-mounting of the main unit requires the handset to \\"click\\"-in instead of hang: The plastic piece that holds the phone could easily break.

Just goes to show you that the subject matter of possession if very difficult to present in a convincing fashion, and \\"The Possessed\\" is cinematic evidence of just that truth. In short, this movie is a snoozfest."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not order from oldies.com","review":"i ordered this movie from oldies.com in june.they sent me the wrong disc in the right case. i called them and let them know, and they sent me a new one. this time it was the wrong disc in the wrong case. i had to send it back four times. and i still don't have the movie. they told me to just give. they were very rude, and did not appoligize once. save yourself time and money. do not buy from oldies.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice Adidas 1.1","review":"The show is comforting, stylish and accommodating all day, feet nor legs were not tired after very long day.

My favs are 1-5, 8, 10 and 11. McKnight puts me in a mellow mood with most of these but he will get you with #3. That may become someone's theme song. Check his album out. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING.............","review":"Ok for all of you R&B love song people ( i am one if them)I know u all of u look for the words. All the slow \\"love songs\\" are written by the man himself, there are also some uptempos ongs he had some help on. One thing youll hear on this CD is the meaningful words, but the chords, vocals, instruments, EVRYTHING. It will capture your mind, when u hear Brians Vocals on \\"6,8,12\\" u know that it cant get any better, then you hear the breakdown on \\"Shall We Begin\\" smooth....as silk. But dont leave out the 5 uptempo songs where it can get no better, in my opion way better than \\"You should be Mine\\". Overall this album is much better than his \\"Anytime\\" album which had a bit more hip-hop/pop sound to it. The only reson it does get only 4 stars is becuse i dont know what Mr. McKnight will deliver next...can it get better? Im just not sure - Ray Roa"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"This is Brian Mcknight's best work since his 95' release,I Remember You. The LP really expresses his song writing talent with such songs as \\"Home\\" and \\"Back At One\\". His mellow and almost haunting voice makes such an impact that the songs that are not so good seem not so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice effort by Mr. McKnight!","review":"This is my first Brian McKnight album...and it is really great! I enjoy his mix of pop/soul/r&b very well. My fav songs on the album are the singles \\"Back At One\\" and \\"6, 8, 12\\" along with the non-released \\"Stay Or Let It Go\\", \\"Can You Read My Mind\\", \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Home\\" which closes the album. His songs really touch you to the heart and they're nice to relax to. This is one of the few albums today that both me and MY PARENTS enjoy listening to. I think the reason is that he uses his Soul and Soft R&B in a way that can mix with today's popular music. Whatever it is, he does a good job and I can't wait to get his next album! Way to go Brian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Brian Again","review":"Brian Mcknight gives the best, nice ballads, stong vocals, cuasi-perfect writing. And he still can't offer all that is not on his artistic hands: Best studio production ( better as days go by, very good on SUPERHERO)& of course one last thing: promotion. Those who knows his music dont need it, but let's be real, he deserves it more than others. Powerful and thankful melodies, he got something to say on it's lyrics, and he say them, but I personally miss stronger message, anyway, he gives it on live performanes ( I still don't know how he does it). A SJam genious, reminds me Stevie sometimes, nice falsetto and smooth mid range tenor, easy to hear, easy to enjoy, dont miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S NOT A GAME","review":"I have over a thousands cd's and most of them are good. Brian Mchknight's Back At One, in my opinion, is one the top five albums of the nineties.

GOD BLESS"},{"rating":"2","title":"OOOOH LA LA!!!!!","review":"Brian McKnight is by far my favorite R&B Artist. He is the master of love ballads and he's not bad when it comes to upbeat songs either. I have all of his releases and this one gets top marks right along with the others. I love this man and his music! If you're a lover of ballads, then check out \\"Back At One\\", \\"6,8,12\\" and \\"Cherish\\". For a smoother side of regular hip-hop, there's \\"Last Dance\\", \\"Played Yourself\\" and \\"You Could Be The One\\". What can I say? It's all good! It's Brian at his best. Can't wait 'til the next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of McKnight's work.","review":"Review,by Eleftherios Xixis.Finally, Brian McKnight's best. \\"Anytime\\" was OK, but a lot people know about \\"Anytime\\" sounding like that other song by D'Ngelo something. There are so many good cuts in this album.(The best in order). 1.Back at One2.Home3.6,8,124.Stay or let it go5.Last Dance. A lot of the reviewers have totally ignored the last cut. \\"Home\\" is so beautiful, and inspiring, and yep, it made me shed a tear. \\"Back at One\\"is my favorite song here,because the background and McKnight's voice make it a masterpiece.Perfect marriage song, and it's me and my girlfriends song,too.U have to buy it.Brian McKnight is reallyyyy underrated. Isn't it true?Think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian McKnight, the master of R&B!","review":"I have always been a fan of Brian McKnight. His soulful ballads are all that. Brian has always had a great musical career and Back At One is a quantum leap forward in his career. The title track is my favorite on the CD; Brian's voice puts depth to an otherwise bland melody, and it works! My other favorites are \\"Cherish,\\" \\"Shall We Begin\\" and \\"Stay or Let Go.\\" This is not his best work; he hasn't outdone I Remember You, his second CD. But if you want to listen to a true R&B vocalist, listen to Brian McKnight's Back At One.

Yeah, waaaay better than Backstreet Five or whatever. His vocals are so sensitive and soulful. My personal faves are Back at One, Played Yourself, 6, 8, 12 and Cherish. Gothic is just him humming but it's a little weird but I don't give five stars to just any CD. They have to be really good. The R&B thing is really in now. I hadn't heard of Brian until his duet with Mariah on her #1's CD and he was gorgeous. Then Back at One became my favorite song and I fell in love. This is a must-have in any music lover's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babyface lite or R.Kelly lite?","review":"Brian Mcknight has talent but this disc doesn't reflect his own idenity.the material sounds too much like 2nd tier Babyface&R.Kelly.personally i don't think that he is as talented as those guys.his first album is still his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back at One","review":"Ilove the main song on there which is back at one i dedicated this song to my boyfriend Stuart i love him to death and the way he describes the chorus is the exact same way I feel about stuart.

If you've listened to his first two CD's you too would understand. This CD lacks the true creative talents that he embodies. The title song \\"Back At One\\", \\"6,8,12\\", and \\"Cherish\\" are so similar I thought he had Timberland doing the tracks (listen to Ginuwine's CD's). But, I guess nowadays that's main stream pop music for you. On the bright side, \\"Home\\" has to be the best song on the CD which is as close to vintage Brian McKnight as you will get. But let's not forget, I'm just a music lover. What do I possibly know about quality music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian McKnight has outdone himself!","review":"Just when you think he can't do any better, then comes 'Back At One'.

However, McKnight attempts to copy the brilliance of \\"When Chariots Come\\" from anytime with his \\"Gothic Interlude\\" on this CD, and it is not impressive.Overall, the strong songs outweigh the not so good songs, and if you go by the \\"4 good song\\" rule for a CD, this one has 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Have To Buy BACK AT ONE","review":"I first heard the single \\"Back At One\\" on the radio and fell in love with it.

Alas, they remain unrealized. I was hoping to have a way to listen to my MP3's on my laptop while on the road/in the hotel. My laptop speakers still do a better job than the soundbug. The best sound was gained from placing it on a large wall mirror. The bass in particular is lacking, and at louder volume levels there is signifigant distortion.

The most frequent response when trying to determine the meaning of a German, Austrian or Czech word or expression was. \\"Sorry, can't help.\\" The list of English phrases to be translated into one of the other languages took too long to sort through to be of any practical value.

Unfortunately, this device is utterly useless as a translator from a language which generally does not classify nouns by gender (e.g. English) to one that does (e.g. French).The gender is of course, part of the noun. The TG-450 gives only a partial translation ie no gender. The implications should be obvious to any student of language.I find it amazing that a supposedly reputable company like Franklin should market a product with such a glaring deficiency.For non-English speakers it might be slightly more useful, but not much. For example, many French nouns are dual gender. Maybe the TG-450 can differentiate between \`le cave' - meaning \`idiot' and \`la cave' - meaning \`basement'. I didn't keep my long enough to find out. The fact is, it is not a translator but an overpriced and useless gimmick. Buy a pocket dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to do it.","review":"Hard to use. Does not show gender in French!!! Has outdated features and lacks customization in several areas where it is needed. Feels and looks like something that has been re-cycled from a previous translator.I need it for the odd word in Italian - if there were any other choice I would not use it. If it were more expensive I would send it back.Took it with me to Italy. Useless! Langenscheidt's small dictionary does a much better job at 1/3 the price!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Translator makes it difficult","review":"The Franklin TG-450 Translator is difficult to use and would be impractical in situations travelers get into. There is no way to get the proper translation for common questions - e.g. where is the railroad station?

She writes basic romance novels. You know what you are getting when you buy one.But I am starting to think that she is using the same file on her pc over and over, just changing the names and places around to make it a little different.The basic story line is young girl meets older man. Older man is attracted to younger girl, is angry about it and is verbally abusive to her to fight the attraction, but at the same time protective. A marriage of convienence ensues. Passion overcomes and pregnancy results after only one encounter. Final conflict then happily ever after.That would be alright if there was some originality included. I felt as if I had read the book before. I also felt a little lost. There seemed to be sentences that go no where. Like the start of a new direction that is just left hanging, or could it have been a line left from the last novel forgotten and not deleted?Not her best effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Winter Soldier","review":"This is a typical Diana Palmer read,Lisa the couragous and struggling widow and Cy an ex soldier for hire. Lisa need protection and help with the death of her husband by a ruthless drug lord and Cy is seeking revenge on the drug lord she needs protection from. Lisa is sweet and naive and Cy has seen to much of a bad world. The chemistry beteewn Cy and lisa is great, these too are well matched. As with all Diana Palmer heroine Lisa is a little too naive, she is the last to realized she is not pregnant by her dead husband, even though she has none of the symptoms of being pregnant. I could not understand why she was not seing a doctor after she was diagnosed incorrectly? Most pregnant women have regular schedule with their doctors.While I had some issue with the way Lisa pregnancy was written, Diana Palmer never disapoint, she manage to give us a good romance with mystery and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best stories","review":"Always intrigued by Cy and this story completes his story.

I love music sung in Spanish but this blows away everything else. I am a fan of two of the bands mentioned, Los Fabulosos Cadilacs and Ozomatli but they can't compare to album Sergent Garcia has put together. I was immediately impressed by how good the musicians were. This is album is not cheesy or <cursi> like many latin american albums are. The first thing I noticed was the excellent piano work. Yet every instrument works together perfectly. This album is tight. Whats more I love the vocalists as well. La Capitana (track 4) has an intriguing voice. Sergent Garcia has a good voice as well and I was very impressed with his lyrical ability. For a non-native speaker to sing so quickly is very impressive. I would recomend especially tracks 2,4,5,and 8. Check this album out. If you like Latin music at all you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un Poquito Quema'o","review":"Awesome!

Lässig eilt er durch die Gassen, protzt im weissen Anzug und schwingt in den Händen einen Blumenstrauss. Auf der Suche nach dem Abenteuer, ungezwungen charmant und zwanghaft untreu. Dabei geht er mühelos als Sieger aus der Musik-Balz des Sommers '99 hervor. \\"Un Poco Quema'o\\" ist das schönste Album des Jahres. Mit verspielten Salsa-Pianos, melancholischen Melodien und coolen Ragga-Muffins wickelt der Sergent - übrigens ein ehemaliges Mitglied Mano Negras - die Hörer um die Finger und zieht sie mit in einen Taumel rastloser Lebenslust. \\"Un Poco Quema'o\\" ist ein Erntedank-Fest der Liebe."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best science videos","review":"I just bought my second copy of this video. It has excellent photography and clear descriptions of charge buildup and the manner in which clouds discharge to the ground or across the sky, but what sets it apart from other lightning videos are its descriptions of the medical effects of lightning from people who survived being struck and a doctor who specializes in the effects of lightning strikes, and its lightning photographer, Gunner, who became a cult favorite of a group of my high-school students. The NOVA lightning video has Lee Trevino and the St. Albans High-School tragedy, but this video has Gunner, with his laconic explanation of how he detects lightning strikes: \\"the lightning detector just gives us an idea of how far away the bolts are ... you can also look and see,\\" and other comments and enthusiasms about his job.

I like the fact that if I am online, I can still ring downstairs and ask my Mom questions, as we only have one line. The walkie talkie feature is what sold me and it is very clear. These phones are so clear you can't tell if someone picks up the other phone and listens in on your converstaion.Also people don't know when they have been put on speakerphone.

I bought it because I liked the built in answering machine and the additional cordless phone unit, but it's given me nothing but problems. This surprised me because I had good luck in the past with Panasonic phones. The battery life is non-existent. It'll be fully charged and a 15 minute phone call would drain the battery completely making the phone useless. At first I thought I got a bad phone, so I took it back and got another one, the exact same model. Well I had the exact same problem!

Calls are dropped randomly, without apparent reason (although this most often occurs when a second call comes in and the call-waiting signal is received). Handsets randomly complain that they are \\"too far from base\\" and will not turn on--even placing the handset directly on the base won't fix the problem (it just seems to start working again after a few minutes). I have missed many calls just trying to get a fully-charged handset to pick up when the \\"Talk\\" button is pressed.Battery life is terrible, charge time is lengthy.Another annoyance--when the answering machine picks up, the handsets' displays change to read \\"Line in Use\\".

If you have shied away from histories of Vietnam as you are not interested in military history, I would highly recommend this work. This book is a social, rather than a military, history. Tracing the history of Vietnam from the era of the mandarins, through the French colonialization, through the communist insurgency, to the fall of Saigon and beyond, the author writes a history of her own family and in so doing, beautifully and subtly details the complexities and nuances of the origins of the Vietnam conflict and America's participation therein. The author's use of spare and straightforward prose enables the reader to look beyond the sheer horror of the war and its aftermath and reach a level of understanding as to how this tragic conflict could have occured."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This is a great story of Vietnam and its evolution as a state.

As a person with a strong interest in Vietnamese history, I found this to be a very valuable perspective-a look at how Vietnamese people and Vietnamese lives changed during the course of the 20th century. This is a unique approach to history, examining how historical forces changed and shaped individual lives and families as opposed to entire nations and societies. This book has given me a much better feel for Vietnamese history and culture, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who shares my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents: give this book to your children","review":"I bought this book for my 14-year-old daughter and wish I had gotten it two years sooner.

I decided on these based on the small size and great reviews. I can throw these in my backpack and they're so light I probably won't even know that they're there. They feel well made. The attached cord seems a bit thin, but that isn't anything I really care about.I was surprised at how inexpensive these are, yet the quality appears to be excellent.

When it showed up, I was pleased with the appearance and size. When I unwound the cord from the binoculars, the bottom piece that surrounds the center fell out. So I didn't even try them. I got back on the internet and ordered a replacement, which I will say Amazon shipped to me overnight. The bad news is that the 2nd pair had the same problem. I gave up on cheap Chinese made binoculars and ordered Tasco (yes by Bushnell) for about $5 more. They haven't shown up yet, but I can't believe that they would be any worse. If you're looking for a small cheap pair of binoculars I definitely would recommend that you look at something else. Hopefully the Tasco Essentials 8x21 Binocular (Black)is better. My guess is that they are also made in China, but for a seven year old you don't have much choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy em, you'll love em!","review":"Bought three of these for an umcoming Terry Fator show in LV.

Had a pair years back, gave them away. My wife was given a Bushnell monocular with the same optics. I know it's unfair to compare these to 8x20 Leica Trinovids, and many are apparently satisfied, but if you're used to good optics these are just frustrating - only marginally better than nothing. Plus the focussing problems others mentioned.There are other alternatives at a low price - admittedly a bit more than $15 for anything decent. It's pretty much impossible to make acceptable roof prism binos (like these) at less than several hundred dollars for technical reasons I won't go into here, but you can get good compact porro prism binoculars for far less. No, they won't be as compact as these but you'll see better! Some are even truly waterproof (internal focussing, nitrogen purged) and under $100. Compare the above item with those and I believe you'll find far better value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"This item had pretty mixed up reviews when I was buying them.

Believe me you when I say I've used A LOT of binoculars so I'm now a newb to this. I bought them specifically for one purpose, shooting range and identifying where the bullet hits on target at 100 yards - yeah good luck. By the time I dialed in and finally was able to barely see the target, though still looking very very smudgy, my husband unloaded 2 AR15 mags. Wouldnt even pass this as a toy binocular, my son's $2 chinese made plastic crap shows clearer image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product with 1 caveat","review":"Great cheap binocs for the price.Just one thing keeping them from 5 stars:They'd have been better off skipping the cheap permanently attached lanyard string and including an eye-hole (or two) on the body somewhere to hook the thing up to your own lanyard or neckstrap instead. The problem with the permanently attached cord is that it's not only cheap, but doesn't hang so the binoculars balance properly on your chest. They have a tendency to hang forward. Not to mention that a narrow string is uncomfortable and possibly even dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bushnell binoculars","review":"I know that people can pay almost 10 times this amount for perfect binoculars but I am not into that.

One of my rubber end-caps fell off somewhere in the woods. These rubber end-caps are just slip-ons, so you will need to put a drop of rubber cement on them to be secure.Overall: For the price and easy of storing they are great: 5 stars, but, for the optical performance - 1.5 stars.

A neck cord is permanently attached between the eye-pieces, which is not shown in the product images.

Unfortunatley the updated version is not nearly as nice as the pair I received about 5 years ago. The older version is shown in the 3rd image - I notified Amazon so they may remove it by the time you read this.The old version:- has a nice rubber coating- focuses much better, easier to use focusing wheel- folds down smaller- easier to hold with fingers (round vs. larger flat top section)My old version is also much clearer, but I have a feeling I may just have a bad copy. It's a little blurry even after focusing. The old pair is crystal clear.I'm very disappointed in this new version. I'm looking for the old version online but there's a chance sellers are using the old photo and selling the new version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This purchase was a gift for my son's range bag.

The price on this was good, a fraction of what I paid for my bigger one.This item came with the piece of plastic on the bottom around the focusing wheel detached. I used 3 drops of white all purpose glue to repair this problem.This is a very small product that fits in the palm of my hand when folded up. I will be able to stow it in my purse because it is so small. (Now all I need is a mini-kitchen sink and my purse will have everything in it. That's a joke folks.)4 stars because new items should not require home repair.

The focus knobs (in the center and on the one eyepiece) move smoothly and stay in place after you're focused, and the price was right for what I got. They are small enough that I can shove them in my coat pocket and they are inexpensive enough that I don't care if they get lost or accidentally damaged.

Some of the straps are removeable for cleaning but some are not. I had to set a big bowl full of soapy water on the chair to soak the straps overnight as they were looking pretty grimy.

Its references to classical mythology and biblical lore provided a serious backdrop to a mediocre and simplistic plot premise. Make no mistake, Devilman rocks. Volumes 1 and 2 are included on the DVD, don't go looking for more, here are both 50 minute OVAs. Volume one takes its time warming up but erupts into a bloody and thrilling climax. Volume 2 introduces a main villian and her attempts to destroy Devilman. We don't know why, and we aren't told much about his greater significance to the world. Devilman must destroy demons, so demons seek out Devilman. There's your story. The animation is good for its time. The dubbing is at best poor and the DVD does not have the original dialogue with subtitles. I doubt very much we're missing a heck of a lot. Violent, chaotic, but loads of fun for adult anime fans. Don't take it too seriously. I especially enjoyed the assorted demons and their powers and design. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The horrors of bad dubbing","review":"I saw the original subtitled versions of both Devilman volumes and that prompted me to buy the DVD, much to my dismay however, the DVD did not include a subtitled version, and the dubbing is amateurish at best, they alter plot-important lines, throw in profanity at every turn, and try and use british slang with american accents which only makes the characters sound really dumb. The original work of Go Nagai was a masterpiece of animation, but after the dubbed version was made it's barely worth even watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"DevilMan is called a classic of anime with good reason.","review":"DevilMan is one of the prime examples of Go Nagai's anime. It'll suit just about everyone,except for the religious people. Action fans will adore both parts for its violence; Philosophers will love it because it takes a completly diffrent take on humanity as a whole, and states that both God and Satan are seen as products of man-kind's imagination. Horror fans will also adore this movie for its demons and suspense. I swear to God my heart stops at least twice during just the first oav. I also love DevilMan because of its supreme irony. (i.e. how the obligatory love scene is juxtaposed with one of the main charecters revealing to the other that demons exsist) There are also literature referances (Dante's inferno). Beautiful,stylish and heart-stopping. for more information on DevilMan, go to http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/demons/735"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"if you want a great anime whith lots of bloody action and a good adult story.

After a few weeks of use, the egg piercer has dulled, making it difficult to pierce the eggs with out cracking them.Now she's under-cooking the hard boiled eggs (I must admit I never tried soft boiled).So it's a cute little machine and it kinda works but not worth the money- get a real egg cooker and chalk this up to novelty item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henrietta Hen","review":"Perfect eggs every time.

USE PAM or you'll have a heck of time trying to clean cooked egg out of the corners of the poacher!3. Poach on the \\"hard boiled\\" setting and they will be just right, fluffy and fully-cooked through. Unless you like them runny like soft-boiled eggs.4.

In other words, the storyline is predictable and the action outweighed by tedious amounts of exposition, as though the author is trying to unravel the previous volume's mysteries as fast as possible rather than allowing the story to unfold more naturally. The artwork is still very solid, but I would have greatly preferred to sacrifice some of the mystery of Volume I (which is excellent!) if it would have meant keeping Batman from long expository ponderings while he's supposedly fighting for his life!Reading this second volume, I was reminded again and again of the second volume of \\"Superman: For Tomorrow\\", which suffers almost all the same problems.

They never made sense to me -- how could scientific revolutions affect one's personal philosophy? Now I know, because I've just experienced one. I used to believe in the Darwinist theory of evolution because the alternative -- the Bible -- was too ludicrous/painful. But some parts of Darwinism seemed really shaky and required a religious amount of faith on my part to believe them, which defeated the purpose. Salvation (eek, what an abused word) came in the form of Hoyle and Wick, who have not only shot down Darwinism, but have also put forward an excellent case which deserves serious consideration from the experts.

This 'Das Lied...' is every bit as good as when I reviewed alone, and it is by far the most interesting collection on the two CDs. I was never a big fan of 'Kindertotenlieder', given its subject, but I love listening to 'Des Knaben Wunderhorn' as it is by far the most gloriously simple borrowing of traditional German popular folk music of the 19th century into a classical interpretation. one can literally hear the oompah bands doing the works from which this was adapted. I love it to pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Mahler collection","review":"This is a very good set, good to be in every collection. It's undoubtable that the crown of the collection is the \\"Song\\". Baker is in the Ferrier league and Haitink draws some amazing playing from the Concertgebouw Orchestra. James King is very good also and as a matter of fact I prefer his singing over that of Julius Patzak in the Walter/Ferrier/VPO account for Decca. The sound is also much better than the mono of Decca though the new remastering has worked miracles there.I would place this performance up there with the Ferrier account. The other pieces in the collection are first class too, but there are so many great performances out there.... Hermann Prey is excellent in the Kindertotenlieder but can't match Ferrier's account for EMI. As for the Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen nothing can match the combination Furtwangler/Fischer-Dieskau on Orfeo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product and shipping method","review":"I bought this product based on the reviews here and on some other sites.

My local Costco and GNC both sell brands that I would go back to.In addition to the mixture, I received the container poorly packaged in a box 3x its size.

I purchased a pair and found myself unable to correctly focus the image (yes, I followed all the directions). My image was doubled, and I looked up alignment problems and tested it by focusing on a horizontal wire and then slowly separating the lenses; the line was disconnected, indicating that the binoculars were not aligned. This is not something one can fix, and Bushnell's warranty requires paying shipping.

I read the reviews carefully before ordering and finally selected the Boot Cut Mug in Green Tea. Probably the area I was most concerned about was the mug's seal, since the travel french press I used previously (an all-plastic model) had a screw top lid and this one has a press down lid. I have to say I've had no problems with the lid at all. It presses down securely and once down it won't turn at all. The most amazing thing is how long it keeps my coffee hot - I'm actually still adjusting to hot coffee after two hours, something that was not possible with my previous model. Since it certainly won't fit into my car's cupholder, I'm using the seat belt idea that I gleaned from another review.

Leon Parker adds his minimalist drums to a few of the selections. With the exception of \\"We'll Be Together Again,\\" all of the music (which includes a few brief interludes along with full-length pieces) consists of originals by either Amsallem or Ries. Some of the pieces are free in spots, most are thoughtful and lyrical, and there is some heat generated in spots. In general, the improvising is subtle and finds the duo members reacting constantly to each other. Well worth a few listens.Scott Yanow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yardley just gets better","review":"This book was so much fun. Since reading LA Woman, I knew Cathy Yardley had potential as a chick lit author. Couch World is much more gritty and realistic than most chick lit offerings. PJ is a flawed and very likeable character, and I really cared about what happened to her. I got drawn into the whole DJ scene, and Yardley's research really shows, but without it looking like she was just spewing out facts. And I also like that PJ's best friend is a bouncer named Sticky instead of a \\"ditzy best friend\\" stereotype.All and all, it's a great read. A few typos present, but that's Red Dress Ink for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard, delivering too little","review":"The plot of \\"Tallulahland\\" is obvious from the first page, and only habit kept me turning pages of this painful exercise in self-aggrandizment. The character of Tallulah is brillantly talented, and not shy about reminding the reader of that fact every five paragraphs or so. She's also obviously a thinly veiled avatar of the author, who likes reminding the reader every few pages that she's just slumming in chick lit by throwing T.S. Eliot references into dialogue so bad it gives Michael Crichton a run for his money. Not entertaining, not sexy, not fun. Stop insulting your readers, Ms. Messina, and give this genre its due.

The most obvious example of this is the extensive coverage given to the Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI).O'Reilly's Active Directory book should be made mandatory reading for anyone before deploying Windows 2000 and Active Directory.

This is especially important for Windows 2000 as there were some key changes in the Release CandidatesI bought my copy a good few months after 2000 was released - If a book is based on a beta version of a product it should say so in fairly large letters on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great detail, well-presented","review":"I am biased because I also write computer books, including several for O'Reilly & Associates. That makes me even more sensitive to what makes a good book. In this case, it's the level of detail and of technical accuracy that really makes this book shine. Mr. Lowe-Norris clearly knows what he's talking about, and by the time you read the book you will too. The hidden gem is the book's Part III, which is dedicated to teaching you how to script AD using the ADSI interfaces.

This makes it a bit difficult to write a review now, as a recording made in the style of the 60s, it is very good, as a \\" baroque\\" interpretation, well it isn't one. It is very easy to listen to, and I don't mind too much that there is lots of vibrato, but I don't like the way that it is played as violin sonatas with harpsichord accompaniment, as the main works, BWV 1041 to 1019, are realy trios with the harpsichord's right hand playing the second melody, and its left the bass line. So as a 1978 recording it give it 4. If you are looking for a recording in the baroque style try the version by van Dael & van Asperan on Naxos."},{"rating":"2","title":"How good would you be...?","review":"This is a collection of really catchy tunes.

Ioan Griffud is way too handsome and too apt to show his emotions to be the Hornblower we know from the stories. As for the TV production, it has been padded out to an hour and forty minutes by the addition of numberless commercial-TV/Hollywood cliches. I also found it tiresome to be belabored about the head and shoulders with endless conversations and confrontations presented for the sole purpose of conveying the idea that aristocracy is evil and egalitarian democracy is good. That was not Forester's point at all, I think, which was, if I recall correctly, a bit chauvinistic (i.e., British discipline over French slovenliness, with the revolutionaries and artistocrats equally reprehensible and chaotic). Perhaps I'm being too critical. but I had hoped for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST YET","review":"I have seen this movie when it aired on A&E and I found it perfect.

The magic of the original Strangefolk lineup came from Reid's thoughtful songwriting and soulful singing, Jon Trafton's inventive guitar, and the band's tight grooves. Now Reid is gone. Trafton doesn't show much of the fire that he once had. On the plus side, the band can still kick a groove and Luke Smith remains the best drummer in the genre. But without a compelling story to tell or even a heartfelt emotion to convey, this new Strangefolk has become just another neo-hippie jam band on the fraternity circuit.Bottom line: If you were into the band for the grooves then this record will probably suit you. If you were into them for the songs, you'll have better luck with Reid Genauer's post-Strangefolk solo work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Library Must","review":"My mom would aways read this book to us as I was growing up and it seemed to grow up with us!

It was very well constructed and easy to install. My dog just would not adjust to using it. I have used ramps before, having no problem with a shepherd or a lab. It had to be returned, since there was no way my dog was going to use it. I think mosly because of the blindness. Amazon graceously picked it up at my house and promptly gave me full credit.

Problem is, there is a serious crush hazard because of the weight and design. There is a finger \\"crush area\\" near the hinges where a user would most likely grasp the ramp to fold it. I have mashed fingers several times and sustained a moderately serious crushed finger the last time I used it. If I can't make it safe with a saw, then out it goes. It's too dangerous for anyone in my family to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk!!","review":"I bought this same item from C*****.

I'll build one out of wood that is stronger for a lot less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, BUT...","review":"I bought mine 4 yrs ago, so I may have the previous incarnation. The handle broke off almost immediately, which made the ramp extremely unwieldy for a short plump middle-aged woman to work with. Then the cotter pin got lost. My English mastiff did like using it at first; now however, at 12 yrs old, he can't see the edges of the ramp & stumbles over the sides unless I guide each footstep. It needs to be wider for giant breeds; he's on the small side for a mastiff -- 160 lbs & 27\\" tall. So be aware of what the design drawbacks may be. I now can use only one half of the ramp & that's really too steep an angle for my boy getting in & out of my Honda Odyssey. And I'm sorry, but 19 lbs is NOT LIGHTWEIGHT!! Not when you're hauling it in & out of a van!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"rubbery\\" surface is worth the price","review":"AFter much shopping, we are glad we decided on this ramp. Our 3 elderly dogs have no problem using it, even in the rain, because of the textured rubbery surface that gives them great traction and doesn't scratch their paws. It is somewhat heavier than some other ramps, but well worth the weight. We put this up over our RV steps for the dogs, but it is strong enough for us to use also. It fits, at an angle, but still sturdy in the open back passenger door of our GMC 2500 truck. Also, there is nothing to scratch the vehicle as all surfaces are protected with the \\"rubbery\\" coating. We couldn't be more pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more Lifting","review":"My German Sherperd was found at 2 1/2 months with a broken right rear leg.

Ramp stays in the truck for the daily brushing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"After researching other ramps we choose this becaise of durability and design. Very happy with the ruberized walking surface compared to others that were slippery or rough on a pet's paws. Very easy to set up. We followed the advice of letting the pet walk on before actually using on vehicle, within 5 mins our Golden Retreiver was walking and runing over it with great excitement. Our new Ford F150 is slightly taller than our previous one and Bear was having trouble making the higher jump. This ramp solved our problem. It is sturdy enough it appears it will last many years. Great choice for making it an easier load for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe, Solid, Non-marring","review":"Bought this for our 50-pound dog, for use following surgery, to reduce the risk of post-op hernia. Trained him on it prior to surgery, since he's used to jumping in and out of the van. Dog navigated it just fine, even in post-anesthesia haze :-). Also used indoors to get him on and off the grooming table. All surfaces are coated, so there's nothing to scratch the vehicle's paint. When folded, ramp kept closed with a coil spring, protected with a bit of clear tubing. Simple solution that works just fine. Notch in rails well-placed to carrying when folded. Rubber pads help resist slipping off the bumper when the dog is walking the ramp. Definitely recommend to dog friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, low key jazz","review":"A pleasant surprise. Excellent, unpretentious, mellow, recently recorded jazz with recognizable tunes is surprisingly uncommon. This groups performs these well-known show tunes and standards with a high quality of musicianship and in a low key approach. The instrumentation is consistent throughout, with guitar, piano, bass, drums and occasionally vibes. The improvizations are excellent.

He is in total harmony and synch with a superb Munich Philharmonic, and the spirit of the whole performance is very moving. The audio and video of the great production are outstanding, another quality production from the House of Panasonic.

The ball is attached to a rope so that when you hit the ball, the expectation is that the ball will continue to spin around the pole until you hit it again.In reality, the top and bottom of the rope is attached to the pole with velcro strips which do not spin freely about the pole. The rope with attached ball just wraps around the pole. Eventually. the rope spins back in the opposite direction allowing the possibility to hit it again only to wrap around the pole in the opposite direction.

Since then I have made several more knife purchases of varying price and quality. I have found that, compared to the Air Ranger:Similar knifes can be had for much cheaper, e.g. \\"Smith & Wesson CK105H\\".Better knifes can be had for the same price like the \\"CRKT M16-13SFG\\".However, the best value is an awesome knife like the \\"Benchmade Mini Barrage Knife\\".No matter which knife you buy, make sure the screws are tight, or they may come loose, like has happened on two of my knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"QA ?","review":"Are these things Q.A.ed before they leave the factory? Let me tell you what happens when you over torque steel screws in aluminum handles. They strip, sooner or later. Out of the box the blade would not stay closed, so I thought I'd tighten the pivot screw a bit. Uh oh, wouldn't tighten, wouldn't loosen either. Checking carefully, I see that the stud that the pivot screw screws into has been turned so hard when it was put together that the flat sides of the steel stud has stripped out the aluminum in the handle that's supposed to hold it in place. I tried to unscrew the screws that hold the handles on and every one of them came out with the threads still glued on with what ever they were using for thread locker. No, it wasn't worth the shipping to send this cheap a knife back under warranty. A couple of passes with a cutter on my dremel tool and I have a knife blade to use in a future project.

The wider profile caused the belt to ride partially off the end of the roller, causing excessive heating. The belt got so hot, it melted the plastic housing and roller mount adjacent to the end of the beater roller. Because of the damage, I had to replace my vacuum.

I'm fairly new to the Anime scene, really only familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's features (the Disney of Japan, search for \\"ayao Miyazaki\\"in VHS).

Try Uchida or Schiff for good interpretations. If you like Brendel, try his recording of the piano concertos where he does well. Besides the cool mechanical performances here, another complaint is that the CD leaves out Mozart's piano sonata KV 545 which is definitely one of his best and most recognizable pieces and the wonderful Fantasy in D Minor KV 397. Don't miss them! Any collection that leaves out those two and calls itself Mozart favorite works for piano is outright misleading, and any recording with so little heart and soul deserves only one star. I'll be generous and give two stars for the sense of architecture that Brendel has.

There is diversity of sound (though often the drum samples they use are annoying). The real gem of this album is the lyrics. Jeru has a less freeflowing, more on beat style but still tongue twistingly runs circles around your mind, and managed to interweave jewels of knowledge amidst tense, compelling lyrical narratives. If you have appreciation for the lyrics of the Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and arent afraid of a challenge of dissecting them (maybe requiring multiple listens) you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"think about it","review":"Jeru does not make club records. Most of the popular Hip-Hop on the radio is driven by the beats and acclaimed producers.

The voices aren't always at their top ability, but are generally more than competent. Asawa, in particular, is amazing here--he has an incredible countertenor voice perfect for the role of Oberon. The rustics are refreshingly comic, as well. The second disc doesn't seem quite as good to me, but it is still wonderful music.

While the plot deals with the theft of a train load of coffee, the book is so far beyond an average hiest story that it is hard to catagorize. The setting, the characters - even the steamy sex scenes - are more than one expects after reading Westlake's other books. This is, in many ways, a serious novel, but at the same time, very entertaining. I had to read it in one long session. It was that gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"After reading Westlake's obit in the NYT I went out on kindle to download some of his stuff since I remember reading a couple great caper books of his over the years. This book had a large numberof 5 star ratings so I tried this one!Having also just watched \\"Last King of Scotland\\" I was really up for another look into Amin's Uganda. The caper aspect of stealing an entire coffee train took a back seat to background of the madman and his frightened society that you get in this book. In that respect it was very similar to the terrific \\"Child 44\\" and its evocation of Stalinist Russia.Since I've been reading a wide variety of Westlake books -- the capers, the Dortmunder series and they are all great, but this work along with other stand alone novels like \\"The Ax\\" are the ones that stay with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on an Apple Airport System","review":"Flawless installation on a new Airport Extreme network with mimo.

But for those that stick with it for the first 100 pages or so, the pay off is BIG. It is a wonderful tale, with interesting characters and many great truths that we all need to hear.For the reader who said it was full of typos, it was made very clear to me that Robin and Robert are the same person, Robin is his nickname, much like Mike is to Michael.

Against that backdrop, Stackpole places characters we instantly like, and a plot with enough twists and turns to satisfy the most demanding readers.Stackpole is best known for his incredible Star Wars X-wing novels. The same flair for crisp action he brought to those novels can be found here. If you enjoyed the X-wing series, you will not be disappointed with Eyes of Silver."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"I been a science fiction and fantasy fan for over 30 years and at times I now find it hard to find a book I can really enjoy.

The plot takes forever to get off the ground. It's very difficult to figure out who belongs to what country/alliance. While the individual characters and their societies are interesting enough, you don't care about any of them. None of this is helped by the book's jumping around between characters from chapter to chapter. This device wears thin even in books I like more.

It had many songs that I only have on an old tape, eaten by my tape deck various times. The problem became apparent after hearing the first part of a song; the songs are truncated, and blended together! Joe Arroyo is a great singer, but part of what makes many of these songs great is the talent of his band members, and the fabulous instrumentation and solos that have been REMOVED from this compilation. The songs are great, but often, the best part has been cut off. DO NOT MESS WITH PERFECTION! Nowhere on the CD is there an indication that this breach of artistic integrity has taken place. Discos Fuentes has a lot of nerve! Give us the complete songs, and indicate on the CD's cover if you do not! CAVEAT EMPTOR!

I basically use them for the hockey games I go to, and they work really well. The only thing I had difficulty with was putting the strap on the binoculars. They came with a plastic neck strap that had to be threaded through a loop on the top of the binoculars and then secured with a button like device. It was very difficult to attach the strap, but that might have just been an issue I had.

I just remembered all the meanings because the explanations were so weird. Oh well, go with what works. I wish that he put more effort into the translations though.

I say this only because I would like to recommend this book to anyone who is beginning Japanese and needs to memorize the cumbersome Hiragana and Katakana characters.

All it takes is half an hour of trying to read any Japanese text while flipping back through Rowley's book and his ingenious pictures will begin appearing right before your eyes, instilling instant gratification of a sense of progress. However, Rowley's main focus is on Kanji, which he does just a magnificent a job of illucidating and entrenching their definitions upon anyone who reads this text. I would suggest to any student, including those who do not need any knowledge of Kanji, to give this text a try for the sheer brilliance in which Rowley has takled these most formidable phonetic syllabaries, Hiragana and Katakana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes","review":"There are so many mistakes in this book. Mis-numbered cross referential numbers and kanji is just wrong are some of the most glaring examples. It is difficult to learn anything when you are second guessing the material. The most embarrassing oversight is the kanji for noisy which is made up of three little kanji women. That kanji is only really used with a power kanji in front to mean rape. Not only is the Kanji useless by itself (assuming you are not living in the Heian period), but it is offensive when you try to use it.The idea of the book is great epically with my learning style, but get a Japanese editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kanji Comes to Life","review":"This is a good book for learning Kanji.

Refer to William O'Neil's books for better guidance about how to invest. Also, if you are a subscriber, there is a large amount of useful information on the IBD website at Investors.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad presentation","review":"I was very excited to find a book that was going to give me more ideas on how to pick stocks using IBD. While this book did give information on IBD, it never got into anything I found helpful in really using to pick stocks. All the author did was present information I already knew by reading IBD myself. Also this was not a pure IBD product the author attempted to mix in several authors advice and techniques into this work by quoting them verbatim. The book was very dry and hard to read and I do not think beginners or veteran traders will find it helpful. It was written by a doctor, who may be a great trader, but I did not like his writing style. I would advise reading all of William O'Neal's book and stick with IBD alone to teach you. Find your stock picks in the IBD 100, you do not need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks..","review":"I bought this book a year and a half or so ago and I think it was a bad investment. I figured this book would be a great addition to How to make money in stocks but I was wrong.This book is basically scanned in pages of parts of the paper telling you about all the economic indicators and other items in Investor's Business Daily.I feel this book could have been a lot better if Dhun Sethna hadn't spent most of his time talking about such a boring subject... I mean who really wants to interpret economics graphs... I know I don't. He could have discuss how to find the winners (like the title suggests) but from what I remember about this book it is just about what the paper is and all the economic indicators you can find in it. I can clearly see why William O'Neil doesn't recommend this book.Reed Floren"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad purchase","review":"I bought this pump and used it about 8 hours per day in my pond for four weeks. Went out one morning and found the pump wasn't working, I checked the gfi and found it had blown. I tried to reset it and it wouldn reset. I unpluged the pump and then could reset it. Thinking my gfi might be old I pluged the pump in direct to see if it would run the motor humed but wouldn't run. The motor has shot. I checked it with a volt ohm meter and found the motor was bleeding to ground. So $150.00 bucks plus shipping down the drain.

Buy immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear drum rupture","review":"I don't know what is more painful, popping your eardrums with an ice pic or listening to Lucia Pamela's Into Outer Space. Yes, I did buy it more out of curiousity than anything else. I won't do that again! Not only is the recording bad, (yes, I know it is an old recording) but the musical compositions are hideous. Who told this women she could sing? Thank goodness time and space separate us as to hear her in person would be analogous to chanting an unholy entreaty to the Old Ones a la an H.P. Lovecraft story.

I have wasted alot of money on some not so good Bushnell binoculars. But this pair was a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke easily and warranty stinks","review":"Purchased these as a gift and they were fine briefly until the internal parts failed.

We will finally be able to see if they are worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy for the beginner, also a wonderful gift.","review":"I purchased these binoculars and a guide to regional birds as a gift for my father who enjoys amateur bird-watching(mostly from his lovely back porch at our country home). I don't know the first thing about buying binoculars, so I relied heavily on the reviews of other purchasers. Happily, I was not disappointed. These binoculars are lightweight and very simple to use,which my father loves. The sheer clarity and visibility actually shocked me upon first use. The only downfall being that this model does not have a zoom function which would be helpful at times; however, it is not necessary and barely hinders ones viewing pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy","review":"I'm impressed. For the $$$, these are awesome. I use them mostly for watching birds on the feeders around my house, and for looking at the moon. Very nice. They are easy to use, crisp, and light. I can see better with these than with my 10x60 binoculars (not that I understand the 8x40 vs. 10x60 :) Bottom line: If you are after perfection, don't buy these -- instead spend $$$$$ and get a great pair of binoculars. If you aren't quite that demanding, aren't a millionaire, and just want to be able to see things in closeup around your house, etc. I highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent value","review":"Purchased to view birds and wildlife from my kitchen window.

This video is a collection of footage about great whites from a variety of previous documentaries. Is the discovery channel just trying to make more money with no investment?

It's one of my favorite CDs, and I own a LOT of them, from different genres.Listening to it makes you think that the compiler was imagining what music would be played at a wedding where money is no object, and ANYONE could be hired! There are numbers by Pavarotti,Te Kanawa, and Carreras, and some pieces I never heard anywhere else. One is a duet between a trumpet and an organ, and there is a VERY fast organ solo piece in there, where you can imagine the organist's fingers being a BLUR. All the traditional stuff is there, too, including the traditional wedding marches from Wagner and Mendelssohn,and everything from \\"Jesu,Joy of Man's Desiring\\" to \\"One Hand,One Heart\\". It is a very romantic album that would work equally well for a special night alone with one's spouse, or or a wedding.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful CD - wedding or not","review":"Whether you're getting married, attending a wedding or just want some sweet music to listen to - this album is it.

In fact Charlie and his Orchestra featured as part of the broadcasts by William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw), and provided revised lyrics aimed at subverting the Allies.Django Reinhardt and brother Joseph are well represented on Disc 3, and The Ramblers are included on Disc 4, together with a rare Valaida Snow side.

I've been grilling for thirty years and this is by far the best functioning bbq I've ever owned. My last grill was a gas/charcoal unit that I always used with charcoal because I didn't like the gas cooked taste. This new Weber somehow makes hamburgers taste just like my old charcoal grill if you remember to preheat it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Grill ever","review":"I have owned this grill for over a year now and I love it as much today as I did the day it arrived. It has great flame control. It is very important for me to be able to turn the flame up or down. Many grills you turn it up and the flame is about the same as when you turn it down. You really don't have control of the flame. Not with this grill. The rotisiree is great. Makes wonderful chicken. You can put 2 chickens on at once. I have made burgers, steaks, tuna, chicken, fajitas, veggies, and just about anything else you can grill and love it. When you are ready for one of your last grills if not the last grill you will have to buy, get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A treat for the eyes but not the ears!","review":"I bought this movie to show kids, but it is way too boring for them.

I kept hoping they would say something because I was curious about what I was seeing, but they never did! Very frustrating. Kids won't sit for it either.

I don't have an example right now, because I had to borrow the book from the teacher, but I can remember that it was really annoying, to the point where I actually noticed, which is really saying something.And sometimes, people did really stupid things that they knew would have had no effect whatsoever, like at the end, when the monster was in the water, she threw her wallet at it, which was full of silver coins that her grandma gave to her!

If you want more musical ideas to create your own compositions, this album will trigger more ideas with several subhouse genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"From one of the best deep house DJs, this is substantially below par. He should stick to compilation releases and leave the recordings to true musicians/artists. I felt there was no soul to this CD, as the tracks seem predictable and cheesy. His first artist album (Colorful You) was better, as well as his many DJ CDs - In The House and 24th St. are his best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought.","review":"I thought the album sounds too much like 70's funk or disco.

This album was short on both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miguel Can Do No Wrong","review":"Miguel has released better things but, \\"Those Things\\", will stand the test of time; a truely great Dance album. It features his best abilities to take on what the INDUSTRY asks of a Star. He is able to master both the resurgence of \\"Rock\\" as a driving force in the sound these days as well as the mainstay vibe of \\"Hip Hop\\". Thank the Heavens that his genius comes out in every track after #3. In fact, the title track #5, \\"Those Things\\", is quite simply, unsurpassed. If you haven't purchased this one yet and you truly appreciate Deep House and the eclectic verve that I believe only comes from the San Francisco Bay Area please don't hesitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the Norm Yet Catchy","review":"Sometimes it takes going away from a certain style of music to find out what you are really capable of creating. Migs on the other hand did a wonderful job with his latest album \\"Those Things\\". Although it isn't his ususal style, I was still impressed with this album. It's not a album to club to but more of a relaxing/ hanging out with friends type of mix. Some of my favorite tracks include \\"So Far,\\" \\"Those Things,\\" \\"Fire,\\"\\"Shake It Up,\\" and \\"Giving It All\\". You would not be disappointed with purchasing this album regardless if you are being introduced to Migs for the first time or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a nice story!","review":"This is the first time I've read anything by Susan Stephens but after this I want to read more of her books.

I like to READ a story, I don't like to be TOLD a story. There is not enough dialogue to move this story along. Too much is told to the reader and it's very repetitive. Also, every chapter doesn't have to end with this \\"dun-dun-dun\\" moment. Overall, this book is very amateurishly written.

Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal.The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it.Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file.As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked?

It might have been fun to see her do it in person but on the recording, it is just boring.I am extremely sorry I wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could You Stand It!!!?","review":"What was this? My word. I am so glad that I listened to this before seeing it. I was very disapointed by what I heard. Was this Julie Andrews or some poor animal crying out to be put to sleep?! I hate to say it but I think Julie shoud stick with her holiday special. One of the great up beat numbers from the Film Le Jazz Hot was one of the most boring rewrites I ever heard! Not only was the upbeat dance music turned slow, and boring,but it also shows that Julie's singing days are OVER! My dear we loved you in the movie version, we loved you in Sound of Music, let's keep those meories alive. This one should be put out of print an never let it see the light of day again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Musical","review":"This is a pleasant recording of the stage version of Victor Victoria. I saw the show on Broadway and it was fabulous and Julie was exceptional. This cast recording has some great new material with \\"Living in the Shadows\\" as one of the stand out numbers. Beautiful music and lyrics. Julie also does a fantastic job on \\"Louis Says\\" and \\"If I Were A Man\\". \\"Le Jazz Hot\\" is a different, longer arrangement than the film version, but equally as grand.To anyone who was fortunate enough to have seen it live, this will bring back great memories. This disc is wonderful for any admirer of Julie Andrews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad sad sad.....","review":"I thought the musical was supposed to be even bigger and better--but from this CD, it's obvious that it's Not! It just seems silly the changes that were made from the movie version. One of my favorite songs 'The Shady Dame from Saville' was totally cut and this frothy 'Louis Says' was put in its place. Dreadful! The 'Shady Dame' was such a wonderful way to end the movie as well, and it was some obnoxious 'Victor/Victoria' thing. I Know most musicals have a song that goes with the title, but really, it was just obnoxious. I saw the live touring performance--it wasn't any better! So....be ware! For die-hard Julie Andrews fans, it's a big let down from the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Movei score instead!","review":"My titile says it all. But, to elaborate, Julie Andrews, James Garner, Alex Karras were all at their peak. Robert Preston brought such incredible sophisitication and truth as a man living a double life in the spotlight. Finally, few things express the pre-AIDS world freedom as clearly as Leslie Ann Warren's pubic hair showing in high-def. The world has become such a more subdued and censored place since the 70s - early 80s. Why watch or listen to the Broadway re-make of a beautiful moveie when you can get the real thing.

Why pay all the money for 301 Stainless and have to cover the grill?2. The shelves on the left and right are concave so they collect rain water about 1/8 inch deep.3. A mild direct wind into the front of the grill causes blow outs when you are only lighting two or three burners.Bottom Line: $1700 for a poorly designed fancy looking unit.

I don't understand how people are giving this 5 stars. Are you watching the same movie? Here are my impressiion of the movies.Good: Impressive Special Effect on some scnes. That is the only good thing I can say about this movie.Bad: No character development at all. No sustaining plot whatsoever. The \\"aliens\\" are not scary at all. This is nota scary movie...where's the fear factor, the adrenaline rush, the heart-pulsing scene? There are none of that. And this is suppose to be a movie about the end of the world? What a joke.Overall: This movie just didn't connect with me. It didn't feel right. I wasn't entertain in the least bit. Definately didn't live up to the hype. Maybe worth a rental for the special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big bark, no bite","review":"The special effects were really good and I thought the plot was good at the beginning, but it almost looks like the director threw in the towel after the first hour, and the constant screaming and whining by the character played by Dakota Fanning made the movie almost unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Letdown!!!","review":"This movie was such a letdown. Spielberg's film was not only lacking in the storyline, but the special affects were about the same as the 1953 version, which was excellent for its time. As a matter of fact, that's all this movie showed me... Special Affects and nothing more. The screaming kid got on my nerves right from the get go. Someone wrote a review that the movie should have been longer... You've got to be kidding, right? Any longer and I would have run from the theater yelling: The Martians Have Landed!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I rather watch the old flick over and over again!Real acting!What really was stupid was that the aliens buried their ships here? When and why? They would of have an easier time when they sent their ships over to earth back then. How come the Earth's governments did not find any of these ships or is the area 51 card going to be played again? This movie was all eye candy but nothing else!And that little brat of an actress screaming all the time through out the entire movie was so annoying!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Illiterate Has this Nation Become","review":"This rating is not for the movie, but for the buffoons who criticized the movie's ending. Amazing! Did they never read H.G. Wells' masterpiece? Did they even know there WAS such a book? Or perhaps, do they even know what a book is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could It Get Any Worse???","review":"I agonized through the entire film although I'm not sure why. Tom Cruise is a poor actor but seems to out do himself in War of the Worlds! His acting is bad and his character is even worse. The only reason this received one star is for the average special effects. Hollywood, wake up. Tom just can't act!!! Definitely don't waste your time, let alone money, on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, intense, and all kinds of other really cool stuff that can be said!","review":"Absolute sci-fi masterpiece! Tom Cruise: As usual, an awesome, riveting performance, Dakota Fanning: An acting talent beyond belief, Justin Chatwin: You ROCK! And The \\"Berg\\": Well, goes without saying ... Thank you Steven! I will be purchasing TWO DVDs ... one to watch, and one to keep buried, unopened, waiting deep below the streets."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Suspenseful\\"","review":"This was a great movie. With Tom Cruise showing off in front of \\"his girlfriend\\" about the movie you had to to see some connection. This movie was about a normal place that aliens come to invade. Withn many attacks it made you think what was going to happen. The only negative was the crummy. \\"How did we survive\\" sounds very scripted. It sounded like a hillbilly. Overall, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"War of the Worlds","review":"I won't bore you with another blow by blow commentary. That's covered extremely well be others. To summarize, this is a fun, scary movie with some very tense moments. Will it ever make the best 100 movies ever made that has some lasting effect on society or how one lives one's life? No, though I suppose some enterprising soul will find poignant thought-provoking moments here and there. Will I end up buying it despite some \\"issues\\" raised by others? Yes. After all, it IS a fun, scary movie with some tense moments. Sometimes, I just like to be entertained and this movie fits the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Dialogue Ruin This Movie!!","review":"Steven Spielberg incorporates elements from H.G. Welles' innovative book written in 1898, Orson Welles' 1939 Radio Broadcast and George Pal's 1953 sci-fi blockbuster. Spielberg did what he had to do to make this film work. Stunning visuals and outstanding special effects almost make this film great. The problem is the screenplay. The dialogue is absolutely dreadful! The characters seemed like they were sleepwalking instead of acting. Throughout the film, I'm convinced of one thing, Tom Cruise is a horrible actor, all looks and no substance. The horrible dialogue in the film will drive you crazy! It did for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Remake and Tom Cruise is not a good Sci Fi Actor","review":"This was a remake from the 1953 sci fi classic. I was curious to watch this film so I decided to rent it. There was more concentration on Tom Cruise being a dead beat dad with his children and dealing with his ex-wife than the actual aliens destroying the planet. The plot was horrible and a insult to H.G. Wells!! If he was alive today, he would be outraged that the plot of the movie focused on family problems than the aliens taking over the world!!! Waisted picture and a waist of time. I wouldn't recommend on anyone purchasing this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is it about? A horrible mish-mash!","review":"What a shockingly ill-conceived movie. Here, Cruise is a divorced parent of two not at all precocious children. He gets caught in a war that had been planned by aliens for millions of years. Yawn! And Yawn! His blonde little daughter tries to act the diva and fails miserably, she is awful and relies in pure ham acting but it seems is very popular in USA more for being white and blonde rather than anything else. She is a little lab rat. Cruise is boring and even the machines, which destroy the earthlings act better than the sorry father-daughter duo. The story lacks panache and has absolutely no emotional or entertainment values. Have seen better movies in Hallmark Channel. A big mistake to buy this pure nonsense! The movie moves at a snail's pace and a headache is almost guaranteed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"war of the worlds is speilberg's worst. it's to scary for little kids and it is not cool. the aliens were bad and the blood that was poured out was so fruit punch. tom cruise was horrible at it and dakota fanning was really annong. why did they put miranda otto in second in the end credicts? she wasn't even in this stinki'n movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Spielberg's Best - Not Even Close","review":"What was Spielberg thinking about when he directed this disaster? I expect an average performance from Cruise and I got it, but Dakota Fanning's considerable talent was wasted. With roles ranging from \\"Taken\\" to \\"Uptown Girls\\" to \\"Man on Fire\\" to her credit, all Spielberg seemed to think she needed to do was put on a blank look and scream. What a waste. Maybe Spielberg was thinking about Munich instead of concentrating on the movie at hand. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I haven't read the book but the ending of this movie is the worst I have ever seen. You got through a lot of sturm und drang to get nothing at the end. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"war of the idiots!","review":"I watched this movie with my cousin hoping I would like it and instead I was disapointed. I really think the animation was good but the storyline needed some work. For the first time in movie history Spielburg has failed. If the aliens were the super diabolickle geniuses then why couldent they just think of something old like the super....mega....ultra lightning ray gun but oh I forgot THey used lightning to awaken the giant robotsBut why couldnt they use that lightning to put a hole through earth. Spielberg If you want to make a good movie stick with that idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"spielberg back in form","review":"finally steven spielberg is back in his form of the past...although not his best it's a powerful movie with the best effects i've seen in a long time...although it bogs down a little it tries to keep the spirit of the novel. the first hour is the best with the second half slowed down a bit...and look for the two stars of the original as the grandparents at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"Interesting at times, boring at others . The movie was not what I thought it would be , but it was nice . I would recommend checking it out . The acting is supurb but the storyline...is not. There was no war, an invasion and thats about it, one grenade and it was all over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have improved","review":"After sitting through about 30 minutes of the same previews i've seen about 50 times before, the movie finally started. The first 40 minutes seemed to capture an old time, Twilight Zone type feel to it and reeled you in. Then, the movie just fell flat on its face. It had too many speical effects, not enough of a plot/story, and they never devolped any of the characters. Dakota Fanning was annoying and made me hate the movie evening more, the male teenager was cliched, and Tom Cruise could have done better. The movie has good sequences but half way too the end, you start to wonder how will this end? It seems they beat ever possible odd that they could face. The ending was way to fast, and should have been more thought of. If you want to waste money and go see a brainless summer movie, go see this. Batman Begins is still by far one of the best summer movies and will be hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"War of the Worlds was a quite a disappointment considering that is was a Spielberg film featuring Tom Cruise and based on an H.G. Wells classic.In short, the acting is good (but nothing great), the action/special effects are just average, while the plot is rather poor.Moreover, the characters are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting.The \\"miraculous\\" survival of the delinquent turned hero (!!!) son, and the unexpected-and yet lame-ending really take away from the overall enjoyment.For a good adaptation of H.G. Wells, check out both versions (the old and the new) of The Time Machine!No masterpiece here... 1 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WAR OF THE WORLD","review":"WHEN I SAW THIS SHOW I WAS LIKE THIS IS THE BEST SHOW IVE EVER SEEN. SOME PARTS I PUT ONE HAND OVER MY EYES CAUSE IT WAS THRILLING. TOM CRUISE WAS REALLY GOOD SO DID DAKOTA FANNING SO I RATE THE FANTASTIC MOVIE 5 STARS. I REALLY WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOK","review":"Look for my substitute teacher JUDY GALVIN in this movie. She will be carrying a red suit case towards the and of the movie. I was also in the town where they showed it to see how peeps like it! IT TOTALLY ROX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and contrived! Cruise is BORING!","review":"Spielberg's treatment of 'War Of The Worlds' seemed to rely much too much on big Hollywood special effects and Tom Cruise's bland acting (Cruise was a much better and more focused actor in some of his early roles such as in 'Rain Man') in attempting to carry the story. Special effects alone do not a good movie make! Sure the ground cracking open and the tripods looked awesome, but the movie felt more like a comic book rather than a realistic portrayal of what an alien invasion of this magnitude would feel like. The viewer also did not get any information as to who these aliens were. Where are they from? Why are they here? All we essentially know is that these aliens were bent on destruction and bloodshed. We needed MORE of a storyline for the movie to feel complete! The last time I felt this empty and cheated after a performance was when back in the 80's I found out Milli Vanilli lip synched their tunes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Dreadful","review":"Well, this is not the worst movie I ever saw...but it certainly cracks the top ten. The characters are unappealing, the plot is non-existent, the action is episodic, and the script has holes big enough to drive an alien tripod through. And speaking of alien tripods, the alien villains were simply ridiculous and the special effects were anything but special. The most astonishing thing about this movie is that Steven Spielberg would allow his name to be attached to this truly awful picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blu-ray quality EVER!!!","review":"I like this movie and I'm a big fan of the George Pal version as well. I have been looking forward to the Blu-ray version of this film believing that it should, and would look awesome. This is without a doubt the worst quality Blu-ray that I have ever seen. I have exchanged this disk three times hoping that I just got a bad copy or two. I compared this movie to my regular DVD version and the DVD is far superior to the Blu-ray. I tested them on two different Blu-ray/LED television systems and the results were the same. DO NOT BUY THIS BLU-RAY VERSION."},{"rating":"1","title":"no war in war of the worlds","review":"words can not and i mean can not tell how disappointed i was when i saw this movie in the theather and just like terminator 4 this movie is about a war that has no war. the scene were tom cruise argues with his son while the army fights the aliens is just stupid. I would rather have seen the army fight the aliens but Noooooo we have to watch tom cruise argue with his son. Do not and i mean do not watch this movie and think it is going to be like ID4 or anything like star wars or like the old war of the worlds movie because you will be very very very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Tom Cruise Collection is complete","review":"This movie completes my Tom Cruise collection (although I still need Eyes Wide Shut for my Kubrick collection). What others do I have? None! If you want to see War Of The Worlds, then get the version with Gene Berry."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new to offer","review":"I can't say that I came to this with high expectations, but in the end this movie provided very little worth watching for except a few good visual effects. The human interest here is very tiresome and melodramatic, and in the end the movie follows the same old story line with very little appreciation of the original point that H.G. Wells was making. Rather than providing a story that questions the true nature of power, this movie merely ends with a convenient plot device to sum things up nicely. In Boston, no less.I am probably more disturbed by those who have voiced great disappointment in the movie's ending. Was this a surprise ending to most people? If so, we have merely confirmed the American image of illiteracy and ignorance of the past--I could have sworn that the demise of the Martians was as archetypal as Eden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Spielberg smoking crack...","review":"Was Spielberg smoking crack when he made this movie? This was horrible. It was loud (I guess to try and scare people) and boring. Do actors read scripts before they take on roles? Will Dakota Fanning ever stop crying? These are some questions that I hope someone can answer. Now I know why Tom Cruise went nuts after promotong this movie- he got a preview. Horrible acting, horrible script and story. I gave it 2 stars because the tripods weren't that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"In short...","review":"I'm going to keep it short. I felt this film was a rehashed production with absolutely no content on any level (save special effects). Spielberg relied on Cruise to pull a weak story with too many inconsistencies and loopholes to count. It felt obvious (to me) that the film tried to leap over pivotal moments in the proceedings to add suspense, when all it added was uncertainty and udder confusion. I was severely disappointed in this movie and I hope Spielberg manages to pull his head from his behind when he decides to pull together another film."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have seen.","review":"I never expect much from Tom cruise when it comes to great acting. This movie is just another example of the man's terrible acting. A bad story and bad acting = a boring movie. This one is not even worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for Spielberg, One star for effects","review":"No stars for enjoyment or fulfilling plot. It just ends. After all that. No great battles scenes, no emotional moments between the wooden Tom Cruise and the over-acting Fanning as the annoying daughter - somebody slap the hysterical child.And please tell me why Cruise's ex-wife and her family are miraculously wearing perfectly starched white shirts and suits answering the door of their untouched brownstone? It was ludicrous. There's rubble all around them, but they are pristine. It was just a very sudden ending and not at all satisfying. The son was more of a hero than the father. And the mother Miranda Otto was more memorable than the father's character, played by Cruise. It just didn't click. ET it ain't. Independence Day was a better War of the Worlds in the modern day."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i just buy blu ray?","review":"I do really like this movie and was really looking forward to watching it in blu ray glory, but what the heck, the quality is worse than the regular dvd!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bore of the worlds","review":"THE BEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS FILM IS THAT IT FINALLY ENDS.

I thought to myself, \\"Point the camera over there! There is something interesting going on behind the actors! LOOK!\\" But, no. The camera remained on dull and uninteresting people as the alien invasion unfolds, progresses, and concludes. Welles would weep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow that was...gay.","review":"If there is a thurder storm outside and your inside you may be bothered. But the people in the movie freak out and dive under a table when theres a storm out side. When the see where the lightning struck outside buildings start to colapes and what do the people do, they stand there and are killed by the aliens. Aliens/Robots are atacking the boats, what do you do get of the boat, but the people get on the boats. The millitary is attacking the aliens/robots, what do you do you run away from the military and aliens/robots, but no people wanna watch.So basiclly everthing was backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful .... a croad of lap","review":"This supposed blockbuster has cemented in my mind how bad Hollywood can get. A remake which doesn't stay true to the original story, opting more to make it a Tom Cruise vehicle.Tom plays an arrogant father who doesn't talk pleasantly to his children. Not that he can be blamed, the children are annoying throughout. Too much focus on this family unit instead of focusing on what we all wanted to see - aliens! Unfortunately, the alien scenes are few and far between.I am glad I only rented this. My advice to others who are interested in seeing this waste of time is to ask yourself these questions:1. Are you a fan of the annoying arrogant Tom Cruise?2. Do you like silly Hollywood blockbuster movies?3. Do you listen to work colleagues positive reviews of movies?If you answered NO to at least two of these questions, then avoid the film at all costs. Speilberg is losing his touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Brilliant special effects are completely ruined by this flat, boring, LONG movie. War of the Worlds boils down to 2 hours of listening to Dakota Fanning scream.

Seems the media loves Tom Cruise so much, WHY?? with the exception of risky business and minority report, he sure picks bad movies.

It was heartwarming.If you want to see a movie that is action pack, this movie will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Dissapointment in Cinema History.","review":"When I went to see this movie in the cinema I was so excited. But afterwards I was SO dissapointed. Possibly Speilbergs worst film and Cruise's worst performance. Totally dreadful acting and even worse directing. Everything seems backwards in this film as tence scenes end awkwardly. Tom Cruise constantly shouting out kids names and Dakota 'The Fanny' Fanning screaming to really annoying effect.A terrible, terrible remake. H.G. Wells would be turning in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spielburg-era is over.","review":"How sad to exploit the tragedy of 9-11 for some quick cash. Spielburg should donate any modest profits from this film to 9-11 families, since he made a mockery out of their loss. The scene where there are hand-drawn posters of missing family & friends, as if anyone had time to cut & paste photos of their loved ones and hang them around the city while it was being destroyed by aliens? And it's an insult that Spielburg can gain the cooperation of the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division to make his film - using actual soldiers who served in the \\"War on Terror\\" for his \\"War of the Worlds\\". Spielburg has surrounded himself with a bunch of \\"yes, sir\\" staff, and it shows. He and Lucas had their glory days, but if you see this film, you will know that the Spielburg-era is over. Hollywood is running out of magic tricks... and the theaters are empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood","review":"I liked the movie, but didn't love it. My review is strictly for the visual and audio quality of this blu ray.First and foremost, yes you will see grain. Yes it's not as visually stunning as Avatar. However, that was the intent.

Wells book. However he made the wrong choice in leading men. Tom Cruise fakes his way through this film and to be honest if you watch it you will notice that the camera is almost always on him and not on the aliens out destroying the world. I hated the business of the tri-pods being hidden underground. Gee don't you think we might have noticed by now?All in all this is a movie that would have been very good if Spielberg had used a good actor instead of Tom Cruise. As it was his over the top bad acting ruined it and earned him the Golden Raspberry he won for his acting here."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long were they waiting down there?","review":"Steven Spielberg took an old movie with a fairly believable story and made his remake utterly unbelievable. Here is the start of Cruise's character experiencing the aliens for the first time. The Martians had their tripod war machines waiting in the ground for thousands of years and they just happen to end up under the city that was built much later. What? Duh. It pretty much ruined the movie for me. All Spielberg wanted was to show how great he could master the special effects of the streets ripping up and use dolby sound to enhance the effects. TOTAL AND AWFUL CONTRIVING ON HIS PART. It really hurt my ability to accept the movie. Sometimes an excellent old movie is better left alone no matter how much a director wants show his knack for special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD BE CALLED WAR OF THE DISASTERS","review":"first off let me make it perfectly clear i am a steven spielberg fan,but i must say his vision of the war of the worlds was not good at all.the tripods and aliens were ok but the story line could have been better.i find dakota fanning annoying throughout the movie with her constant screaming.tom cruise was ok but the story line was focused on him and his kids and not on the invasion.at least in the george pal version we do see the army fight the alien ships,on spielbergs movie we only see a little army fighting with aliens at the end of the movie.the worst part of the movie was the army and alien fight in the middle of the movie where as we dont see a fight at all!!!!!,what a big dissapointment!this is nothing more than a quick buck remaking a classic.if you truly want to see the war of the worlds as it was meant to be seen see the original 1953 george pal's war of the worlds.this remake is what i consider see only once and forget about it........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining movie...","review":"This was a good movie that I enjoyed better than the original.

I'd turn on the TV or radio to try and find out what I just saw! I sure wouldn't go make peanut butter sandwiches!Tom Cruise was the wrong man for this movie. Sorry. A 40 year old Mel Gibson would have been great, or maybe Harrison Ford.The script was poor, with many puzzling comments.

Don't look too closely at those plot holes...Just sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'war' that's worth viewing.","review":"I went into this not expecting very much, but I ended up enjoying it.

It had plenty of action and thrills, not to mention the special effects were top-notch. I definetly can't wait for this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Visual Nightmare","review":"WAR OF THE WORLDS is a bit depressing. It has an uneasy feel to it. Visually some of the images are very disturbing and have a nightmarish quality about them. However, Tom Cruise gives a very low-key performance in his anti-hero becoming a hero in his role as the downtrodden father. Tim Robbins almost steals this movie in a standout performance as a man losing his humanity by events he can't control. The Cruise character seems to constantly evaluate events, regain his control and move on. He gains strength from his struggle and the weakness of the Robbins character. Spielberg and company did a good job here. In all, this film is good. It adds several dimensions over the George Pal film, while ignoring others, but is no better or worse in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"If they were showing this movie to the inmates at Guantanamo I'd understand what the ACLU is so worked up about."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHUT THE KID UP!!!!","review":"This movie is great as far as special effects and keeping in tune with the book, but Spielberg, having to make a \\"family\\" situation again, has this little girl in the movie who is bossy, and a brat, who screams in a high pitched voice with her tantrums with Cruise calming her down over and over. It is annoying as all hell. Who wants to watch a parent trying to calm down a screaming bratty kid throughout the movie! It was irritating! Just because Spielberg makes a movie, he doesn't piss gold. If he leaves the \\"family orientation\\" out of some of his movies and get right down to a decent plot, it would be more enjoyable. Less kid screaming in the future please."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS SOOOO OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!","review":"Yes, I liked the movie a lots good special effects and a lots action.

Not worth seeing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden Acting","review":"I found this film ridiculously bad for Tom Cruise to be in. Tom's all right, it's just his movie son and daughter seem unbelieveably bad. I'm not saying acting is easy, especially when you are about 9 and 16, but I thought their acting lacked character, believability and any shred of credibility.I also didn't find the plot believable what so ever. Just not my type of film I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Special Effects, little meaning or plot","review":"If you didn't read the book, the movie will make little sense to you. Most of the story is based on the main character running away from the machines, and it gets tedious after a while because the plot doesn't change much. Most of the action is at the beginning and the end, and the middle pretty much fills up screen time. The characters are poorly developed, and interactions between them are overly and unecessarily dramatic.But there are good special effects for the aliens and the machines, slightly redeeming the poorly developed characters. The movie doesn't really explain many of the concepts behind the plot, and assumes that you'll know them, making some parts of the movie very confusing and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and worst Spielberg movie yet!","review":"I think Spielberg conned a lot of people into seeing this movie based on his reputation. Well, his reputation isn't quite so good anymore. Just about everyone I've talked to who has seen this movie agrees that it is just plain boring. The original was significantly better. There is no plot to this version, you wait and wait for the action to happen and it never happens. The special effects (what little there was) were mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real stinker...","review":"cruise continues to act like the only lessons he's ever received were from watching low budget b rated flicks. he's stiff, stupid, and just a real downer to watch. he seems to bring down the supporting cast as well. the only real actors in this movie are the cgi aliens. it's a shame he drags down two possibly talented kids.cruise needs to give up acting and maybe turn his attention to making dental posters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that good special effects cannot save a movie","review":"Regardless of the impressive special effects, this movie is REALLY bad. The dialogue and character development are shallow and uninteresting. The alien-human confrontation in the basement was just like the dinosaur-human confrontation in the kitchen of Jurassic Park (mirror trick and everything). Nothing really innovative here. I giggled out loud when Cruise sings the lullaby from \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" to calm down his daughter. Wow. This is a bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"War of the Worlds","review":"Action, great effects, wow Best version by a long shot.Tom was outstanding.I and my family were very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schizo Movie","review":"This is a movie that couldn't decide what it wanted to be.At the beginning, the aliens vaporize all the humans they can, so it looks like they want the earth for it's natural resources. But they first came here millions of years ago before humans were here, so why didn't they just take it then. Huh??At the end, the aliens have come here to eat us as food. If that was the case, why did they vaporize their groceries at the beginning of the movie. Huh???Mostly, it is a movie filled with gore for no good purpose in the plot. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for special effects...","review":"Great specials effects, decent direction, OK acting but (and this is important I think) no plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Weak -","review":"The movie struggles, primarily because of the ridiculous extra conflicts thrown into the plot - mostly involving Tom Cruise and his two children. Further, Cruise himself adds nothing, and the film's introduction of the 'space-men' couldn't be more implausible if Spielberg tried. Eventually, just as hope is almost lost, the invaders from other worlds succumb to plain old bacteria. (But what about the effect on humans of the alien bacteria they brought with them?) Further, the film's depiction of airplanes falling out of the sky and cars dying because of an enormous electromagnetic pulse doesn't square with reality - both have their own sources of electricity and could continue operating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful to look at, empty of character","review":"These days, amazing and realistic special effects are the price of entry for any film that wants to be taken seriously in the U.S. marketplace. And Spielberg, one of the inspirational creators of the modern standard in special effects, delivers visually without missing a beat...but fails pitifully where it comes to story and characterization. As a huge fan of the George Pal classic with Gene Barry as the beleguered hero, I desperately wanted this latest \\"War of the Worlds\\" to be as just as fascinating. Instead, the performances are wooden, predictable and--yes--boring. Rent it to say you've seen it; the effects are indeed excellent. But don't spend any more time or money unless you're going back for the PAL version. This one disappoints mightily."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Terrible acting, terrible storyline.

I've heard that it was \\"OK\\", but watchabe. So I watched it. I liked the beginning, it was story building about Cruise's character Ray and how it all started. It was very suspenseful through the chase scenes and the will-they or won't-they be caught scenes. But it wrapped up so quickly that it was insulting to the viewer. I was really into the movie for a while, but all of a sudden, it ended; and without good reason. It's almost as if the guys ran out of money to make or ran out of ideas to end it. It had a lot of potential, but it just lacked an ending. It's certainly worth watching once, but I wouldn't bother with it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Quality Worse than DVD","review":"I notice a lot of folks spend more time reviewing the movie than the actual quality of the disc. So here goes:I have approximately 350 + Blu-Rays and this is by far the worst quality disc I have ever seen! Seriously, I have never seen such a grainy picture in my life. I played the movie on my 65\\" Panasonic (brand new) and was extremely disappointed. I ended up turning the movie off about 45 minutes in. Don't waste your dollars on this. If you're wondering what kind of player I was using, it is an OPPO BDP-95 which is an audiophile grade player that is better then 99% of players on the market so I'm sure this horrible picture quality wasn't due to my player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original version","review":"I watched this movie on one of the movie channels to see if it's worth adding to my DVD collection. If you don't like the subplot of a dysfunctional family, stick with the movie that was made in the 1950s, it's the BEST version. I stopped watching within the first hour (if that long) because the characters played by the children are SICKENING! As for the little girl, smart I like, not smart-ass! The young man, in the immortal words of Fred Sandford could have used, \\"one across the lips!\\" In fact, several! This is one movie that should have an alternative beginning with the children being the first victims of the aliens or completely omitted! Stick with the 50's verison! Also, if EVERYTHING has lost power, how come the mini-van was still able to function? Yeah, the starter was replaced but what about the battery? The generator? The alternator? Duh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money on this loser","review":"This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Massive budget and that't it. No plot, no character development, poor direction, lousy screenplay, amateurish overacting, poor casting, etc. I was hoping the aliens would win and quickly vaporize the cast so I wouldn't have to suffer through this train wreck any longer than necessary. There was no one and I mean, no one in this film that I cared about or even found interesting. The special effects were not even all that great. Total failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychotic melodrama","review":"I watched this movie trying to make up my own mind, following all the publicity and less than flattering pre-release reviews. Unfortunately, the movie disappointed big time. Don't get me wrong, the effects, the sound etc. are very enjoyable, but the artistic value of this movie is minimal at best. Oh yes, you have to be a real cinematographic master to screw up such a fantastic material of Wells so badly! The essence and the spirit of the original is watered down by cliche directing and the immature self-centered acting by Tom Cruise, who is a real drag in this movie. In my view, the original brilliant novel has been turned into a cheap psychotic melodrama.In short, just do yourself a favor and watch Scary Movie 4 instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know what movie YOU were watching, but.......","review":"ugh! yikes! where do i begin?TERRIBLE film! horrible! no character development, basic weak plot that left no emotional investment. all it is, is blowing things up! speilberg never should have the shown the aliens, they were laughable at best!This film first problem is with the script. some actors can take even the most utter crap, and turn it into mediocre watchable stuff. no one in this film can do this! Tom might be able to LEARN, considering his Fiancee is the always amazing Katie Holmes. everyone else is basically screwed. Dakota Fanning could have really done well, considering the pressure of a life and death situation, but she just screamed and i wanted to club her! she was the biggest baby! disappointing, because she's best young actress of our time, and to see such a terrible performance, was disheartening.just a mess of a film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrrifying and Mesmerizing.","review":"Heck I never really cared for Tom Cruise in any movie Ive seen him in because his lines were always delivered without any emotion or ummph.But in this movie he says little over the course of 2 hours which is great because you dont need much dialogue, and Cruise manages to convey the horror of whats happening by reacting to them with his face.If anyone remembers the Jeff Wayne Musical of this story and the Martians sound \\"OOOOHHHH LAAAAAAA \\" be prepared because these aliens have the most haunting bone chilling calling sound that I never expected.The aliens themselves are ok, they do remind one of the Independence day Aliens, just about 5 times bigger, but are wonderfully animated.The site of the martians striding over hill and dale on their tripod legs will no doubt be the one biggest memory one brings home.No its not HG Wells novel, but Im sure had he would have loved these Martians."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Few could deny that War of the Worlds has its share of flaws, but capable direction and special effects coupled with a few outstanding scenes make this film (just) worth recommending despite its ludicrous and abrupt ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spielberg the dream killer","review":"I'm so glad to read, that there are still some people who see this film as pure trash. What a big disappointment! Tom Cruise is just miscasted(a New Yorker? please) and why in the world would a director introduce a dysfunctional family that would scream throughout the movie at each other and deal with the aliens like a secondary problem. H.G.Wells masterpiece is so torn apart that I'm so glad the Gene Barry version (1953)is on DVD to view. It's extremely sad that Spielberg would put this out, I was so excited to hear he was doing it with great expectations and to see the end result, it felt like if the Russians had come back and scored a 2 goals and beat the US Hockey team for gold...now that's disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible, but certainly not good either","review":"I was hoping for a better movie. Certainly a disappointment considering the talent involved. All in all, a mediocre movie. Poor photography and lighting throughout. One of the most basic elements of movie making is to make the viewer care about the characters and in that regard the movie fails completely. It's very difficult to care about characters who are complete idiots. The father acts as if he has an IQ of about 80-90, the son about 70-80 and the daughter even lower. I won't even mention the other characters in the movie who uniformly act subhuman.Doesn't begin to match the Gene Barry original. Perhaps we can have a better remake in 4 or 5 years when everyone has forgotten this dismal effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"If your looking for a thrilling,Steven Spielberg summer movie,this isn't the one. The film starts off well,but after the first 4o min, it begins to loose steam,FAST. After the that, I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Seems like the exciting summer films that Spielberg used to make are over, at least with this one. It's not very thrilling,scary, or exciting, and the plot, to say the least, is pointless, leaves alot of holes, and leaves you wanting more (or maybe not). The preview looked exciting, but the film is utterly BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"Spielberg and Cruise...two of the biggest hacks in Hollywood!If Steve-o really wanted to make a scary film, he should have done TomKat The Movie!

Some of the special effects were great, but the tripods were just plain silly. The aliens' motive and techniques seem ludricous. The aliens completely disintegrated people(but not their clothing) at the beginning, but then later in the movie, the aliens captured people and used their blood for fertilizing their blood red, vine-like, plants. Yes, it was pretty silly. I liked Spielberg's and Cruise's collobaration in \\"Minority Report,\\" but I was bored with this. The kids did the best they could with their parts, but I really wanted the aliens to kill them after a while. The girl's constant screaming and the boy's attitude were annoying. I know Morgan Freeman, who did the voiceover at the beginning and the end, was reading from \\"War of the Worlds,\\" but it really did not help. I like H. G. Wells, but the ornate style of the book didn't fit the rest of the movie.My wife said it set a new low for bad movies. I agree it was pretty pedestrian and it never soars."},{"rating":"2","title":"spielberg has scored again, big time!","review":"This movie is a definate winner. Spielberg did a great job with this movie! I like it as much as his indiana jones and jaws! Spielberg has a gift, and took it to the max to make this movie.

It's great speicial affects made the movie even better!Over all I'd give this a two thumps up! You need to get it, and watch it if you havn't.Warning!

The first 10 minutes were interesting and I couldn't wait for the movie to get better with the introduction of the aliens. The aliensarrival was pretty cool with the tripod zapping all the humans. But after that, the movie went down hill for me. I was expecting better performances from Tom Cruise and more professional work fromSpeilberg. I found Dakota Fanning's screaming really annoying and the other kid of Tom Cruise's character really stupid. Trying to go off and join the army at the last minute with no gun or no training.One good thing I can say about this movie is that the SFX were really superb and realistic. But there are a lot of people who love and hate this movie, thats why I gave this movie 1 star for effort. A real dissapointment from a top class director. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't I see this already","review":"This movie is an amazing display of what special affects can do. Outside of that this movie is aweful.

Even considering it's sci-fi, this movie relies extraordinarily on it's audience to ignore inconsistencies, contradictions, and improbabilities.It's sad to see such a master of film in Spielberg turn out such a piece of junk. Based on the relatively positive reviews from the media, it's also a testament to the power he has to sway reviewers, regardless of the quality of the movie.Don't make the mistake I did, find something else to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent re-visioning of Wells, and all that implies","review":"H.G. Wells was not a believer in the good nature of human beings, and his science fiction was more often than not an exploration of our darker nature. It was refreshing to me, as a sci-fi fan, that the movie retained these elements. There is no fight here. Humanity is being exterminated by powerful aliens, it's hopeless, and there's little to do but run. This movie captures these claustrophobic feelings quite well.Cruise, in the midst of his well-publicized media freak-out/rant, puts on IMO the best performance of his career, here.. The alien machines are (FINALLY) the great lumbering tripods they were meant to be, and the scenes of destruction and panic are some of the best I've seen (btw- this film really needs to be seen in 5.1 - the sound is an underappreciated star of this movie).If you're a fan of the book, I recommend this. If you're looking for gung-ho heroics, you'll probably want to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary study only","review":"In trying to keep a very open mind in regards to this movie, I was very dissapointed. I feel Spielberg could have done much better if he would have introduced some scientific facts to the movie as was in the novel and in the 1953 version. More could have been shown during the battle scenes. The graphics and Spielbergs version were excellent. The really outstanding part of the whole movie was the Grandparents, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, who stared in the original 1953 version, a good move on Spielbergs part. All in all the movie could have been much much better, especially with todays technology and advancements in the film industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"engrossing remake","review":"four and a half stars.A taunt thriller that begins with a very few minutes of ordinary life followed by inexplicable weather activity followed by all hell breaking loose. The effects are intense and devastating, the direction tight and powerful, and the small cast excellent. There is not a great deal of character development as the characters are running for their lives almost from the get-go. Typical Speilberg family dynamics are there, but subtle and they work well--thankfully there are no \\"foxhole\\" moments. Cruise, Fanning, and Robbins are great. I sense some 1-star reviews are driven by disgust with the Cruise publicity circus; well, it's a free country! I think he is quite effective here. I'm getting to be a big fan of the Speilberg/Cruise Sci-Fi. Folks who say rent the 1953 original instead of this are really being silly. This remake is a great update."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Budget Effects and a Stellar Cast!","review":"This big budget send off of H.G. Wells literary classic pays homage to both the novel and its 60s predecessor and really delivers the goods. Shockingly realistic in it's amost graphic portrayal of a Martian attack on earth eerily comes across in its post 9-11 arrival. Tom Cruise leads the cast as estranged father, Ray Ferrier, who has to come to terms with the very essence of the protective father to his teenage son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) once it comes down to a fight and flee situation and a battle for survival when the invasion takes on the total destruction of mankind. Tim Robbins puts in a memorable performance as the insane basement dweller Oglivy, yet another threat albeit \\"human\\" one to Ferrier's family. Dazzling special effects by Speilberg, yet once again, provides many heart pounding, surrealistic and nail biting scenes! Definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best with the sound turned off","review":"The special effects are stunning, but the plot was an insult. It featured a father who could not stay married, a little girl who's main tactic was screeching, and a boy who did his best to get killed. Apparently stupidity lets you fall in icewater and spend the night in wet clothes without ill effect. The father kills a character who gave him food and shelter because the character showed some initiative - wanted to attack the aliens where they were vulnerable. The movie featured EMP effects that could take out a starter solenoid, but did not affect delicate engine management computers or cell phones. All gun use was shown to be suicidal or criminal. The good guys won because they were photogenic. Watching grass grow would be a lot less irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I really enjoyed the previous reviews, which were very discriptive of the movie. I don't need to reiterate thier fine reviews. My feelings from watching SS WOTW were of being ripped off. I did not feel that this movie was based on HG Wells work. It had the beginning and an end, with a couple of references added here and there. Other than that, it was a cookie cutter action film of the same old SS family, with a showcase of ILM's cgi effects, which was it's usual fine work. But as for Spielberg's part, the story is just full of holes and it all seemed rushed and slapped together. Sure, it is something to watch I guess. I just expected so much more from this powerhouse line-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This movie totally SUCKED! The original is much better even though this one has the big boomy special effects. Good thing too, cuz that's about all it had going for it! The acting sucked.

It's all about the graphics and the aliens for my son and me but we felt cheated. The movie follows Tom Cruise around as he runs and runs while the real action and what I wanted to see was outside. In one scene jets fire missiles at the aliens but it all happens out of sight. What a shame to waste all this effort. We now own this DVD only because it came free in a buy-two-get-one-free sale at EA Games. We'll watch it again for the graphics but the story leaves a lot to be desired. We will always wish this movie could have been what we hoped it would be but fell way short.Given the great old 1953 version was such a classic, and this one is such a bomb, perhaps there is still room for a good remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientology","review":"It's kinda ironic that Tom Cruise, a Scientologist is in this movie.

Not only does he have to deal with laser beams vaporizing his friends and neighbors, but now he has to deal with a teenage son who hates him! The poor guy! If that's not enough, now the citizens of this country have become nothing more than panic-stricken animals who want control of his mini-van. Unfortunately, that seems to be the only plausible plot The rest of this movie is nothing but special effects and Dakota Fanning's screaming.

What a bad storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been...","review":"This movie could have been a contender! The effects are great, but the characters are really bad. Half way through the movie, you almost end up rooting for the tri-pods because the writing in the movie is so bad. Here's a good drinking game: take a shot each time the little girl screams. You'll be drunk before long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, another steamy pile from spielberg and cruise","review":"Sorry, after minority report, which actually looked great compared to this performance of cruise, i didn't think it could get worse...yeah, it did. I didn't rank a one because it was a classic story, and the action was ok at times, but Crazy Cruise was just a stinker in it. I just didn't care for his performance. I can't help expecting every time tom cruise opens his mouth to expect to hear \\"show me the money\\". I was hoping spielberg would have cast an unknown in this spot, or someone that could look a bit more grubby, more manly, cruise still looks like a kid. Definitely not the original radio brodcast. Tim Robins did a fair job, I would have liked to see him in the main character roll than cruise. Catch this one on TV, HBO or something, or rent it if you must, just not my collection type movie though. I know my review is taking a beating, but I just didn't care for this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound!!","review":"I love this movie but what really blow my mind is the sound of the DVD especially the DTS, its one of the best sound I ever listen. I bought this edition because I really don't care much for the special features that are include in the 2 disc edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Video","review":"The video quality of this \\"Blu-ray\\" was horrible. Picture was grainy throughout. The sound was good enough quality, but without a decent pic what good is it? Bought the $7.99 special...'nuf said."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK!!!!","review":"To get the bad taste out of my mouth, I had to pop the original DVD into my player after suffering through what seemed like six hours with this HORRIBLE remake!! If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good not great","review":"A very good but not great movie that sci-fi fans should enjoy.Spielberg's War of the Worlds is another intense, edge-of-your-seat thrillride in the vein of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jurassic Park. Although it's certainly more like the latter as War of the Worlds is a dark, menacing, frightening tale of alien invasion. I would consider it the best alien invasion movie I have ever seen. Hopefully it will make people forget that dreadful Independence Day from nine years ago. Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp bring a unique perspective to the alien invasion genre. It's a smaller-scale movie which follows only Tom Cruise's character and his family instead of trying to juggle a huge cast of characters on a global scale. This decision results in the film being more realistic and more believable, and I believe more successful, as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a lot to desire","review":"War of the Worlds is a visual masterpiece, but there's more to a movie the FX. The film has no plot, really bad acting and a lot of plot holes. Cruise seems annyoing (maybe because I've seen to much of him in the news), and Fanning has once again managed to be really, really annoying. About 7 years have past since Independence Day came out, but this movies seems like its ugly twin brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller/Comedy/Action/Great","review":"I loved this actiony, comedy, thriller type classic. It\`s quite funny, belive it or not. I saw it when it came out, that day. Let me tell you the tickets were sold out when I going to see the 7:45 show, so I had to see the 8:40 show. Oh my gosh the line was unbeliveable. It was so long and good enough I got cool seats. Some people couldn\`t find seats. Anyway the begining was awesome and funny. My favorite line was when Rachael {Dakota Fanning, my favorite actress, the reason I saw the movie mostly} said You told us to order and then Tom says I told you to order food. Well the reason they said this is because Tom bit into what Dakota ordered which was humus and Tom thought it was disgusting. Any way the middle was a thriller. The ending was sweet and actiony.Oh you have to see this movie!!!!!!!! It rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And that\`s a fact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is frickin' horrible","review":"I saw this with a friend because the commercial looked good. Man, was I disappointed. We laughed several times during the movie, and it's not supposed to be funny. Speilberg used to be the best director. What happened? His movies were so good that you didn't just watch them, you felt them. Now he's like his buddy George Lucas. He's lost his touch with age. This overhyped, plodding, pointless film is just another in a continuously growing line of Spielberg toilet paper. Take some money out of your wallet and wipe your a$$ with it, and you'll feel better than wasting it and your time on War of the Worlds. It's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Rooting For The Aliens","review":"When human beings make a movie this bad they deserve to die! Maybe the martians can do better? Unfortunately, for the viewing public the humans win."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much special effects; too little screenplay or plot","review":"Definitely not Spielberg's best. He tries too hard to make a different movie but ends up relying excessively in inane special effects and confusing plot diversions. Many opportunities were lost that may have conveyed a more convincing story. And the ending arrives so disappointingly...For a much better plot and ending see the original 1953 movie, also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor ending that left you feeling like Jurrasaic Park","review":"The premise of the this movie had potential but Steven Speilberg blew it. I felt like I was watching Jurassaic Park -- it was all so fictional. And the ending -- I don't want to ruin it for the viewer but it comes out of nowhere and typifies the Hollywood way. After two hours of a bleak and insurmountable fight, everything somehow ends up ok in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Special Effect","review":"What a dissapointment to what could have been an amazing re-telling of a remarkable sci-fi story. This movie was one big special effect from the beginning to the end. The story was lost. H.G. Wells would roll over in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mess","review":"Possibly one of the worst movies of the year. The combined talents of Speilberg and Cruise amount to less than adequate. To take an excellent Wells story and turn it into this trash is a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"No story","review":"Where's the story line??? It appeared Tom and his kids spent the 2 hours running from NY to Boston. The 1953 version with Gene Barry and Ann Robinson is far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as Eyes wide shut........","review":"this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen...totally inconsistent..\\"far superior aliens\\" come to earth to use machines that were buried from before? why didn't they use their machines when they first brought them here? why did they start blowing people up only to collect them later on? the whole story line sucked-it's based on tom cruise getting him idiot kids to boston where his ex-wife and in-laws come out perfectly attired-the only people in the whole world unscathed! THE SUPERIOR ALIENS HAVE BEEN CHECKING US OUT FOR QUITE A WHILE (THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS) YET FAILED TO CHECK IF THEY CAN LIVE, DRINK, EAT, OR BREATHE HERE!!! WHAT MORONS..or is that what \\"the powers that be\\" want us to think?"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This was seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I love movies. I watched it at home with three other people and we all wanted to turn the movie off within minutes but didn't hoping that it would get better. It didn't. The acting was overdone, plot full of holes, and just plain irritating. The characters were stupid and irrating and completely unlikeable. We were constantly yelling at the screen because off the ridiculous behavior of the characters. Don't even waste your time on this movie, it's two hours you will never get back, instead spend your time doing something more enjoyable, like getting a root canal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Being a big fan of the original 1950's movie version, I was immensely disappointed with this \\"dumbed down\\" modern version of this classic story. Missing were the interesting and thought provoking scientific and religious themes of the original version. The protagonist, instead of being a curious and brave scientist, is dumbed down to a blue collar worker whose only interest is in protecting his children. Spielberg no doubt thought that this would add more drama to appeal to the masses, but instead it makes the plot boring and tedious, especially for adult audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY A MASTERPIECE","review":"War of the Worlds, directed by Steven Speilberg, has got to be the best movie in years. In the middle of the war between human and aliens, one family (Cruise and Fanning) try to survive. And we get the best. We see how Cruise saves his daughter Dakota, and how far he'll go to save her.Speilberg again delivers great shoots. The camcorder shoot (when it falls to the ground) was awesome, and his aliens looked creepy and weird! The tripod machines, and the story behind them, were amazing. This movie, believe it or not, would get you close to crying because its something we might experience in the future. Also because of Fanning, who once again proves she has got to be the most talented young actress ever.Watch it while you still can, because you have to see this movie to believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless Fun Alien Flick","review":"It was great! I know some people don't quite agree, but I thought it was an excellent alien movie. It was a great movie for Speilberg to direct and had great roles for Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, both of whom were fantastic. I know some people don't like the ending, but it is the same ending as in the book and I actually liked it. It was a good resolution to a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Special Effects - Maudlin Story","review":"Good thing the martians invaded, otherwise this poor dysfunctional family might never have worked out their problems.Honestly, the kids in this movie were so spoiled and whiny I was hoping the martians would fry them with their death ray.Plus the basement scene was idiotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Hype but Little Substance","review":"I tried to view this movie with an open mind and had great hopes for it when it began. This quickly faded as I realized this was just an adaptation of the \\"Amazing Race\\" with a slight change of cast. The special effects were good, as can be expected, but seriously there is not much of a plot - Tom Cruise is running from aliens and their terrible machines, trying to keep his two kids alive. I have to admit I didn't catch the very end, as I either had to use the rest room or took a phone call. The original is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor ending makes for a bad movie!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed MOST of this movie, but it ended so poorly that I left the theater feeling rather disappointed. This is really too bad, because the movie starts off well and the storyline does a great job of building suspense. Tom was pretty good in his role, although I've seen better performances from him in other movies. Dakota Fanning was fabulous. The special effects were fine, nothing really new, but not bad. Just not exceptional. But the ending! After building you up to expect a big climax, it just poops out. I left the theater asking myself and others: What's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Flaws and more entertaining than the Average Summer Blockbuster","review":"H.G. Wells has been served far better than anyone has any right to expect.Spielsberg has created a cautionary tale about Imperialism and our complacency in the dominance over our affairs, and given us a great \\"Chase movie\\". While characterization is slight, and there are nits to be found everywhere, the movie strikes balances of horror, terror, and enough breathing space to keep the audience primed for the next inhumanity.Tripods! Death Rays! Irredeemably evil Aliens! And Cruise doesn't even save the world, although he does a lot better than many of his compatriots. The ending, and the defeat of the Aliens is completely true to the source material.Bring the popcorn and get ready for the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"The movie was good. But I couldn't tell if it was Blu ray or not. The clarity was bad. Didn't look HD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for collection","review":"I love this movie and the suspense is always palpable even though I have seen it at least 3 times. So glad to have this in my sc- fi collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was torn....","review":"..about whether or not to even see this movie. Cruise is just like nails on chalk board, but Speilberg is a master of entertainment.After living through this film -- well half of it anyway -- I can assure you of two things: (1) I'll never watch anything else by Cruise, who is becoming a charicature of himself in every role, no matter who else is stupid enough to work with him and (2) Speilberg will know better than to ever do so again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"I expected more out of this film- Spielberg and Cruise gave expectations that. Unfortunatelly this remake fell short. Althought visual effects were decent, I felt that the screenplay did not provide the stars with enough of a story in order to please the audience. It was not a box office hit and that says a lot especially when it had names like Spielberg and Cruise behind it. However if you do not have high expectations, this film is watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Hollywood (once again)!","review":"This film is probably one of the worst films ever made! Even 'Mac and Me' was better than this garbage. Clear evidence that not even Spielberg himself could save a horrendous script. Anybody that gave this film more than 1 star needs their head re-examined. Nothing more that needs to be said than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray transfer is a huge disappointment!","review":"I have to completely agree with many other reviewers on the Blu-ray version of War of the Worlds. I was very anxious to bring home my new $25 copy only to be highly disappointed as the movie began. The graininess is very distracting and a complete turn off for me. The sound though is still on par for DTS and excellent in all aspects. I should have better spent the $25 on something else more worthy. There is no good excuse for not having put forth a better effort for the ultimate transfer that this movie greatly deserves. Buyers beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a Waste","review":"After a terrific first hour, the film just nosedives and never resurfaces. Tom Cruise is the last person you cast as an everyman because he's Tom Cruise and is only successful at playing Tom Cruise. Tim Robbins doesn't fare much better with his overacting; his presence is even more of a detriment. And don't get me started on the God-awful \\"love conquers all\\" ending. What a waste of Steven Spielberg's talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointment","review":"This movie is completely rubbish. People who might be tempted to view this movie because of Jared Martin's \\"War of the worlds\\" TV series are bound to be disapointed.Rather than buying this DVD, i would suggest buying a DVD of Jared Marstin's TV series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Moive","review":"This Moive is so bad who would give it five stars. I went to see this moive because it had good people in it. It was bad however. Do not buy this moive tust me. If you need a good moive buy Star wars but do not get this. This had a lot o hype but did not do will at the moives."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my time and yours!","review":"When I was only an hour into this film, I knew it was a disaster! It's just boring!!! Plain dull UN-believable and boring. The movie takes way too long to develop its plot; it just goes on and on and on and on. And Tom Cruise's kids are not believable. Dakota, the little girl, screams in a very fake way in a couple of scenes. Unfortunately, it's too forced. The kids as a whole, are more annoying than anything and their acting is not up to par! There are many nice \\"visuals\\" and these tend to drag on too long. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the citizens are shown like a million times! Enough! We know they are there! Now, get to the plot. I expected so much better from Spielberg. Perhaps it's time for him to go back to the drawing board. We come to expect better of him and I hope he reads these reviews on this movie! Spielberg, get it right next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORE OF A WAR!!!!","review":"When I first heard this movie was coming, I was excited. I expected it to be as good as the first, maybe better. I ignored the hoopla surrounding Tom Cruise and scientology, and hoped the movie would succeed in spite of it.Unfortuantely, the movie does not. It starts out all right. The scenes of the alien tripod creatures obliterating Americaare impressive, the scenes involving the refugees were equally intense. All good things come to an end, though, and mid-way the movie winds down. When the action picks up again, you know that Cruise will be the hero of the day until the microbes prove themselves bigger heroes of the day.Perhaps the main thing working against the movie, though, is its being a re-make. Almost every science fiction fan in existence has seen the first War of the Worlds, giving the second movie a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling.If special effects turn you on, see this at the big screen. Otherwise, I recommend waiting until it hits the DVDs or Comcast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood throw up.","review":"Hearing so much of how this movie was to be the movie of the decade has jaded me a bit because I spent so much money seeing this in the theater with my family and feel so jipped out of my money. It looks totally unfinished and what's with the appearing and disappearing long poncho on Dakota Fanning?? I'm certain this movie was shot without a complete script and it wouldn't surprise me to find out Speilberg and Cruise never even read the classic novel. Too many facts are wrong or off in this film. It is uneven and rushed and what the H2@#! I expect more from such an allegedly expensive movie. The independent War of the Worlds movies are MUCH better and more entertaining and I highly recommend saving your money here and checking out the classic Victorian movie version instead. Let's hope Spielberg gets his head screwed on in the future and makes something we can all be proud of, like the original Jaws. Buyers beware here because this movie is a pooper and not one to be proud of."},{"rating":"1","title":"The film just doesn't do it!","review":"There are better versions of the H.G. Wells story on in video format. Tom Cruise has done better work and hopefully will again. His character seems to need a spine and some Murine, not anything like the H.G. Wells hero! The \\"Tripods\\" are ok, the SFX are okay, the plot sticks somewhat close to the book. Batman Begins was much more interesting! If you already saw that one, check out Mr. and Mrs. Smith!!!!! That's techno and funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dakota fanny","review":"ithink dakota fanny or what ever ruined the movie with all that screaming don't get me wrong i liked some of the special effects but me persoanly i would Have sacrificed her in the begining she probally the worst young actress ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone Else Thought of it First . . .","review":"It's a good movie and well worth seeing, but the whole concept of tripods rather than the original flying machines was taken from a book written 35 years ago. That book, \\"The White Mountains,\\" was the first part of a trilogy. The Spielberg movie borrows not only the concept of the tripods, but actually nearly copies at least one key scene directly from the book. I read \\"The White Mountains\\" and the other books as a young guy, and I'm pretty sure that anyone who enjoys this Spielberg movie will get a kick out of those old books too, and I believe you can get all four books (a fourth book called \\"When the Tripods Came\\" was eventually added to the trilogy) for a very low price. You'll immediately recognize the key scene I'm referring to if you read the first book, \\"The White Mountains\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie I've Seen In a Long Time","review":"That's right, this is the best movie I've seen all year! Infact, this is one of the best action movies ever made, in my opinion. Steven Spielberg is easily my favorite director and always has been. He has made so many classic movies that are always fun to watch. War of the Worlds gets the full monty from me. This film had a lot of realistic eye-popping special effects, great acting, good plot, and kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. If you give this movie 1 star and say it sucks, well I've got news for you, you suck! This movie is awesome and deserves all of the admiration it gets. Dakota Fanning (great child actress) and Tom Cruise were excellent in their character roles. I loved this movie, what else can I say? Go see it yourself and have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Spielberg Just Special Effects","review":"Very dissapointing film except for the special effects.

We don't know why Tom Cruise's character commits an inexplicable murder. The ending is never explained.

Something unexpected from Spielberg.","review":"This movie is terrible. Only when I saw the Director's commentary in 'Special Features' I found out that the aliens caught flu/cold. It is hard to understand movie. Tom Cruise yells \\"The Shield\\" towards the end of the movie and then the spaceship is attcked with javelins. Given Tom cruise's interest in automobile repairs earlier in the movie it sounded like he had found a fault in some windshield of the spaceship or something. But NO it was the flu virus that saved the earth. Thanks. Tom Cruise's acting is terrible. He has a cute face but certainly he is not an actor. Direction is awful.Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"War of the Worlds flop","review":"Ok don't get me wrong I loved the idea and the theory in the movie. The plot was just great. And the idea. But the actors sucked, that little girl I think she just got the job if she could she she was whiney enough. As far as character flow as in they are a family I sure didn't see it at all. Tom Cruise acted through the whole film as just an actor didn't really make me feel like he was tryint to 'get into' the part at all. Just readin lines from a card. And 3/4 way through the movie the son takes off after the aliens and ya never see him again till the end. What did he do? When the militarty was gettin blowin up he made it through? It made no sense. A remake in 2 years with good actors and I'd give it 5 stars if it kept the same storyline. If ya think of renting this have your buddy pay for it. Or go in half cause it's sure not worth full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic Spielberg!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is a very grim, summer action flick. It was advertised like an action movie, but its more of a psycolgical thriller. It explore how people act when they are put against something that seems invinsable. Tom Cruise is very good in this movie. He always seems like he's scared and that he's aware of what is happening. THIS FILM IS NOT A PG-13!!!! The MPAA rated this one wrong, in my opinion. There is a lot of swearing, brusome violence(that is suggested, not really shown) and a brutal murder scene(again, suggested not shown). I was very impressed with this film, but I usually am by Spielberg. He's the best storyteller in modern movie making, and very good and telling a great story, while providing exciting action.Great movie, BUY IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the stupidest movies ever seen","review":"totally going nowhere and don't know how to end it, so as always the only cliched way out, the aliens suddenly died, the aliens' killing machines only got a crab shell-like armor on top, and nothing underneath (like achilles' heel). after all the bing! bang! bong!!! the h.g. wells' story and the screenplay neither could go on and on, and so, you know.....what a stupid movie!why always make the aliens with three dumb long fingers? how could they make machines with those stupid hands and fingers? how could they create their civilization with those hands, legs and heads? do you think they could use that kind of hands and 3 fingers to hold a needle, a screw driver and design hi-tech stuff? totally crap!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The special effects are believable the plot is not","review":"There are so many problems with the plot that it is completely unbelievable.1.

When all the electronic equipment was fried buy the lighting strikes some equipment was still working.etc, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such A Disappointment","review":"I honestly haven't been this disappointed in a movie in a long time. I fully expected at least an entertaining movie with Spielberg at the helm, but just kept sitting there watching, and waiting, and watching, and waiting...for something (anything?) to grab my attention. The arrival of the aliens and the effects were solid; other than that, I was never on the edge of my seat. I found the entire film lacking in any suspense or excitement. The characters were not even interesting, and certainly nowhere near compelling - and the storyline just jumped around aimlessly until the abrupt end. I'd just watch some re-runs of Independence Day, Cocoon or Signs to see some fun, suspenseful alien movies. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The special effects were clearly the star attraction rather than the story. They were seriously overdone and the acting, even with Tom Cruise, who happens to be a favourite, didn't help much. A BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Science in Science Fiction","review":"One thing that the movie lacks is a focus on science in the context of science fiction. The earlier WOTW film had a focus on the science of science fiction. Strange for Spielberg because he has done work on Apollo 13 and seemed to respect the science. The film mirrors our culture's loss of interest in science at the same time we see cuts in science budgets, religious disapproval of stem cell research, and dishonesty in editing scientific environmental reports in Washington."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original film was better.","review":"Yes, I know it was \\"originally\\" an Orson Welles radio broadcast, but I did not experience that. The 1953 Byron Haskin version of the film was much better (theatrically)than the modern version. I particularly don't like the fact that nearly every remake these days is centered around a family from a broken home, the children hate the father (even on the verge of certain death) and the father-figure can't act.Why two stars? Aside from the material of the remake being a disappointment, the visual effects didn't always work either. Blame it on the compositing and lighting, because Tom Cruise's character did not blend with the background, especially whe it was needed the most. I can go on, but I already wasted 2 hours in the theater watching this film, so I don't want to waste any more time writing a review of it. Save your money, wait for the DVD and rent it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"O. K.","review":"Spielberg's rendition of H.G. Wells' classic novel exceeds expectations in the special effects category, but the plot and acting are far from desirable. Tom Cruise does not do too bad as the main character in this film, considering how hard it can be to produce a well-liked leading role in a film based on a classic piece of literature.I would recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to see a good action movie but who will not be disappointed if the movie does not exceed the greatness of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment!","review":"This film reeks of all that is good in film. The actors are forgettable in this film, this doesn't take from the value of the film though. Forget the comparisons to the other films. Forget the novel. This film will smack you in the face. It's fun and chocked full of great effects. Cruise is the ONLY actor that makes this film believable. Spielberg's direction is impeccable. I'm not a fan or Cruise or Speilberg, but his pairing works."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"WAR\\": the GOOD, the BAD, and the UGLY","review":"Tons of reviews already, so I'll keep mine short:(A) THE GOOD:1. Eye-grabbing special effects (esp. when humans get zapped by ray-guns).2. The lighting is dark, atmospheric; good used of filters and dark tones.3. Love the BOMBASTIC BOOM bass sound made by the alien ships!4. Very appropriate, engaging musical soundtrack / special sound effects.5. Good use of crowds and mob scenes.(B) THE BAD:1. Tom Cruise's singing.2. Tom Crusie's acting / non-acting.3. Shut that screaming child up!! Bad directorial decision to have the daughter scream throughout the movie. One word: annoying.4. The ending. It worked well with the original \\"WOTW,\\" but seems inappropriate now.(C) THE UGLY:1. Ugly, unsympathetic characters, esp. Cruise's 2 spoiled brats.2. The uninteresting sub-plot of Cruise and his 2 kids takes away from the alien invasion.3. Cruise & Spielberg get minus marks for this failed remake of a CLASSIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much publicity","review":"The special effects ...AwesomeThey actually had little mistakes. Like...all the electricity was gone, even phone, clocks, blah blah...but The videocamera was working , even the digital cameras :o, how were they taking pictures if machines weren't working? :| weird (Maybe I'm wrong, sorry).Why did aliens attacked earth not knowing if the ambient they were going to enter was good for them? Its like sending US soldiers to mars with no suits before knowing if they gonna be ok or not.I think they didn't knew how to end the movie. Cause the ending was really short.Maybe it needed more alien machines, we just saw 1 :| that gets kinda boring.Needed more alien infantry, more action, not just some big alien machine shooting everybody.But special effects and sound were damn great, the intro is damn cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Scary Movie!","review":"I read the book when I was quite young and found it very frightening. The first movie didn't really scare me at all...maybe it was the time period in which it came out. Special effects weren't all that great. This new movie has to be the scariest movie I have ever seen! I was not prepared for the level of fear it generated. The sound alone was terrifying. Perhaps having a home theater helps, and a big plasma screen contributes to the overall effect, but anyone who is into special effects will love this one! The acting was excellent, and although it has a few notable flaws; I loved it. The bonus materials are great also. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, exciting movie","review":"A very interesting movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tom Cruise plays a different role than his usual in this film, he is actually not the \\"Hero\\" to anyone except for his kids, and while he does find the weakness of the enemy at one point and help save some people, he is the actual civilian Joe-Schmoe with all his faults and foibles in this movie, making him seem suddenly more \\"human\\". Alongside his daughter in the movie, the future superstar Dakota Fanning, they do a realistic job of what a typical american family in reality dealing with the struggles of paying the bills and holding down a job would do in such a situation. This movie lacks any hollywood horsecrap that has you under an illusion that this particular family is better than all the rest of us for some reason. And it (thankfully) avoids that horrible cliche of the divorced ex-wife and ex-husband reconciliation found in most of today's flicks. A must-see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunctional Family Flim","review":"Let's have no doubts about the outstanding individual performances. Cruise continues to amaze as an actor who can carry a movie by playing any part given him to its fullest expectation. That said, don't watch this movie expecting to see a science fiction version of War Of The Worlds, as you would normally expect. If you want to see a dysfunctional family at its best, this is your kind of film. I was greatly disappointed in that I expected to see the usual military/government verses the alien's confrontation. Something on a grander scale. That was my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"War of the Worlds Blu-ray","review":"I was so excited to get this movie in Blu-ray and was utterly disappointed. I kept checking to see if there was something wrong with my BluRay player. I checked my aspect ratio and my resolution to see if I could make the picture better. It's the worst picture quality I have ever seen. I can't believe they are trying to scam the public into calling this \\"Blu-ray\\".

Yeah, Spielberg did a fine job with the suspense and the visual effects looked amazing, but Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning were badly miscast (it was quite irritating to hear Fanning just shriek and shriek and shriek...).

You must swear off having children in your movies for at least 5 years, or until you have shown that you know how to do it without so much saccharin sentimentality.

That is not what disturbes me. What did disturb me was the underlying messege mixed in with these in a few scenes that 'sometimes you have to turn on your fellow man to save yourself and your own family/people.'In no part was this more apparent than in the \\"blindfold\\" scene. What in every other decent story would be seen as coldblooded and premeditated murder carried out by someone of low moral character is here passed off as a neccessary action carried out by the hero figure.After this scene I found it virtually impossible to enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't come close to the originial.","review":"Hollywood and it's uncreative powers are at it again with the remake of the classic film \\"War of the Worlds.\\" The film is so bad you wanted the alians to win.

The same old special effects and terribly acting. I am now totally convinced that the days of really good acting for Hollywood is over. It was a waste of money which i should have used to watch a new foreign film.

However, I caught about 3/4 of it and went in and out of sleep for the other 1/4.I'm sure others have mentioned these same things and more but why bury all this weaponry to attack later. Why not just continue to occupy way back then?These aliens have all this technology but are totally unaware of the danger of 'germs'.

They spent more time keeping Tom cruise and dakota fanning in isolation, with all of their sentimental bs. I fast forwarded when tom cruise sang that lullaby thing, sorry, don't need to hear Tom cruise sing! Dakota fanning acts to much like a self-aware adult, you just want to grab her and say, be a kid! act normal! I guess that is her normal but it's creepy.

I actually fell asleep watching it. Not overly impressed with Tom's performance especially with his off screen display of discoloring comments centering around depression and religion. It's fine to have your opinion, but he's using his celebraty status to use as a billboard for his political views and it's staining his image. Now, he's not just an actor, but an outspoken political natzi.

But that's beside the point, it's his only 'acting' strength. What drove me nuts was the role of the daughter who was a 9 year old hypochondriac who had a shrill scream when she was happy, when she was frightened, when she was sad, when she was startled, and when she was angry. Even the neighborhood dogs howled at every screening of this flick. Then... the role of the son, good gracious, he was ready to join the 'Army of one' abandon his family and go running after a battalion going over a hill to attack an unknown enemy. Jeez!The saving grace were the special effects. But that does not make a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"H.G.

How come technologically advanced aliens know nothing aboutbacteria and viruses? The opening voice-over says they werewatching us for a long time...so they never heard about a common cold?That aside, the worst part was the incessant high pitch screaming from the character playing Cruise' daughter.The sound effects are excellent (high-pitched screaming not withstanding) and the alien's weapons special effects make it worth the price of the rental.Alas, the movie (and the aliens) end not with a bang but a whimper, and it's all been transferred onto a grainy, washed-out DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing movie with a stupid ending","review":"The whole movie is about Tom Cruise, along with 2 uncooperative children, running away from aliens.

Fortunately, I only rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Drizzle","review":"What a letdown, I really enjoyed \\"Minority Report\\" but this was borderline awful. Cruise's character was so one dimensional and so dull actually he was almost unlikeable. If he was to represnt the common man in humanity then he failed. Dakota Fanning was the most annoying character I have ever encountered all she did was scream. I really did not care for the characters and did not care what happened to them. Check out Tim Robbins riduculous New Jersey accent too. The aliens were out of central casting and worst of all was the terrible and predictable Hollywood ending. I was bored and dissapointed. Spielberg is a whimp, see the ending. Can we just have on movie without Morgan Freeman too? He narrates the beginning and the end. I do not recommend it would make a good video game though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated!","review":"This is the worst movie Steven Spielberg has ever made, and it proves that it takes more than special effects to make a good movie. His movie lacks a good storyline, good direction, good acting and a good commentary. The start (or opening) of the movie was somewhat weak, but the end (or closing) was a lot weaker.

The present release is hampered by a disposable subplot pitting a immature blue-collar divorced dad vs snotty teenage son and relentlessly self-centered, shrilly screaming tween daughter -- if he'd fed the latter to the aliens from the git-go, they'd have fled home within seconds with their whosits between their whatevers! As a matter of fact, most of the humans seem to have escaped from one of Stephen King's less subtle unattractive-weirdo-a-thons.

This movie is 95% about Cruise and his 2 kids from a divorce and how messed up their relationship is. Interspersed with inane and just plain ridiculous reactions by Cruise and his teenage son you will see some shots of alien war craft death-raying pedestrians.An extremely forgettable film.

I have the say the special effects were outstanding but the rest of the movie was horrible.The character development was bad. There were several scenes that were downright stupid. When Cruise and his kids make it to the ex-wifes house after the first attack, does Cruise turn on the t.v. or check the radio? No. If they didn't work then show that. It would lend a little more credibility to being uterly alone. He never once tries to find out what is going on else where. The fight between Cruise and the crazy guy (Tim Robbins) in the farmhouse. Really stupid. And the end. They should never have had the 15-year old son make it back to his grandmothers house in Boston (Cruise and his son had been separated mid-movie). Come on. Everyone else died in the group he was with but he made it back to complete the family unit and call Cruise dad.

I would say this is at the level of watching it on a CRT TV from a VHS player.This product was totally disappointing. I'd advise you to just purchase it on regular DVD as there is no qualitative difference with the Blu-ray product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not very profound, but very entertaining","review":"After the disappointing A.I. and the only slightly above average Minority Report, Spielberg returns to science fiction in fine form with War of the Worlds. Spielberg presents the alien attack in all its visceral glory, and he resists the temptation to show famous landmarks or New York City being destroyed. Instead he focuses on one family's fight for survival in the chaos of the alien invasion in much the same way that M. Night Shyamalan did in Signs. The strength of this approach is that the audience sees the war as it would be seen by the average Joe in the street instead of from the perspective of the president or a member of the military. Cruise is an excellent actor when he sticks to fictional subjects other than Scientology, and Dakota Fanning is far superior to 99.9% of all actresses in Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Beginning Weak Finish","review":"While I enjoyed the War of the Worlds in general.

Speilberg and Crooz should hide in the closet for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a story line","review":"This movie does not do justice to the original H.G. Wells book. And the fact that it was called a block-buster movie is only due to its special effects and heavy advertising taken out at this movies release. The special effects are very good, and thats the only good thing I can say about this movie. The plot is aimless and often makes no sense at all. The fact that the aliens had buried their their machines underground years or maybe eons before makes you ask \\"why?\\". Just so the movie could have the special effect of huge lightning bolts hitting the ground (this is what brought these machines back to life).Or that 2/3rds of the way through the movie you find out that the Martians also need to suck the blood out of us humans. Yes the special effects are good but in between are long periods of dull, add to that no story line makes for one dull movie. You'll watch this one only once.

About the only thing going for this film are the special effects. The \\"first\\" alien tripod encounter does show the film's potential, but, very quickly the whole thing disintegrates into a mess of bad acting (I am so sick of Tom Cruise), implausible story situations (the entire plane crash sequence), and just generally uninteresting filmmaking (1/4 of the film in a basement).

Seriously, cut open a used fuel filter sometime and see just how much crud is really in your gas. The only downside to this particular filter is that it is rather large and may be difficult to mount in some vehicles. The drain valve is a nice feature. It's surprising how much water comes out when I drain it (usually every 1-2 months)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad the analysis doesn't match the preaching","review":"This book works from an interesting premise-take selected sermons by a noted and popular preacher about main themes in his work, then have someone write analysis. Some of the sermons are brilliant as in Easter is an Earthquake, the opening sermon and one of the best I've ever read. However the sermons are a bit uneven as is the analysis.It's worth the price of the book-especially used- for the opening sermon.

It's over 20 years old, so it was no surprise when the owners manual was nowhere to be found. So I picked up this guide to help me sort through and maintain it.But \\"Total Car Care Repair Manual\\" it ain't. It seems to stop *just* before giving you useful information. For example:A few of my van's fuses are blown. The Chilton guide helpfully showed me where to find the fusebox. It showed me how to take the plastic cover off. It advises I use a non-metallic tool to ease removal. But it doesn't tell me anything *about* the fuses. No part numbers, no amperages, no indication what fuse does what. Basically, it gave detailed information on everything I could determine by just looking at the van, but absolutely nothing I'd consult a manual for. Which makes it a pretty lackluster manual. :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke - total let down","review":"When I bought this, the other review wasn't posted yet.

I'm not into technical reviews and talking about mixes and production and stuff but this is truly an amazing cd. It is long enough that it can stay in the car for a week at a time and will not become one of those that you thrash for a few days and then never play again. As they say 'all thrill, no fill'. Each track has it's star performer. To truly enjoy it a good pair of headphones and a couple of hours kicking back is recommended. Can't wait to get the studio albums these tracks came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much kitchen sink dump, too little coherence","review":"I'm not sure why I even bothered with this book. It gives little to clarify the use of the many tools that UML offers, and little to help you understand either where or how to design flexibility into your systems. It felt more like a collection of disjoint ideas with little practical experience behind it (perhaps some classroom or academic experience), dubious interpretation and semantics added onto the UML, a hokey description of things like activity diagrams and refinement.I found many reasons why I would not want to be on a project that designed based on this book. e.g. I would never defer consideration of external systems in use-case interactions to design-time, or decide on association directions as recommended here, or either use design patterns the way this book does. Some of the designs I would end up with would be terrible.Overall not impressive and only marginally useful. As a point of reference, I am moderately experienced with OOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need.","review":"This is a book in which characters look in the mirror to see how good-looking they are (particularly to admire their voluptuous breasts, or the breasts of their friends). It is also a book in which John Updike tries to write feminist characters but succeeds only in building up a group of women who hate each other, who hate their children, who hate other women, and who are idly superior to the men.Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose, homophobic, and misogynistic.","review":"Updike's novel is totally overworded with unnecessary details that fail to move the story on. Did we really need to know about Sukie contemplating the area between her legs while in the bathroom before having an affair with a married man? And of course the lesbian sex scenes just had to be Updikes hypersexual drive outdoing itself. And I don't think I can count the number of times the word \\"fag\\", or one of its similars, was used on one hand! Not to mention how our hero Darryl turns out to be one and has conned the women into doing his bidding. The problem is I WANTED to like this book since I love the movie and musical so much. But it was so damn hard to get into I could ONLY read it on the bus because I had to have NO alternative distraction! My opinion: unless you're a huge fan of Updike, get the movie. It's practically a completely different story than the book anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, horrible","review":"This was probably one of the worst books I've ever read; it doesn't even deserve 1 star! Well, I actually couldn't even force myself to finish it. Updike goes on and on and on with pointless descriptions, making it hard to get interested in the book. There really is no plot. He jumps all over the place making things hard to follow. There was also too much crazy sex scenes for me! I would definitely not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kindle edition NOT available in the US?","review":"The one star is because this is a Kindle edition, yet I can't purchase it for my Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the book.","review":"I loved the movie. That's why I bought the book. The movie is fantastic, the book is disappointing. I will not be reading any other books by Updike. He is verbose, slow to read and wanders of tangents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I hoped","review":"I wanted to like this book. There are passages in it that are written so expressively that you feel like you are there - the music Jane plays before her cello is eaten is an example. But I didn't like the three witch-women - I don't think Updike liked them either. There was so much male fantasy about women that wasn't believeable (I know it's a book about witches) Since it was written about the early 70s, I guess maybe Updike thought he had some enlightened male insight into women and their behavior and thought patterns and desires but I just found it chauvanistic and wishful. And kind of boring at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is It Possible for a Movie to Outshine the Book?","review":"I would have never thought that it was even a slight possibility, but the book was plodding and just not interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written page turner","review":"To be successful as a writer today (and I use the word succesful in its most vulgur form) it often seems that one must be either horribly mediocre or overly self-indulgent. As such, it is always a pleasure to find a book that is, at its heart, a well-writen page turner. Updike's developed wit and ability to offer concise but insightful descriptions elevate his work above much of the fiction that is popular today. The Witches of Eastiwck is a novel that is both light and heavy; the intriguing characters and slightly quirky plot twists compel one to turn the pages quickly, but the underlying messages about sexuality, love, and the human need for approbation will likely weigh on the reader's mind for quite some time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dessert for your mind","review":"Before you read 'Widows' read \\"The Witches of Eastwick\\". JU's vivid descriptions require you to lick your fingers before turning the pages. Keep a tissue in your lap to wipe the corners of your mouth.

This book is definitely different. I am not saying this book was bad, but strange. This is the only instance that I can say that the movie was better than the book in my opinion. I saw the movie way earlier, before I even knew that this was a book first.After reading, I was blown away by how far the movie was removed from the original vision of the author. One minor annoyance to me was that the basic character looks were scrambled around from the book to the screen...not that this really makes a difference in the grand scheme, but reading the book after seeing the movie it was a little difficult to keep the scene in my head straight. I also came away feeling that the author hates women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper than L'oreal but caused me to break out!","review":"I've had good luck with Nivea products in the past so I thought I'd try out this lotion. I'd been using the L'oreal for Men version which worked really well, but was a few dollars more for a smaller bottle.I'm switching back to the L'oreal. The Nivea product made me break out within a few days of using it. I stopped using it for a few weeks, then tried it again. Sure enough, I broke out.Other than that, the product feels a bit greasy in comparison to the L'oreal for Men product. And I guess the scent is a matter of opinion, but they could have done a better job with it.If you have sensitive skin and don't mind spending a few extra bucks, buy the L'oreal for Men product instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"I've only had a fan for a few months now but it was easy to assemble (took me 5 minutes) and it does a good job and is not too noisy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these cards.

The bottom line is that I love them, and am totally sold on them for poker.PROS:-very easy to shuffle-you can peek at your cards and it does not create a mark or crease.-after hours and hours of playing, the cards still feel brand new.-the cards slide really well on felt.

The 4 cards had paint flakes on them that can't be washed or scrubbed off, and were rough to touch, screwing up the smoothness/flatness of the cards.Also, a number of other cards had small stain lines in the white background, but this was ok since it didn't screw up the flatness of the cards.Go with Copags. Cheaper and better quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"The cards in the blue deck were not cut uniformly.Before I even opened the pack, I could see through the cellophane that the edges of the cards didn't line up.I ordered a replacement deck, so hopefully I get a better set, but this does not instill confidence.What is the value added of a card manufacturer if it's not quality control?The whole point of paying for high-quality, 100% plastic cards is to avoid nicks and marks which might allow players to identify certain cards in the deck. Therefore, I have to give a 1-star review.UPDATE: The replacement cards they sent were bridge (or narrow) size, not poker size, even though the label on the package said \\"poker size.\\" Had to return them again.

They feel real nice and shuffle well. But for the money they are simply not a good value.I use Copag, Modiano, and Dal Negro plastic cards and decided to give these KEMs a try. I've never seen such bad quality control as these have. There were several cards in one deck which were badly scratched across the back rendering one deck unplayable.I received no response from ChipandGames so I sent the deck back to USPC in Cincinnati (fingers crossed). We'll see what happens.Long story short... don't buy KEM cards. I've used a TON of plastic cards for poker over the years and while KEM cards do have a nice feel to them (about as nice as Copag) they are simply too fragile and easily marked.At nearly twice the price of Copag these KEM cards are absolutely laughable to me. I consider them and the entire USPC a joke. How can they expect to compete with oversees companies who produce a far better product for half the money?Buy Copag... end of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware!!","review":"Please avoid this place , I ordered Kem cards and was sent a different brand that cost an 1/8 of the price.

While Theroux visits his old college pals, Kapuscinski lives and travels with the masses. In Africa, this puts him in situations where he can die of dehydration, thuggery, a stampede, TB or a malarial sweat.The the brief histories of Rwanda, Liberia, the Tuareg and regime change in Nigeria are the best I've read. There are great descriptions that discussion of the underlying reality of life in the market, a Christian church, train travel, child soldiers, spirits, insects, the roads and the lingering impact of slavery. You can feel the ever present heat and sadly the hunger.Both the writer and translator present this and more in beautiful prose. This book is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Study of Africa","review":"Am bowled over by this writer and his superlative book. In few pages, he clarified what perplexed me about the causes of the Rwandan Genocide and the Liberian Civil War. Despite reading few books on Rwanda, I was still unclear and clouded about the issues concerning this tumultuous event.Couldn't ever imagine that the Liberian Civil was due to the racist policies of US-returned Africans, who followed their masters' calling and applied the same methods on the native populace, under which they themselves suffered. Indeed they did what the Nazis did after 100 years.Ironically, the money/food given in aid fuels and prolongs the wars in the continent. So why prosecute Naomi Campbell, the aid agencies should stand in the docks too! What a laugh. All are guilty, nobody is innocent..Lastly, one is thankful for what God has given us already. Amen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written account of Africa's recent history","review":"I was mesmerized by Kapuscinski's account of his travels through Africa during the last 40 years. For me, someone who has not yet been to Africa and has always been confused by the politics of that continent, this book helped greatly in sorting out the issues, politics and history of that region. Kapuscinski is a brilliant writer and, more importantly, a brilliant story teller. Visions of certain related stories play through my head as if a part of my own distant memories, such as his killing of a snake, his night in a cockroach-infested hotel room in Monrovia, his descriptions of heat and sunlight. My only complaint about this book is that it dwells too much on the negatives of Africa. Surely somewhere there are beautiful cities, or at least sections of cities. Although the history, personalities, and misdeeds came through strongly, the beauty of this continent did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wrinkle in Time: A Unit Plan","review":"WOW!!

I add the two tablespoons of butter (or a bit more), a smidgen more than 1/4 cup milk, and about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I put some salt and pepper on it and it is much better than the original mix and takes about the same amount of time.I like the idea of adding a bit of spice to it as well and will try that next time.This cannot be compared to the Kraft mix (and I loved that as much as anybody), but if you have to eat gluten free, this is a good substitute when you add some more flavor to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"I got this because I have celiacs and as a result am incredibly sensitive to gluten. This is very safe and I had no negative side effects at all. It's also very easy to make and it's delicious. I loved this! I will definitely be buying this again and recommend it for anything who's forced to be on a gluten-free diet but loves the taste of mac and cheese. It's delicious. I've eaten it several times in one day. I had this with soy milk rather than normal milk so maybe that makes it taste different, but I was very happily surprised at how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"OV-10 Testors airplane model","review":"Nice model vert sturdy material.

She's offered a chance to become part of the mainstream, as a navigator, for a scientific expedition. From the second she boards that ship, she spends the entire book being used, abused, maliciously manipulated, raped, tortured, cut to bits, spied on, broken mentally and physically, occupied by alien beings, insulted, and otherwise ground into the carpet. In the end, it's revealed that she loves the jerk who put her up to the whole adventure. How utterly disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant depiction of inter-human and alien culture clashes","review":"Just discovered Terry A Adams' Sentience (on a friend's bookshelf) and had to read it in one gulp. It explores the fear and contempt that non-telepathic humans, a majority, have for those humans with telepathy who are confined to a single planet. Add to the mix a newly encountered and very different species that is completely telepathic and hostile. Yes, as one reviewer said, there are some rough and ugly moments, but they are handled with a horrifying distance, that is, details are there but sparse. There are also moments of wonder--that Terry Adams could create such a satisfying variety of cultures. Just when you think that things might go well, the characters make surprising choices. The hypothesis about the nature of alien intelligence adds a rich background. The central character's honesty and determination make her actions fascinating to follow. Would love to read more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Space Saver","review":"This little Sanyo is a true space saver and we have used it every day - love it.

Very easy to use. There is a learning curve with toasting time but overall the toast is far superior to my Kenmore toaster (it was rated number one by Consumer Reports.) It is the best toast I have ever made in a toaster oven, and I have owned many. The browning was even on the top and even on the bottom with the exception of the white lines left by the rack which is normal. I found it toasts faster than my Kenmore and you can watch your toast without having to put your face down the slots of a toaster. It takes up vertical space which means I can keep it out on my counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"This handy little appliance is great at heating up a slice of pizza, toasting bread or bagels, and performing similar chores. Very easy to clean and to use. Takes up minimal counter space. You can watch the food through the glass door and see if it's getting overdone. No more bread getting caught in toaster slots, or crumbs getting stuck in the coils!

I've had mine for over 20 years and would replace it with the newer model if available. The quartz heating elements are finally showing wear and tear. It is a space saver.

It you want, it will toast only the top shelf. In short, a well designed appliance and worth every penny.

I don't believe they can be reliably patched or repaired at that point so are essentially junk. I bought two of these and they both had the same problem although one lasted a little while longer. Ultimately, pre-filled self sealing tubes are the best route I've found. These are a waste of time and money. I'm not sure why the rubber separates where it does - made in China cheap rubber, design?

I learned a lot of new things about the conflict (that the Soviets didn't really want to invade Afghanistan, JFK was elected on an anti-Communist hawk platform, Britain since WWII), although I do agree with other reviewers that he left out many things. Walker spends about 70% of his time on the west and 30% on the Soviets in each decade, so the Evil Empire's motives and actions are a bit murky. Britain from the mid-sixties to the Thatcher era is dropped. And he does spend a lot of time on the economic markets of post-war Europe & Japan, that while interesting to me at first, I bought the book for history not economics. But those are just quibbles. Overall, the book is a good start for anyone wanting to know about the Cold War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff...Really Works!","review":"Thyroid T3 really works! My Endo refuses to help me feel better and keeps refering to my lab tests and says that as long as things are in the normal range that's all that matters...but I am still feeling all my Hypo symptoms...:( so I decided to take matters into my own hands and after a lot research came across this product. My T3 levels although in the normal range are a little on the low end of the normal range so I bought this.

Another member of my family is purchasing one for the backyard at their house as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the doctor ordered","review":"This fan is awesome! I took it out of the box, assembled it, hooked up the hose and let it fly. The mist sprays about 10-15 feet, depending on the speed you select.

Highly recommended for people who sit outside while small children play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Poor Execution","review":"I looked at this and thought \\"What a great idea!\\". I ordered it, got it, put it together, turned it on, and realized that what I had was a very wet fan or a very bad lawn sprinkler. Bottom line - your municipal water pressure will not work to atomize the water enough so it is mostly evaporated by the time it hits you. You will get soaked if you stand too close, and the cooling is ineffective if you stand too far away. I can see you liking this if you want to cool the kids down while they play outside (and don't care about them getting wet) or if you are working on outdoor projects(and don't care about you getting wet). But for an evening of sitting around the patio with friends - it just isn't effective, and is just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service","review":"My children ordered me a fan for Father's Day for use at our lake home.

I know, I know ... in Florida the humidity is too high to allow an evaporative cooling fan to work. I had hoped to defy the physics and chill, but the only chill I got was when I was soaked through to the skin after about 10 minutes. And don't use this fan around upholstered outdoor furniture ... it's like leaving them out in the rain.My bad for buying something that would work great in the mountains of Colorado or the southwest deserts, where humidity is a desiccating 10 percent or so. In that environment, I expect this fan would work wonderfully. But if you live anywhere the humidity on a hot summer day exceeds 50 percent, save your money.

I decided since they were the same model I would just switch out the broken one with the one that still worked because I needed a fan in that room the most. Not only did those 2 not match up on a brack that should have been the same but I went to companies site to look at the manual. I found the fan as being sold in their product list, but they did have a manual for it (all other products but the one I needed) and they don't even cover it in the F.A.Q. section. So if you want to throw your money away by all means go right a head and throw your money away but if they can't make a good wall fan then I would not trust them for any thing that is more involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooling","review":"Easy assembly, screwdriver required, connections very simple.

We have an outdoor sports bar by our pool and this fan helps make the heat tolerable during entertaining. One hint: the directions do not tell you...be sure the water pressure is HIGH...otherwise the mist is too wet and is uncomfortable. The high pressure helps atomize the mist so it doesn't make everything damp & soggy. We found this out after trying different pressures.

I really enjoy both videos. I must say that the Cardio Athletic Kickboxing has a great ab. workout at the end of the video. The only complaint is that I don't sweat as much doing this workout compared to Taebo, therefore leaving me unsatisfied and wanting to do more. I rotate tapes, so I get the results I want. I recommend this workout for beginners, not advance. It will make you sweat, but if you regularly do high impact aerobics this isn't a video for you. You'd be better off with Taebo Advanced. The instructor in this video is very safe and wants everyone to have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Energy and very motivational","review":"I saw an ad for the video a few months ago and decided to check it out. It was definitely a good decision. The workout in the Cardio Athletic kickbox video is high energy and motivational, I feel like the instructor (Eversly Forte) is actually in the room with me. The people in the video are real people and not world class athletes like some other kickboxing videos have. To my surprise there were low impact alternatives to all of the moves. It is easy to follow and the music is much better than the usual video music people are accustomed to. It is not a fancy production, but it is quite effective. I took a chance when buying this cardio kickboxing video, but it turned out to be a very good investment. I give it a big thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN AVERAGE WORKOUT","review":"I am an aerobics instructor and have been one for 9 years. I purchased this video thinking I would get some great ideas for my kickboxing classes, as well as a great home workout. I was very disappointed. I have all of the Tae Bo tapes, as well as some Jennifer Steele, Aaron Langford and Kathy Smith tapes. The people in the video need instruction, themselves, on proper technique. I was so concerned that the girl in the front row was going to hurt herself because of improper technique that I found it hard to get a good workout, myself! For a good, safe and effective kickboxing workout, I would highly recommend the Kathy Smith Aerobox video over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well balanced","review":"If you have listened to a lot of harpsichord concertos, you will have to agree on the one inescapable characteristic of most recordings: the harpsichord is overbearing, imposing itself, with a harsh discordant jangling getting in the way of your enjoying the music. Not so with this recording. The orchestra and the harpsichord strike a perfect balance. I don't know whether this is a merit of the musicians or the recording engineers, but it sounds wonderful. The main message coming out of the recording is not \\"here I am, the harpsichord,\\" but \\"this is the wonderful music of JS Bach.\\" Of course, if you absolutely hate the harpsichord and cannot stand its sound at all, this recording is not for you either, because the harpsichord is still there with all its flavor. In that case try buying one of the piano versions, such as Angela Hewitt's marvelous performance, but that one doesn't have the C minor concerto, which is one of the gems in this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach for all ears","review":"This recording is shurelly a \\"pick of the day\\" for almost all Bach melody lovers. It's light and dancing and although a little old fashioned never disapoints. Raimmond Leppard and the English Chamber Orch. make a wedding cuple and everithyng walks togheter. The tradicional string playing is sharp and warm and we fell back in time while listening. The clear and more dense Philips ADD recording is masterlly remastered and you can buy this set with eyes closed. It's a pity Philips didn't added one more CD with the concerts for 3 and 4 harpischords (this one a great energetic Vivaldi transcription of L'estro Harmnico Op.3 n10), recorded with the same team.

I got them instead of Pinnock just because so often the violin concertos are tacked on to Bach recordings and I already had Grumiaux and was satisfied.

This might not be a bad background Christmas cd though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clips could be stronger","review":"Nice pair of suspenders , strong elastic with solid metal locks.

Their suspenders broke on the third use, and email to them was a run around. So, I figured I loved the pants, and the suspenders were props to sell, not intended to represent the primary focus.So, I bought these to go with those pants, and others. I find the non-button option (the clamps) is really good! I did not have any slippage, and they allow me to wear pants that I like, but that are a bit big and I have to keep fiddling with when I wear a belt. With suspenders I never have to pull the pants up or push them down.One big reason I make sure to have some slightly too-big pants is when I fly I absolutely cannot be squeezed and uncomfortable, or the probability of my getting airsickness goes up considerably.I do wish I could find more artistic and urbane suspenders, but the classics like these are timeless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suspenders!","review":"Very versatile suspenders that can be used either with buttons sewn inside the pants, or clips.

Definately not for those who enjoy Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit types of games. Very, very fun to play with the right group of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pary Fun","review":"We have played the game at two parties so far and both times laughed until our ribs hurt. We did make a house rule that if you lost by flipping the three curse cards you kept playing, just could not win. So it was lots of fun! We had people playing from the ages 13 thru 50 at the same time and everyone had a good time.Durability, well the game appears to have survived the inevitable drink spilled but the edges did curl up a bit. Small price to pay for all that fun.I think the biggest attraction to the fun was that the game does not require real score keeping, so none of that serious competitive points counting!We will be playing this game again and again, every time it is with new people it is like a new game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun at all!","review":"The other reviews explain the game very well, so I'm not going to get into that. There is one majior reason why I don't like this game. The challenge cards are SO dumb, and there is no penalty for refusal to do it. I don't understand why they are even part of the game. I Played with a small group of friends and no one liked it. I wasted my money now that on the next game night I host this one is going to sit in the closet. Take the curse cards (they are pretty funny) and make it a drinking game at your next party. There are much better games out there that are less expensive.

My family and I were just rolling. It is fun to hand out the curses and to see how each person works with the curses to win the game. I would total recommend this to everyone, it really makes you think:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game","review":"This game is so much fun! There is sure to be lots of laughter! The only problem I have is it gets rather long after awile. And some people do not like having to do the strange things that might be required such as speaking with a French accent or pretending their arms are only one inch long. But I think the weird and crazy things make it interesting! Also be aware that you need an imagination, but this game is pretty good at bringing it out. I bought it to take w/ me to youth camp and played it with my 8th grade cabin girls. They had never played it before and LOVED it! They kept begging me to let them play it. And it's just as much fun to watch as to play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much Fun","review":"I ordered this game because my family and I over heard another family playing this game one weekend camping.

Well, this movie failed miserably. What was supposed to be a Porky's version of \\"Bring It On\\" was more like a homo-chick flick instead. There were lots of breast, i'll give it that but I was expecting to see some good full frontal & the girls in the movie that I thought were the hottest never took off a d@mn thing. Throw in the classic male tied to the bed & played with scenes along with the males running around naked scenes & what you have is a fraudulent teaser.

Her gloom is lightened somewhat by meeting Ben Fisher, the handsome American television producer. He seems to know her very well. If she knew the reason for that, Sam would not be so quick to fall for him. Ben found her diary and read it. Will his secret spell doom for the future?* Diaries are not the only things that get lost here; add to the list attention and interest. The story tends to ramble and be hard with which to connect.

But as difficult to follow as that sounds, after a few chapters it's absolutely addictive. I liked not having absolutely everything spelled out, but seeing the result of the change of heart/plans/what have you. One minute the characters are in disaccord, the next they agree.

The music has a retro vibe, and the lyrics flow nicely, although they seem to focus around a general theme of 'say your prayers, eat vegetables, read lots of books,' type jokes combined with bizarre references to indigestion, lizards, robots and other such nonsense, this album is a giddy, delerious way to pass time, and you will almost certainly get some of the choruses stuck in your head, dont say i didnt warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"The Shine soundtrack was a wonderful accompaniment to the movie, and it is a great addition to any classical music library.

The 1st Symphony is one of the best recordings--Previn does not allow the work to ramble, yet doesn't shortchange the emotion either. The 2nd Symphony is very good, though not quite at the top rank--there is some deeper emotions and inner darkness Previn does not completely bring out (Edward Downes and the BBC Phil on Naxos are my first choice here). The fillers (marches and overture) and again very good, though I would go with Boult (EMI) for my only recording of the marches and Barbirolli (EMI) for my only recording of the overture.Sound is first class; orchestral playing ditto; price is right. And the 1st Symphony essential..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the Money","review":"I just picked this set up again used and reminded myself how good Previn's Elgar 1st is. It was the first recording of this work that I listened to, and it still holds up well. The second was never released in this country by itself on either lp or cd, so its appearance here is welcome. It is a trifle bit slow (but not as slow as Sinoppoli's) and is a bit wanting in forward movement. There is more of this in both Downes' (Naxos) and Menhuin's (Virgin) readings. The pomp and circumstance marches are also very well done. The 2nd one is severely cut, however (it only runs 3 minutes) but it is not rushed off its feet like in Menhuin's recording. Cockaigne is also sober but has a good spirit about it also. Sound is very good-in fact, I can't tell the difference between digital sound then and digital sound now. It just shows you the high standards that the CD medium has continued to exhibit throughout the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"over priced","review":"This is a great item for ppl who have no fireplace, small spaces or too many stockings (like me) for the fireplace.

For instance in the chapter on Gratitude he begins by showing how Gratitude is not given inherently but must be developed by the human being. This is his concluding paragraph of this chapter: \\"As I have said, the first words we utter in the morning are Modeh Ani, I thank YouG-d, for restoring my soul and giving me another day of life.

However, after 1 year of service, the sides bowed out so much that the shelves fell off. I only had a few plastic pots and hand tools on the shelves, so weight was not an issue, and I live in a temperate climate, so I don't think it was weather.To fix it required me to take everything out of the shed, completely disassemble it, reassemble it (now, of course, without the instructions). Even after doing this, it was still bowing out, so out came the trusty duct tape (pictures uploaded). It can now hold shelves again, but I'm not sure how long this will last, and of course, it's pretty ugly.In short, extremely disappointing product, no durability at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"This shed is a piece of junk!

I put it back together, and a month after that it collapsed again, under 30 lbs of paint on the shelves. I called Rubbermaid, and they want to send me a side panel, instead of replacing it. Bull!

Yeah, it's pretty windy here at times, but I'm not talking hurricane/tornado.

My major concern is it seems that the panels appear to be too flimsy for a shed that large...even after being perfectly assembled. Nearly 10 years ago, I bought a Rubbermaid shed from Home Depot that looks like #3747, but the panels appear to be of more durable material than the new 3746.

The other holder we had used to be all sticky on the outside because of the dribbling."},{"rating":"2","title":"very lovely","review":"i like it alot. i'm using for my lemon juice. i use fresh lemon juice only. very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"We use this daily in our kitchen and it pours great and has 0 leaking issues at all.

We had seen and used it at a restaurant and we wanted the item for our own olive oil. It is great and makes a great presentation. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect size and shape","review":"This cruet has been the answer to my EVOO drizzle problems.As you may have found, the openings on large bottles of EVOO are large and I had trouble controlling the amount used. Since using this cruet, I have been able to control the amount of EVOO in stir fry veggies, fish, etc.I love it. It looks small but when you are using EVOO, a little goes a long way. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small!","review":"Not really worth the money--maybe $5 tops--considering it's so small. Still it seems like a perfectly fine product. I recommend really jamming the stopper on there so it doesn't fall out when you pour it (sort of grind/twist it down)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for the money","review":"Love it. It's really a great piece of glass and works perfectly for use around the kitchen. I leave it filled with olive oil and use it daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought it would be bigger","review":"At first I was dissappointed with this item. If you cook alot like I do you will go through the oil in this little bottle quickly. I ended up getting a bigger one and have that put in the cupboard for the larger jobs. They little unit works well for adding oil to a pan and small jobs. And it looks cute on my condiment and spices racks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy but difficult to clean","review":"I really like this cruet. It's very pretty and provides a nice touch to the dining area in the kitchen. However, the whole thing just seems like a pain to clean. It's very narrow in a bunch of places, which gives a great aesthetic but is not super practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby didn't like it","review":"Well, my baby girl just doesn't seem to like this toy. I started putting her in it at 5 months (after she had very good head control) but it ususally ended in crying. It's a little difficult to get the baby's legs through the seat. Now at 8 months's she's still not too interested. She likes her jumperoo, but just really doesn't seem too interested in this exersaucer. I'd have to agree with another's review that the sounds are either too loud or too soft. This toy either gives you a big headache or else you can't hear the noises at all. For the money I'd have to say I am a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous part!","review":"My daughter loves playing in this exersaucer and gets really excited when she is in it. She starts jumping up and down and bopping her head up and down. Well, just the other day she was doing this and her face came right down onto the yellow plastic holder for the phone. This part sticks straight up and is squared off. She ended up with a big scratch and a black and blue eye!! If it were slightly in a different position when she hit her face on it she coud have seriously damaged her eye! I am very upset because you put your children in these toys thinking that the company has designed them to be safe and in my case it wasn't. We have taken off that toy since the accident. So I warn parents to take this sharp holder off, its really not necessary, they should have attached the phone by itself or have a different type of holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nathaniel's Mom","review":"This is a great exersaucer. Although, it was on the expensive side, I feel it is worth the money. My son is 7 months and has been using it regularly since 4 months. Initally, I thought the arch with toys dangling would not be used, as he seemed disinterested. However, now he is very interested and loves to reach and pull. He has chewed on plenty of the toys and we have never had a problem with dye running. Very nice to have the colapsable feature. Works well for bringing in the car for grandma's house."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lot of toys in one","review":"This is a good toy center. We got it for my little boy when he is 4 month old. He could't really sit and play, we removed the detable toy to play with him. He started to really enjoy the toy when he was about 5 month old when he sit and jump for 30 min each time. We don't put him there for long each time, and only once or twice per day. When he seems to get bored with it, we won't put him there for a day or two. He is 7 month old now and still likes it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for restless baby!!","review":"This is a wonderful product if you have a baby who likes to keep busy and you can't keep up! Our 4 month old girl LOVES it. She didn't like the swing or any other product that didn't keep her upright. The only reason I took a star away is because it is difficult and time consuming to assemble but other than that I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"foul smelling","review":"Whenever I close to this thing, there is foul smelling (almost poopoo smell). Finally I found out it was from the flower rattle. This flower also bleeds dye when wet with horrible smell. I have no idea what kind of the fabric that they used for this toy, but awful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DANGEROUS","review":"I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old as soon as he learned to move around in it this thing became a hazard. The springs that hold it together are held in a clear see through dome and the kids see it as a toy. once they start messing with it the dome easily twist off, the springs pop up and the excersaucer COLLAPSES WITH YOUR BABY INSIDE !!!!! It only takes a second and the saucer collapses on your babies legs very poorly made"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"Be careful using this once your child is comfortable standing for long periods of time. My son really likes this bouncer. He was bouncing in it this morning and managed to fly out and landed on the floor. Luckily, he wasn't hurt. He pushed down on the top and bounced at the same time, he was able to get enough leverage that he ended up vaulting out of it. The bouncer didn't even tip over, he just flew out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Box open and damaged","review":"I ordered the SmartSteps Exersaucer as a Baby shower gift, and the box was delivered in a damaged condition.

There are several items to put in the mouth, and yet they are firmly anchored to the exersaucer. My son is 9 months old and this is our second exersaucer. I am not sure how appropriate it is for younger children."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are bad developmentally for babies","review":"I was tempted to buy one of these for my daughter, but was told by a pediatric physical therapist and a pediatric occupational therapist to not waste my money. They both explained that these toys can cause babies to develop bad habits that can delay when they walk and stand on their own. Even for short periods of use, a baby may be in there and not standing correctly. They may be on tiptoes or have their legs facing an odd direction. These bad habits can cause delays for a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is a very nice activity center, my 4 month old daughter loves it, she smiles and get really ecxited!! the only bad thing about it is the assembeling...it's really a pain in the neck!!I recomend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and Safe!","review":"My daughter is 8 months old and loves this. It has a ton of entertaining activities, music, and much more. I love that it is stationary but has a swivel seat to allow her to explore around 360. It also has several adjustable heights. This is great if you have a \\"shorty\\" like mine! Worth the money and you don't have to worry about them traveling around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy I have ever bought!","review":"This toy is worth every penny. My son has had this for five months and absolutely loves it. Now the toys are interchangeable which makes it even better. I know this one is at the top of the price scale but believe me you will not find one better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy baby=Happy mommy","review":"We bought this saucer for our little guy when he was about four months old. From the day he first sat in the thing he has loved it. I was worried that there was just going to be too much stuff for him at first but he just focused on one area at a time then slowly began to turn his attention elsewhere as he got older. Unlike some of the other reveiws, we have not noticed any of the dye issues. HE always is putting the toys in his mouth and there has not been any problems. HE is now seven months and stil loves it. He spins and bounces with ease and just has fun. This is definatly a must have and totally worth the money. It just has so much on it and the best part it is rewarding behavior for the kids also. Cause and effect by pulling the hanging toys sounds the music to play. It even teaches shapes and numbers. We just LOVE it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun exersaucer!!!","review":"I just received this exersaucer from a relative whose son just outgrew it and it is WONDERFUL!!! This saucer has soooooo many fun functions! It has great sounds and toys! It keeps my 6 month old very occupied. He'll stay in it for about 45 minutes at a time. This saucer has 11 different toys, a mirror, and three hanging rattles. All the toys have a function, whether it be beads in it, fun sounds, colorful shapes and colors, etc... It is not loud or annoying, either, like some toys can be.When it was given to us, the legs nicely folded down and it fit in a normal sized trunk. It will be easy to store for when I pack it up and save it for the next baby.Even though this saucer was given to me, I would have definitely spent the $99 on it. My baby uses it everyday, and the price is well worth it.If you are looking for a great toy that will provide endless hours of fun entertainment for your baby, this is the saucer for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Color comes off from teething toy","review":"Purchased this Exersaucer for 4 days, it was really entertaining for my 6 monthes old son and he loves it. But we found all his clothes that he wore spending time in the saucer has some pink stains around the same area. I have a baby that puts everything in his mouth. By testing the toys on the excersaucer with a wet paper towel, we found out there was this flower with purple and blue petals that makes my paper towel all pink with its purple petal. I will contact evenflo tomorrow since it might be a health hazard for the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining!","review":"My almost 4 month old was quickly bored with stuffed animals and rattles. She has very strong legs and always wants to stand with support. She can almost sit on her own, but still falls over occasionally. With this in mind, it was difficult to find things to keep her entertained. She was over the play gym thing. We went looking for a stationary entertainer and knew we just had to get her this one. It was the most expensive on the shelf, but she will only be little once. The benefits are worth far more than the cost. We could stick her in it for hours (NOT THAT WE WOULD LOL!), and she would be happy. The first 5 minutes she is in it, she just stares at everything there is to do in amazement. Then she goes crazy! It gives her the option to touch her feet down, but still gives her the support to sit up on her own. We are usually fans of Graco or Fisher Price, but Evenflo definitely has the upper hand when it comes to entertainers. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best $100 we ever spent","review":"This has been our little ones favorite toy. She is a bit hard to please. She was three months old when we purchased it and loved it from the set go. She refused to stay in the swing but really enjoys the saucer. She will turn seven months in a few days, is starting to crawl and pull herself up but can still spend 40-60 minutes in the saucer watching Sesame Street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Exersaucer","review":"Great product, my 4-1/2 month old daughter loves it. I had borrowed the circus exersaucer from a friend, but bought this one because it had so many more toys for her to play with. Right now she only likes being in it 10 minutes or less but she enjoys the toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment for baby","review":"Our daughter is 3 1/2 months old and we've been putting her in this exersaucer for a few weeks now. We just put a blanket in front of her to help prop her up. She loves it! She will focus in on one or two toys and is entertained for 15-30 minutes. She always sticks the flower in her mouth and I haven't noticed any of the dye problems that others had. We've folded it up and taken it places and it doesn't seem the easiest to get folded but once you get it folded it travels pretty well. I was unaware that there were other toys that you could switch out. That makes this product even better. All in all we love this exersaucer and would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"Our 3 month old daughter loves her Exersaucer. From the first time we put her in it, she was hooked! Although it was a little complicated to put together it was definately worth the aggrivation. My daughter loves to press the buttons on the learning pod and she always laughs and smiles. There is just so much to do that it keeps her entertained for quite a while. I would definately recommend this product to any parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"great toy but poorly made?","review":"I love the toys on this saucer. My son loves them, he couldn't stop staring at it in the store. I rated it one because I bought it with one of the toys on the bar broken and sent three emails to them never getting a response. Two months later the piece with the story books on it broke.It keeps making weird noises. Again I tried to contact them but didn't get a response. I am upset that we wasted our money. I don't know if we just happened to buy the one lemon or if they are not made very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrrible! Buy Baby Enstein First!!!","review":"I was so excited to buy this toy for my little one. It was the worst contruction ever built! The parts did not fit together properly. There are too many toys on it that they are on top of each other...there are even a few toys that do not make any sense...they do not work!I immediately took this back to the store and bought the Baby Enstein saucer. I enjoy it as does my baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning! babies have to be able to sit up on their own","review":"i received this as a gift for my 4 1/2 month old who can hold up his head pretty well and is attempting to pull himself up, but not yet sitting unassisted. we put him in this exersaucer and he immediately fell forward and hit his face on the edge of the padded seat. i read in consumer reports that babies should not be left in this exersaucer for more than 5-10 minutes at a time because it can cause their back to compress and grow crooked. also, babies should really be more like 8 months old before put being put in it. the box says 4 months and up but the directions (in an inconspicuous place) say baby must be able to sit up on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"This toy is great. My son (5 months) really enjoys it. The only thing is that the flower toy's color does come off when sucked on. I called Evenflo and they are sending me a new one. We will see if that one does the same thing. I read reviews when I was looking at getting it and saw that some people had the same problem. I didn't think that it was going to happen but it did. So hopefully Evenflo can fix that problem because this is a great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EvenFlo Exersaucer","review":"From the moment we opend the box, this was a HUGE disappointment. The directions were HORRIBLE (really, not everything can be \\"part A\\"), there were missing toys, and the activity bar never played music, or lit up, despite several battery changes. Yes, we could've returned it, but once you've opened it up, spent an hour putting it together...who has that kind of time with a 5 month old??? This is the 1st, and clearly last evenflo product we will buy. She likes it enough, but would probably love it if all the pieces were there, and it worked properly. Obviously, their QA department is lacking, much to our great disappontment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worried about safety of this toy...","review":"I won't dispute that this toy keeps baby entertained, but I have reservations about its safety as some other reviewers have remarked. I've noticed some of the same things.1. The dye from the teether runs off and looks faded now.2. The stickers scratch off easily when wet - not a good mix for an infant who puts everything in their mouth.3. The butterfly springy toys have plastic strings peeling off their stick - I can't imagine this would be safe for baby to ingest.4. THe telephone holster can create a dangerous \\"impaling\\" situation if baby hits his head or eye on it while playing.I have removed the dangerous toys and will be putting Tape over the butterfly springs since they cannot be removed. It's a shame since most of the other toys on this saucer are very engaging.I would search for something safer, maybe Evenflo's newer model of exersaucers have been improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Completely satisfied with the product! My daughter loves it! It is very colorful and keeps my daughter very entertained! I definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toy!!!","review":"At 4 months, my daughter would not bear much weight on her legs. After purchasing this product, that has all changed!!! She bounces in it all the time, plus has greater strength in her torso. She absolutely loves being in her exersaucer. It is amazing all that she has learned to do, from turning the pages of the electonic book to pulling on the toys from the bar. This is the best money I have spent on a toy for my daughter because not only has it helped her in reaching developmental milestones, but she smiles the entire time she is in it. I would highly recommend the SmartSteps Exersaucer to any parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cute! The best baby toy, wish it was also a walker....","review":"We checked out all of the walkers and exersaucers at Babies R Us, this was the best! It has TONS of toys, music and lights. This is the first real toy that we have bought my baby girl, she is 4 1/2 months old (with sibling's hand-me-down toys), and she stays interested for quite awhile (probably about half an hour at a time). The only other thing that we have for her is the Aquarium Bouncer (seat) and it's so boring, it does nothing for her. I just wish this was a walker, or converted to a walker, since this seat is far better than all of the walkers out there and I still need one of those. As for the reviews from the \\"negative\\", this seat is awesome - but if you do have any problems just bring it back to the store out of the box if you have to, any store should return an item that is defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4-month old absolutely loves her exersaucer","review":"My husband and I purchased this for our daughter and started putting her in it when she was around 2 1/2 months old.

A must have definitely!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed before we even put it together...","review":"After reading all the comments regarding the running dye on the flower toy, we decided that we would test the fabric on all the toys before putting it together. We wet a paper towel and gently rubbed each toy. The dye ran on all the fabric, including the fabric on the seat and overhead bar. We decided to return the toy before putting it together. Who knows what danger the dye would be to an infant.We believe this item should be recalled by Evenflow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I love this saucer! My 5 month old son loves it too. The only problem I had with it was putting the legs together, but my hubby took care of that part. As for the dye issue, the flower toy on my sons saucer also left pink on a paper towel...I found an easy fix. Use a screwdriver to take the toy apart, and suspend the flower (only the cloth flower! Not the whole toy) in some hot water with detergent. Let it soak for a little while and all the extra dye runs out of it. Rinse, let it dry and viola! Problem solved. I put the flower back together and my son is enjoying banging it on the book. This saucer is great and I would recommend it to anyone. I have free time now and that is invaluble!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!","review":"I have a 5 month old and got this toy because it had so many toys on it. There is a BIG problem w/ it. Over the 3 springs on the legs, are hard butterflies that stick out. When my baby jumps, the butterflies just stick out further and he has hit his head on them. Also, the telephone is cute, but we had to remove it for the same reason. If you have an active baby, this toy could impale them in the eye. We had to cut the butterflies off as well as remove the phone. Not fun. And it takes about an hour to assemble. Oh...the spinny guy doesn't fit properly either. Skip this model and go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Effects Way Too Loud","review":"There are two sound settings on the little learning table - one is way too loud (could easily damage your babies ears) and the other setting is way too low (can't hear it at all)."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 month old- LOVES IT!","review":"We had the Intellitainer by Frischer Price at first and although my son was able to reach the gizmos, he could not propel himslf back and forth.When we got this exersaucer, he could not reach the bottom of the base, but a 2 inch book helped him out. He has since gained his neck and back strength and not to mention his legs are strong. He is able to now spin himself around and play with all the toys. He disovers and rediscovers the gadgets, it's great.I highly recommend this activity center.The only negative is that the seat circle is hard and to be against their chest and back to me was not safe. I padded it underneath with some table cloth napkins. It's cushiony enough now! I looked at every activity center and all of the seat are hard, so it's not something specific to this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"My daughter is not quite 4 months old, but she already loves this entertainer. I think she'd sit in it all day, if I let her! She adores the toys that hang on the bar, and loves when I pull them to make the music play. She tries so hard to reach them herself, but she's still too little! She loves every toy on the exersaucer and gets a kick out of all the fun sounds they make.While assembly wasn't what I'd call simple, I wouldn't say it was difficult either. I put it together myself in under 30 minutes and all of the pieces fit together nicely, and instructions were easy to follow.My daughter and I highly recommend this activity center!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST IN CLASS!!!!!!","review":"This exersaucer is the best that I have found so far.

You simply stay on hold for 10-15 minutes, then you are transferred to a voice mail which may or may not be returned.I finally was successful in getting the product repaired, and then I ordered replacement cartridges directly from Lotus Tersano.

The spray bottle had a defective sprayer. The company said it would send a new one and I am still waiting, a month later. I have used the system several times and three out of four times I get the F1 error after it reaches the 95% done phase. I read this going in and was convinced it was user error and I would not have any problems. I wanted it to work, but it doesn't. It causes more annoyance than anything else.

I have purchased and used both their Food Sanitizing system as well as their Water Purification system. The Water purification System turned out be be far more reliable than their Food Sanitizing System. The Water Purification System Served us well with a once a day run for nearly two years. The food Sanitizing System is were we ran into ongoing and now increasingly worse problems. This, my last purchase of the Food Sanitizing System, was purchased from Amazon and it broke down on the second use, It has been returned to Tersano who replaced it with a used machine older than the new one that I returned to them. The machine that arrived almost started a fire - it began to smoke as we were using it. Terrifying! I am deeply disappointed in this product and the warranty services provided by this company. It has turned into a downhill avalanche of increased breakdowns. I advise against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"Talk about a lot of BS...this product does nothing they say it does. You are lead to believe you get this super powerful cleaning solution, you get water. Talk about snake oil! All that happens is the water swirles around and you get some bubbles. And when you spray this so called \\" super powerful\\" water on any stain, or grease, or anything else, it acts....well like water. Also the spray bottle is a piece of junk, it really does not \\"spray\\" the water out, it dribbles it out. I have never been so disappointed in a product....I had to write this review to tell people to save their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE LOTUS","review":"Just like a previous reviewer, I really wanted to love this product. I purchased it and tried it for the first time with the spray bottle suggested by the company. I got the F1 reading when it got to 98%. I then tried it 2 or 3 more times but got the same result. I sent it back and a few days later I got my replacement.Unfortunately, the same thing happened again. I am so disappointed, but I guess its best it happened now instead of after the warranty ran out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love My Lotus!!!!","review":"Being a mom of three crazy boys, I cannot say enough great things about my Lotus Santizer. Recently, my youngest son had a nose bleed, which had trailed onto my carpet as he ran up the stairs. The Lotus sanitizer took the stains right out!!! Even my husband, who was a little skeptical, was impressed. When my boys have minor cuts and scrapes that require disinfectant, I take the spray bottle with the Lotus Ozonated water, and apply it to clean out any bacteria. My kids love it because there are no \\"ouchies\\", which is always the case when you apply other disinfecting products. I also love how I can take all my fruits and vegetables, run it through the Lotus Sanitizer and know that my family is not ingesting harmful pesticides and chemicals. Thank you for making such a great product for busy moms like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliver as promised, however, there are some defect issues.","review":"The product worked as promised, however, my first \\"2\\" units kept showing \\"F3\\" error messages.When I returned to SharperImage, their sale rep. told me that the company \\"Tersano\\" has realized the problem and when customers return, just replace them with new one.I got my \\"THIRD\\" one 2 days ago, which arrived to store on July 7th. They did fixed the \\"F3\\" problem, but now, July 9th, it starts showing \\"F1\\" error messages.The reason I gave 2 star instead of 1 is because it's a good concept and when it worked, it did what they advertised. Unfortunately, there are still bugs that they need to fix. I will return my \\"THIRD\\" one, and get my refund.

I found trouble shooting instructions on the website that said to try bottled water for at least two cycles (first cycle to clean out the sensor).I did and BAM! Worked great. The processed water was also fantastic on a couple of stains that I tested it on. I tried tap water again, and it still didn't work. At this point the website tells you to forever use filtered or bottled water.I couldn't really be bothered to set up a water filtration system just to make this appliance happy, so I returned it.

A great idea but in everyday use its temperamental and errors out frequently. In the year and a half I've owned it it's probably worked three months. The company has replaced it three times but each unit failed within weeks. Finally they offered an out-of-warrantee replacement if I sent back the unit at my cost and gave them another $39.99. If it were a new version then maybe but I don't want to be having the same conversation in three weeks about out of warrantee replacement. I'd wait for the next version.

And it does a fine job of sanitizing plain water. However I could never get it to finish a cycle when trying to sanitize foods. And the claims of cleaning are a bit of a hype. Sanitizing is about all the water can do. It did not clean mildew, soap scum or even plain old dirt off of anything. And if it takes so many trys to get the product to work how is this helping in reducing costs associated with wasting electricity. I sent mine back. They should have worked a little harder on getting the bugs out before introducting this to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer's Remorse","review":"I've purchased two of these units and I am extremely disappointed.

I love the idea of using it to clean fruit, vegetables and household surfaces.Why is the machine built so poorly?? There is no reason for me to go through multiple machines. I have replaced the machine at least four times. I have even purchased new ones when the machine was out of warrenty. I have had two leak from the bottom and my current replacement model is flashing F7.Their customer service is terrible. You can't get through and you go into a black hole voice mail.In all of the time that I've owned a unit, I have never recommended it. I'm not sure why I have been so loyal. I am finally done...I can certainly use the counter space for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company does not stand behind the product","review":"I was really excited about this product. Then I tried using it. The water bottle attachment works fine but the bowl attachment will not pass a cycle even with just plain water. I called the manufacturing company. They told me to buy Dasani brand water and run the bowl two times with the Dasani water. That cost me $5 to do. I did that and it didn't work. I still got the error message with just plain Dasani water. I called the company back and they said if the water bottle attachment works then the unit works and they won't do anything. I told them I bought this item for my produce not for the spray bottle. They then told me just use the water bottle on all the produce.This was a brand new item and they won't take it back, and they won't replace it. I spent over $200 on something that doesn't do what it says and the company will not stand behind there product.Just be warned you may be stuck with something that doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"My food doesn't taste like bleach!","review":"I purchased this to go along with me to a third world country where I lived for 3 years. Fruit and veg are sketchy at best in these places and most people soak everything in a bleach solution. If done perfectly you don't really notice the bleach but that is hard to do and still feel safe eating non-cooked fruit and veg. With this I never worried, just toss it in and let it run through the cycle. Honestly I never got sick from any food prepared in my house, I did plenty of other times but never at home. Whether you are in the States or off in Africa I think this is a great product. Plus it smells fresh and clean like a spring rainstorm everytime you use it. I highly reccomend this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work long, and never for some things","review":"I purchased this with high hopes. At first it worked pretty well on everything but strawberries and grapes. I think I got a cycle to finish on a batch of strawberries once...ever. Maybe a couple times with grapes. Yes, I tried bottled water. Yes, I ran it through multiple cycles (up to 10). It just would not work on those two things.Now, at 1.5 years old and rarely used in the last 6 months, it works on nothing. I'm ready to toss it or give it to Goodwill. I spent the money to join an organic CSA for this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great while it lasted","review":"I bought one and liked it a lot. It was everything it was said to be, but then it broke after a month. The company replaced it with a reconditioned unit. That one worked for about six months and then broke. Now I've given up.

Now I clean 2 times and hope that the fruits are \\"pretty clean\\".I am not sure if I have received a \\"bad product\\" or most of the users are encountering similar problems.

I read a great deal of non-fiction of this type, and the opening pages were very promising. But I ultimately found it disappointing, even offensive. Trienens sinks the book in legalistic detail, focusing so much on the civil suit that he loses sight of the fascinating larger story. Worse, he seems to regard the Goodmans -- descendants of the owner who died in the Holocaust -- as little more than opportunists, and displays little sympathy or respect for their family's tragedy. And while he claims to be taking an objective view, over and over he interprets facts in a light most favorable to the defendant in the suit -- his client. This book is a badly missed opportunity.

Thankfully, though, none of the songs are bad. It sounds relatively unique, but not as much as, say, Thievery Corporation. Also, the vocalists are slightly a guilty pleasure at times (see \\"Still Burnin\\"). The production is pretty good - you'll definitely love the first three songs. It's not a classic album, but trip-hop fans will probably like it a lot.

I also felt patronized by the message that pumping at work would be too hard and I shouldn't bother trying.

I am now back to work, and STILL breastfeeding! I liked the approach recommended by Dr. Wilkoff - take things a few months at a time and see how it goes. Thinking about nursing for the recommended 12 months when my baby was 2 weeks old and I was in tears each nursing session for various reasons was just too much.

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, small sized dish rack, but stainless steel rusts","review":"This is a nice looking dishrack, and is the perfect size for me - I live by myself and always wash my dishes by hand. The only problem is that within the first week the tray started rusting, and now the rack itself is beginning to rust. As well as washing my dishes, I have to wash the rack too! I've used this rack for a little less than half a year, and am looking to replace it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was looking for a large, nice, stainless steel drain rack and was not happy once I actually used this. First, there's no way to drain the water from the tray below into the sink, you have to lift and dump it out. :-(. Second, it just doesn't have the space I like, like on the plastic ones, for glasses...and the like and things slip-or don't stay where I put them. Thirdly, the silverware tray is strange, that the silverware leans way over to one side, making it more difficult to put more in as you wash. I would return it had I kept the receipt. Who would have thought you had to use a drain rack to know if you like it?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed","review":"I purchased this product a few years ago and it rusts despite the claim that it is rust resistant. Secondly, the drainage rack has nowhere to drain so the water accumulates and creates more rust. I will now purchase a cheap plastic dish rack that can be cleaned easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality has degraded and now rust","review":"I owned this dish rack 7 years ago and it never rust. It's still at my mom's house and looks beautiful. When I moved out, I bought the same dish rack and within 6 months, rust everywhere! There are rust water staining my granite countertop which is not good. The bottom pan also has water stains that I can't get remove no matter how hard I scrub."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Rusts","review":"I figured out how to stack more dishes by angling the glasses, and I love the drainer, BUT it rusts! Stainless steel, my foot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great--so long as you don't use it","review":"It is a nice looking dish rack, but the one here has rusted, not just at the joints but pretty much everywhere along the bottom third. The pan has not rusted, which is odd, since it is always full of water unless you empty it by hand after filling the rack with items to dry. Horrible design in that regard. Maybe it's a quality control issue, or this was just a badly-plated one. Either way, would never purchase another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I should have read the reviews before I bought this dish drain. The water doesn't drain out so we turned it over and punch holes in the rim. This does help the water to drain but along the lip we now have mold growing. The utensil caddy is the worse..everything falls...there is no place to put your glasses and the compartment for the dishes is also lacking. Dishes fall right through the large opening.Rust? It does rust. I bought stainless steel because I thought that wouldn't happen...Surprise !!!So needless to say I am disappointed. Do not buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice at first but very unfunctional.","review":"It looks nice. But when you have a lot of dishes to do, you can't stack because of the uneven surface on one side. The lower part is so low, that sometimes the dishes wind up sitting in dirty water.I would NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking...","review":"Welll built, looks good...

My one complaint is that it does not have an adjustable canopy so if you are walking into the sun your baby gets blasted with sun in his/her eyes. I've had to use clips on the canopy to attach a blanket but then my toddler complains because she can't see.

Bottles of water do not fit well in the cup holder, and while on a walk, a completely full bottle of water flew out of the cup holder and hit my 11 week old on the head. I gave the stroller such a low rating because I wanted to bring this problem to the attention of parents. We got lucky, and our daughter wasn't seriously hurt, but the experience was traumatizing for both of us.This is something to keep in my mind if you purchase the stroller. I will probably continue to use it, but put water bottles under the stroller in the basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for toddlers when they are asleep","review":"the jogger is great, big tires, colapses small, but its boring for the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I bought this jogger and loved it at first. It has turned into a dud. It pulls to the left, the frame is creaking under the strain of having to correct it from pulling. I don't use it for jogging- just trips around the block with my 8 month old and to a local park where there's gravel. Tried to fix it but we can't get it right. Hope you have better luck. Still waiting on Baby Trend to return my call.**Update... Baby Trend never called me back but I did finally get them. The customer service rep said I could send it back but if their mechanic fixed it the problem and then dis-assembled it and sent it back I may still have a problem because I am not a mechanic and the problem might just be me. Not friendly service. I never sent it back and use it very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulls to the left --- just like all the other complaints","review":"We just bought this stroller two days ago and we already hate it. We are veterans to jogging strollers and the need to adjust the front wheel periodically to have the stroller roll straight. This stroller pulls to the left regardless of the adjustments we make. It is useless as a jogger because we are constantly correcting the direction, and irritating as a walking stroller for the same reason. We will be returning this stroller today, and will not be exchanging it for a like product, based on the many similar reviews of this stroller pulling to the left."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit heavy, but good!","review":"Since my husband and I travel to out of the way locations a great deal we decided to invest in this stroller.

The author had a good experience in therapy herself and decided she wanted to tell others what she learned so that they could benefit more readily and avoid mistakes. She has no axe to grind and she is not promoting one form of therapy over another, which is a real strength given that all forms of therapy have been conclusively shown to be equally effective. She doesn't have any formal training in psychotherapy or psychology, however, so take her advice with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Flight!","review":"Keeping it weird in Austin, TX, this CD is dedicated to \\"all the spirits in all the directions who landed in the microphone\\" -- many different moods and styles blend on this one, with the opening track recalling recent acts like TV On the Radio before summoning up Forever Changes-era Love. Some very great distorto-guitar and squonky organ as the album gets going, and White Flight is never afraid to venture out into strange experimental soundscapes before snapping back into some very nice garagey funk grooves.

I wouldn't buy another one though after it konked out so soon, the tilt quality, and the size as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this or other spherical puzzles by this manufactur","review":"I bought a spherical puzzle of the moon. The problem is that the pieces intentionally don't fit together perfectly to get the puzzle to hold the spherical shape. Consequently, you'll find two pieces that you think will fit. When you turn them over, where each piece has a number encoding its order, you'll discover you were wrong. Basically, you can't tell if you've assembled the thing correctly unless you cheat.Second, even when you find two that are sequenced together, you have to pound -- and pound hard -- to get them to fit. After one attempt to get ten pieces to go together, my fingertips were so sore that I had to give up for the rest of the night.I'm an idiot savant at assembling jigsaw puzzles, but I gave up on this one. It wasn't worth the literal pain to put it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces dont fit together!","review":"This is a nifty idea for a puzzle, but it needs some work. The pieces don't fit together! I couldn't even get the base of mine to fit together perfectly (or even close to perfectly) and that part is flat! After a few tries, I finally gave up out of frustration at the pieces falling apart so often!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your time would be better spent elsewhere","review":"This puzzle does not offer much of a challenge. It is solved by following a numeric sequence (ie. place #1 w/ piece #2) which are printed on the back. Secondly, the pieces don't fit together well. We had to implement a glass to pound the pieces together. When we reached the north pole, we had to just place (not interlocking the pieces) the top for fear of it crashing down. Therefore, as avid \\"puzzlers,\\" we cannot recommend this puzzle with good conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had a great great time with the puzzle","review":"I completed this puzzle.

The reality was that the finished product - if you are able to finish it - is crude and disappointing. The first half of the globe was easy and went well. The pieces above the 'equator' were difficult to insert (the further along, the harder) because the pieces were flat and the globe round. Glue was not optional, because pieces fell out as you worked, so had to be secured to continue. Very, very unhappy with the project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"As much as this puzzle costs, you should be able to undo one piece without the pieces tearing. This puzzle is so hard to put together. We got all of the way to the top and then it was impossible to make the puzzle stay together while you finished the last few pieces. There were no instructions included. We figured out how to put it together and it is not fun like a normal puzzle. All you do is put the numbers in sequence. How fun is that!!! Then it keeps falling apart so that youcan't even finish the puzzle.

I couldn't get it to read DVDs or burn DVD-Rs without many errors.After extensively searching Google I found quite a few other people who had the same problem and I was led to suspect it was a firmware issue, and the Averatec website didn't have any firmware upgrades, nor did the QSI site (which was mostly in Chinese and the little bit of English was very broken English.) So, I emailed Averatec asking if they knew where I could get a firmware upgrade.

Lots of interesting twists and a surprise (pretty much) ending. It's very readable with good pacing and a plot that propels you along, BUT... My problem is with the characters-- I agree with other reviewers that the romance between Hero/heroine was not believable because he was too much of a jerk in the beginning and through much of the middle. Also, I had a very hard time with the total absence of the child throughout the story. In fact, the story could easily have been told without the child, IMO. I felt that the villains were painted a very monochrome black-- no redeeming human characteristics for a more complex emotional involvement on the part of the reader. And I have to say that Cameron frequently uses \\"deviant sex\\" to both titillate the reader and label the villains as BAD. I enjoy sensual novels, but I am getting tired of this technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading it now","review":"I am reading this book now, and it is developing very nicely.

We haven't lost power since we installed the alarm but on a few occasions I opened the freezer door longer than I should have and after a few minutes the alarm does go off.For the cost of the alarm you're getting protection you can count on.The con:The alarm isn't loud, in fact I'd classify it as \\"moderate volume\\". If your freezer is on a different floor or somewhere you don't go regularly you may not hear it. Our extra freezer is in the garage, which is just off the laundry room and kitchen.

THIS one, however, has nothing to prevent our bird from picking up the tidbits of corn cob and throwing them all over the place. also the food and water cups are very small and he throws the corn cob pieces all in his water and food dish.

It is obvious she is trying to sound as if she has had voice training, but if she has it hasn't done her a lot of good. Her music itself is overly simplistic in its composition and in no way should anyone who likes Loreena McKennit buy this CD. I am always hoping for good spiritual music, but this is not it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for your soul","review":"My favorite Elaine Silver CD so far!

It is a happy album, even during songs as tragic as the classic \\"Burning Times\\". Somehow, the cheeriness always shines through.This album does not have a heavy spiritual feel, even though it is geared toward the enlightenment of spirit. Instead, it features folk-like songs that use a lighter touch to gently guide you through your day. Songs like \\"Softening\\", which is about taking life more in stride are absolutely precious on days when you feel wound up. And the inclusion of Libby Roderick's \\"How Could Anyone\\" was a brilliant idea. It's a song about what it means to be beautiful and whole.This springy, colorful album should be a welcome addition to any Goddess-centered music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"My introduction to Elaine Silver was through her Cd 'Lady Of the Lake,' a Cd that is still amongst my favorites. 'Faerie Goddess' was given to me personally by Elaine as a Thank You gift when she performed for my church back in July 2006. Once again her music took me on a magical journey of truth and transformation. Elaine is a gifted singer and song writer whose roots are in folk. 'Faerie Goddess' celebrates the Goddess and introduces us to pagan folklore. One of my favorite tracks is her rendition of the song 'Burning Times' authored by Charley Murphy. Seven of the 13 songs were authored by Elaine. This is a magical Cd that will inspire you and draw you closer to the Goddess. Thank you Elaine for this incredible music. Blessed Be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs that make your flesh creep","review":"I love the album Faerie Goddess; it has chants and songs that are warm, loving and beautiful. Since I got this cd I had to know more of this Faery Elaine, as she calls herself sometimes.She isn't really professional, but her voice makes you flesh creep. Ballads and chearful songs, in a total of 13 songs.Although I have to say that some texts, like: don't you know you're body is a temple, the earth is a witch and nine million european women died; isn't an accurate thing to say; because it that is just a romantic idea of female witches. But if you look beyond that: it really sounds very nice!I also have Faeries, dreams and Other Friends, which is a cd full of American Children Songs, such as; Puff the Magic Dragon and Teddy Bears'Picnic.

The author has, for this book, taken what few facts we have and woven around them a plausible, entertaining, moving tale of Mother Julian of Norwich.This is historical fiction at its best, weaving a fictional personage into what we do know of a time period, and doing it seamlessly. The author's character of Julian may or may not be very like the woman who spent so many years in a cell at St Julian's Church in Norwich, true, but she may well have been, and why not?Love, faith, and joy shines throughout this novel. As a lover of history, historical fiction, and Christian mystical writings, this book was absolutely to my taste in every way. Well done, on every level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book.","review":"Wildly insightful and intelligent, yet unpretentious and down-to-earth, and surmounting incredible heartache, Julian teaches herself to read and write Latin and English in a time when nothing much was expected of women. Their options were housewife, nun or prostitute. Period. Her commitment to the spiritual life and her dedication to knowing God's ways are inspirational, and her willingness to share what she learned is a blessing to us all. I'm reading her \\"Showings\\" now and recommend them as well. She chose a life of isolation and spent her days praying and meditating and counseling townspeople. Reading her book is like eavesdropping on her conversation with God.By the way...it's not The EARTHLY Story of Julian of Norwich.

The female character is powerless, confused, and lets herself be ruled by any of 3 different men, all of this in SPITE of the fact that she is supposedly the embodiment of the Norse goddess Freyja. Over this weak foundation, Paxson includes overdone political commentary on the Viet Nam war (it felt as if she really wanted to talk about Viet Nam, and wrote the Freyja story as an aside), male characters who are flat and predictable, a storyline that tries, but fails, to sell itself, and superficial exploration of dated stereotypes.I read the book through, hoping that it would redeem itself.

I fully cleared the game for all achievements and then put it away as soon as possible. I wanted to like this game, but ended up only liking the main character. It seems they poured most of their budget into her creation and rushed everything else. It seems like they originally intended to create a different game. I say this because the levels are not always linear, yet often you will reach a dead end that has nothing of interest; nothing to kill, nothing to pick up... just nothing. The graphics are subpar, the environments are not detailed and the enemies uninspired. Also, the enemies are recycled over and over. I remember mostly relying on 1 gun to beat the game on all difficulties. Basically the end product was a good start, a rough draft, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is There A Spell T o Refund My Money?","review":"Too bad you can't use curse words on Amazon, because there would be a ****load right now. This game is filled with good intentions and some nice ideas, but just not thought out as well as it should have. Mowing down demon soliers in a suburban neighborhood should be alot funner than this. And while the magic effects are nice, the overall feel of this game is very mediocre; The movements are awkward, and while some of the graphics are nice and sharp, the overall bland enviornments will just have you shaking your head. Sure, all the explosions look 'purty', but don't they all on Next Gen? This could have a been a really fun guilty pleasure with a little more effort behind it, but instead it's just very ho-hum. Another year in development could have maybe turned this around. But....Just play Bloodrayne 2 again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great graphics and fun!","review":"The game is very fun and has some great entertainment value. While the camera can be a pain sometimes, I enjoyed the game and keep replaying it. The graphics look very nice and while many people complain about the enemy A.I., I found the level to be just challenging enough while not being overly difficult to the effect that would keep me from wanting to play this game. I enjoy the fact that I can let the enemy see me, then go hide around a corner and blast them when they try to come chase me-just like an action movie! I would have given the game 4.5 stars if possible, the only frustrating point being the camera angles occasionally going crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost potential..... But give credit for the effort.","review":"Yes this game isn't the best of its class but it was a very hard concept to make and by this 3rd party Developer Atari that made games such as Enter the matrix and so on, One can't really expect an Award winning \\"Game of the Year\\" Franchise to follow through. This game would have been more successful had it been Rated Teen since the gameplay is simplistic as Devil may Cry and there was no need for the ultra gore. Overall Its an above average game that didn't do too hot in the market that was targeted for a small group of gamers. Not too bad but not too great either."},{"rating":"2","title":"read me \\\\/","review":"As you can see this game must not be for everyone, but I dont see any problem with it. The story was referred to as \\"an embarassment to storytelling\\", but this story doesn't seem any more stupid than the ridiculous story presented in halo. Personally I wasn't expecting an incredible story from a game called \\"bulletwitch\\". I was looking to blow everything up as a woman in a schoolgirl outfit. And thats exactly what I got.

Sexy girl, big guns, stuff blowing up, whats not to like right? Boy was I wrong. There is very little to do in this game. Theres no ammo to pick or health to find (you have unlimited ammo and your health regenerates pretty fast). The enemy AI is horrible as well as your allies. Aiming your weapon is difficult and jerky. You run FOREVER through unnecessarily vast landscapes. There is very little challenge. I played the game for a few HOURS praying for something interesting to happen. Finally after two or three stages, I come upon what i perceived to be a boss. Big guy 4 or 5 stories tall with a giant machine gun for an arm. Yes! Finally something to do...I killed him with one spell...seriously...I didn't even have to move. I could go on and on but I wont.

The work covers the period from his early political carrer in New York through Andrew Jackson's presidency. Van Buren's own presidency in not covered. His anecdotes regarding Jackson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John Calhoun are interesting and stimulate one to read more of the era. The animosity between the Federalist and Republican parties in the early 19th century is also a common theme. There is a lot of self-serving fluff regarding issues the affected Van Buren the politician as the book passes the halfway point and my interest here waned. Van Buren never mentions his wife--although his sons are mentioned. If you are interested in this era of American history and have a prior grasp of the issues at hand, this work may provide some enjoyable and entertaining insight into the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cryoderm Gives Welcome Relief","review":"I use this product to help give me relief from severe back pain in the cervical area.

Superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riven: The Sequel to Myst","review":"In this, one of the most eagerly awaited computer games of all time, the user is shown a truly diverse and intriguing world. As appealing as this may sound, one would never known it. Dealing with the game's lack of involvement and user participation grows tiresome quickly.The concept of point-and-click gameplay, which was revolutionary in Myst's day, is beginning to show its age. Today's games often immerse the player in another world; Riven succeeds in only providing the individual with a multitude of pretty scenes.There may be a fascinating story behind Riven, but it is lost in its clumsy implementation. This title will only appeal to those who wish to show off their fast and new their computers. I surely won't be waiting around another five years for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous graphics","review":"This game has stunning scenery that changes continuously.

I think they are still one of the best games ever in the adventure genre. No violence but still thrilling, very good sound and grafic design, and you're almost meditating while playing the game. Go and get them, I can't wait to get MystIII - Exile and it looks llike I'm going to have to get a new CPU and grafic card to play the sequel in 2001"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tranquil, Peaceful, Phenomenal!","review":"Clear and breath taking! Truly a work of art! I fell into the world and enjoyed it's beautifully creative puzzles. The natural scenery was so realistic that I found that between sessions of playing the game and for sometime afterward, whenever I stood in a natural setting, I felt like I was back in the game! Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diffecult but not Impossible, maybe....","review":"I just finished Riven and it was one of the most exciting games I have ever played, if not the most. The graphics were superb and I felt like I was on a roller-coaster ride many times. The puzzles were diffecult, but I got through the majority of them with only a few hints, but I'm not sure I could have done it without help. I'm really looking forward to whatever sequel RedOrb has in mind. It will be at the top of my list as soon as it is released. Check out the web site on the Riven box for input and help, but then if you are as into puzzles as Riven fans are, you don't need that hint. Go for it. Give your imagination some exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the Myst series","review":"This is the best game I have ever played. It took so long and I was so worn out by the end that I felt that I had really been on a journey. Very Good! I would just recommend you play Myst first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Game, but Very Hard.","review":"I havn't played Myst yet, but I have completed this one. What an immersive game this is. Great graphics, great sound, great features to play with and great fantasy world. Riven might only be a small world, but it's well worth the visit. You even get to see some alien creatures here and there. I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers. It took me 3 months in all, WITHOUT HINTS I might add. If you like fantasy, puzzles and exploration. GET IT. It's worth it just for the graphics alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very complicated, well detailed, but a little too hard.","review":"Riven is the best game. If I were a genius, I would love it, but average old me thinks it is too hard to beat without the walkthrough, so I got it.

But More ? Yes, this is the Game to get your hands and Mouse on next. None before has had the visual presentation of Riven. Even the sound is far better than anything you are likely to have encountered yet. From the very start the intrigue is foremost and doesn't let up with the puzzles. How long does it take to determine the Base 5 system ? Does every lever and button do something cruical ? Come along and find out. I picked up this game and started right away. 4 hours a day and 14 days later I was on my way to safety. You can't have this much fun in front of a T.V. Congrat's to the designers.

I have a Mac operating Mac OS 10 on a PowerPC chip. The system requirements list only \\"PowerPC\\" as required. But in fact Riven only operates under the \\"Classic\\" environment which means Mac's running 10.2.6 or LESS.

Again, buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac OSX owners BEWARE","review":"My sons both had MYST and I loved watching them play. Now, years later, I have my own laptop and couldn't wait to get MYST - however, it won't work on newer MACs.However, none of the reviews I read or system requirements I saw said that RIVEN wouldn't work on OSX.

Although the graphics are fabulous, the game is awful. The puzzles aren't difficult, but sometimes so tricky that the game becomes stupid. Some things just lack sense. If you really liked Myst, don't buy Riven. The only thing you will find both in Myst and Riven is the kind of graphics and the point and click. Don't expect to find the same kind of intelligent puzzles Myst had. After some play, you really get sick of this game. If you really want to play it, borrow from a friend.Riven maybe is the worst game sequel I've seen. It's really sad, because Myst is one of the best games ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVE STARED BOREDOM IN THE FACE!!","review":"Riven is the unneccessary sequel to Myst. Apparently, there are enough insomniacs out there to merit a sequel. I can't imagine anyone that would prefer this to an excellent game like Red Alert or Quake. If it's reflexes you lack, try Heroes Of Might and Magic 2 or Curse of Monkey Island.

RIVEN is all you would expect from a sequel. From the start, you are launched into the beautful world of Age Five (a.k.a. Riven). Turn the music up, the lights down...and prepare for immersion.....My one complant is the hardware needed. I played it on my brand-new PII-333, and even IT seemed stressed out at times. If you have the hardware, though, Riven is a wonderful game....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, Entertaining, Beautiful!","review":"When I first played MYST I was enthralled by the graphics and enjoyed the game so much that I went into mild depression when I finished it :) But even MYST doesn't hold a candle to RIVEN. Just walking around and looking and listening is entertaining! Everything looks and sounds so realistic that it's utterly fascinating. And it's challenging enough to anybody stuck to their computer with the sound up for great periods of time. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply terrific","review":"I don't play computer games. Like, at all. Except for Myst, and now Riven. They are intelligent, require thought, and immerse you in a fascinating world of the Miller's imagination. I was delighted with Riven, but I was having a hell of a time getting through it - and my partner was stuck too - then we started playing it together. My intuition, his straightforward logic, and our mutual enjoyment of the glorious world of Riven - not only did we get to play a terrific game, it helped us see the strengths of our differences! Challenging, clever, overwhelming graphics and so-realistic sounds, the world of Riven is addictive in the best way. Only problem is, there's no room for a sequel. Rats.... but I would recommend Riven and Myst to any thinking adult who just doesn't understand the appeal of those mindless 'shoot 'em up' computer games. This one's different. This one is terrific. Buy it, play it, live it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate that I cheated","review":"This is by far my favorite out of the Myst series. Before I knew better, I cheated to get to the ending, looking at walkthroughs. Unfortunately, it's not like you can 'undo' that memory in your head, and I've forever ruined the game in my eyes. The two biggie puzzles in this game involve clues from the whole game you've explored up to that point. I wish I had taken the time to fully appreciate their solution and not cheat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the graphics - but the game play is impossible","review":"The graphics on this game are very pretty and make the game seem quite fascinating for the first week or two.After a week or two of playing this game, however, and you will realize you don't have a clue what is going on. Anyone who says they have figured this game out without a guide or less than a year of their life invested playing 8 hours a day is a liar.The game is impossible to figure out unless you are willing to decicate your whole life to it. Period.So if you like a game with neat graphics that you will roam around in for hours on end, clueless as to what is going on, then Riven might be for you.For those with less time I would recommend a game like Grim Fandango, instead of Riven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty to look at, but boring","review":"Can't imagine what all the hoo-ha was about.

The pacing of puzzles and clues is completely unbalanced. Some of the puzzles are made more difficult by a cavalier attitude toward providing clues.

Graphics and game play that go far beyond Myst, plus teriffic sound and lots of real video, you can really get into this game! Solving puzzles can get very tricky at times, so you might need the RIVEN players guide, since there is no virtual guide to give you a hand when you may need it. You must travel to five islands on Riven, plus a few other places. There you must pay close attention to every detail and keep track of every bit of info (A notebook may be helpfull) and finally use that info to conquer the game of Riven.

We don't want to read a fictitious account - we want the facts - and we got few if any. This book was a joke - Chuck, it seems, was trying to make a joke of the establishment, but instead his fans suffer, reading an empty novel. If Chuck wants to write fiction, then let him - but don't pawn this off as true(!), because it's not true! On the other side of the coin, I still enjoy the Gong Show - it was (and still is) FUN!!

The quality of the production was, in my opinion, very nice. The sets and costumes were lavish, and the singing was exemplary. However, the characterization of Marguerite as a Catholic nun made it very strange to say the least. Also, during the overture a bizarre ballet is performed in which Faust uses Universal Studios-ish Frankenstein equipment to bring a dead girl back to life for a few moments.

The video appears to have been shot from the balcony with a hand held VCR. The initial scene concentrates on the trap door through which Mephistofeles appears. The video is blurry and focuses much of the time on an empty stage or on the bass players in the orchestra.

But the Palm OS itself doesn't support printing Docs to Go fonts, so what you see on your Palm device is not what you get from the printer.

This is very dissappointing reading, because you are expecting to learn more about how brokers work as you continue on reading. Another annoying thing is that Anonymous has a very big EGO. All you read throughout the entire book is how great this guy is in everything he does (which probably does fit the self-portraited image of a Wall Street broker). But of course there is one good point this book makes: Never confuse a broker with a money manager! A broker earns his salary with turnover, buying and selling stocks. Regardless whether his customers make money, a broker always does. A money manager gets it earnings by sharing part of your revenue, which he has to generate for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please....","review":"I could have written a FAR more scandalous book, and if I do I'll be sure and \\"name names\\".

(The stock was a dog)The broker pushed it more than once. My father bought the shares. Eventually, the value of stock turned from $10 to ZERO.Never felt sorry, the broker continued to push for other stocks (which they didn't perform)After reading this book, I understand why the broker behaved the way he did. And how my father lost the money.Incidentally, the specific broker hardly promotes blue chips stocks. Rather, he focuses heavily on small caps and special issues. I often wanted to question him about that. This book solves this mystery for me.Interesting book which your broker doesn't want you to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Underworld of Wall Street","review":"This book provides a sneak peek into the seedy underworld of drugs, sex, gambling, and outright theft of Wall Street.

True, the bad guys in the book are only a small percentage of the business, but the book also tells a lot about the basic conflict of interest between all brokers and clients. Like the bit about hidden commissions. I'd never known about that, but now it makes sense. My broker, back when I had a broker, never told me about that. They just want to make money for themselves. If they make money for you, fine, but they look out for No. 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for playing in Colorado.","review":"This is a very good book for anyone who is trying to adjust to playing the $2-$5 hold'em games that are spread in the casinos of Colorado.

Of course, upon meeting, said country music star and gargoyle, fall in love. Yes, nothing like screwing like mad bunnies without saying more than a few words to each other to win the hearts of millions of readers---NOT.

This cookware is everything a person could want--takes less heat than others, cooks evenly, and looks beautiful. I wish I had had it fifty years ago.

A person with good equipment can always do a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now you're cooking with copper.","review":"This copper-bottomed Catering line by Sitram is the best performing line of cookware around. I have an All-Clad SS skillet that is almost exactly this size and my wife and I both like this Sitram pan quite a bit more than the AC. The thick (~2 mm) copper disc in the bottom of the this pan means that it heats much more quickly and evenly than an aluminum clad pan like AC. When you remove this pan from the heat it cools quickly, too, meaning food stops cooking when you want it too. Also, its quite easy to clean up, probably because the stainless interior seems to be a lot more smooth than in other pans. If you cook often enough to be considering a pan in this price range, just get it.

This is what I'm always telling our children. This book does a great job in explaining the history of Halloween. Sure getting dressed up and getting candy seems harmless, but is it really??? Does God really want us living in a way that celebrates fear, death and horror when He himself does not give us a spirit of fear? I'm not saying all costumes and all people dress up in scary ways, but the main focus of Halloween is death and hauntings,etc. Reading this book is a wonderful way for the family to come together and understand the history of this day and not in a holier than thou way!

They've taken scripture and used it to justify anything they don't like, and many of them don't like Halloween. That's mainly due to the fact that they have very little understanding of this holiday's cultural roots and important role in fostering a child's ability to face his or her fears instead of being ruled by them.I'd appreciate a book that illustrates how the celebration of this holiday might benefit Christian parents, instead of this ill-conceived propaganda.

Jacob idolizes his artistic older brother, Asher, the family rebel. He is tyrannized by his autocratic and narcissistic father, Abram. And his converted from gentile mother, Claire, remains ineffective in his life, even after she leaves her husband whose iron-fisted emotional abuse is unbearable for everyone. Funny in spots, tense with suppressed violence, and hackneyed in being another story of male repression couched in a father-son relationship.Tobias Wolff'sThis Boy's Life: A Memoiris afar better literary experience and vastly outshines Braff's offering, which reads more like a screenplay than a novel. Gee, I wonder why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you laugh and cry","review":"Jacob Green shares his thoughts about growing up in a Jewish family trying its best. His rare gift of being able to read Hebrew makes up for other weaknesses, one of them: poor spelling skills. Occasional typoes in the novel, however, hint at the fact that it can't be entirely fictional, which renders the protagonist and/or author even more endearing.Especially worth reading if you are a Braff-fan and want an image of 6-year-old Zach (alias Gabe) in a tiny tux. The humor is very SCRUBS-like, following the narrator's trail of thoughts, which mingles the plot with the Unthinkable. At any rate, a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dissident","review":"I'm surprised to find that mine is one of the only negative reviews.

If you enjoyed Dracula, you'll love this. Very brooding and sparse in its simplicity. As usual Mr. Kilar relies on very low basses and cellos to build, and build themes in a repetitive manner. It's very effective and brilliantly executed.As the Dracula soundtrack, this is a dynamic score that needs to be played on a good system. And although I love my Goldsmiths, Horners, Zimmers and so on, for my money, this IS the best composer working in films today.

However the control is very touchy and pressing it up, down, left, right, or inward all do different things and if there is any motion in the car, you finger will bump it in one or more wrong direction adjusting things you don't want to.The process to switch between displaying the clock and the song info is so tedious requiring 4-5 careful movements of this joystick (every time) that it is virtually impossible to do while driving.Other than the joystick control, the unit is great.

Working at an ice making plant for 2 years, it has dropped, bumped and smashed into the machinery, the floor and forklifts. It's fallen 10 feet onto concrete and they have refused to break. I have worn them for 16 hours straight and never had problems with excessive pressure or pain. Even after I quit there, I still use it in my dorm room and on airplanes with my own in-ear headphones. They give me even more noise cancellation than Bose headphones and are just as comfortable. Instead of spending $350, I spent $30 total and have a very good product. As for the sound protection, they are far superior to other ear muffs and in conjunciton with earplugs, are nearly silent(If you need extra protection). The only complaint is that it would be nice to have them fold in, but then there would be a loss of durability.The down low:Comfortability ***** 5 starsDurability **** 4 starsHearing Protection ***** 5 starsMobility *** 3 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome earmuffs!","review":"Love these earmufs!

How this talented conductor slipped below my radar all these years is a mystery to me. This is an enormously sensitve and textured work worthy of some of the greats like Von Karajan and Szell. Admittedly, much of what I listen to is often decades old remastered analog recordings, or early digitals like the Telarc Cleveland Orchestra series. So I believe this performance beneftis from advances in technology. Still there is no denying its status as a masterwork. I was even more delighted to learn from liner notes that David Zinman earned his early musical chops at Oberlin College, just a few miles down the road from where I grew up. I picked up this recording because Beethoven 1 & 2 represented a hole in my library. It received rave reviews here so figured why not give it a try.

Horns and lights did not work on but one, another was missing keys when delivered, luckily interchangable. Within 5 days, one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit, the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere, and the third had two bald tires which burst! All this before the new year turned. I contacted the company, and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail. However, they offered no assistance on actual repair, telling me that \\"any man can do it with a few tools\\". After several hours and a visit to the tire shop, I fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now.

Now the bolts that hold the brake in place came loose and feel out and I cannot find them, so to the store I got to replace them.

At first, we thought they were defective--wouldn't charge. We then figured out that we needed to tighten everything--the connections were just loose enough to cause the battery to not charge. My kids (ages 10 and 8) rode these like crazy and then they sat in the garage for months, not being charged, so I was very surprised when we got them out again and they held a charge for hours of play! The rubber wheels are great, but like any real tire, they can be punctured by an errant nail in the road. Fortunately, my 8 year-old doesn't weigh much, so a \\"flat\\" tire doesn't affect her ride. Overall, a great choice for the price and very fun. I've even had a go at it, and I think they go faster than the stated 7.5 mph (we'll have to clock it sometime)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for basics only","review":"This book was a good resource for a quick review.

That wouldn't really matter except that I make the cheesecakes to sell and I use a 10\\" cardboard cake circle, instead of the glass bottom of the pan, and it doesn't fit.

But after several uses, I've noticed large patches of the nonstick surface gone and am having to swallow my disappointment and trash this product. I hope we haven't swallowed some of that nonstick coating along with our desserts, and I'm glad no young children have eaten them.

The family characters are so real that they seem to leap off of the pages. You will love all of them and you will not be the same, nor look at your own life the same way, after you close the book. It is amazingly heartwarming.

I personally had to look on the internet for some hints but that's just me. I believe that this game should be worth forty bucks at least, but the mere twenty is astounding. The entire game's originallity is astounding as well. The plot is very clever and the personalitys of the two brothers is complicated.

When you get stuck on a puzzle, there's nothing to do but ask a friend who's beaten the game what to do next. And as i've asked before, What are you susposed to do after you beat the game? (and please don't say \\"you could always play it again\\", because if you do, i'll know you're truly a geek:)I know it would defeat the perpose of this genre of beautiful non-violent games but I would like to see a combination of Myst and Doom in the future.

There is too much slow clicking around and backtracking to keep the attention of even the dullest person.I don't like having to resort to hints in order to play a game because it's released before the necessary technology is truely ready.REALmyst?...I no longer care.

While the environments were increadibly beautiful, they fail to make up for the miserable gameplay, which has you go to one place at least 5 times to solve five different puzzles. The story is intruiging, yet the game's ending fails to please the player, since, you'll discover shortly after completing it, it could be completed in a matter of minutes.A good game for 10 to 20 dollars, but you shouldn't spend more than that on this weekend game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Oh my gosh, this is the bst game in the world, I loved it !!!!!

The graphics for this game a very nice and the Quicktime Animation enhance th experince all the better. I eventually beat the game (after cheating two or three times). Some of the puzzles were almost impossible where I just stood back and was like \\"huh?\\".

It was wonderful to play together, keep a journal, think and talk about it with each other as we went through the days puzzling it out.The added bonus that I found with Myst, was that it woke me up to my environment. Playing this vivid, three dimensional (on all levels) game that demanded one listen to every sound, look in every corner, behind every door, etc. increased my sense awareness. Suddenly I was paying greater attention to and appreciating the amazingly vivid three dimensional world I live in every day.

The sound is cool and the graphics are good too. If you are not very experienced at solving puzzles like these (when you explore places and find out about them and their history), then get a hint book, or my brother. Once you understand the patterns throughout the levels, it becomes even more addictive. I would recommend this game to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still standing?","review":"Although almost 5 years passed after this superb game was launched is still competing the new adventure games. The reason why is of course the atmosphere and the loneliness of the game that with the help of the mysterious soundtracks makes you feel that you are actually in the game.

The surveys also allowed overlords to collect taxes directly and to remove the lower-ranking warriors from the villages and retain them in castle towns.In one stroke, a major source of political instability was eliminated and the structure of social relations in rural japan set for the next 250 years. When Japan modernized in the nineteenth century, the complex system of family obligations by which land was exploited laid the ground work for the mechanisms of social change that brought the country so quickly into the industrial world.This is a brilliant and beautifully written description of the role that these agricultural arrangements played in that modernization.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful look at resiliency in war","review":"I found myself surprised to like a film about heavy metal this much.While I respect it, it's not music that usually speaks personally to me.But this tragic, darkly comic, oddly triumphant and endearing look at agroup of young Iraqis trying to keep their band together and play - inthe middle of the insanity of war, and then later in exile in Syria -and also the crazy bravery of the two young film-makers trying to makea movie about them - has stuck in my head with very fond feelings.By making the war and it's effects this personal I came away with amuch deeper, more personal understanding than from a film trying to coverthe whole wide landscape.I wasn't quite as moved on a second viewing, but it'sstill a film I think of with tremendous wamrth, and recommend itwhether you like heavy metal or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always good to experience multiple perspectives","review":"It's always good to experience multiple perspectives.

It is wonderful to have a copy of this DVD in my collection - it is a little grainey due to the age of the performance no doubt, but the dancing is sublime. Fonteyn is wonderful as Odette/Odile, such grace is rarely seen and Nureyev is in his prime - Nureyev always danced with passion and the pair always danced as if they were meant for each other. There may well be better productions, but there are none to compare to Nureyev and Fonteyn as partners. I actually preferred the ending of the Anthony Dowell Covent Garden performance - but Anthony Dowell was wooden and no Nureyev. For the sake of seeing these dancers together in a classically danced ballet - I would highly recommend this. It is also a joy to see Fonteyn again and not the anorexic dancers we tend to see today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Important","review":"The ballet duo of Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn is something of a legend, and I'm pleased that a film was made of one of their performances and that it's available on DVD. The production is traditional and sumptuous. A voice-over narrates the story. I'm not well informed about the particulars of ballet and dance, but it seems to be a fine performance. Nureyev looks to have had special tights made to accentuate his behind; it's hilariously prominent. The film is old and rather faded, but its appearance suits the overall atmosphere and the ebbing memories of that time.

Still a very personal and informative short documentary. To me, this was not disappointing at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's First Family of Music","review":"Loved the video, although it should've been longer. I would have loved to see more of the Jackson Five footage, the complete performances. This video shows clips of footage. I must admit it took me back some years, but it was well worth it. I allowed my family to view the video and they loved it as well, but wished it would've been longer. This brought back some good time memories. \\"I Think About The Good Times.\\" I would ask that each of you purchase this video as a collectors item to reflect back on the good old times, and most of all to support the Jackson Family. I hope they will come out with a video of the Jackson Five showing full tv shows and concerts they did back in the day. Thank you Marlon for doing such a fantastic job on the narration. Also, I thought the interview Marlon's daughter did with the Jackson Five plus Randy was great.Lynn, okc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I was very, very dissappointed with this DVD, everyone wants to see Michael, he was only in one or two shots, then it was only about 45 minutes long, I will sell it for $6 if anyone is interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"the jackson america's first family of music","review":"I love this dvd, it was great I wish it was longer.

Strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not correct","review":"As another person stated \\"If you are a pastor that is greedy of filthy lucre then this book is for you!\\" Leon Bible weaves distortions and wresting of Scriptures to get another penny out of his flock. I can't imagine how he sleeps at night. This is only one of a thousand things he declares. Would not ever buy anything he writes again! It is very sad you see but it is fair to say. Get it LEON?

This book is for those who have no love except for money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I dearly loved Dan Jurgens' run on the \\"Superman\\" comic books -- he wrote and drew some of my favorite Superman stories of all time, not the least of which was the infamous \\"Death of Superman\\" storyline. This is not that storyline, however -- it's a rehash of the story years down the line filtered through the perceptions of a stereotypical comic book \\"crusading journalist\\" type. The new characters are dull and the old characters don't really add much to the story that we didn't get ten years ago when it was printed the first time.If anyone gets this paperback, it'll be Superman completists. People looking for a good Superman story -- get the original Death & Return saga... I'm afraid you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having kissed my share of frogs I had high hopes for the story, but it dragged. You never really get attached to the character and just keep reading to get the end. don't bother. There is no end. Very anticlamactic. She has no big character growth, no life altering event, no real conclusion at all. I can only assume Karrie's life will go on as it has for the first 45 years, I'm just glad I don't have to read about the next 45. don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great summer read for every season- don't wait!","review":"Don't wait for summer to enjoy this wonderfully light and easy read. It's fast paced and funny. The character,Kari Kline, has a different dating story to tell in each chapter which made it so hard to put down. I usually can't stay up late reading,but I couldn't put this book down even as I was fighting to keep my eyes open. Following Kari's experiences actually makes dating seem kind of fun. Most of her dates were happenstance meetings, not blind dates or other kinds of forced introduction. That alone should give single people renewed hope and encouragement that you just never know who and how you'll meet someone. It enforces how unpredictable life is. Besides entertaining, I found Lori's writing insightful. What Kari learns from each relationship about herself and other people made me reflect. I highly reccommend \\"You Have to Kiss A lot of Frogs\\" and hope there's more to come from Lori Graff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like being trapped at a party by a narcissistic princess...","review":"A rambling, self-obsessed, horrendously written bore. If you don't know any obnoxious NY princesses, and you are simply desperate to feel like you're at a really bad party, monopolized by a self-absorbed narcissist, you will find your own personal ring of hell with this book!! Otherwise, steer clear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of pages, but not much fun","review":"I'm all about books that are written from the single girl's point of view (i.e. Bridget Jones's Diary, The Devil Wears Prada, etc.) but this book, which details the life of the heroine in non-chronological order, is not a fun read. The reader never feels any true empathy for the Karrie Kline, nor does her romantic exploits satisfy the reader's imagination. There are better written, more interesting, and poignant books one could read instead. Don't waste your time flipping through over 400 pages waiting to like the book. Because even the ending, not the content, but how it is written-- cut short and dry, leaves the reader frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Frogs and Fun","review":"Author Laurie Graff gives us a fun ride through New York dating misadventures. It can be daunting no doubt for the protagonist, an actress with much on the ball and bless her -- a positive take on an often dismal situation. It's very New York, and probably pretty familiar for those who've been in the mix. The book moves at a nice pace and offers some good laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow...","review":"I flopped back and forth on my rating of this book. The beginning was hard for me to get into as the author writes in an almost a choppy form. Then I really got into the middle part of the book and couldn't put it down. Then, with about 100 pages left, I had to force myself to finish reading it! I have never had such mixed emotions about a book before. Normally if it is hard for me to get into, I eventually start liking it or hating it all the way through. I don't really know how to give a review on this book as it was hard for me to read. I know that is not a huge help but I always recommend to try something out for yourself because everyone is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing... Just nothing","review":"There are very few books in my life that I have not been able to finish. This was one of them. Nothing happened. Nothing funny, nothing exciting, nothing even tragic, except that it was completely boring! I found myself fighting to read it thinking that it has to pick up some time, but it didn't. Finally I gave up. I think the plot had potential if only some zany things would have happened. It was just a looooonnngggg list of boring, not so great dates and relationships that didn't work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to love yourself first...","review":"Karrie Kline, a struggling actress, takes us on a journey of disastrous dates and poignant personal reflections. She allows us to see her at her most vulnerable. We laugh with her and cry with her through years of dating in New York city. Single people will love this book because it will reassure them that they are not alone in the arena of modern dating disasters. Married people will relive old dating scenarios and live vicariously through the escapades of Ms. Kline. This is a fast-paced enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I think this book was too long; should have ended way before it did. Not the worst book I ever read, but certainly not the best. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"It's rare that I do not finish a book, but I had to put this one down. It was nothing like I expected it to be. The writing just was not captivating enough to make me force myself to finish it. I feel a book is only good if you can care about the characters in one way or another, and this book made me think, \\"So what?\\"I wouldn't waste my money. Well, actually, I did. But if I was you and I hadn't bought the book yet, I wouldn't waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schizophrenic dating disaster","review":"Only those who have no problem following an incessant rambling about guys who truly are stranger than fiction will be able to enjoy this book. It is essentially a bunch of words that have somehow made it into print, with no real beginning, middle or end. I suppose the holidays and years are nice, but halfway through each chapter, when I am still trying to find a point, I forget which day it is anyway. This book is so all over the place, and a downer to boot, that I wish I had not wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather kiss a frog than read this book!","review":"Halfway through the book, you are left wondering two things: why doesn't Karrie take a break from dating for a while, and why doesn't she try a new career? She seems to not have much luck in either arena, and the results are a rather tedious read. While cute at times, Bridget Jones diary it ain't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time....","review":"This book is TERRIBLE. It is all over the place, and seems to have no structure whatsoever. The dates the author describes are in no way funny or entertaining, just boring and pathetic. Definately do not waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended...","review":"It was a chore to finish this book. Karrie (lead character) drove me nuts, and the subplot about the random meeting of her unknown father on a set was completely unrealistic. I've read most of the RDI books, and this was one of the worst. It's not a good sign when celebrities supply the blurbs on the cover and back instead of other authors. Read the new Shannon Olson book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"It takes a lot for me to put a book down without finishing it. In the history of me reading there have only been 3 books that I have put down without finishing. This is one of them. The premise is that a lady is on the hunt for a man to settle down with. The chapters are written as if a diary history of 10 years of dating. The chapters are not immediately connected and the main character is so slimly designed that you could care less if a bus hits her. I would put this on one of the all time worst chick-lit books ever written. And to top that off probably one of the worst books ever. I find more interest in reading bathroom wall graffiti than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Caracas to Stockholm","review":"Very good. This is the second time I review it favourably.

The directions make installation a breeze, except the transducer initial location was too low, requiring me to re-position the bracket (meaning more holes in my boat). The 535 is simple to use and the menus make it easier to use than earlier models. The unit works well at high speeds but occasionally defaults to 3.5' in depths I know are deeper, tweaking the transducer helped but it is still not 100% accurate. I use it primarily in depths from 2' to 60' for fishing and shrimping, and the adjustable sensitivity is great for both uses. The screen display is good even in direct sunlight, my only regret is I wish I would have upgraded to the dual beam model.Humminbird 535 Fish Finder"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and easy","review":"All the books in this series are user friendly and the activities use materials that you have on hand.

I've had one in my apartment for a couple years, using it almost every day. I bought one for my parents and it's been solid for them as well.It's probably the smartest microwave I've used, too. You can set the kitchen timer while the unit is already microwaving, and vice versa. Pressing +30 seconds will start the microwave immediately, and you can continue to press +30 seconds to add more time. Have you ever used a microwave that doesn't allow these functions? It's a nightmare. Also, you can press one of the preset buttons and just walk away; the unit will start microwaving after a couple seconds.No problems with heating, either. It does what you expect it to. Clean and intuitive user interface. You won't be able to change the alert sound, but that's because this is a microwave, not an f'ing toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Worked well for the first year.

No fooling with your audio settings to get it to work properly. It works properly out of the box.The only minor inconvenience is having to remember to dial 011 (pause) and then the US phone number, which isn't a big deal considering the voice quality. It's also nicelooking with an adjustable phone cord.The reason I bought this phone is that I called up Vonage, after my former Skype phone stopped working, and found out that my Vonage bill would be about $32. monthly with taxes, and with Skype I paid $38. per year for 2 phone numbers. Period. No additional cost. And with the sound quality on this phone, you can't beat it.The Amazon price is better than the Wallie price, btw, which is a bonus. I highly recommend this phone.
