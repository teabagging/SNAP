The computer doesn't always shutdown properly, causing me to turn it off manually. It takes two minutes from the time you fire the computer up before you can do anything.

Once I formatted the hard drive and started fresh the problems went away. Ok lets get back to Windows ME. If you're going from 98 Second addition, you're not going to see much difference. But for those who are starting out new it's great. The drivers supplied with the software took care of everything. Following the directions made everything a snap.

Locks up during shutdown about 50% of the time, requiring a cold boot and scandisk. Then, scandisk often locks, requiring a second cold start, skipping scandisk. I had to reboot twice to get on-line to write this. Loading any software, even Microsoft products, causes problems -- the loaded software doesn't work, something else doesn't work, or the computer becomes unstable.

I downloaded and installed some updates just fine, but was not able to install certain other updates.The System Restore function, which is supposed to let you restore your system to a previous point and was a major reason for my move to ME, only worked about a third of the time I had to use it. The other two-thirds of the time, WinME told me that I was unable to restore to the point I wanted.I'd say, stick with 98, as the new features are only incremental in nature.

My biggest complaint is that they (Compaq and Microsoft) have cluttered the desktop with commercial inducements, some of which cannot be removed!

When are companies going to learn that we're all not stupid consumers and that they have to show respect?So I upgrade to Win 2000 and find that the Compaq modem doesn't work and Compaq informs me that it will never work under Win 2000. Since the Win 2000 installation reformatted the hard disk and Compaq didn't include Win ME disks or CD-ROMs, Compaq expects me to pay for new software!

In four months of use (ME came with a new Dell PC), I've suffered two major crashes that service technicians attributed to ME. There seems to be some glitch between ME and Word 2000, which also came with the computer. Further, as an AOL subscriber, there is some kind of incompatabilty betwen ME and AOL. Get used to waiting to get quick access to AOL and don't be surprised when you're given the news that AOL has disconnected you. A problem with AOL? No, when I revert to Windows 98, using the same AOL access telephone numbers, no problem.I'm profoundly disappointed with Microsoft for apparently rushing to dump a flawed operating system on an unsuspecting public.

After reinstalling it 3 times in that 18 months due to its instability, I finally broke down and bought XP. You see, if you try to install an application built to run with Win95, not only will WinME not run it, it will gradually cause the system to fail. Then again, sometimes it will just go on the blink for no reason at all. All of a sudden your modem gets a configuration error, or your sound stops working, and you have no idea what caused it. For some reason, it would load extra devices like crazy until it dragged performance down to nothing. About every 4 months, I would have to go into safe mode and delete the extra devices from the device manager. At one point, the device manager showed that I had 60 primary and secondary IDE controllers loaded for my hard drive.Anyway, take my advice and buy the Windows XP upgrade instead.

Where Apache Looks for its Configuration 2. Per Directory Configuration 3. Conditional Configuration 4.

It definitely has jazz and soul overtones throughout. The more I listen, the more I like it. Especially after playing track 2 (Devils & Angels) about 10 times first. It's nice to have a fresh new gritty female voice to listen to after my Nickelback CD. She plays that acoustic guitar very well. It sings its own song.

It will have you dreaming of Cuba on every track as you listen to the son of Marcelino Guerra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretender-Loose in L.A.","review":"Crissis hyde is a rock godess!

One can hardly exempt Israel from the general charges against proliferation, but at least in this instance there is a certain discipline to the endeavor, and, so far, no mad bomber routines. To be sure, Israel is a special case, the factor of deterrence has surely been more than abstraction. And one can only cheer at the destruction of the Iraq reactor.But this work is interesting for the description of the insidious tactics of 'opacity' in the public discourse of Israel on the subject, that is, the engineered lack of discourse. We invade Iraq to nix the nukes, while Israel simply slipped into half-invisible mode. That is changing now, and the author ponders the future here. Quo vadis?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent research based on the 1st hand material","review":"The Avner Cohen's book, is one of the best in the field.

Her examples come from a wide variety of literature (though my favorite was her example from Stephen King's Carrie). This is important to all learning writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic Reading for Dynamic Writers on Dynamic Characters","review":"WOW is the first thing I thought of after I swiftly devoured Mr. Kress' material in this book.

I love Master and Musician, and I love his instrumental works from the 90's on. I also really like his collaboration album, \\"Invention.\\" Furthermore, he is a great role model as far a being a devout Christian goes and he's been a huge inspiration for me. So when I got \\"What a Day/Love Broke Thru,\\" I thought, Two albums! How can I go wrong?I'll tell you how I can go wrong. It's two albums of boring. I don't mean to sound harsh, but it seems there are two Phil Keaggy's. The modern and the classic? The awesome and the corny? The Rock and the New Age? That's the best way to describe these albums- Not rockin' and very New Age. If you like that style, more power to you, but it is not for me.

While the Seed set came with the offical Gundam Seed Complete CD, this CD is just a collection of the opening and closing songs.

The readers learns a great deal about the normal events of courtship, marrying, friendship, birthing, raising children, educating them, keeping house, caring for the sick, and mortality, as well as the values and standards of conduct that existed in the past, some different from now, but some the same. It is all made more fascinating in that it is about the women of the famous poets: the wives Sarah Coleridge, Mary Wordsworth, and Edith Southey, and the sister Dorothy Wordsworth, and the daughters. The book has a lovely gossipy quality. We learn about the characters and relationships, what they thought of each other, what they liked and disliked.

It starts at the very beginning, goes thru the develppment stage, then the war. It's role in the murder of millions is covered.

The info on Ernst Roehm and the SD, I thought was very interesting.This book reads faster than The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and Albert Speer's Inside the Third Reich. I felt like with the other two Order of the Death's Head gives a nice picture of Nazi Germany.Because of the depressing subject manner in the eyes of most humans. I would suggest all three works with plenty of time to get the bad taste out of one's mouth between reading them.I also would argue that a focus on power is the best way to look at these people. There are plenty of racists, but few of them created and reached positions of power in a society.Thank you and good luck to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is quite an achievement","review":"In this quasi encyclopedic book the author brings alive the SS and the men that ran that organization.

This learned effort by Mr. Höhne combines scholarship with anecdotes and historical \\"trivia\\". This book will shed light on most readers about the organizational structure, mission and the legacy of horror that the SS left at its wake.

This book confuses the Waffen-SS and the SS-Totenkopfverbände (Death's Head), two different groups. Proving the author has some unknown agenda, he does not discuss the pan-European nature of the SS. Even the British Freikorps are not discussed (English Waffen-SS volunteers). Also, for the record the Death's Head is not some sick satanic sign, it was a traditional memorial symbol originally used at the funeral for Freidrick the Great the first king of a united Germany.Most sadly however, the tremendous bravery of the Waffen-SS in the final few months of the war is not mentioned anywhere in this book.

This is not an history book, is written in with words and qualifications that the writer has not a clue about. A good historian cant classify something without putting a single proof on the book. Its the same someone publishes a book about the US Air Force and puts, the devil US army killed millions with the Atom Bomb or how the RAF bombed german cities. Thats not history. If someone wants to put his personal ideas on a book then he should put the same comments for both the winner and losers of a war.Its doesnt mention a single good point of the SS and its full of errors.

It's 1141 A.D. and the celebration of Saint Winifred has brought a flood of pilgrims to Shrewsbury. Cadfael carefully and cleverly unwinds a twisted tale of retribution, murder, and medieval evil. Stephen Thorne's superb narrative talents do full justice to Ellis Peters' celebrated Brother Cadfael that has become one of the most popular mystery series in the annals of the genre.

Resume: there is (as usual) a fair near the convent, pilgrims come to the fair because the saint (from Morbid taste for bones)is beeing moved to her permanet resting place. Among the pilgrims a pair of men travelling together, one a pilgrim the other his companion and a small family consisting of brother, sister and aunt. These five plus Cadfael are the main charecters.

Most of us who get sheep brains for our labs from laboratory supply houses can only dream of the cranial nerves shown in clear detail here. At the University of Guelph, we are one of the few holdout universities that offer the sheep brain dissection to large introductory biopsychology classes, and although excellent photographic series are available on the Web, nothing can replace actually going through a sheep brain.

One of my favorite films in a long while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprising gem","review":"I'd never have seen this if I hadn't noticed Mr. Gleeson at the Golden Globes, nominated for his acting. This movie starts off with wonderful characters. He is delightful as an \\"unorthodox\\" local policeman uncovering corruption and murders. The FBI gets called in and Mr Cheadle is part of that team. Gleeson's character is unbelievably up front with his opinions. But he is shockingly right on not to mention very observant. There are some dramatic moments along the way and the dialects of a number of the characters can be difficult (I must mention that I can't remember if this takes place in England or Ireland, sorry).It is enjoyable and was a real surprise to all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guard","review":"This is a great movie.

Surprisingly, the download worked exactly as stated in the book, the very first time, without any problems. You are good to go, instantly. The book tells you how to use the downloaded routines, and gives background information on the topic. You can also reproduce the figures in the book, with the routines provided. This is especially useful if you like the graph, but need to adjust it (i.e. edit the routine)to cover your particular problem.

Please get them instead, you'll be very happy. I really don't know why this book got so many stars from so many readers. I guess stories are easier to read, but they are really not worth it even so.

There is also love, grief, and family struggle. It's interesting how something planted generations ago remains to please or bother succeeding occupants, a metaphor for neighborly rumor or belief that transcend time and people's lives.I highly recommend this book. It's short, but full of finely crafted sentences, and finely wrought ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is for the birds!","review":"I have read several other works of fiction by Ms. Hoffman and enjoyed them. However, I was disappointed in the \\"cobbled together\\" collection found under the title: BlACKBIRD HOUSE. Magical realism can be very enjoyable but it requires some actual \\"meat on the bones\\" to sustain it. Hoffman usually has a deft touch with this suspension of reality but these tales seemed to be little more than fragmented ideas for longer, more fully-realized stories that she just couldn't flesh out. The house as central theme drew me in (as I am always most attracted to old houses with rich histories that can captivate the imagination).This so-called novel barely skimmed the surface and left me feeling cheated...I wanted something more substantive.

I had no technical problems with the game whatsoever; it ran like a champ, even on an out-of-the-box year-old Dell. However, that didn't mean that I liked the game overmuch. In a nutshell, its biggest weakness is that you explore 4 ages so that you can get online. That was the glaring point and purpose. There is no other reason. No story, no plot, no tension-building, no great sense of mystery and discovery - all the things that made the first three tremendously appealing. However, I understand the technical trade-offs Cyan needed to make to achieve this - but that was absolutely no excuse to sacrifice storyline. I am sadly disappointed with Uru. Where is my story! Weak, weak work, Cyan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I've played all the other Myst games and loved them. This game however, gave me nothing but technical headaches. Reading the system requirements gave me heartburn and I have a degree in computer science! The game crashes on my Window XP Professional system, 512MB RAM, 1.6 GB processor *and* a (supposedly) supported NVidia card. The error message it left in the application log was entirely useless, demonstrating just how terrible the programming must be on this thing. Ubisoft's technical support is non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a big disappointment!!","review":"I would say I'm an somewhat average game player. I have followed MYST since it first came out. It is true that after a week of adjusting and updating my computer the game itself was disappointing. The puzzles were dull by the time you did figure them out, you couldn't believe that was it and there was no storyline. At least in the first three you could immerse yourself in the story and graphics. Why make the only character besides you computerized?

If the fact that you can see yourself or the lack of some really hard puzzles bugs you, then wait for Revelation! Wheather you've played any of the Myst games or not, I think you'll love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyan at it's best!","review":"Cyan's portion of this game - the CD game itself - is outstanding. The graphics and music are excellent, the avatar customization is wonderful, and the puzzles are Cyan's usual high test brain twisters. I paid Amazon's ~$50 charge at the time, and would do it again without hesitation.Ubi's on-line service is no longer a reality. I played the Prologue for two months, and loved both the on-line communication with the other players and the continued Cyan graphics and music. The ONLY hitch to the get-along was Ubi, and that company is not a mistake I'll ever make again. But I didn't purchase the game just to play on-line and I'm looking forward to the additional material due out in March."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Interaction Model","review":"All I want to know is where the people who designed how you move around in and interact with the game have been for the last few years. Out to lunch with their heads in the sand is all I can figure. As a trailblazer, the original Myst had an excuse. But that was then. After Real Myst demonstrated a smooth, intuitive, 3D GUI for Myst, there is simply no excuse for the impossibly awkward interaction model used by URU. I just can't believe it, and it makes me angry that anybody would even release this thing. Lately, I've been playing Dungeon Siege. It is such a pleasure to encounter a well-designed and well-tested interaction model. I guess I'll have to wait for Real URU to continue the Myst experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE !

(Yes, I went through the video calibration and I have the gamma correction at max.)But that's where the fun ends. I agree with others that puzzles are tedious and made very difficult by the interface. The previous Myst games required lots of thinking, putting clues together to solve the puzzles. This latest addition requires less thinking and more \\"Mario Brothers\\" type moves.I think I'm about half-way through the game and I'm tempted to stop there. I won't even consider the online version of the game (which is what I think UBISOFT and CYAN really designed this game for).If you liked the previous versions of Myst, don't bother with this one. If you don't mind half the game being \\"how do I time this jump just right\\", give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you give negative stars?","review":"This game doesn't deserve even zero stars. The 3-D controls are the worst I've ever seen. It's impossible to move around easily and like a previous reviewer said, you are now more worried about falling off ledges than solving puzzles. Also, the great mood music in earlier games in the series is now gone. It's been replaced by, well pretty much nothing. What were they thinking when they designed this clunker? I'm so p*ss*d I spent the money on this game and now it's gone for good. All they needed to do was continue the Myst-Riven-Exile format and people would have been happy as clams, but instead they went for the greed hoping people will someday pay to play this piece of crap online. Man what a bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling Ripped Off By Amazon and UBI? I am!!!!!","review":"Feeling ripped off? I am!

While I'm just as frustrated as the next Mac guy (and I've been a Mac guy for 20 years) that there is no Mac version, from what I've read so far, I'm not convinced that I'm missing much.While a relative handful here give the game rave reviews, it appears that the rather narrow system requirements, along with the plethora of bugs and patches that typically plague Windoze systems regardless, add up to a less than exemplary experience, despite the advance hype. I'm certainly not going to invest in a new PeeCee just to play a $70 game. realMyst spoiled me.Let the Windoze people find the bugs - I mean, they're certainly used to it.

I am disappointed that Ubi Soft shows that my hardware is supported in the list, but that the game still does not run.

It just crashes.On my HP tablet running XP - it will run, but only after installing the Uru updates and then soooo slow. Even when there is NOTHING happening on the screen, except for a static view, the mouse crawls across the screen so slowly that the game is literally unusable. It also has an annoying hysteresis so that it overshoots where you are aiming at. What are these guys playing at?

Upon getting the game, it wouldnt play on my system because of the video card, so i had to buy a new card to play it. But the game itself is really boring, you spend all your time searching every inch of the screen to find things. All the other myst series had it alot easier to see when you had something to look at or click on, but not this game. If you are not in the exact right spot, you will miss something that you need to continue the game. I never finished playing URU because you are not sure what you are looking for, also you almost need a PHd to solve a few of the puzzles. This game was a big waste of my money, and i hope that they go back to the drawing board on the next installment they make. Get back to some of the old myst, newer isnt always better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This game is not user friendly. It is not like the other Myst games. I can't even get a start on the game. It won't save when you want to quit. Whe you do quit and come back to the game, it starts from the beginning again. The mouse curser is all over the screen and hard to control. I guess you have have to play it all in one day. The URU website is complicated and offers no help at all.

I played the other Myst games with none of this type of trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed in URU","review":"After having enjoyed all of the Myst games I was very dissapointed in the URU game. You can't save the game so you have to start from the beginning everytime.

I finally bent the disk in half in frustration...not at all the quality of the prior Myst products in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE...Only works with two types of graphic cards","review":"I was only able to get past the opening scene and then the game kept crashing. Unfortunately I didn't realize that there are only two types of graphic cards work this game. The system requirements were for the following graphic cards: 32 MB NVIDIA GeForce 1, 2, 3, 4, or FX; ATI Radeon 7000-9800 OR BETTER. Since my laptop is brand new I assumed my graphics card (Intel chipset) was considered the \\"or better'!Oh well, I was really looking forward to playing Uru since I've played all the other Myst games. I don't understand why UBI did this. The other games were just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"MYST is back!","review":"After playing realMYST a few years back, I was impressed with the translation of Cyan's immersive world into true 3-D. Playing Uru, I'm very happy to say that Cyan has created an even more immersive game engine with photo-realistic renderings. Playing the game, you get caught up in the mysterious story-line which picks up right where Myst 3: Exile left off. While playing the other games in the Myst series will help with the deep backstory of the Myst world, it's not needed to understand what's going on in Uru. Also, with Uru Live, the game expands to what will be a limitless universe to explore. Live allows the player to explore with friends, cooperating to solve puzzles in what is a truly unique wonderful experience. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad idea executed poorly","review":"Uru is as underwhelming as it is expensive. The unlucky individual who buys this gamewill have to endure a game play style that forces constant alternation between keyboard and mouse control. This is caused by the unfortunate decision to have the game done in third person, forcing the player to tediously maneuver a poorly controllable character throughout the world with the keyboard, and then search nearby with the mouse for hot spots. The graphics are nominal at best, nothing like Riven or Exile, and the worlds are in no stretch of the imagination as enchanting or creative. It is impossible to get swept away in the ambiance of a long lost and magical world playing this game because it simply has the impression of just another third person 3D video game. There is no Myst/Riven feel here at all, no style, no magic, only the sound of hard earned money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires more hardware than earlier Myst games","review":"Be absolutely certain that you have the hardware requirements for this game. Just because you've run Myst, Riven and Myst III, it doesn't mean you'll be able to play Uru. In fact you have to have one of only 2 video cards in order to play.Obviously, I'm disappointed. I love the Myst series, but Ubisoft should make it more clear that this game requires hardware above and beyond the earlier games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uru should be pooyou","review":"I bought this game for my wife, and was so ashamed to have gotten such a cheap (NOT) game. I have a top of the line computer WITH the correct video card, and the game still sucks. The graphics are terrible, and moving around takes a brain surgeon, or so it would seem. I wish that I could get my hard earned money back, but the scheisters that put out this game aren't likely to do that since their obvious modivation was profit, and not the unwary customer.

Ubisoft would be best served to return to the format of the first three games and not exclude the Mac fan base as they have here. The game ran sufficiently well on my 1 year old Dell, but, hardware requirement issues aside, the game looks and feels more like Everquest than a Myst game.A big disappointment for what was an eagerly anticipated game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Money","review":"Giving it one star is extravagent. Loved Myst and Riven. Exile was not quite so good, but with URU they have reached an unbelievable low.

First, the story was nowhere near as compelling as in the previous games. Secondly, controlling your avatar was quite difficult - and be prepared for a lot of jumping more typical of an action game. The game seemed as if it was only a prelude to the real game to be played online. Unfortunately, Online Uru has now been cancelled. Instead we will get expansion packs; the first one free to those previously registered...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the others in the series.","review":"I bought this game for my husband for Christmas because we had so much fun with the previous games in the series. What a disappointment. The beautiful grahics and haunting music from the last ones are missing. You now go through as a character you created, worrying about jumping off ledges rather than encountering interesting puzzles to solve. Using a character to explore the worlds takes away the firsthand feeling of being in a stranger in a strange land. It is ackward and just not the same. I personally don't want to meet other gamers in cyberspace nor do I care that I can change the length of my character's nose or his shirt. I just want to be presented with fun and challenging puzzles in an exotic and mysterious place. I wish I could return it after only one night of playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy before checking compatibility!","review":"Never got to play the game, as it doesn't support 90% of the video cards out there. Their site \\"helpfully\\" recommends that you buy one of the TWO OR THREE cards supported, and by the way, you'll have to kick in an extra $50 for a new 400-Watt power supply.Tech support? You can't even send them an e-mail even after registering the product. Guess you have to fork over your credit card before they're willing to have a person type back at you.Hunt around long enough on their site and you'll find a list of everything not supported (and the pathetically short list of what is). IMHO these lists should be in bold print on the front cover of the retail package.My opinion: Blatant consumer fraud.A real shame, as I really liked Myst and Exile (riven was just ok). $50 plus tax down the tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed Myst Series Fan","review":"I've played all the Myst series games and never found any other games I liked as well, so I was eagerly anticipating URU. What a disappointment. As many people have stated, the controls are very difficult--to my mind they interfere with the exploration of the wonderful worlds, which is one of my favorite things about this series. I just don't get the sense of wonder that I got with previous games and sometimes the timed puzzles are such a pain that they really lessen the enjoyment of the game. Unlike the other games, I may not bother to finish this one. The game definitely did not live up to my expectations either in story line or graphics. Another gripe I have is that you probably won't be able to play the on-line portion particularly well unless you have broadband. Well, this game is not good enough to induce me to upgrade to broadband to play the on-line portion. A really mediocre effort from the people who produced the previous three great games."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS NOT A BOXED SET","review":"I read the first ten or twenty reviews on here and they all talk about the previous Myst games and how this is all in one boxed set, IT'S NOT THIS IS ONE FULL COMPLETELY NEW GAME IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT GO TO http://www.urulive.ubi.com/ and read all of the information about it.

Taking into account that I had thoroughly enjoyed all of the other Myst games, I expected that Uru would be no letdown. Wrong!!! As it turned out, Uru did not even work on my computer; the game merely allowed me to view the introduction before requiring some advanced graphics card and stopping dead in its tracks. This game was such a disappointment! I had been so fond of the Myst series until this little party pooper came around. I had basically exchanged 50 dollars for Uru's cover art and a fruitless 30-minute installation! Anyway, if you plan on buying this game, be aware that it requires a computer that was probably invented seconds before the game's completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars!","review":"There should be a zero star category. I could hardly wait to get this game home and enjoy more Myst style gaming; however, the game would not play correctly. I have a very recent system but all the fiddling I did adjusting the graphics AND the time online downloading things the program said I needed, didn't help. Luckily I bought my game at Costco and they take things back even if they're opened. Thnaks Costco!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up trying to play after 4 hours of frustration!!!!","review":"It should be clearly listed on the outside of the box that this game has several incompatibility issues with the most popular video cards, we have 2 nearly new HP computers, one with Pentium III and one with Pentium 4 and plenty of RAM in both, but the NVDIA cards are incompatible with this game! I got it for Christmas and was so excited to play. Now I am asking the gift giver for the receipt back so I can go buy another compatible type game for XP."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad game play","review":"This game has very poor controll and nominal graphics. I had posted a review along with several other people about the many problems with this game, but amazon keeps purging the reviews. At one time this game had over a dozen reviews with many complaints, but they all have been removed from the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumers be Warned","review":"I read the review \\"feel ripped off\\" I completly understand this person's anger , this happend to me with the Anniversary dvd edition of Myst/ (Riven) does not work and is a know problem with some video cards which Ubisoft knows about, while on the site i checked to see if my card would be compatiable with URU hence as the reviewer wrote it would not support it , i have Intel intergrated chipset also. I think all stores or online sites should post this info as soon as it becomes available, too many burned consumers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disappointment","review":"This was everything I dislike in a computer game. It has almost no resemblence to the real Myst games. If they keep going the next Myst product they produce will be a full shoot-em up game. This isn't too far from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't tell you if it's cool or not","review":"Recently purchased Exile (Myst III) and Uru here at Amazon, after checking computer requirements. Exile is dull, despite the cheap price, don't bother. Uru, on the other hand, is massive, and although it will load, cannot get it to run on new Dell XP machine. No on-line support from UBI that I can find - their beautiful web site is geared for those who've already gotten 'in' and are ready to move forward to cyberspace. I'm very disappointed but willing to sell to the highest bidder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!!","review":"I am so disappointed. I asked for and received this game as a gift but I do not have the system requirements to make it work. I would have to spend about $400.00 to upgade my windows 98, my video card and my sound card. It is not worth it to me. I cannot even get it started to see if I would like it. This game will not play under windows 98 as Amazon says it will. I guess you need atleast windows 98se or 2000. Be very carefull before ordering and make sure you have ALL of the system requirements."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no","review":"This is not the bare minimum of what Myst should be like. Never mind the crashing, this is just no fun whatsoever. It's cold and unnecessarily mysterious. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgot who made them so successful","review":"I can't believe that this is a PC-only game, with no Mac version! The whole Myst phenomenon was launched be Mac users! The original Myst was Mac-only when it first came out and it sold an incredible number of copies. Now the Miller brothers have turned their backs on the people who made them successful in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dissed and pissed apple owner","review":"Talk about left out in the cold. After making Myst on a mess of Macs they kick us out to shiver and press our noses up against the Windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Macintosh?!!","review":"What's this crap! Myst IS a Macintosh series- always has been. Now some company buys the franchise and only puts out a PeeCee version? Forget it. Myst has lost it's myth.PS: sorry I had to give a star at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame about UBI Soft","review":"Myst was and is created on Macs, and original Myst was first a Mac only title, because the Miller brothers are Mac Freaks and produced a long time for Macs only. I am shure URU will come for Mac too, but that it still isn't available for Mac, and worse that it is not first for Mac only is a break of tradition that tells us UBI Soft does not deserve to have this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"URU: Ages Beyond Myst","review":"I am an avid player of the myst and riven, and all adventure games. I must say that URU is a game that has unbelieveable sights and sounds. The graphics and details in the scenes are phanominal. You have so much to see in not just the details of the game but also for instance, there's the building that rotates and as you wait to align the walk ways the background scene is just beautiful with the mountain and falls and valleys that you see as your revolving around with the building. The puzzles are great to try and you can also interact with things like shooting at stuff from a distance. But with all these game be aware that you should save your game as often as you can when going through puzzles and places that you don't want to repeat. I love this game and have played it 4 times and each time is just as rewarding as the first. So give it a try. I think its one of the best of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uru is a fantastic adventure!","review":"Don't listen to the negative reviews, Uru is quite possibly one of the best adventure games ever made. Its graphics are gorgeous, its lush enviroments are the most breathtaking I have ever seen in any game. The puzzles are challenging, but not overly difficult, they actually quite brilliant. I loved the ability to create your own avatars.The only downsides are that the controls could use a little tweaking, and the ability to pick up objects would be nice (it's irritating to have try to move a stone with your feet into one spot). I am also extremely disappointed that the massively multiplayer version, uru live, was canceled.Still, if your a fan of the adventure genre you MUST have this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"URU AGES BEYOND MYST","review":"I JUST FOUND THE CONTROLS IN THIS GAME TO DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.THE GAME PLAYERS, WOULD NOT MOVE WHERE YOU DIRECT THEM, AND THEARROW KEY MOVEMENT, MOVED THE PLAYERS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONGAME WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT, IF MOVEMENT OF PLAYERS WOULD HAVEBEEN AS IN RIVEN, MYST III EXILE, OR EVEN MYST, TRYING TO CONTROLTHE GAME PLAYERS, TOOK THE FUN AND ADVENTURE OUT OF THE GAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a total diappointment","review":"Well we've had Sims Park and Sims House Party And Sim City and now the we've been delivered Sims D'ni.This isn't a continuation of the wonderful worlds created and expanded in earlier versions.And interactiong with others online is a cheap excuse to expand the game into a more profitable format. Wasn't a lot of the appeal of the original games that you never saw other people? Remember seeing someone in the distance run off and thinking, \\"Wow! There's someone else here!\\" But you could rarely actually interract with others. You were an outsider.Now instead you get to look at yourself as a crappy SIM and others too.This game is a HUGE dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"URU is not as Advertised","review":"I purchase this game based on my past experiences with Myst andRiven. It has a complete Single Player off line. When I triedto gain access to the Multiplayer \\"URU Live, I entered my CD Keyand a window comes up saying that a 56k Modem is no good. Youhave to have high speed modems to get on line. No where does thegame state this on the box or literature. That means you have been had. I can't afford a highspeed internet and it is notavailable in my area until June 2004. I find that it will be$39.95 a month. Then you have to subscribe at Est, $9.95 a monthto play. Sorry, the game will be played in Single Mode and bedeleted from my CPU."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!!!","review":"I purchased this game with great expectations, all of the Myst type games have been very, very good. I tried to install this on my three machines (Intel 3.06 gig processor, Intel 2.6 gig processor, and AMD 2400 XP+) and could not get it to work on any of them. I understand the importance of copyguarding games, but when it won't let you play the game because it can't recognize the CD-drive it just installed from, there is a big problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"So tedious that I can't continue it","review":"I've not had any of the technical problems that others seem to be complaining about. Yes, the scenery is beautiful but the gameplay is TEDIOUS. No thrill or awe here. I was well over the breathtaking scenery by the time I solved the first puzzle. Frustrated and bored is the best way I can describe how I felt. My 2 other family members agree and don't want to continue with it either. The positive 5 star reviews that I've read here sound pretty fake. Someone please shoot me if I have to suffer through any more of this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful World -- Cranky Interface","review":"Now having completed the single-player version of this game, I can say it is probably the best I've ever played in this genre, and certainly the best of the Myst series. At the beginning I was very put off by the nearly-unmanageable cursor, but after removing all the other [user] background tasks on my 3 GHz machine, I found it possible, though still very annoying, to work with. The problem with cursor management is simply that there is an extraordinary amount of other \\"stuff\\" going on in the game, and cursor positions are not updated often enough. One would hope that the relative amount of time devoted to mouse position polling and other functions can be slightly modified to give the kind of smooth mouse action usually found. In contrast to the mouse, the motion keys [arrow keys] are a bit over-sensitive, and one will find that a mix of walk/run and 1st person/3rd person views to be most useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"the gaming equivalent of Rocky 5","review":"This is the gaming equivalent of Rocky 5...it shouldn't have happened. Just pretend it's a bunch of outakes, and ignore it from the series.I must say, I blame ubisoft. I was selected as a beta tester for this game, and while i understand that there are many issues to attended to, all the bugs that I reported are still present in this game, and to me, that's far beyond unacceptable.To all the people having trouble getting the game to launch: know that you are not alone, and it's likely not you.I can't believe that Rand and Ryan Miller endorse the work that Ubisoft has done. I have been a big fan of Myst and the D'ni history for a long time, and this game does no justice to it at all. It is more than pretty pictures...I get that point, and it seemed at one time that the Miller brothers were bent on expressing that point. I'm hoping that Cyan will take it back and try to recover from the damage that's been done."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not an improvement!","review":"The little action figure that you create is irritaing to move. I never did get the hang of it and spent lots of time spinning around and bumping into things. The game itself seems to have a marketing strategy geared toward the online game. I found the problems difficult, actually impossible, to solve. Much frustration here. Lots of side tracks that have nothing to do with solveing the game puzzles which lead to hours of boredom and frustration. Much better to play previous games of Riven and Exile. Even the original Myst has a charm and satisfaction that this game lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uru","review":"If I could have given this game 'ZERO' stars I would have. A big, big disappointment. And I can't return it because it has been opened. Do not buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I have enjoyed all of the previous Myst titles but this game will not run on either of my new (less than a year old) computers - these are top brands, too. I know there are several other reviews like this and I just want to emphasize DO NOT buy this game unless you have the specific video card requirements listed. Only 2 brands will work and they have to be the specific model listed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top","review":"I cannot run this game on a fairly new and very expensive laptop computer (HP OmniBook 6100), because the video card apparently doesn't fulfill the system requirements. I'm not a gaming person, so what UBI wrote about the requirement doesn't make sense to me, and my card wasn't listed in their list of non-supported devices. It crashed anyway.It seems that UBI has overdone it this time; apparently the super-duper 3D environment requires a super-duper graphics environment that 'normal' people like me don't have. I was a very big fan of Myst etc., and am very, very, very disappointed that I'm excluded from it from now on. I just hope I can get back my $50...My advice: don't buy this game, unless you tried it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't have broadband, don't bother","review":"Ubi gives this little nugget of information buried deep within their website, perhaps hoping people will buy it before noticing: you have to have broadband to play the Uru live online portion. I cannot find anywhere on the Amazon listing that gives potential buyers this info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree with most other reviewers","review":"This company expects everyone to spend 40-50 bucks on this game and then also expects them to have the most recent hardware or upgrade their hardware.

Maybe I was skeptical from the beginning since I figured you can't get any bigger or worse than the devil. Although entertaining, it was all over the place. fairies? dragons? then they had this mother of all issue last maybe 1 1/2 episodes then it was gone!Also the chemistry seemed a little strained between Dean and Sam which I thought was hilariously pointed out in The French Mistake episode. All in all it was like Chinese food, I was hungry again in an hour for something more fulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My son and I were both really disappointed in the new seasons 1st episode. It lack so much including a decent plot line. We expected a more exciting story - since Sam and Grandpa are fresh from heaven and hell plus not a whole lot about the cousins. Why the gin creatures? There could have been other creatures that would have made a better story like demons, the trickster, ghosts...these are all creatures they have done multiple episodes on - but the gin - 1 episode and it wasn't focused on the creatures. This just seemed to be the type of episode you would see mid season - not one to start to season off with. It was just flat. What happened - new writers???? We hope the other episodes have some umpf to them...btw, it was neat seeing Corin Nemic, glad to know he has a paying gig and isnt doing those silly internet shows with David Faustino anymore :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID!!!!!!!!!!","review":"After all of the great season, this is the only thing they could come up with? I can't believe somebody would think this was a good ideal. A civil war in the kingdom of Heaven, the angels never seen God, and the demons never seen the devil. Whoever came up with these story lines need an good old Bible lesson. I don't mean this new wave junk, but the old fashion way. I myself like this show but i skipped this season half way through and know trying out season 7. I'm hoping they just stick to ghost and demon hunting like the first 5 seasons and not try to change the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure the episode is GREAT but AMAZON screwed it up!","review":"I'm extremely salty that I purchased the episode but could not stream it due to a poor internet connection. Instead, I downloaded Amazon Unbox Video and then downloaded my purchased item. WELL, guess what...It took hours to download and THEN I go to play it AND IT WAS ONLY AUDIO, NO VISUAL! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Amazon, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?I am extremely displeased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome season","review":"My son got me to watching Supernatural on tv. We are now collecting all the different seasons. Now we can watch them whenever we want without commercials. If you've ever watched this and enjoyed it, get them on DVD, you'll be glad you did. If you've never watched them, but enjoy stories of the supernatural, try it. One of the best things about the series is the relationship between brothers, Sam and Dean.

I cannot believe they have not been recognized for any of the show's talents. The characters good and bad just keep getting more interesting and hook you in at every episode. I always wonder how they will out do themselves each week and sure enough they manage to pull another unique and interesting episode. I enjoy the re-occurring characters dead and alive. The ending will blow you away and an amazing lead in to their 7th season! I have shared this amazing series with a bunch of my friends and now they have all become regular viewers past and present episodes. I am waiting for Mr. Krippe to get his due recognition for an awesome idea and making it pure entertainment! Jensen and Jared are fun to watch and it helps they have such great chemistry together.

Used to be the best show on TV. Now it's deteriorated into sappy fundamentalist Crap. Who's taken over the writing--Michelle Bachman & Pat Robertson (etal)? If this weren't insulting enough, they've turned this once wonderful two charactrer show into a three character show. Used to be about Sam & Dean and their fascinating exploits, with a different premise each week instead of a running soap opera/serial; now it's about Sam & Dean & the b o r i n g AngelDude (And THE BIBLE, fer cripesake!)! That \\"actor\\" ruins the show--I don't see how they could have found an actor with less screen presence than this Nebbish: Uninteresting, unattractive, asexual and annoying. It's not too late to salvage the turgid mess they've made and restore the show to what it used to be. Maybe. The trouble is, I'm so sad about this that I just don't care anymore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined the Entire Series","review":"I was and always will be a huge fan of Supernatural seasons one through five. The deep and meaningful tone about family grouped with hilarious humor and some scary story telling made for one of the best television shows I had ever seen, and probably ever will. But when this season debuted after the entire plot was summed up in the fifth installment, it felt as though the writers were reaching. I will admit that there were some enjoyable episodes in this season, as there will always be when watching Supernatural (no matter how bad the complete season is). To me, being the huge fan of this series that I was, it really disappointed me when Kripke left and everything went a little crazy. All in all, I would have preferred them to end the show on season five."},{"rating":"2","title":"supernatural","review":"It is much different from other shows of this nature and keeps me interested into the next season.

I was in the infantry and I like cruel humor but this season crosses the line. One of the episodes shows a guy in a dentist chair not being able to lie and tells the dentist in great describtion how he was alone with his 7 year old daughter to rape her. WTF.... little things like this go on for the whole season. It crossed the line from entertainment to terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same","review":"The story line is completely different from all the other episodes, I am not sure it will do as well as the others.

They'd decided to continue the story on, and this is why I think this season takes a few more episode than normal to bring you in.I will say most of my friends who were fans had some issue staying with the series through this build-up (even I started having a doubt or two) but when you see where the story is going and the truths behind what's going on come out, you'll be glad you stuck with it. The slow build had everything to do with a big story payoff and nothing to do with poor writing or plotting."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT CAN I SAY","review":"I AM A HUGH SUPERNATURAL FAN.

Seaon 6 continues the saga after Lucifer is defeated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season Six of Supernatural","review":"The series is enjoyable with its combined humor and story lines. They have gotten creative in season six, which has helped the season as the story lines have gotten a bit far fetched. Apparently the intent of Eric Kripke was to do only 5 seasons. When they decided to do season six, the plots have really stretched to continue the show. Otherwise, it is still a fun show to watch with good ensemble of actors that play their parts well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural The Complete Sixth Season","review":"Excellent quality, great seller and fast delivery.

From the moment Dean says he wants to Star Trek 4 this dude, the fun starts and doesn't stop until he \\"ganks\\" him. Jensen shows that he's got some great comedic timing, Sam gets that frame on a horse (don't you wish Dan Blocker's horse was still around?) and Bobby undergoes a soulonoscopy. More fun than the airplane episode which is still one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The discs themselves were great. They played perfectly. The price for the entire season was insanely reasonable, and it arrived much quicker than I expected it to; which I've come to expect with Amazon (I just love that!). In my humble opinion, Season Six had to be one of my least favorite seasons. Don't get me wrong, I adore Supernatural, and I'm a fan of pretty much every season, but Season Six had more moments of dislike from me than some of the others. The season is good, but Sam was such a jerk-face, and Dean was a whiny thing that needed to be slapped. I still loved Sam and Dean and Cas to little bits and pieces, though. Both of them needing to be slapped aside, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural: The Complete Sixth Season","review":"My favorite show!!! Now I can watch the episodes over and over and over and over and over and over...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best season - but still enjoyable","review":"Ahh - could it be that Supernatural is finally going down hill and has truly jumped the shark? Granted, this season is by far the least in quality compared to the other seasons, but it is still enjoyable. It starts out well, gets slow in the middle (and a bit off track), but picks up again with a nice season finale. The season gives you a bit of a different perspective on Dean and Sam - in a way they almost switch roles, with Sam being more of the tough guy and Dean more of an emotional character. If you like the character Bobby, his presence in this season seems a bit more robust than in others. Overall, worth watching, but it will make you long a bit for previous seasons intensity and creativity. All in all, still a great watch and hopefully season 7 will bring us more quality with the Winchester boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERNATURAL--EXCELLENT","review":"First time I saw the show, I was hooked.It has everything I love in this type of series.My favorite show.Hope it never ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Supernatural","review":"Im so glad I bought this season.

Instead the book goes on and on about how bad, delusional, self-centered and lying Larry Ellison is. It also belabores how decadent and immoral are Oracle's marketing and sales people.The book does not really paint a picture of how Oracle became successful. The time line is blurred, instead, we get repetetive stories ripped out of different periods in Oracle's history.The explanations of database industry and technology sector overall are weak.Perhaps if the book was shorter, I would not be as negative, but as it stands at 350 pages, I can not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected....","review":"I have always been fascinated by Steve Jobs, and little did I know that he and Ellison were best friends.

Ellisons aggresiveness, attitudes, etc. I would highly recommend anyone who is interested in Ellison not only read this book but read the July issue of Icon Magazine. It contains some good quotes from Ellison and others that know him. Mike Wilson he does a great job of making the book as interesting as possible. I am a computer geek, and admit that understanding computer life can be a bit dry if you are not a propeller head. I do agree with what someone said about Larry in an interview with Icon. He will definetly grow old lonely with that life style of his. Ellison will never accept anyone until he accepts himself.

In describing Larry Ellison, the word \\"unembarassable\\" is used and is apparently precise. Therefore, bravo to Mr. Ellison for the courage to bear all his achievements and life lessons to the world.

It is not remotely smiliar, unless the manhwa artist is actively employing a style closer to Japanese manga.As I've improved in my own art over the years, I've realized how truly terrible Chris Hart's books are. Don't buy them. They will only teach you how to copy various pictures done by multiple artist in varying styles. Find a quality art book and then develop your own style. Draw from life.

It follows the sardonic and brutal Johnny (David Thewlis) on a long weekend journey into the harsh London underground, as he berates, belittles, insults and insences everyone he meets to the point of finally being beaten up. It's poignant, thought-provoking, and brutally hilarious!It also stars Gina McKee, my favorite actress (Bella in \\"Notting Hill\\", the girl in the wheel chair; and Nadia in \\"Wonderland\\") as a cafe girl who meets Johnny, takes him in, and promptly throws him out.This is a GREAT FILM."},{"rating":"2","title":"A depressing, but otherwise brilliant film.","review":"Naked is not a pleasant experience. There is much to enjoy about it, but the mood and plot are incredibly downbeat. That being said, there is a lot to appreciate here. David Thewlis is absolutely marvelous in the lead role. He is funny and charming, but at the same time violent and alienating. A terrific anti-hero. The score is wonderful, and the other cast members are very good.The film looks and sounds quite good, which is expected from Criterion. The extras could have been a bit better, but what we get is good.Overall, however, I cannot wholly recommend Naked. Not as a blind buy. If you are already a fan, the presentation is very good. If you've never seen it, I strongly recommend renting it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top 3 favorite movies","review":"This movie can tear a person to shreds.

Written from a feminist perspective, it combines information within the framework of the feminist movement. In today's context, the material it covers generates anger at how little was understood about this issue in that era. The book incorporates interviews from victims, fathers, and mothers which ring true, but the author's interpretation of those words may bring anger and disbelief. We know now that incest is not solely attributable to living in a patriarchal society and that offenders are not easily rehabilitated. If you want to understand how much progress we have made, this book provides that perspective. Be warned that it looks at ALL the issues through a highly feminist viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This product came prompt and on time like you said it would.

Zeke agrees to let Chad, her son, work of the debt and soon enough they fall in love.This book just didn't do it for me. Zeke was boring and so was Nathalie. There was no depth to their characters, I just felt like they went through the motions and Zeke was a bit too perfect to me. Pretty easy read, but if you are used to Catherine's Coulter novels, don't expect too much.

I know Catherine usually does the mystery thing very well, but the feel of the entire book was off. So, I guess I am one of very few people who did not like this book.

A few stand-out episodes pepper the season early on and Erica Durance's Lois Lane charms us through and through. However, fans who loyally waited for Clark to get the suit and finally fly under the colors of his heroic destiny will be sorely disappointed. The obvious \\"blue-screen\\" effects and the fact that Clark was in costume for what was probably less than 8 minutes at the end of the final episode suggest that the creators of the series begrudgingly gave fans what they were clamoring for -- and only at the last moment.

Needless to say I was disappointed. Lois is some undercover superhero that goes from a chauffer to a stripper and amazingly (not!) she knew her way around a club she had NEVER been to, stole a costume, managed to find a wig and ta da she was seducing the bad guy. They made the Lois character with too big of a head, Clark is too much a wimp to amount to much. Smallville has gone way down with the addition of Lois and her character.I am curious if this will survive after season 10...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they miss something in the Edit Room?","review":"This episode sure seemed pretty hacked to me. Clark saves Tess from battling Granny Goodness's soldiers, and suddenly he's back at the farm looking for Lois. What happened with the Orphanage? Did they just leave all the kids there? What about the little girl he left in the electrical room? If we're to assume they did call authorities and shut it down, how did Granny escape? Tess is trying to dial for help on an old rotary phone in the Orphanage. They have all this cutting-edge technology in the Watch Tower, but she doesn't have a cell phone? Why would granny leave the ballerina music box in Tess's room when she could have, oh, I don't know, grabbed Tess instead? Huge holes abound.I'm a fan of the series, but man, this episode was a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming a man","review":"For the last ten years we watched Clark Kent, becoming boy to a world's legend. In the show, we made a promise that their would be no flight and no tights. For the last season, Clark Kent is ready to wear the tights and fly. He's been through a lot of obstacles that will help him become the greatest superhero for a long time and that will make him a legend. We watched Clark Kent develop the seven major powers for ten years, the strenghth, the speed, the x-ray, the heat, super-hearing, leaping, Super-breath and flight. Seeing the finale where Clark Kent wearing the superman suit and flying made it look like he was ready to fulfil his destiny. We knew he was ready, but Clark Kent himself knew when he was ready to take on the mantle. He was ready for it to fulfil destiny and wear the superman suit. Trust me this is how a boy becomes superman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Tom Wellington, Alison Mack and Justin Hartly","review":"I know the series is about Superman, and in the original Chloe Sullivan was a non-starter, but had the writers known a talent like Alison Mack, I've no doubt he would have written her in as this imaginative crew has done. When she is there, the stories have a polish. shine and hopefulness that is missing when she's gone. It will be fun to see how all three of these actors continue with their careers. Justin Hartly is just superb and possibly the next Clint Eastwood - he'll shine. Tom Wellington has grown as an actor and behind the scenes as a leader. I hope he continues to do hero roles as it would be hard to see him betray what he's built so far. Very much a Giant character like Rock Hudson! Alison could go all the way and eventually be made a Dame for great works. She's an awesome talent and just sparkles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ending to an excellent show","review":"No matter what, Smallville had integrity. There was a specific vision in place from the beginning. Not a grand mapped out vision exactly, but an idea of a show that charted the journey of Clark Kent from naive farmboy to Superman. Slowly over the course of 10 seasons they evolved the characters and true to their word gave us Superman in the end. Through production and cast changes Smallville always told fun stories that looked great (especially for a WB/CW TV show) and were exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kent?","review":"Today I watched the Episode \\"Kent\\". I have never said anything bad about a single smallville episode, but this episode was just incredibly stupid. I don't understand why they needed to do another alternate universe episode. they did one and that was fine. All I got from this, was that Clark decides to sell the farm."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would make baby Jesus Cry","review":"You would think that after almost 10 full seasons (180+ episodes) that Clark Kent would atleast learned how to fly. Well, ladies and gentlemen he still hasn't learned how to fly. It also seems that Smallville will never come full circle on anything because they keep having episodes about Zod, Lex, Lionel, etc. Plus some of these episodes don't make any sense and would make a person lose brain cells by watching them. This used to be one of my favorite shows, but now everytime I see the name 'Smallville' I cringe."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliche galore","review":"What a disappointment! Writers block supreme! they resurrected every villain, acquaintance, and relative of Clarks. They made him face and defeat every one he ever fought and then killed them off again. So many flashbacks the viewer often lost sight of what was actually going on. More alternate dimensions, got sent back to the phantom zone, the Luthers, on again off again weddings, and any other trite cliche you can think of. Barely watchable and certainly not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLECH! Season 1 was good. By season 10 the show was bad. The finale had him in cgi - lol bad!","review":"The show worked at its core when Jonathan Kent was still on and you had father and son moments. The dynamic of him with his parents made the show like you'd expect an early start of Clark's life to be. Somehow by season 10, they got wayyyyyy off track! The whole blue blur crap, and Clark looking like the only idiot alien who is afraid to fly... It just got bad.The finale was pretty pathetic in that you don't see him in the full suit. They just cgi (and bad cgi) him into a crappy costume that you get a glimpse as he helps a plane ala Reeve/Routh from the movies.EWWW stay away from this one folks and wait for the \\"Man of Steel\\" movie starring Henry Cavill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pititful","review":"So for the last 10 seasons Clark Kent was a self-doubting and scared individual when it came to what role he was supposed to be and about his powers. Now all of a sudden Clark Kent does a 180 and is the superman. Even the last episode before the finale confirms this.The producers left too many questions unanswered. I really hate it when TV shows follow this path; 10 Years of slow character progress then they hurry up and rush the ending. If I was able to rate this with zero stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon player needs an over haul...","review":"I don't know how other movies play on this player, but this tv show's aspect ratio SUCKED(heads on actors were distorted looking....unexceptable....), and the picture clarity was terrible.

Bad experience with sellar!!","review":"A perfect ending to a great show!! Even though the show was coming off a weak season 9, season 10 really stepped it up. The return of Jonathan Kent and the Luthors it really was a season true fans can appreciate!! The only bad thing was the company Amazon got the set from. Warehouse Detail buyers beware!! The case was broken and the box was actually cut on the back. The packaging was way to tight causing even more damage to the box.

Obivously not designed for non-engineers. There are no simple project examples, arcane instrucitons, and some translation issues that are strange. Worse problem of all is that printing is nearly impossible without someone to teach you specifically how to set it up with a particular printer and driver. I was completely unable to get it to print on 8x11 paper, and the system will not subdivide a project like a spreadsheet would in printing. No print to size command either!!!

It received very good reviews on consumer reports and I think I made the perfect choice. A bagless that cleans as well as this for under $100 is a great choice. The attachment for the stairs (which is identical to the windtunnel one I had) works great. Shares a lot of things in common with the pricier Windtunnel models. Would highly recommend. And yes, it cleans as good or better than a Dyson. Its also one of the lighter models in its class, making climbing stairs with it much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Doesn't Live Up to It's Name","review":"Bought the green older version about 1 1/2 years ago. Has been repaired once for $50 and has just died again,after months of just ok suction. It is loud-(hush mode is no better), heavy, blows dirt on your ankles, difficult to use on stairs, and the hose comes unattached occasionally. So dissappointing for a Hoover. My parents still have theirs from about 30 years ago (while no repairs, probably doesn't pick up as well as they think). Hoover's quality has definitely gone downhill. The cannister/filter is disgusting to clean, spreading dirt/dust all over. Give me a bagged model anytime. Actually, after much research, I just ordered an upgraded Bissell bagless model from Amazon that almost 100 reviewers gave 4 1/2 stars. I never put too much thought into my vacuum until this model-there were just so many issues, it made me want/expect better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Frustrated","review":"I bought this new Hoover after havin gmy previous Hoover for over ten yeats. After less than a year, it will not pick up pet hair or leaves. I would not buy this vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacuum for the price","review":"I wanted a reasonably priced vacuum that was good on hardwood floors and at picking up pet hair. This model has performed well on both counts--which is not surprising since Consumer Reports said it would. I would buy it again. There are some complaints about the hepa filter. I take it outside to empty the main chamber and bang each end of the filter against a tree or the edge of the porch a few times. The tree doesn't seem to mind the dust and I don't bring any back in the house so everybody is happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck - Try something different","review":"Maybe mine was a lemon, but this vacuum is terrible. It does not pick up dirt on our concrete floor. The dirt flies back and hits you in the ankles. The hush function did not have much difference in volumes when it arrived. Now it is the exact same, so this function does not work on my vacuum. I spend more time cleaning the filter than vacuuming. The stretch hose, must be a joke, since it does not stretch. You will definitely want an extension. Plus it is a two handed ordeal to put it back into place, unless there is a trick that I do not know.Even though I hate this vacuum, it seems to pick up dirt fine on carpet. It will reside upstairs for carpet only in our household.This model was so terrible, I just bought another vacuum, which works beautifully on our concrete floors.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised","review":"Read the reviews on the Amazon sight and at Consumer Reports and chose it for that reason. Received the vacuum and after one use the brush no longer spun and there was no suction from the bottom. I contacted Hoover who was willing to ship me a belt but wouldn't hear of refunding some of my money for their remarkably unreliable product. So now I'm still without a vacuum while the 'new' one I bought is being repaired. Hoover considered the warranty repair as a 'gift' to me and they were doing me such a service by repairing their product for free after one use. I would steer away from Hoover products."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"I purchased this vacuum based upon how it was rated by Consumer Reports. What a disappointment! It is supposed to work well on hard surfaces. It simply shoots out the back what it picks up in the front. A total bummer since my house is all tile! I would not recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product for me","review":"I didn't purchase this on amazon but my employer bought it a year ago for us to use in the office. We have a really small office probably smaller than my 3 bedroom house and the carpet is pretty short. It worked great for about a month and then just started not picking up very well. I think the power boost button does nothing but make the machine louder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum for the price!","review":"We have carpet everywhere except the kitchen/bathroom and we have a dog that sheds a LOT and it gets it up with no problem. Easy to use and easy to clean/empty. I'm glad I tried this before buying one of the $300-500 dollar vacs. This is all I will need and for the price I would buy another one if this one doesn't last a while. Haven't used attachments or on floors yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT BUY THIS Vacuum","review":"This vacuum spits out the particles instead of sucking them up.

It works quite well at cleaning carpet. It doesn't work at all on wood floors. The hush mode is just as loud as the regular mode. It's bulky, heavy, and doesn't turn well. And cleaning out the bagless canister is messy, dusty, and just a royal pain. No matter how careful I am, I always end up with dust flying about. I've had this for a year and as soon as I can afford it, I am going to buy a good old-fashioned \\"bag\\" vacuum cleaner. There is no savings by going bagless...you still need to replace the filter every so often and that can be a good $15 dollars.

It does not contain pharmakonetics, extra-label uses, contraindications, dosages, concentrations ect. It is a stretch of the imagination that this would even be considered for use as a textbook.My advice for you: if you are a student in a veterinary program, get the newest edition of Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook.

The book was very helpful to me in terms of how to take minutes, organizing my minutes on paper, and avoiding redundancy (especially using the \\"How to Say It\\" section). I received many compliments on my ability to take \\"good\\" minutes. It's been over ten years since I've had that job. I now have another job where I am required to take minutes.

Some technical details of the technology are also presented.Of particular interests are the vivid accounts of Apollo spacecraft, Space Shuttle, Intercontinental ballistic missiles, Submarine-launched ballistic missiles, Tactical guided Patriot missiles, Missile defense and Arms control.Missiles have evolved in the past decades and major changes have been made in their design. In contrast, improvements of the propulsion systems have been incremental only. However, the robot probe (Deep Space 1) was launched by an innovative propulsion system (a small ion engine) to study comet Borredly in 1998.

The dialogue is poetry -- it contains some of the best lines I've ever heard in a movie. (And yes, I am talking about a Charles Bronson movie!) However, I urge you to avoid the video and wait to catch it on commercial TV. Ordinarily, I'd never ever say that, but this video is unique. It isn't letterboxed, but it isn't pan-and-scan, either. It's as if the camera just sits in the center of a wide scene and the actors come and go in and out of sight. Terribly frustrating. I even ended up giving my copy away. I'd go so far as to call this a truly great movie, but you're missing out if you let the video be your first exposure to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Pan N Scam Product","review":"Wish a reivew had alerted me, but I should have checked the aspect ratio before purchase anyway.

The brutally abrupt pan and scan cuts literally made my head spin at points. The film is great, and worth watching, but I hope they put out a widescreen version one day.

Charles Bronson's character is good with wrists, and thanks them he earn some dollars. He is honest, and considerate with his friends, especially a woman and a cat.

I point out also the rejoicing chorus, similar to Burt Lancaster in \\"Elmer Gantri.\\"I forgot to pay attention to the format, and I was disappointed when I realized the widescreen images vanished after the open credits.

Bronson is perfect as the mysterious drifter who lets his fists do his talking, Coburn as the fast-talking wheeler-dealer whose out-of-control gambling sets in motion the climactic brawl, but it is the stoned Strother Martin who steals the movie as Poe, the medic and descendant of Edgar Allen Poe (...\\"hear the tinkle of the bells...\\"). It's time for a special edition DVD release for this underrated classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"This movie should be considered a classic of action movies. Made in the 70's it is very effective in depecting the 30's depression. The story is about a street fighter who hooks up with a con man (James Coburn) who is not as sharp as he thinks he is. While not a true boxing movie it has some of the best fight scenes ever filmed. This is due to Bronson. He looks like he could do all the things he does in the movie. The amazing thing is he was in his mid 50's when the movie was made. The story has a good pace and there is no sappy ending. Good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Times - full screen UGH !!!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD !

Centered in or around New Orleans in the depression era, the film is about men who earn their living as bare-fisted street fighters, and one of the best is an unknown fighter played by Charles Bronson. James Colburn is great as his sleezy manager in trouble with the mob. This is a highly entertaining movie with some good performances (even Bronson's) along with a realistic view of the era. Between 1 and 10, \\"Hard Times\\" gets a well-deserved 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hill's Best Film","review":"Hard Times is hands down Walter Hill's best film. Some of you may disagree, favoring Southern Comfort, Long Riders, or The Warriors or maybe even 48 Hours, but in the end all those films have certain elements that hold them back. Hard Times, on the other hand is, as another writer has put it, a great \\"Mid-Seventies movie.\\" Bronson and the rest of the cast are perfect. The story is pared down and action packed. The characters are inetersting and the story has a nice ring to it. The actors are probably what makes the film. You just don't have the caliber of Bronson, Coburn and Martin these days. These days Hill just makes the same thing over and over, seemingly trying to recapture his past glory, but none of his films is as successful as Hard Times. And maybe best of all, no bus chases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bronson in top form","review":"A classic mid-seventies movie. They don't make them like this anymore. Makes Rocky, which came out a year after, look like Cindarella. Bronson, who must have been in his early fifties when the flick was made is absolutely convincing as the toughest mother you will ever meet. Cudos to Coburn also who turns in a slick performance as the small-time fight promter. Great flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Movie","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time.

Based on this, You can tell the amount of expectation on every single line he writes, and \\"Dynasties\\" unfortunately does not help at all. The book is too long, too superficial, and some times it was really hard to keep on reading.

I kept thinking the book would get more interesting but nothing kept my attention. Part two on automobiles was probably the most interesting part but I still nearly put the book away to read others.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking back to learn","review":"Certainly not a book for an ambitious manager in a hurry, but for guys who can lean back for a few hours and have time to contemplate: it's a very good read.Landes' focus is very big business. But standing back - the patterns he describes are applicable to all kinds of families and - presumably - concern most of us.Landes describes these family patterns extremely well, looks closely at religious aspects too. It's this comprehensive view which renders his book so interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"I purchased this watch because I have never had any trouble with Timex watches, and I am glad to say I still have no problems.

I have worn it everyday since buying it a year ago. Several issues with it though: I managed to scratch the glass on the front, which is unfortunate. I also didn't realize that the band wasn't water proof, and would go swimming and shower with it on. Needless to say, the leather began to rot a few months in. I replaced it for a few bucks.

However, the song \\"Dreamware\\" is the only palatable song on the whole disk. It seems as though it would be better suited for the album \\"Oceanliner\\".

It's bad science which appears to be guided by people with an anti-religion agenda. Every time there are multiple possible explanations for their findings, the most religion negative track is chosen.

There are some logical jumps, which is kind of the author's faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointing","review":"I bought this book anticipating an intelligent discourse on the convergence of religion and neuroscience. However, what I found was a hugely self-indulgent personal drama documenting one man's journey to spirituality. An interesting story, yes. But it is delivered based on false advertising. As a neuroscience student, I was hoping for empirical data and perhaps something more than a superficial glance over the scientific mysteries of religious practice. If you are interested in a scientist's personal journey to a reconciliation of science and religion, by all means, check this book out. For anyone interested in this subject as it applies to more than only one man's plight, forget it. What it comes down to is misleading advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interpretation more than scientific","review":"This book will appeal to those who already believe that religion is a product of the human mind. This is neither a scholarly work nor a scientific treatise but rather Alper's interpretation of data from various unconnected studies and experiments that support his world view.

Mr. Alper states that he spent years delving into science's proven answers to the origins and intricacies of existence as we know it. I am not a scientist, but I believe that if one finds one plausible explanation for anything -- and stops searching -- it is akin to believing in a flat earth, thunder gods, or magic beans. For his sake, I hope Mr. Alper has resumed his search since the publication of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-scientific half-baked nonsense","review":"I've bought books which I've been disappointed by, but this is the only book I've ever been so disappointed by that I've returned it. If you're looking for something both scientifically and religiously informed, there are a number of great books out there, but this one is neither. The author openly admits his drug use which I don't think automatically discredits him, but it's hard to believe he wasn't heavily under the influence when he wrote this."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS WANDERING","review":"Wasted time and money purchasing this book.

It began with the author's use of his own experience with mind-altering chemicals to argue that human consciousness is a merely biochemical phenomenon (sample sizes of 1, or n=1, are usually not a sufficient basis to make such a sweeping conclusion!). The chapter on the origins of life presents explanations that still reside in the realm of theory and conjecture, and are critically short on citations of peer-reviewed literature. And the point when I finally put the book down is when the author, in the chapter explaining the existence of atheism, begins by arguing that all human traits are normally distributed (ie, the \\"bell curve\\" or Gaussian distribution)! I submit that the author has some learning left to do with regards to what he expresses as his own \\"religion\\"- the religion of science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Duplicate Reviews.

Ironically, this book accidently achieves to reinforce the concept of intelligent design better than some of the ID books out there!!!

In the end however, he manages to explain the \\"how\\" (science) but fails at any attempt at the \\"why\\" (why the hows even exist in the first place - we all know \\"how\\" the Universe developed but \\"why\\")? What the hell are we doing here???This read adds fuel to the proverbial fire that science is mearly a curve ball thrown at us by God to challenge our faith.

However, the plot is beyond convoluted. I was especially disappointed by the ending. Its head on collision with my memories of H.P Lovecraft drove me to re-watch the awful interpretation of \\"The Dunwich Horror,\\" produced by Roger Corman in 1970. The ending of \\"Low Red Moon\\" was so similar (albeit, minus the Hounds) that I almost threw the book across the room. It's one thing to build on another author's work but an altogether different thing to use the same plot, ideas, and very world of another author.

I, and I doubt I was the only one, was misled by the DVD's packaging as it failed to specify that it was Boston's version. Apparently, unlike Chicago's version, the Boston shows on the DVD were produced by Larry Harmon, who bought the licensing rights from Bozo creator Alan W.

In short, he does a great job of presenting these magnificent and sometimes terrifying creatures.Strongly recommended, for those with a soft spot for all things natural, along with the National Geographic's Search for the Ultimate Survivor, Chased by Sea Monsters, and the Walking with Dinosaurs, Walking with Beasts and Walking with Cavemen series. 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Beautiful images of reptiles. Even better than Planet Earth, since this documentary focuses on a particular group of animals and explains their odd living and feeding habits. The chameleons are absolutely mesmerizing.

Fortunately, snakes get a single episode, and there is some amazing footage of a python eating a deer whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Artist's Last?","review":"A David Attenborough film as I have grown accustomed to see them. Short sequences so beautiful that they take my breath away and nearly take my attention away from the subject. Nearly, yet they never do, just as Attenborough himself, appearing as a charming guide, never attracts attention away from but always to the filmed frog or chameleon, filmed not as an object but as an individual with whom Attenborough empathizes.As usual with Attenborough films, this one abounds in most colorful animals, rarest animals, most fascinating behavior, recent scientific observations... As usual, Attenborough's assistants, scientists and filmmakers of great talent, are never an eye sore but discretely shown in separate parts where they seem appropriate and even necessary.A masterpiece, comparable only to other films by the same Great Artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, David","review":"There is not a one minute span of video where David does not crawl, slither, scamper, or sneak his way into the shot amongst nature's exotic cold-blooded creatures.

I no longer buy videos from them and I will make sure I won't be buying microcassette tapes on here. They really need to screen sellers more closely to make sure the products they are shipping will be good quality.

This fits the bill. And I have dropped the phone without any problems, so it's sufficiently protective. My one issue is that it doesn't fit that well - the bottom left corner slides down, so it's always a little lopsided. And the case yellows with time, so it's not as clear after continued use. It does a lot of what I want, but it's not perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price, not worth it","review":"I got this exact same case on EBay, for about 90% less.

Hobby gamers won't have any trouble with it, although kids who are only used to traditional games like Candyland or Go Fish may need a little adult help to learn it. It includes basic and advanced rules, so you can try the simple version (which leaves out some of the cards) first. Note that gameplay is nearly identical toClash of the Lightsabers Star Wars Card Game. The main difference (aside from the theme and artwork) is that this game doesn't include pewter miniatures for keeping score -- you just flip scoring cards to track that. Also, this game uses illustrations while the Star Wars game had movie stills on the cards. On the plus side, this game will fit in your pocket.I was able to play this with my preschooler (who plays a lot of games and is into anything Transformers) by taking out all the cards with text on them and just playing with the number cards. I'll add in the others once he can read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transformer Card Game","review":"I purchased this card game about 2 years ago for my 6 year old grandson.... In fairness, I never got around to contacting the seller, so problem may have been resolved if I had.

Maybe it was just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for older childen.","review":"I bought this set of cards for my oldest child (almost 7), thinking it would give him an opportunity to learn more about Transformers, counting, game rules, numbers, etc. But the rules of the game were so complex, even my husband gave up and just played the simplest version with him.

Maybe when he's older and can understand what the game is asking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"If you want to cook and bake like your mother, grandmother, and great grandmother did than you will want this book.

Not worth the money I spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it- why not?","review":"Okay, if you're looking at this book you probably know Jonathan Goldstein from This American Life.The important thing to know about this book is it's not a straightforward narrative. It's a novel in fractallized pieces.That said, the pieces themselves are often funny, and sometimes very sad.The book isn't for everybody, but it's not for nobody.Just read it. You can get through it in an hour or so, so even if it's not your favorite it's not like plowing through Ulysses."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interesting Disappointment","review":"Interesting, experimental novel by one of my favorite \\"This American Life\\" essayists. Folks familiar with that show will recognize the storytelling style: three- or four-sentence paragraph/chapters, each presenting a new idea, are bounced off each other in very rapid succession. The effect is sometimes ironic, sometimes not. Unfortunately, this device may be better suited to radio than it is to the page, and while there are some powerful moments the book comes off as more of a gimmicky exercise than anything else. The relentless cleverness (although the writing isn't terribly funny) make the book seem pretty far removed from actual human experience. It's also bogged down by an undergraduate sensibility about sex, and by a lot of odd metaphors that don't go anywhere. I can imagine this style being successfully applied to the novel form, but I don't think Goldstein's done it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I'm a huge fan of everything I've heard of Goldstein's on This American Life and WireTap and the concepts of his other books, which I have not yet read, and had high hopes for LBID. However, I simply didn't get it.I didn't laugh once and I didn't really enjoy reading this book.

It is sort of like those columns Larry King used to write..... I want a pastrami sandwich,.....isn't the Godfather a great movie,..........I remember when the Yankees won all the time....

Its only redeeming feature is that it is short."},{"rating":"2","title":"The art of the Middle Eastern Oud is art, indeed","review":"This CD is really titled \\"The Art of the Middle Eastern Oud\\" and is performed by Charbel Rouhana of Lebanon. The oud is the Arabic lute and is actually the etymological source of the word \\"lute\\" (al-oud.) It is that familiar somewhat hollow-sounding stringed instrument in much of Middle Eastern music. The fifth song on the album \\"Manara\\" or \\"Lighthouse\\" is my personal favorite, winding in out in unison with accordian playing melody alternating with the oud.The oud style here is Rouhana's contribution to the instrument; his method is widely used in teaching the instrument, and the tunes on the CD are his interpretation of traditional melodies. The music is seductive and tuneful. Rouhana is accompanied by tabla, vocals, accordian, riqq, qanan (the Arabic zither), strings and bass guitar. The backup instrumentalists harmonize with Rouhana to make a very excellent album of music that I highly recommend if you like Arabic and Middle Eastern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature, thoughtful and seductive","review":"A great pick for anyone who enjoys more thoughtful and mysterious Mideastern melodies, as oppose to more festive and jolly.

The ultimate goal of Yoga in my humble opinion is to experience the core of your personality (Self =God). To accomplish this you must pass through the material layers, which involves transcending the mind through relinquishing the attachments to the outcome of desires.

Whereas I am not too keen in affirmations, I found Mr Maisel's words extremely conforting and intelligent. Although the affirmations are inspiring, this is a book with practical advice as well, unlike so many others that adress similar questions. It also contains a lot of quotations from famous artists who apparently went through similar ordeals. \\"Affirmations for artists\\" adresses many different kinds of disciplines and is definitely a great gift for an artistically inclined person.

I tried installing Windows ME on a system that had previously run Windows 95, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, three distributions of Linux and FreeBSD flawlessly. I experienced video problems, hard disk crashes and ME getting corrupted repeatedly. I tried reinstalling more than once, both as an upgrade and as clean install after formatting the hard disk to no avail. This operating system is simply not stable.

He and Hunter Thompson burrowed under the skin of all manner of Californians and other New Americans and put us under there too. Wolfe led the way on a wild, joyous, outrageous trip. Most of Hooking UP, except for the title essay and the Noyce piece, is very superficial. As an admirer of Wolfe, I was uncomfortable for him as I read his savaging of Susan Sontag. Her main sin seems to have been getting more 90's ink than Wolfe. His three line dismissal of Noam Chomsky was also embarassing.

That would be a shame. Beginning with the outcry of 'serious literature' champions, including several of his contemporaries, upon publication of A Man in Full, the literary world seems obsessed with deciding what Wolfe should be, rather than treasuring what he is. And that is this: our most accurate social critic of modern America, as dead-on now as he was 40 years ago. Do you wonder about implications of changing sexual mores? Unraveling the human genome? This is a perfect place to begin seeing the future. Don't sell Wolfe short--leave that to the more informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"In general I love Tom Wolfe's work especially Man in Full. Quite frankly I found this volume of old essays dull. The essay on the founding of HP was interesting. Much of the rest of the book appeared to be an attempt to make himself feel more important by taking shots at any who criticize him... see My Three Stooges. Ambush at Fort Bragg would be more interesting if I could determine his point of attack. Did he attack the media or the homophobic soldiers? The last portion of the book about his clash with the New Yorker would be a lot more interesting if I was 20 years older and lived in or cared about NYC.

Wolfe has a keen eye for many aspects of American life.I can not give it 5 stars, though. For someone who makes his living observing others Mr. Wolfe's skin is thin when he is put under the microscope himself. His disdain for Updike is ridiculous when one considers Updike's fiction is a graceful Michael Jordan flying dunk and Wolfe's is still based on descriptions of sounds and accents being spelled out in ALL CAP phonetics on every other page.

That beautiful face looking scared and lots of running.The grotesque hillbilly cannibals are undeveloped monsters who menace the 90210-looking cast.Strictly by-the-numbers drive-in monster movie, minus the humor and titillation of the B-movies from the 70's. Every scene will look and feel familiar.(By the way, if the West Virginia in this movie looks a little flat, that's because it was filmed in Canada)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camp Deliverance","review":"I rented the DVD and had watched it on a night when a storm was a brewing outside. Scared me silly, especially the part where they (victims to be) are hiding inside the inbreds home. I liked this movie. I just thought that it would of been nice if Jeremy Sisto character(he brought a little comic relief) would of survived a little longer. I didn't care with the way he had gotten killed either. He was brave enough to get the inbreds attention away from the other dude that the filmaker could of let his character go down fighting with at least one of the inbreds. Eliza Dushku is always a treat to watch in any movie or series she has been in---look for her new series coming to t.v. soon. I think it is called tru calling.

I just returned from seeing this film at the local theater. Wrong Turn was exactly what I expected it to be, a high adrenaline mixture to put you in mind of the classic films The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance. There are reletively no slow points to this film, and the action is tense and suspenseful with plenty of blood and gore for the hardcore horror fan. To top it all off, Eliza Dushku...wow, shes on fire! Definitely a must see for any fan of horror or suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Flawed, Yet Intense And Very Well Done","review":"At first it seemed as if I walked into the standard horror film, and risked the chance of it becoming another piece of garbage like the recent Darkness Falls or the even worse Wes Craven presents They. The opening of Wrong Turn is your basic slasher film opener, nothing too special so I was caught off guard, because Wrong Turn isn't your basic horror film, because pretty much every element works, and for the first time in a while I found myself on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. Although I do warn you, this film, is not for the ones with weak stomachs, its very gory and probably unsettling for even those who can usually handle gory situations. If it wasn't for this year's incredible House Of 1000 Corpses, Wrong Turn would have a definate shot on being 2003's best horror film, its sure better than any horror films I saw last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, Boring, and Pathetic. 1.5 Stars.","review":"The gore is the best part. This movie is one cliche afetr the other, but that's what the director wanted. There are some inovated kills in this, that will keep gore fans entertained. Plot? You already know it. Teens go into woods, smoke have sex, get slaughtered by a family of imbreed cannabals. Believe me that IS the plot. No character development, no suspense, no scares, but the gore is great. My personal favorites are the arrow in the eye and decaptitation of the girl in the tree.

Deliverance was about 4 city boysgoing to the woods and two of them getting mentallytortured and having to coverup the murders of the twohicks they killed. This movie is a Texas Chainsaw Mass-acre rip-off. It's just a stop and go gore fest withlame looking hick folk. Come on! These guys don't evenlook human! They look like some monster trolls or something like that.It's just boring and uninteresting. There was one scenethat I really liked with an axe and a tree. Don't wantto give it all away.

I was looking forward to a modern variation on the atypical \\"teens lost in the woods\\" film popularized in the 1970s. Instead, the film turned out to be another \\"assembly line\\" horror film consistant with much of what Hollywood is turning out these days with regard to horror films. The acting is competent, the story is a standard cookie-cutter trek through the woods with a bunch of terrorized kids.

The characters get introduced; there is dialogue that sounds natural and some quite funny jokes. Of course, one shouldn't expect too much from a horror movie...Anyway, after about half an hour the film makes a wrong turn and never seems to get back on track. The film makers obviously confuse gory and disgusting with scary, and that turns every climax into an anti-climax. Instead of going \\"uh, this is scary\\", you go \\"yikes!\\" and that's quite a different thing. All the suspense that is built up goes wasted, and that's too bad.Still, some things are quite ok in this film (at least by horror standards) such as... well some of the dialogue. I guess it might as well have gotten one star.From the beginning the viewer gets some clues about mutants and inbred people in the woods. But we don't get to know what they do to people. Do you want to know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary!!!","review":"This movie seems to be a formula flick. On the surface, it is. But, there are elements that stray from the expected.

Seriously, couldn't we think up of a more frightening killer than imbread West Virginians? It's pretty cheesy.

Desmond Harrington from Ghost Ship and Jeremy Sisto from Suicide Kings also stars. the mountain men are disfigured and are really just plan take the movie to the dumps. there are some good moments, well for one when the skanky girl asks the guy to drop trou, Jeremy Sisto's fleeing from the cabin and when he gets 3 arrows in his back and basically thats it. stir away or if your a Dushku fan like I am, watch it and be bored or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller that keeps you on edge!","review":"Wrong Turn definitely took the meaning of \\"horror film\\" to a new level.

This suspense flick has brains--and not just the ones smashed on the floorboards. Refreshingly bereft of the buffoonery that has become de rigueur in recent creepers, this is a heart-thumping horrorfest delivered with deliberate and deadly seriousness. The cinematography is particularly striking, drawing the audience into a dark woodland made both magnificent and menacing. The pacing is prompt and neat, and screen time is not wasted on needless characterization and chatter. The terror comes quickly, and only the credits' roll allows an easy breath!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They got this all wrong...","review":"The thing about \`Wrong Turn' is that it tries so hard to be something else that it forgets to create its own identity. Instead, it remains a mediocre copy of better films that came before it. The idea of mutated woodsmen waiting to feast on scared little teenagers isn't anything new, and sadly nothing about \`Wrong Turn' tries to do anything new. We have hot young things getting their freak on and then getting butchered by a scary group of grotesque people who pick them off one by one. Like many others have noted, films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes, even the remakes, are far more effective in this sub-genre. If you are into films that regurgitate themes and scenes from better films then by all means, dig in, but if you want something with its own pulse and its own vision then stay away from this. If you want to see Eliza Dushku run through the woods in a tight white tank, then watch this movie immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horror flick!","review":"Just a few days ago I ordered \\"Wrong Turn\\" and \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" and finished watching them back to back a few minutes ago. Even though THHE's was very disappointing, \\"Wrong Turn\\" was everything I had hoped it would be.

I won't go into what the movie is about as I am sure others have already done that. I would just like to say that this is a horror flick all fans of the genre should have. It left me wondering why I just learned about the movie last week. Did it not make it to the theaters? hmmm...anyway, get it. You won't be disappointed...oh, and don't pay any attention to those who may give this movie a negative review.

Soon after, lone wolf medical student Chris (Desmond Harrington) accidentally smacks into the back of their 4x4.From then on they start to get picked off in turn by the locals, who have a taste for city-boy (and girl) flesh. The whole thing chugs along amiably enough in its way before guttering out in a messy, somewhat suspense-free finale.

A group of young men and women are stranded in the hills of West Virginia when they wreck their cars on a barely passable side road. Out comes the locals that look inbred enough to scare even their mother. Most people either love or hate these movies. Personally I find them entertaining if they don't overdue the gorefest and if there is a decent enough original story. Even though parts of it seem familiar, it is different enough to get credit for some originality and I'm glad to say the gore is outdone by the suspense.

The villains (inbred west virginiers) were an almost laughable bunch of lumbering idiots who grunted alot. Everything was beyond unbeleivable, the amount of people that were implied in their killing streak alone was ridicules. There were no scary moments at all and barely any tense ones.

The film gives only a brief mention of 'Deliverence' and completely ignores 'Southern Comfort' when a more accomplished director would have paid better homage and at least given a subtle nod to the movies from which it is born.As the 'jumps' are broadcast with the subtlety of a hammer, this movie does as least become unintentionally funny as they run around the dense West Virginia forest generally screaminga la Shaggy and Scooby.At least the scenery is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"straight to video","review":"If you blinked you probably missed this movie in the theaters but that's okay because it'll be in the 99 cent bin at your local video store really soon.

Those mountain men weren't that hideous, a lot of people look like that when they wake up in the morning. Really, this is a standard horror film, but it has its moments. The nasty brothers have a poor diet and they eat mysterious meat, tasty. There should've been a local dentist in town to help those poor boys. Well, everyone gets it except for the main guy (Desmond Harrington) and the main girl (Eliza Dushku) and they manage to blow up the incest house standing a few feet from the gas can. Is he crazy? He could've blown himself out of his own shoes. Kind of silly, but oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible....","review":"For starters the inbred (of course we are only assuming they are inbred) \\"mountain men\\" are distorted beyond inbred---they look more like kin of the Toxic Avenger; at least in \\"Texas Chainsaw....\\" they actually looked inbred. Secondly and more importantly the script is pretty much--you guessed it--\\"Texas Chainsaw....\\". Is this the best that Hollywood hacks can come up with?--a retreading of an old tale(actually a rip off) and a bad one at that. My suggestion is to buy \\"Deliverance\\" and forget this piece of garbage ever hit the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie with a lot of blood, gore, and no plot.","review":"I love movies...even bad ones. So for me to say a movie is bad it has to be REALLLLLLY bad. This movie was a lot like chainsaw massacre. There wasnt much of a story either...just people running from disfigured inbreed woodsmen who are looking to kill people and keep body parts as a trophy. Theres just an overkill of blood and gore. I also thought it was boring and fast forwarded through much of the movie!

WRONG TURN will keep you on the edge of your seat and it doesn't take long to get there! In fact, there are two deaths before the opening credits even start! We also get to see Mr. Stan Winstons awesome special effects throughout the whole movie, and he won't let you down. Next to Tom Savini, Stan Winston is the best when it comes to gory effects and make-up work. This DVD is worth every penny because you also get some good extras along with some good gore. The death in the treetop is sure to become a classic! Do not hesitate and buy this DVD now! If you are a true horror fan and like the 70's and 80's horror flicks add this to your collection today.

Why do they need to put so much more makeup than would be needed to feel real today ? To impress us ? Fake ! They want us to believe it so much and too much that it becomes very unreal and highly unrealistic. I don't understand. How can people find it believable ? I can't understand.

'Wrong Turn' truly surprises as a B-level horror movie. The comparison to \`Deliverance' is unfair since the acting talent in Wrong Turn is sub-par at best. Rather compare this to say \`Friday the Thirteenth' and 'Wrong Turn' becomes a far better movie. There are some inventive killings along with some truly tense moments created while the lost teenagers engage with one messed up inbreed family in the Virginia mountains. The first quarter of the movie is amateurish but keep watching as this movie turns into a gut wrenching (literally) fight for survival. The very end is a bit hammy and sets up for a sequel. Side note: The main male actor kinda resembles a young Lee Majors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I decided to rent this film because of Eliza Dushku and I'm a fan or horror films.

All of the above. If you picked E you're right! The filmmakers in the commentary compare the film to \\"TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE\\" & \\"DELIVERANCE\\", another movie it reminded me of was the 70's horror classic \\"THE HILLS HAVE EYES\\". Which I encorage you to check out if you haven't seen it. Something must also be said about the remarkable FX that are on display here. Make-up FX are top-notch thanks to Stan Winston Studios.

It takes place in West Virginia and it's basically about a bunch of cannibal inbreds that live in the woods and kill people. The writing isn't that good, and some parts are really stupid. One stupid part I'll note is the scene where they jump out of the watch tower. Now this tower is at least 100 feet in the air, and they jump out of it and land safley in the trees below without a scratch!! Please!! I'm sure you could survive that fall, but with no broken bones, or even a scratch for that matter??? Then they run around through the tree tops like monkeys and knock one of the inbreds out to fall to his death. There were a few stupid scenes, but some of them actually were pretty scary and suspenseful. The acting was ok, not the greatest, but there was plenty of gore which really saved the movie.

The entire cast is basically made up of younger actors who are getting their start in the business. I found the movie suspenseful, yet predictable at the same time. Towards the end of the movie, Eliza Dushku's character became very annoying it seemed to me. She seemed to go from being the really strong girl who had the situation relatively under control, to being the damsel in distress girl who needed to be rescued by the man.

It's got that 70's feel to the filming and offers a bunch of fantastic scares and some terrifying situations!It's a tale of a group of teens that happen upon a family of murderous inbreds in West Virginia.Sam Winston produced this, and I think, did a great job.

That stays true to 1980's horror fimls. And I also hated how this horror movie called itself a 80's horror movie.

Highest point is the sight of the always-attractive Dushku, who will make your heart skip a beat over the bloodthirsty hillbillies, and nadir is the lack in standard cinematic devices.Running Time: 95 minutes and rated R for strong violence and gore, some language and drug use."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG TURN IS A \\"DEAD END\\"","review":"With all the hype and the cool website the film had to offer, I wandered into my neighborhood cinema expecting a little something different.

I have seen very small indies much better than this....the best part of this \\"DEAD END\\" was the trailers before it.... TRUST ME: YOU WILL BE VERY DISSAPOINTED. Save your money and stay at home, \\"Wrong Turn\\" is the wrong movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie.

Its not in good condition at all. Very upset with this disc. Its is defective/ doesn't work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something a bit new","review":"I tend to avoid mainstream horror and big budget films, as most of them are predictable and lame. But, I was actually suprised with this one, it was somewhat original and doesnt have the typical idiotic blonde running from another slasher with a mask. It has a somewhat of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre feel to it. definatly worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"wrong turn","review":"great movie right here. You look at all the teeny trash they put out and then you find this movie. A great movie with homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre about a group of people running from canabalistic forest dwellers. A scary movie with great FX from Savini. Alot of jump from but not to much shock. What i mean by shock is no gore. There was one scene of gore when the dwellers come back to there shack and..... ull find out i dont wanna ruin it for you. Great sound on your Dvd Player. The dvd special features arent great but there ok. Cool 1970's feel with zoom in camera shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i went and saw this movie with my brother, my sister-in-law, and my mom on vacation in TExas. It was awesome. I love scary movies! This movie wasn't so much scary, though, as it was that i kept you on the edge of your seat. I'm not usually scared by movies..buti screamed about 3 times during this movie. However, I absolutely loved it and am trying to convince my best friend to watch it with me when it comes out on video (she's terrified of horror movies) lol. anywayz..i reccomend this to anyone who wants a good scare :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but low quality materials","review":"The jar itself is beautiful and very unique, so if you want to make an impression when gifting a jar of something special, this is a good choice, but NOT the best since the lids are aluminum and not a harder metal, so it gets misshapen quickly and it's difficult to get it back into shape. This results in a very poor seal and spills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud & Beautiful","review":"These jars are better than I expected and are gorgeous filled with pickles or jam. When the jars seal they make a loud thunk sound that makes me jump every time.

The child has to lift their pencil to get over the plastic barriers while writing a single letter. Instead of writing a continuous circle for \\"O\\", the child traces the top half of the circle, lifts their pencil over the barrier, and traces the lower half. That's not a natural way to write, and is frustrating for the child because when they lift the guide off the paper they still have to connect the parts of the letter for the whole letter to form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I purchase this item for my granddaughter to teach her how to write.

There is no mention of the original date of publication (in was in the 20's) or of who published it and where.To make matters worse, if that were possible, the book is called an EasyRead Edition, despite the text being printed in blocks of type; there are no indentations for paragraphs or conversations.In short, there is nothing easy to read about this truncated, sloppily (lazily) typeset edition. I wanted to read the original text, and I do not recommend this inferior reproduction.The publishers should be ashamed of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A THANKSgiving book....","review":"I was just at a huge retail bookseller yesterday looking at Thanksgiving books that I could read to my homeschooled Kindergartener. There is a large selelction of bland books about thanksgiving. The wise child will say, \\"But, WHO are we thanking?\\" after reading most of those books. THIS book answers that question...GOD! Yes, while it seems politically incorrect, the truth is that the first settlers to our country WERE religious pilgrims, seeking a safe haven from religious persecution. This book is a gem in a PC sea of bland, corny thanksgiving day books for children. Children will enjoy the simple story; those just getting into chapter books will enjoy feeling successful reading a 'big kid' chapter book; and they will enjoy seeing how God blesses the faithful when they endure through trying times and complete hard work. This is a great book that your early elementary aged children will enjoy and can become a traditional read aloud for your family on the holiday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don'd buy the e-book","review":"Terrible quality.

It won the Caldecott Honor for 1955.I think this is my favourite version of the first American Thanksgiving that is in short chapter format.

We really enjoyed it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Part I-The Making of, \\"Don't Cry\\".","review":"Making part I shows the making of Don't Cry. The video involved interviews with Axl and the gang. Call me clueless but I did not realize Don't Cry was about reincarnation until after I saw this video. I think GNR did an excellent job with this video, considering their budget and the fact that none of the band ever acted before! I also liked the interview with Shannon Hoon, one of the backup vocalists on the song. The band did have some trouble finding a building to perfrom on top of for the video (liability issues). I liked when the video showed how Axl was spray painted green. There's humor from all members of GNR. It shows some of their human side. If you like to see how videos are made, then you will enjoy this. Of course, GNR fans will like it anyways!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i can't see any difference from old one...","review":"Okey, I like the way Axl Rose performed.

I mean, yes, they do go on lots of holidays, but HEY, they're books, and I like reading them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"This book wasn't very good. First of all, the fact that an entire school is going to Hawaii for no reason whatsoever is COMPLETELY unrealistic. Next, the adventures of the babysitting weren't that exciting-not even Stacey's. She was on a helicoptor that crashed, but her adventures mainly focused on walking back to where they were supposed to be. What really bugged me about this story is that there was almost NO plot. The whole plot is: The baby-sitters go to Hawaii. They do stuff. They come back. That's what most Super Specials are about, but other ones are written better and the adventures are actually realistic (since when do 13-year-olds act in commercials by pretending that they're 18, and having everyone believe them?). If you're a die-hard BSC fan, then you'll probably like this book. Otherwise, stick to realistic books that actually have a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID with a capitol STU!","review":"Although well-written and interesting, the whole thing is stupid. WHat makes the BSC so special that they can travel the world like that? Why, when I was in school they wouldn't even let us go to Eastern Washington (which is only a few hundred miles from where we are in Western Washington. It hacked me off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, disappointing delivery.","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much. The 12 steps used in recovery programs have helped millions of people in a variety of situations. This book doesn't quite make the transition from the 12 steps to chronic illness. Although the basic premise, that we can look at and heal emotional pain, and find spiritual serentity, is good; the path isn't laid out clearly. It's too sketchy, nebulous, and intangible.Cleveland writes, \\"Ask your fear what it needs from you.\\" If this works for you, great. I just found it frustrating. She has some good ideas. It was just hard for me to fish them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are these 5 star ratings coming from?","review":"First off, I am a HUGE MST3K fan. I get most of the inside stuff and I generally have a great appreciation for \\"stupid\\" humor. Having said that, this episode just didn't do it for me. I and a friend (every bit the MST3K fan I am) just finished watching this episode and counted maybe 10 chuckles between us. A mighty low count compared to other shows. We had the highest of hopes based on the reviews on Amazon. Maybe we set our hopes too high and couldn't help but be disappointed. Bottom line, we just didn't laugh that much where other episodes have had us in tears. IMHO, this one deserves 2 stars at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this called \\"Cave Dwellers\\"?","review":"Another absolutely hopeless movie lambasted by Joel and the 'Bots. This movie is so bad that it almost gets tedious. Bear with it, because Joel's accusatory stare at Frank and Forrester after viewing the movie is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This was one of those movies where not much makes sense, from the unnamed people fighting in the opening credits to the hero in the wilderness just making a hang glider out of nothing but sticks and some sort of material. But Joel and the bots take full advantage of the incongruities by pointing them out. Showing poorly edited movies is what makes MST3K great. It's fun to hear them point something out and then rewinding to see if you can spot it. (Maybe I should get out more -- but it's still a good movie.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, the wonderful pain of it all...","review":"Cave Dwellers occupies the same exclusive realm as the mighty Manos: The Hands of Fate. From the opening credits (starring two characters who aren't even part of the feature itself) to the elaborate flashback scene, to the wonderfully schlocky ending battle, this is a masterpiece of the horrid, a movie that makes you laugh and wince simultaneously, wondering all the while, \\"How on EARTH did this movie get made?!?\\" In fact, it's so dreadful that TV's Frank and Dr. Forrester each feel the need to apologize to Joel at various points. Now, if that isn't a clear sign that this is something special, I don't know what is. The commentary is inspired (as always). Buy it. Watch it. Live it. \\"How much Keefe is in this movie?\\" \\"Miles o' Keefe!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"One of my favorites! When I recommend MST3K to friends, this one is always on the must see list.

I THINK that this is one of the sequels to Ator - Fighting Eagle, I can't be sure because I think I forgot that movie as a defensive mechanism. Some great lines in this one...heck, even the box made me laugh. Not the best episode by any means, but still a real cracker. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too funny!","review":"If you ever watched Mystery Science Theatre 3000 and call yourself a fan, you have to buy this episode. 'Cave Dwellers' is perhaps one of the worst movies showcased on the show, making it instantly the funniest of the bunch. Joel, Crow and Tom Servo's comments are dead on. This was the first one I ever watched and still think this and Pod People were the funniest of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific historical review of the SD&A/SD&AE Railway","review":"If you are looking for a historical review of the famous last transcontinental railroad, this is it!

I was looking forward to this DVD, but was very disappointed by the selection. This is definitely not the best of Dana Carvey on SNL! Dana used to be laugh-out-loud funny, but there is not much of that on this DVD.It is possible that for others the selections on this DVD are exactly what they hoped to see. That is always the danger with this type of \\"best of\\" compilations. The DVD is inexpensive, so if you are a fan of Dana, it is still a worthwhile purchase. And there are some good moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource book for trail riders!","review":"This book is a must have for trail riding in Oklahoma.

It came as a gift with the purchase of \\"Worship\\" by Michael W. Smith, and so is now out-of-print, but if you can find it used, I recommend buying it. It combines the reading of Scripture with 5 anointed worship songs. We had a tape of it that we listened to constantly, and when we found this used, bought it immediately. The music and Scripture combine to take you on a escalating worship experience from adoration all the way into the Throne Room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and self congratulatory","review":"Jay Quinn tells us on every page, through the character of Chris, what a great mom he is, how pretty he is, how good his butt is, how he did the best he could, sacrifice, martyrdom and constant constant self congratulatory rhetoric. I found the concept of the story fascinating, but the writing sophomoric and its purpose to make everyone else in the book secondary to the greatness and grace of Jay Quinn. The dialogue is completely unrealistic and comes off silly. Mr. Quinn should never take up screenwriting. I had to keep reading just to laugh out loud every time he had another character tell him how fabulous he was. It gets ridiculous. It is a surface novel which screams 'love me' at the top of its lungs. I kept imagining one of Charles Busch's characters saying his lines. It's that corny. Too bad. If he weren't so wrapped up in himself and his need for approval, Jay Quinn might allow himself to go deeper and actually turn out to be a good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I admit I was only able to get to about page 100 before giving up on this well meaning but--for me at least--boring book. I like the fact that the protagonist is over 40 and the story is not set in a big city, but I didn't particularly like or care much about any of the characters in the book--which is problematic in a book where the characters (to paraphrase Jon Lovitz as Harvery Fierstein) just want to be loved.I agree with a lot of the negative criticism in other reviews: the main character just seemed too feminine, the dialogue was unrealistic and a lot of the catholic stuff was just off putting.The plot also was way too obvious in many places; for example, when Chris is so worried what the priest will say to him, how can there be any doubt the priest will surprise him and be great?The main reason this all bothers me, and why I'm writing this review, is that I think the author has some talent. All that potential is just wasted in this silly, dull book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting premise, beautifully executed","review":"Jay Quinn has given us characters that seem real and full of life. The premise is out of the ordinary for the typical gay novel, but is handled very, very well.After 22 years of being the husband of Zack and \\"mother\\" to his children, Chris finds himself replaced. The story of his new life and his relationship with his \\"children\\" forms the basis of the book. I hate it when reviews give away plot points and story details, so I refuse to do that. Just know that it evolves beautifully and makes you wish that these were people you could visit with frequently.Read it - you'll be very glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Jay Quinn's writing has certainly deteriorated from \\"Metes and Bounds\\" (2001) to this book. OK, \\"Metes\\" had some flaws, but it didn't blatantly advertise for silly stereotypes such as \\"husband and wife\\" or \\"top and bottom\\" role-playing in a male2male/gay/whatever you call it longterm partnership and wasn't written like a Rosamunde Pilcher novel (although Ms. Pilcher is certainly a nice lady, but her novels are written for ladies wanting to read a book full of romance and stuff)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ!","review":"I pretty much always finish a book no matter how much I hate it..but THIS book I couldn't even do that much..I only got to page 75 and that was enough. This character is a whiney victim..a real pussy..it really irriates me that the author wrote about this character almost as if the character was a WOMAN! I did NOT like how this Chris was put into the role of 'wife'/woman it seemed...and the ex was the 'husband'/man..that just isn't how it is in the real gay world...very irritating and insulting to me.and the whole drama with that damn dog..get over it! my god! was like reading a child's diary at that point.ugh..very immature writing.E.Lynn Harris is much better if you are looking for gay- relationship literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I really wanted to like this well-meaning tale of middle-aged man trying to rebuild his life after he's dumped by his boyfriend of twenty years for a Joan Collins character. But in the end, I wanted to get back some of the life that I'd wasted reading this self-congratulatory tripe, featuring the most wooden, agonising dialogue since James Earl Hardy's last effort. But the worst part of it is nothing happens. Nothing! Unless you count having Catholicism rammed down your throat by a bunch of one dimensional bores being terribly nice to one another. Then, to add insult to injury, in the final pages one character refers to the sex of her unborn twins by saying \\"one nice package and one tiny little t***.\\" I can't recall having ever read such an ill-judged and tasteless piece of imagery.I wish that, like the title character, I was back where I started - before I'd ever picked this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sartre is still relevant.","review":"Sartre's work is still a classic.

The name isn't misleading at all--the footbed is as smooth as can be. The straps are short enough that your feet don't really \\"flip\\" or \\"flop\\" when walking, and durable enough that they don't stretch.

I had these knives a couple of years ago and have since upgraded to the Wusthof Classic. The Silverpoint knives are lighter and \\"flimsier\\" than the professional lines for a reason - the cheaper knives are stamped by machine, mostly made in China. The professional knives are made in Germany and the steel is forged, giving them the heavier, more balanced feel. You can't expect top of the line knives for $60. If your biggest concern is price over quality, this set will serve you well enough until you are ready to shell out more for a better set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Knives Should Not Be Sold As Wusthof","review":"The Silverpoint knives may look good in the pictures, but they are NOTHING like the quality of the Wusthof Grand Prix knives. The weight is about a third of the same Grand Prix knife. The blades are flimsy and they don't have the same balance as the more expensive quality Wusthof lines. The Silverpoint knives are stamped and not forged like the other Wusthof knives. I ended up donating my Silverpoint set to Salvation Army, and bought another set - Grand Prix this time - to get the quality I was looking for. Do yourself a favor -- save your money and use whatever knives you currently have until you can afford to buy a Classic or Grand Prix set.

The knives are extremely sharp, however they are so light and flimsy that they are a safety hazard.

If you genuinely care for it, great, but don't try to stuff it into me under the guise of \\"great literature.\\" The stories are all long, boring, and you really do have to take notes just to follow the so-called plot. Even professors with doctorates in English have to take notes to follow it. It seems that every story is about some woman with sexual and/or social problems, and you get to read for about 50 pages the story of how the woman sleeps with all the guys and wanders around looking for meaning in life. It has about as much meaningful content as a day-time talk show, and it's a heck of a lot more complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tool for work","review":"As an earlier reviewer noted, this book isn't the DiSC in its purest form. However, it does provide a framework for understanding relationships at work clearly and concisely. I was introduced to the DiSC during a leadership school I attended through work, and this book provided me with the tools and framework I needed to share the model with my staff. In one-on-ones, I've been told that the process was both enlightening and useful on a daily basis.If you're looking for pure DiSC, look elsewhere. But if you want a tool to improve the way you and your staff interact, written in a way that's easy for everyone to understand, this is the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"I was looking for a book to learn about the DISC tool and to be able to interpret the results of a test, something I could use to train others.

I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alison","review":"It was a horrible scenario in many ways, robbing people, prostitution, suicide attempts, not exactly the things you would find in a happy movie, but the point of the movie is that love can be so powerful it can encompass everything. Claire, being the perfect girl, or what appeared to be perfect, was missing something. She was beautiful and intelligent, but when Jack came along, she fell so over the top in love, that he was the only thing that mattered to her. It was sad that her existence hinged on a person who destroyed her, but she couldn't help it, her heart lead her in a completely opposite direction and the fact that she could not truly have him turned her into a bitter and careless person. Love is supposed to be giving and real. When a person truly loves, they give themselves to another person and hope the other person takes care of their heart, only sometimes it is the wrong person and they never figure out how to love. This movie hit too close to home I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost good but not quite","review":"This is another one of those annoying movies where the men fornicate with everything that moves and the women who love these schmucks are depicted as shrill and clingy for being upset about it. But when the man gets totally unhinged by evidence of the woman's infidelity this is somehow powerful and emotional. I really wish that Hollywood would stop perpetuating this insulting double standard.Adrian Brody was somehow compelling as the tritely written \\"criminal with the soul of a poet\\". There were a few moving scenes that made the movie worth watching (\\"I hate you\\"..\\"I know\\") and some some of the other love scenes were touching and realistic as well. Pam Grier was great, as were a number of the other minor roles.Overall, a disappointment but with a few transcendent scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yo, Adrien!!","review":"I want to say to all of you, I had every intention of liking this movie. I have a soft spot for Adrien Brody's Bronx/Manhattan sadness. He reminds me of the good guys that I grew up with in Queens. He's probably one of the nicest guys in Hollywood right now and I was thrilled when he won for best actor last year at the Oscars. But let's face it:This film was such a dog! You have to be desperately seeking art in any form to think this was even remotely interesting let alone entertaining. The only reason I didn't shut the DVD off in the first half hour was because of the respect I have for Brody.Yo, Adrien, be a little more judicious with the roles you pick and show a little more influence in who you costar with in the future, OK?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually Entertaining-","review":"I saw the trailer for Love the Hard Way and I just recently rented and watched it. I really liked the film style of when Claire and Jack make love and when she catches him cheating. (...) I must have re-watched them about 6 times by now... The film was entertaining, but they left a lot of questions unanswered, like about Jack's past, where the hell was Claire living and how did she always seem to end up at Jacks place, etc. Plus the movie was pretty believable up until the whole Claire prostitution and suicide phase, then it started gettin wacky all over again- Overall i think it was worth seeing and i enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises more than 90% unfulfilled, alas","review":"Ninety-three pennies and one dime yielded a spin in 6 cases.

People can find any information for various problems relating to parrot behaviorism."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent starter book","review":"The writer injects her philosophy/zen-ishness initially, but by the 2nd or third chapter gets into the meat of bird psychology. It is less a how-to and more of a way of approaching parrot care. It does, however give good basic training principles. She starts you on basic decent bird (and human) behavior. It has cute illustrations for each chapter, but the font under the illustrations is microscopic. Overall, it is a decent starter book. If you don't have a parrot and are planning on it, read the book to get a reality check. Don't buy a parrot on a whim and have a 30 or 40 year potential nightmare on your hands. If someone you love has a bird, this will help you learn bird language and perhaps avoid some painful nips, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Excellent book for a child that is needing information for the time of slavery.

We listen to this song, and they try to decode what it is about. I read this book to them to \\"crack the code.\\" I like how it personalizes he story to be about specific people.

It is an inspiring story of courage and triumph over adversity. The story is about a slave named Peg Leg Joe who leads other slaves to freedom by teaching them a song instructing them to \\"Follow the Drinking Gourd\\".

I am considering purchasing the Ozeri ZB13 scale to replace this one, as it has MUCH better reviews.

Why does a body fat measuring device need to know if you are an athlete or what your height is? If is truly measuring resistance through your body this info should be irrelevant! What it is actually doing is calculating your BMI. That is completely useless if you want to know your bodyfat percentage! Don't believe me? Change your height! Your body fat will go down if you say you are taller and will go up if you say you are shorter! In exact accordance with a BMI chart!

However, those are the only positives.The body fat percentage of the scale does not work. I get different readings each time I step on the scale. One of the reasons why I bought this was because it has an athletic mode, which corrects for the high muscle mass of athletes. Being a collegiate division one athlete, my muscle percentage is higher than that of a normal person. The batteries were also not included, so that added extra expenses.Overall, it was not worth the money I spent on it.

I thought a senior yoga workout would be good for me and something I could do comfortably. Turns out I was right. I can do everything except the floor work but the rest of the workout is just right. It gives me the stretching and moving that I need but is not too strenuous. The pace is relaxing and I feel accomplished after doing it. I would recommend this DVD to anyone that needs an easy sitting and standing yoga workout. Perfect for anyone having a problem with knees or hips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lilias!

Many years ago I was interested in Lakota, read through this dictionary and found the orthography so confusing I did not even try to learn it seriously. It cannot be blamed on the author Buechel, who made an important contribution to the description of Lakota during the first half of the twentieth century. The editor, Manhart, is really responsible for the sorry state of this dictionary. Not only is the orthography confusing and illegible, many words are wrongly transcribed and were never rechecked with native speakers.

Why \\"Dayvan Cowboy\\" is issued again is beyond me, since it already was totally redundant on \\"The Campfire Headphase\\". To top that, the remix is even worse than the original.The rest of the album contains mildly interesting noise-drenched synth noodlings, somewhat sounding like their earlier work, but mostly lacking its emotional power.I keep hoping that the Boards will get their act together, but it hasn't happened yet with this EP.

Provide rhythmic structures with other elements, not with electro drums - that would be something really new and exciting from them.Anyway - ok album.But there are many less known artists that more mature than BoC and would deserve even more recognition - like Keith Fullerton Whitman, Tim Hecker, Fennesz and many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice EP","review":"Short, under 30 minutes....but a very nice cut.

The other stories are all just as bad/fake and there is never any conclusion to the question on the title why do wives cheat, what is the purpose of the book?

It is so much fun to be able to have to sing perfectly on the note bar. The only thing that is bad about it is that it doesn't have very many accessories to go with it. Like for the Playstation volume, there are headsets that you can sing in to it, but for the gamecube it just has these very cheap looking microphones. They work well though, and you don't even have to hold down the button on them to sing. That was a huge relief for me. My advice, if you have a Playstation, buy that one instead, but if you just have a Gamecube. Buy it!!! It is one of the coolest games ever.

Streching exercises are for gymnasts (camera shies away from Carradine when unbelievably hard exercises are being done by other participants) and seem to have been borrowed from Pilate or Yoga. The Chinese exercise leader does not know how to lead, just mumbles, and the camera angles and structure of teaching make everything impossible to follow. Unnecessary things like Kung Fu, songs, and other non-Taichi materials should not have been included. I have the older VHS where Arnold Tayam was co-instructor, and I prefer that a lot which I give a B plus. The problem though is that it's the short form. I give this DVD (Natural Journeys production) a grade of D+ (barely passing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"T'a Chi","review":"I found it very difficult to fallow along since you can't always see everything the leader is doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe \\"tai chi for stoners\\" would be a more descriptive title","review":"This is a repackaged (and cleverly marketed) recycle from a guy who never learned what he is presenting.

He's very happy with this DVD and I am also using it because of the additional material as well as the intense original workout.In addition to the original workout, David Carradine also has a stretching workout which is Yoga.

The film also conveys in interviews with Iraqi citizens something of the after effects of \\"shock and awe\\" when there was still hope that a little patience would be all that was required before a new normalcy took hold - and coalition forces ended their occupation. But there are already ominous signs of what is to come - bombings, sectarian unrest, imprisonment and harsh treatment of detainees. Offered the presidency of the country, the filmmaker's 80-year-old father returns to London, where he has been living in exile, understanding that as a man of integrity the job would be too much for him. A film whose melancholy has deepened in the five years since it was first released."},{"rating":"1","title":"1��5��","review":"This album is 1 stars because most of the songs are unlistenable.

After you get those two albums, get Angels Fall First."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightwish:The beginning of the best band ever!","review":"I was reading the other reviews and I thought I would add my opinion. This Cd was their first effort adn I loved it. Although Tuomas' voice may not be as melodic as Tarja's I wouldn't call it awful. It's just not polished. Elvenpath is one of the best songs ever. Tuomas adds Lord of the Rings into a song. What other band could pull that one off? This cd gives way to the startings of metal you find in their other Cd's. Oceanborn is an acievement, often hailed as their best(Don't hurt me but I d no agree, although I do love the album). Wishmaster was my favorite until Once. I love the songs on Wishmaster, there are no bad tracks. Century Child breaks the mold, as they add in heavy guitars and Marco's voice. Once tops them all. Nightwish started with this and has worked their way to the top. Every band starts somewhere. Nightwish started on top and stayed there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome first album","review":"I'm not sure why some people don't like this album as much as Nightwish's subsequent albums, but I thought it was great. Anyone who truly loves Nightwish will appreciate Angels Fall First. Beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad start for an otherwise fantastic band","review":"If you want to know what exactly Angels Fall First sounds like, let me offer you the following scenario. Combine Wishmaster and Century Child, strip off the bass and half the keyboards, add in some of Simone Simon's extremely forced vocals from Epica and Tuomas's flat tenor, and throw it all into a car crash. That is what Angels Fall First sounds like. I was very disappointed with this first album, especially considering how incredible their other albums were. The two best songs (meaning four out of five stars) were Elvenpath and Know Why the Nightingale Sings, followed by This Moment Is Eternity and Beauty and the Beast. The rest were frankly hard to listen to. Look to Oceanborn and Once for Nightwish's best performances, because you won't find them here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Couples Aid","review":"My girlfriend and I read this book separately and took notes.

The music box drama featuring Laura being forced to turn on her stuttering friend (that Nellie Oleson was such a fun brat!) to Pa mining the liquid dynamite to lil Carrie falling down a well (if only they had left her!).

The episodes entitled \\"The Race\\" and \\"Bunny\\" are out of order. In \\"The Race\\", they talk about Nellie abusing the horse, and faking her injuries, which happens in \\"Bunny\\". So they made a mistake when they put the DVD together, because they have \\"The Race\\" play before \\"Bunny\\".Other then that, the first episode had a few visual flaws, but otherwise, all else is good. I haven't watched the other discs so I can't comment on those. But I recommend you BUY this DVD set and continue your collection. I'm glad I did.11/05/03 - Update:I just wanted to add another thing to my review. Many reviewers complained that they only showed the opening credits for the first episode on the disc.

Yet to my vast irritation and disappointment, the DVDs are NOT captioned. This is false and misleading labeling. I am extremely hard-of-hearing and I NEED captioning. This is infuriating.

Here's my theory. Season 1 &2 were EXCELLENT. And this is the WORST SEASON SO FAR. And why did they put Bunny and The Race in the wrong order? Take my advice, Watch BUNNY before THE RACE. I like sevreal episodes though like, To live with Fear is really good. But why is Fred {the goat} so annoyng and pathetic? But it is really funny. And The Blizzard was good. I did not care to watch The Monster of Walnut Grove by the description ,I can tell it doesn't flow. Oh well let's hope season 4 will be better. Oh I forgot , Bunny and the race are the BEST episodes from season 3.

I also watched re-runs with parts chopped out of them for years, and always hoped that someday I could purchase them uncut. The first two seasons on DVD were excellent; it was like watching a different show than what you see now in the syndicated versions (and on the videos produced by Goodtimes, I might add!) I was so excited!When Season 3 came out I expected the same uncut shows. Except for only a few, these episodes are exactly like the ones shown in syndication, with scenes and lines of dialogue missing, so I am quite disappointed. I would much rather have had the missing scenes than the opening music and scene indexes for every show. I will wait until I see some reviews for Season 4 before I buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little House- Season 3","review":"I love this show, and Season 3 is my second favorite season.

When I mentioned episodes being \\"uncut\\", I was referring to the actual show itself. Opening/closing credits and scene indexes are nice to have, but I would MUCH rather the shows have no scenes or dialogue left out. I consider an episode \\"uncut\\" if I get to see parts that are left out when it is shown on T.V. Most of the Season 3 shows are like the ones in syndication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Show That Keeps Your Interest","review":"Try to find a quality show like Little House now and you come up empty. Season 3 has a lot more drama than the first 2 seasons, but every episode is different and holds your attention. The acting is great. I didn't realize how good an actress the very young Melissa Gilbert was. Considering her age at the time, she really performed some excellent scenes and held her own.Too many scenes are cut apbruptly, which is really annoying and makes me wonder how much of the show was cut.

Nerds turn into psycho's, preps turn into perverts, and a teen gives birth to a mutant slug that falls into toxic waste and then turns into a giant monster that stalks the high school halls.

Troma has tried but failed to acheive cult statutas again with 'Class of Nuke 'Em High', an overlong horror/sci-fi/comedy about teens at a local high school who are contaminated by toxic waste from a nearby nuclear power planet. Some good scenes, but fails to deliver the same graphic violence as 'The Toxic Avenger' and 'Surf Nazi's Must Die'. As in all Troma films, this film is extremely long and dosn't know when to quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Class of Nuk'EM High","review":"Class of Nuk'EM High is one of Troma's better movies but that ain't saying much. The movie is very sloppy and looks like there wasn't much time taken into it, but what do you expect from a B movie? Well there is a lot better B movies out there then this one. It is good for a Troma movie and Troma fans will like it but if you hate Troma movies stay away from this one. I really liked \\"The Toxic Avenger\\" and I felt this was a let down compared to that film. Troma made two sequels to this and they were even worse.For a Troma this is good,but they haven't yet made a film really good since \\"The Toxic Avenger\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Troma Classic.","review":"If you haven't already seen this 100 times on the USA network in the 80's or 90's (or even if you have), this is well worth your time and money.

Has that high-school atmosphere even though many of the actors look in their twenties. For a low-budget film it really depicts the nuclear aspect surprisingly well.

The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obbesion, Horror and Beauty","review":"I picked up this book on a whim at a local bookstore knowing little to nothing about Oscar Wilde. This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face.

Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Growing up with Oscar,I had read this as a youth and seen the film, but obviously the original book was much better.

The vocabulary in it was from the time it was written about, and was hard to understand. If you read this book, you need to be able to understand words from context.I liked this book because it talked about the eternal fight for beauty, and I think that this is an interesting topic.

However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art.

I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA.

It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk.

I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being.

He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better...

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overall Book","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination.

This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever. The best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gothic Good Fun","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

During his portraiture, Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton, who preaches self-indulgence and the high social value, yet lamentable ephemerality, of youth. Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character. In the end, he cannot bear to be what he has become.Comment: This novel struck me as glib.

Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing.

I hardly think so.","review":"First off, let me begin by saying that this book was not completely devoid of any good characteristics. It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture.

Sometimes poor camera work or a bad script can be excused when the acting is outstanding. Then there are times when everything conspires against a film.The acting, the script, and the camera work were all bad in this film. Every actor was reading their lines, or trying to remember what they memorized a few minutes before being on camera. Almost every actor had difficulty moving with grace and ease in front of the camera. The story was not very good at all, on the outside chance somebody decides to watch this stinker, I won't ruin the single worthwhile moment in the movie. The camera work was all bad handheld giggle camera.In a nutshell, avoid this film.

She looks so much like a younger Halle Berry, without trying but also seemed to try to act like her as well. the story reminded me of a cross between Boomerang with the Eddie cheating on her and coming back and it reminds me about a reverse role of the movie where the guy can read women's thoughts. It doesn't explain how that happened for her to hear men's thoughts other than she woke up in the library and read a bunch of books. It was predictable in that you knew how the movie ended.

Who wants to go camping without a campfire to sit or stand around after the sun sets? So, I started looking for a solution to this problem and decided on the Fire Dancer. This was definitely the right decision! It's portable yet not too small. I love the fact that it's self contained. The top screws on snugly using the carrying handle and the hose wraps nicely around the base. The coolest thing about this propane campfire is that fact that the flame actually dances. You can be mesmerized, like watching a real campfire!

Mind you, the fabric is not thin at all but quite thick.

They're not magic socks, that's just the layering effect, but these are the only socks I've found that fit comfortably in my Vibrams.

Due to my wearing of Vibram Five Fingers I am required to wear socks with some of my work related activities and it was either these or cut off socks which tend to roll up.

I have recently purchasedadidas Men's Climalite II 2-Pack Low Cut Sock, Shoe Size 6-12which can be cut off near the mid section and since they have an elastic type band in the middle they stay together better than regular cut off socks and don't roll up as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seem to Be Right for Skeletoes","review":"I purchased these for my son who wore his Skeletoes without socks the first time and said he needed socks.

They are a little tight but I was afraid if I got the next size up they would be swimming on him. They fit fine and snug which is probably good since you don't want a lot of extra fabric in these form fitting shoes.So far so good. They were comfortable for him to wear all day and when he first put his foot in the Skeletoes with the socks on he said, \\"That's so much better.\\"We'll see how they hold up with use and washing.

No matter how short I clip my toenails, over time one toe will cut the neighboring toe. This is avoided with the Injinji. I wear them year-round and although they are a rather thin sock, my feet are warm enough. They are moisture wicking. It takes some practice getting them on. I make sure to pull them off (gently) by the toe for washing. They are not the most durable and I've mended them at the crease and at the top of the big toe. Even with this, they are extremely comfortable and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great socks for toed shoes","review":"I bought a pair of Vibram Five-Fingers and needed some socks (my feet sweat) to wear with them. I shopped around these got some great reviews, so I finally went and got some. I wear a size 9.5 shoe (42 in Vibram) and I tried on the medium socks. They were good, but a little tall. I then tried on the small and they were perfect in height. They barely showed over my very low Vibrams. However, I noticed they put some stress on the slots between my toes. It wasn't uncomfortable, just a little distracting.For this round, I decided on the mediums and they work a little better. They are taller (just over my ankle) and the toe slots seem a little better. These socks breathe really well and keep my feet cool. May not be the best for winter since they do breathe so well, but I love them during the summer. My Vibrams were a little long and these socks help me fill them out better."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality","review":"I Ordered six pairs of this sock.

Over the last several weeks since receiving them, I've found that incidences of blisters have been diminished.When I wear socks for long periods, I find that may feet swell a little.

After wearing injinji's socks before with my previous pair, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. They were just as comfortable and well fitting.I wear my VFF BIKILA's everywhere, so having socks that excel at comfort is essential. They dry quickly, avoiding the smelly shoes that most people cringe at. Over the past 2-3 years, these things have not let me down.Only complaint would definitely have to be the price.

I wore them to my exercise class and they protected a corn I had developed between my toes. Unfortunately, one of the socks was a little bit unraveled when it arrived and got worse with each washing.

Unfortunately, this was after the 30 day return period. And they are expensive socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but a bit thicker than I had hoped for","review":"I bought these with the intent to use them for my Fila Skele-toes shoes. They work well, albeit they are a bit awkward to get on and off, but what would you expect? It took a couple runs to break in to fit in the shoes well, as the fabric is a bit too thick for use with toe shoes that are properly fitted.

This is an experience which I hope to never experience first hand, but should I ever need to ride in a boxcar, I certainly picked up plenty of tips about boarding them, the etiquette of sharing a boxcar, and how to stay warm. The risks the writer took were extreme, and I commend his parents for not dying from worry.

The song SUNGANI ANA by FIRE FAMILY BAND, though sung in Nyanja, could almost be an offering from Orchestra Super Mazembe or Les Mangelepa. The guitar duet in the second half of this track is as exquisite and heartwarming an offering you could wish for to set your spirits soaring.Languages featured include: Bemba, Mambwe, Tonga, Luvale, Lozi, and Nyanja, so don't expect to understand all the lyrics.

It was a topic I have never read about. I wish I was the boy who became the pupil of the famous cartoonist because I could become a little famous and I could draw and paint well. The character I liked best was Kiyoi because he was brave, nice, and when he got advice, he would learn from it quickly. He liked painting with charcoal, watercolors, and pastels. He always obeyed his Sensei and he never caused any trouble.

I was stunned after opening the book; the pages are made of newsprint-grade paper, and the photographs are so murky and blurred as to be near-useless. The text itself is dense and authoritative, but thoroughly dry and uninspiring.With a little attention to presentation values, this could have been a first-rate textbook, but as it stands, it isn't worth half its current asking price.

In his first Duncton triology he has moles following the faith of \\"the Word\\" as his antagonists, in this book a mole is martyred and executed as Jesus Christ was. This book, like the others in the series, makes an excellent secular fantasy read - the plot is really captivating and the prose is excellently written. However, his plagiatism and blasphemy of the Bible is inexcusable - instead of creating a relevant faith for his moles he had to go and twist the Christian faith around.

So, get ready for a few nights burning the midnight oil. The installation CD is truly a hacked together job.

Joe investigates the mystery in which nothing is what it appears to be.Cleverly's ability to capture the atmosphere of 1920's British India continues add a flavor to this book that you don't find in most mysteries.

This is the second book that I've read from this series, and I am having hard time with them. The autenthic description of the days long gone are the best part of her books. The trouble starts when her wooden characters just aren't able to carry the story. She seems like a Regency novel writer trying to switch to a more lucrative genre.

The biggest laugh of all for me in these movies was it started with vampires attending high school and then hooking up with a teenager. So to boot, these vamps are pedophiles. More unintended comedy.

Love the drama, the location where the movie was filmed,I think it's beautiful;it makes you want to travel and go where Bella and Edward pass their honeymoon.

Target was nicer but more expencive. The box is deceiving!!!! I beleived that it would be all cardboard almost like a hardcover book like all the other twilight gift sets. Not so!!! The white case you see in the picture is just hard paper almost a dustcover for the dvd thats inside which looks just like the 13 dollar dvds you see in the store. All thats \\"special\\" about this version of twilight dvd is that it comes with a fabric poster, that you can't hang with scotch tape but will have to nail to the wall or frame. Frame not included. I'm a collector and have all twilight gift sets from target and was VERY disapointed with how cheap this one was. NOT worth 40 dollars!

No deleted scenes, a handful of interviews with the actors that we have all already seen on various interviews already released. Yes, I enjoyed the making of documentary, but felt very cheated that that was all! I will really feel ripped off if they release a bunch of deleted scenes and stuff with a boxed set when all the movies are released to DVD. I can understand holding some stuff back.....but none, come on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This movie took so long to get anywhere I thought I was going to fall asleep. I actually think the first one was better and that's saying something, since it's budget was way less than this one. Maybe they should have not made it two parts, then the honeymoon wouldn't have made me so sleepy. I guess I was hopeing the films would get better, the books weren't bad, but this movie proves there not going to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the year!!","review":"The wife and I enjoyed the previous movies but this one was just total garbage!! It's as if someone handed the movie over to a bunch of 5 year olds and was like have fun! I think this is the first movie I've Red Box'd that I felt ripped off for paying $1.50. I know everyone has they're own opinion and I respect that but the fact that there are people out there that think this is good cinema scares me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"The kindest thing I can say about this film is that at least Edward looks less like a mime than before. Bella is as expressionless, dull-witted, and boring as ever. Jacob is the heart of the entire film; without him, there would be absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. The end was surprising in that (warning: spoiler) Jacob imprinted upon Bella and Edward's newborn, thus assuring her safety from the supposedly murderous wolf pack who manage to somehow come across as pretty cool even though they're supposed to be the bad guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Pissed!!!","review":"this dvd is a complete wreck, i cant see a damn thing on it.. im so upset i wasted my money on such poor quality. i am returning to get my money back. im so disappointed i love amazon but this really pissed me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borring","review":"I loved the other Twilight Movies but this one is just dull. If you ever read the book you may remember that about 75% of the book was about the wedding, the preparations, and the honeymoon. It was very drawn out with little real content unless you're into romance novels then you might have found a little more to be interested in. But to make a movie out of that book you could have thoroughly covered the entire book in a single movie. When I heard they were making this a 2 part movie I was dumbstruck as to how they would find enough content to do so. Well they did it by making lots of drawn out panoramic scenes showing dreaminess and all that you would expect out of a medium quality home wedding movie.For as bad as this movie was there's very good potential for the second movie. But this one I would say you could crop it down to 30 minutes and then you'd have a decent Breaking Dawn Part 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves this movie.","review":"My wife really loves this movie.

Awful.

Really?","review":"I'm pretty bummed about this version, the special additions to this package do not include any extended scenes, outtakes, or deleted scenes.I don't think the promoters of the Twilight Saga truly understand the fans will buy the movie, on a simple disc with nothing else on it without marking it as Special Edition which insinuates there's something special, or different than the ordinary version?About the movie itself I give the MOVIE 5 *'s I think it's awesome. For those who hate it remember this is HALF the book. So we only got half the story it's a huge cliffhanger all that's missing is the ....to be continued at the end.

I could not follow the plot. So many speed bumps and detours. The other twilight movies carried me, they flowed with true thirst quenching heroic tales of passion,action,and romance.

I'm pretty sure that's all you can ask for in this situation.If we were doing movie reviews I would give this 4 stars or two thumbs WAY up. It's an awful movie if you really break it down into the normal movie reviewing categories, but IF you consider the fact that this is NO ordinary movie and shouldn't be judged on superficial things like \\"cinematography\\" or \\"acting then you have yourself a timeless piece of movie history.In all seriousness, I love the shiz out of these movies in spite of their awfulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twilight Saga-Breaking Dawn Part 1","review":"Had difficulty with the DVD in loading the movie.

When you have great shows like Buffy or Angel or True Blood or Vampire Diaries, the bar is set high. So when I saw this movie and others, I have to say, I was bored with the script. All the drab acting by the three leads and the horrible action set pieces.I know little girls or Big girls who think this is a good romance movie but all you have to do is watch one of the above Vampire shows to see that this and the other Twilight movies are made for people who do not like intricate plotting and love glittery vampires. This like Pirates of the Caribbean and those hideous Transformer movies are over-bloated messes that makes tons of money.Of course, this does not mean it is good because it makes a lot of money.Challenge yourself people and stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies Ever","review":"SOoooooooooooo boring, a shameless copycatting of Deathly Hallows and Avatar.

The bad is usually the excessive amount of cheesy romance and the stalkerish way that Edward treats Bella and the good is, of course, the awesome vampire action as they deal with whatever threat is the latest to come Bella's way.This movie was different. It seems that the directors and producers have finally found a way to bring the best of both worlds together. There was enough romance to make even a guys eyes tear but enough action to hold our interest through the whole thing. This movie was amazing. Well written, well directed, well acted. If this is what Twilight can be then I am truly sad to see the series coming to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great movie","review":"I was really disappointed in this latest edition to this series. It was just a so, so movie and at times actually seemed kind of boring. I have all the previous movies and liked each one of them, but this one is bad.

I highly DO NOT recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The others were so good but this movie was quite disappointing.

Anyway, this is a Twilight review, and here it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I wasn't \\"over the moon\\" with it but did enjoy it nonetheless. I didn't have to pause and do something else and come back to it. Plus i wanted to catch up so I can see the latest one out now. Overall, good movie, nice continuation of previous movies. For those that desire lots of action then you won't see that here - it's much more centered around character driven stories, love story and where that leads them.

I enjoyed the special effects and the action but this movie was just outright depressing. I couldn't help but wonder if the actors are wondering \\"When does this end...I need to move on\\". If you're home on a Friday night and want to know what happens with the rest of this saga, then watch it but don't expect to walk away \\"satisfied\\".

The acting is very good and Rob Pattenson is his usual sexy self, this is the first time he has to struggle at something without Bella at his side, but all works out well. If you love the other movies, you'll love this one too. The only thing was there were only a couple bruises, what's the big deal? For him to be so upset they could've marked her up a little more. The sex scenes were sweet and tastefully done, love it when he moans! But why did the other vampires stop hunting when she comes home pregnant? Just remember its a modern fairy tale and go with the flow and you'll enjoy this movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"My collection is almost complete. It was very hard finding the right dvd version that is similar to borders' twilight and new moon. It is what I thought it was. And what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"I have loved all the films in the 'Twilight' series. This one is amazing!! I am excited for the final film in the series...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This DVD it's something that every twilighter need to have and The gift set it's just perfect, I really fell that I have a part of The Wedding of The year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is the best of the series to date. The acting has gotten better and the storyline is exciting. Getting better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My god our culture is being destroyed.","review":"This is the kind of stuff that makes you think our cultures are killing off the last bastion of good taste. This stuff is reprehensible day time soap garbage. Not a damn thing worth saying here except that people who yearn for this stuff and live for it need to be dumped on an island. Cull the herd. I cannot even believe this is what is popular with kids today. Why? Because marketing, TV, and whatever the hell else have convinced these morons that this is what they want and need. Never has their been a time of worst taste in the mainstream except the mid 80s. Never. Even then it was forgivable as the decade was pretty much lost anyway. We should know better. The TV has inundated people with this stuff and their minds are so vacant and susceptible that they think these kinds of films and books are somehow any good. The acting is awful, the direction pitiful, and the whole thing just reeks of cold-hearted sleaze."},{"rating":"1","title":"So unbelievably bad","review":"I was shocked by how the tone in this installment had shifted. It is almost as if the director was out to make fun of the film he was creating. The wedding toasts, really? Gah! Embarrassing to watch. The dialog was stilted and the acting was soap opera'ish'. Poor Taylor Lauten seems to have been given the worst direction. What happened to the breath taking scenery? Even the scenes shot on the honeymoon were nothing special. Parts of the film looked like a television series while others, most notably Edward and Bella leaving in the Volvo for the honeymoon, looked like a car commercial. I really hope the second installment is better but if shot the same time as the first, there is little hope for improvement. What a shame. This whole series could have been something spectacular if one great director had stepped up to helm all of the installments, like Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings films."},{"rating":"1","title":"oooops","review":"I had waited to see this movie, had a little time, got all ready to watch, and it would not download. Tried several times-no luck. Still waiting to see movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I should have listened to all of those who read the book and said how disappointed and pissed they were and should've never watched the movie. Despite of all the warnings, I still went ahead and watched it, I guess because of all the anticipation. Let me start by saying, Breaking Dawn was a disappointment in so many levels. The reason I fell in love with the series was because it was so romantic and magical...there was not much of that in Breaking Dawn.I'm just pissed with how much Edward and Bella changed, the wedding, the honeymoon, the pregnancy (according to Meyer this could not happen). Thanks Stephanie Meyer for killing all my imagined magic this Sage might once held for me...The baby's name: Renesmee!! And then Jacob imprinting on her. I felt sick.I have never been so let down by a movie. This was a total betrayal of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two guys one girl.","review":"The point of this whole story is how important it is to have a weird boyfriend. I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my wife, and decided that its not that I \\"just don't get it\\". No, I get it completely. They tell of a girl that has it better than most middle class families. She is having a magical adventure, that if it wasn't for the sex this movie would only be for preteen girls. But all of this is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking Dawn","review":"I was not impressed with this installment, and the ending was just blah!! they could have made this more exciting. I bought the movie and I'm going to return it and buy it used. the wedding scene was nice, but the movie went downhill after that, I was really looking forward to the scene with the Volturi and it was not in the movie!!. I hope the next saga is much better than this crap they churned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"This movie is absolutely terrible. The worst one they have made so far. ***Spoiler Alert*** The wedding scene is brutal, the honeymoon scene is weird, the birth scene is grotesque, and the werewolf council is laughable. Not that this movie storyline is believable, but getting lost in this story is not even an option (and I think it was in the previous movies). They have a chance for redemption in Part II, lets see if it comes to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've ever seen","review":"I enjoyed the book and I really tried to like this film, but I really think this was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was slow and choppy. The director for this installment is not a great storyteller. The low point was the talking wolves, and the high point was when the credits rolled because the film was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a true Twilight fan, it was hard for me to come away from this movie and admit disappointment. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing - or, should I say, WASN'T seeing.

I would recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made sense to split to 2 movies","review":"Did a good job with dividing the book into 2 movies and taking the key pieces. One of the better movies in the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true vampire movie! Epic fail!","review":"Okay, let me sum this up for you people out there. One, vampires do not glitter in the day light! Second, vampires are not emos/preps. Third, vampire movies do not get their music from teeny bopper bands!!! Fourth, anytime you have a different director for each movie, the next movie will show the same mistakes as the last one. There is no consistent leadership. Fifth, if the vampires in a movie don't scare or intimidate you, it equals FAILURE!!!!! Lastly, a real vampire movie would be \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", \\"Fright Night\\" or \\"Nosferatu\\" (which are true classics of vampire movies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kristen Stewart","review":"This girl has absolutely no talent whatsoever.

No acting, just empty words.Must be for the younger stupid impressionable kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"as if there is not enough lameness out there. see the way i know about this my sister gots the movies. and what let me get this straight a lame actress married a lame actor. there in no point. to it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"just....awful","review":"After suffer all the twilight movies (so far) for my wife (she insist on go the movies and watch this..things..) i can say, with all honesty, this saga is one of the worst craps i see on film.There are only two ways to watch this, one is laughing loud of how awful this is, the other is seeing thru the eyes of a thirteen years old girl.I dont see how this movies making money, i just depressing. Now, if you want a few laughs about a bad movie, super creppy (sort of handsome) young actors, really misoginist script and you really really hate womens, this is your movie. Dosnt hurt if you really hate vampires too, because this movie really take all a vampire should be and turn them into the gayiest people on earth, really any creature of the night must be ashame of been in any way related to this travesty. Anyway, a movie is as good as is screenplay, and in this case, the lack of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"...sigh","review":"This is movie is so bad that's it embarrassing to watch. I was sitting there with my friends and having to laugh at the HORRIBLE dialogue, the lack of face expressions and the pretty lame graphics. And for two people who are \\"soul mates\\", they sure are awkward around each other. The chemistry is forced and most of the scenes don't make sense. There is no flow and if you didn't read the book you'd be confused (just like in New Moon and Eclipse). The book Breaking Dawn was pretty bad but the movie is just a joke. It makes money because it's Twilight. Hot guys, Romeo and Juliet love, vampires... people eat such things up. But there really is nothing special about the story and it takes what's awesome about vampires out of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn movies have better plots","review":"All the girls that find this series makes them wet down under will all die alone surrounded by cats.

Good Lord, if not for the pervy old ladies sitting behind me doing their own Mystery Science Theatre 300, I woud have slept through it. Bella was not the least bit happy on her wedding day. I thought she was supposed to be over-the-moonin ove with Edward. Then, an eternity of pointless filler later, Jacob had become a pedophile. Why did his pack kill him for that and why didn't Bella or Edward do something about it other than being proud? I have to admit watching Bella get slowly killed was the only interesting thing. What is it with Stephanie Meyers and ruin great buid up with stupid little things such as the \\"imprinting\\"? Would it have been so bad for a bloody battle scene or hey maybe some sexual tension between the stars? Why is gorey violence okay but not pg-13 sensuality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"-10 stars","review":"a bent and twisted book put to film. rotten acting and screenplay. meyers world is a joke. the only reason this movie made money is because the education system has gone down the toilet and people cant read anything complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the previous movies","review":"I simply thought it was lacking in many ways.

No wonder our children are bringing guns to schools and shooting people. Because their ignorant parents let them watch this smut. Growing up in a deluted liberal world where killing people is the cool thing to do. This is so much more offensive then hard core porn. Edward finds some secret powers that let him speak to the devil baby. Bella feels much better after a blood milkshake. Then she dies, but Eddie saves her by biting her all over her body? Wedding bullcrap, although I'm sure I would like it if I was a fourteen year old girl. lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was very disappointed with the prop flowers. I had expected actual flowers preserved inside an acrylic block. What I got was a cheap plastic flower that can be purchased at any Michael's Crafts sandwiched between two sheets of plastic. It is completely tacky looking. No wonder they don't show a picture of this; I would never have spent the extra money had I known it would be so tacky. Way to disappoint and gouge money from the fans, Summit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing saw it in the theater 3 times!","review":"The movie was the best so far.

I find them to be all have great qualities in different ways if you expect from them what they are - fun, campy and fantasy, however, I could not have been more dissapointed in the Breaking Dawn movie - lacking in romance, the long awaited sex scene was a yawn, so much of the book was just missing and it was so disjointed it left me with an empty feeling! Can we have a do-over?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC","review":"I love True Blood, Vampire Diaries, and many other vampire movies and series, but for the life of me I cannot like this movie. It's pathetic. The acting is at most, marginal, but the wolf isn't that bad. At least he's trying. But the two main characters are so stilted, wooden, and bland, it kills the movie.

Not ashamed to admit it.I watched the movies and liked them too. Except for this one. I don't know what happened. The story line while pretty exciting in the book was just so boooring and drawn out. The acting while never Oscar worthy was especially bad in this one, unfortunately you kinda have to watch it in order to follow the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Features - disappointing","review":"I am a Twilight Saga fan and like this movie. The special features were disappointing - no deleted scenes etc. I understand that there are different releases of this DVD ie the one with Bella's dress as the case cover which may have different special features. Don't want to have to purchase the same movie 3-4 times just the get the all the special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the first movie look like GONE WITH THE WIND!","review":"The TWILIGHT series is definitely a guilty pleasure -- at least, the first three books are, and the first three movies are at least fun, in a \\"this is really stupid on screen\\" way. I only WISH this had been so bad it was funny; I can always use a good laugh. But the movie BREAKING DAWN commits the worst sin there is for a movie: it's BORING. The wedding takes half an hour, the honeymoon seemed to take forever (and not in a good way), and the rest of it -- well, aside from counting the number of times the werewolves' ears flopped over (they do, really), it was so dull I kept falling asleep. Maybe I can save it and the forthcoming Part 2 for those nights when Sominex just doesn't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring","review":"I tried to watch \\"Breaking Dawn Part 1\\", but the movie was so boring, I had to fast-forward through it.

However, I'm NOT a fan of this movie series because the characters look so cheesy. Movies often look this way when they try to bring an author's world into reel world.In this movie, the wolves still look like computer animations being pasted on a green movie screen and still look unrealistic. Lead actress Kristen Stewart exercises her facial muscles more often than usual, she smiles a little more than usual, makes more noise, and she seems to say more words! Bravo! Good job, Kris. Not that she was too quiet before, but somehow that Bella character demeans the actress herself...

I'm sure when they release part two they'll give us some extras. I don't mind paying again it's worth it to be able to watch this one now any time I like. I think Bill Condon did great.

Has no ambition, is superbly whinnying, and not to mention...extremely selfish. It is wrong to blame Bella though; the character was created by an untalented author. The story has no substance or imagination, and is more or less centered on impatient, aimless and cranky teenagers. It is an attempted love story, which wasn't convincing by any standards. I read the first novel and couldn't bring myself to read the others. Movies were worst. And this latest installment is an atrocity. There is nothing epic about this series; it is dead as a rock (or Edward). It could have been completed in 30 minutes.

The books are always a million times better than the movies. I think it would be worth it to have five parts to this movie just so it could be more accurate to the book. Of course some hate he books but I really enjoyed reading them. If you hate the books then you are just a Twilight hater so this review does apply to you at all. If you really enjoyed the movie then I beg you to read the book because you are really missing out. I loved the series of books much more than the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you thought it couldn't get worse...","review":"I can suspend disbelief like a champ, but for this movie you have to suspend a lot more than disbelief.The whole series has been a public service announcement for abstinence and against pre-marital sex, but as soon as you're married violent sex is okay, I guess. Getting rough in the heat of passion is one thing, but leaving bruises is unacceptable in my book. Then comes the part that really stretches disbelief. We know Edward's skin is cold to the touch because he is DEAD after all... never mind how Bella could stand making love to a man cold as a corpse, or have part of that cold corpse inside her vagina and remain aroused... the unbelievable part is that she becomes pregnant from the encounter!We have to assume that Edward's spermatozoa remained alive for over a hundred years inside his body after his death."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!","review":"Bad Movie, bad acting ... !

Ok, I cringed through most of all the twilight movies. Eclipse and New Moon were so boring that they were forgettable (I don't really remember if they were about anything). This installment at least has a lot of weird and memorable things happening. Again, cringe inducing, and some of it, just outright laughable and campy. There *is* an element in the Twilight movies that is titillating, I'll admit that (it's one of the reasons why I feel like checking them out). But they're also amazingly petty and immature.The one thing I would've LOVED (and still HOPE for) from this installment is a commentary track by Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.

Perhaps this should be renamed to Twilight: Breaking Hymn (did I spell that correctly? *cough*), since it was a naughty song of love. The moon through yonder window did break, and its light in and out of the window did shine, all night long, until the bird cried out in the morning, \\"coo! coo!\\" And if you think that's hot, then you'll thrill to the glacial pacing of this epic nuptial that remains frozen in time, like Edward's icy and tumescent love for Bella."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB MOVIE !","review":"This movie is crap!

I think it was a big mistake to turn the final installation in the series into two separate films (obviously just to increase revenue). I found the ending of Part I to be an odd and disappointing place to cut away. The author knew what she was doing when she wrote the books and it was a travesty what the filmakers did to destroy it in this way. I was left very disappointed by this film.

This is called Chain immigration of course.I learned a lot about how easy it is for immigrants to come here.I would say that none of them made any attempt to intergrate into the dominant culture,they stayed in their own segregrated world( by choice) and murdered those close to them.This is what diversity is and I recommend that people go to Numbersusa dot com and find out how to limit immigration"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real police procedural","review":"Even if you aren't a fan of the police procedural novel, in which every detail of police work is explained, this true-life piece of reporting may prove engrossing because it reveals what really goes on in murder investigations. The author gets into what makes good detectives good and also what makes them different from one another. Although the members of the special homicide unit may dress pretty much alike on the job, they are widely divergent in their personal tastes and backgrounds. It's easy to consider the LA police force as an homogeneous group, but this book reminds us that no two people are alike.

These are familar enough that you can pick them up easily if you regularly do dance workouts. It's highly energetic and fun, and the instructor is charming and a great dancer to emulate. PLus unlike other dance videos (Madonna Grimes) it's long enough to get the cardio benefits you seek on tyour cardio days. I'm also a big fan of Dance with Julianne- Cardio Ballroom, Dancing with the Stars- Dance off the Pounds; Core Rhythms also has some energetic longer dance workouts.

Mostly the book has detailed descriptions of castles or land or other frivolities - I skipped pages of that sort of stuff - and little character interaction.It also ties everything up in pretty wrapping paper and a big bow. Come on, life is not like that! Even in fairy tales someone loses, and in this book no one loses, everyone ends up with what they want.It took me 4 hours to read this book.

I think it center way too much on the marriage. After the 3rd or 4th times Kurtz stated why Kelson was marrying Araxie, it became annoying. It took up to 100 pages before Kelson set off to Torenth, which I know could have progress faster from reading Kurtz earlier works. The action was definitely lacking, and the political intrigue not fully developed. This book definitely was not written to par with the other in the series. What a disappointment :_("},{"rating":"1","title":"No excuse for this!","review":"A profound disappointment. This book reads more like an outline for a good series (say 3 novels). The story/plots moved way too fast and were shallow---very shallow. I am, frankly, surprised. Ms. Kurtz is an awesome story-teller. Can't imagine why she would turn out such work unless she was busy writing something else at the same time. I was hoping for King Kelson's Bride to be the first in a new series.

But King Kelson's Bride left me bereft, sad. Morgan and Duncan are barely recognizable, when they do show up at all. Maybe because I'm over the age of 40 now, but teenage angst irks me. If I wanted a romance novel I'd have bought a romance novel.I'm hoping, praying, that Miss Kurtz will rejuvenate her beloved (our beloved) characters of old in her next novel.

The undying love for rothana, and the budding romance with arexie turned my stomach, not to mention the sticky sweet scene with the children. The attempt to bring Derry back as a the great character he was in the first kelson series accomplished little more than rehashing an old plotline. i was disappointed.

They had not changed or grown in those years. I got very tired of mopey Kelson, when his emotions felt contrived to begin with.Things that felt resolved in previous books were miraculously unresolved in this one. Rules about magic that have been previously declared inviolable were suddenly questionable. A lot of the intrigue felt like it was there solely for the sake of intrigue.I did like some of the parts of this book and it has opened the world a little more for further Deryni education and informational quests. I also liked the development of Jehanna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointly Dull","review":"This book is dissapointingly unlike Kurtz's other Deryni novels.

That, or was just a contractual obligation and she didn't really want to write it? The earlier Deryni novels are much better written, and this one does not come up to the same standard. Kurtz's previous Deryni novels are like stepping into a whole other world. This one is a lot like stepping into a tired and trite romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go for it.","review":"Fascinating.this offering from Kurtz reads fine as a stand alone novel.How can I mention, without sounding soppy, that I cried for CHAPTERS of this book? You will find yourself so deeply involved with the characters that tears are inevitable, but it is not a particularly tragic book. As I had not read the previous books for some while, I found myself more in sympathy with Kelsons proposed bride, than his \\"one true love and soulmate later revealed not to be so true or so souly\\".So although in parts it leaves you dry throated and wet eyed, it has moments of glorious triumph and humor.You have to read it, if you haven't already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual excellence","review":"It seems I waited forever to be able to purchase and read a copy of KING KELSON'S BRIDE...and boy, was I disappointed! The characters didn't seem as rich and full and vibrant as they had been in Katherine's previous novels. Morgan and Duncan, especially, were quite pale in comparison to their former selves in other novels, and even Kelson didn't seem to have much of a spark at times. The talk of all the royal marriages confused me after a while--I couldn't keep track of who was to wed whom. I liked the fact that Jehana has started to live again, rather than continuing to sequester herself away and be so morbid and angry all the time. All in all, I was quite unsatisfied by the time I finished the book, especially as I've feasted on the literary wonders from Katherine in the past and was expecting more of the same. Maybe her SECOND novel in this series will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little, Too Long in Coming","review":"After waiting since 1986 for Kurtz to return to Kelson and the plot threads left hanging in \\"The Quest for Saint Camber\\", this book was a disappointment. Instead of following up on the quest for Camber, Kelson gets married. Granted, after the tragedy of Rothana, Kelson deserves some happiness, but this book felt rushed, almost as if Kurtz decided to stop writing Deryni novels all together and wrapped things up in one fell swoop. Kurtz has shown that she has a knack for tragedy, notably in \\"King Javan's Year\\", and the previous series on Kelson tended to mix in a good part of that. If she continues this into a trilogy, let's hope she gets back to what she's good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthy sequel","review":"Katherine Kurtz doesn't seem to have had her heart in the Deryni books for many years. This book, which was written and then \\"left hanging\\" (sans sequel), seems to prove it. Compared to the subtle plot twists, action, and adventure of earlier books, the plot is fascile and the pace is slow.Fans of the Deryni books will probably read this volume anyway, eager for anything new on the topic. They will then endure a recap of events they vaguely remember from books read over a decade ago. Following this, all the characters talk and talk about who King Kelson will marry. Then they talk about talking about it. After the inevitable \\"surprise Deryni ancestry\\" revelations, the usual pack of fanatics and evil Deryni will try and thwart the wedding and will be defeated. Then King Kelson will marry the woman who was discussed and discussed.I was so excited that I decided not to wait another long span of years for another volume and gave up on KK after 30 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Night Walker....not so good","review":"This is the first book by Hamilton I have read. Despite wanting to love this book, it just wasn't very good. The plot is simple, the characters are weak, and the conclusion is, well, hard to believe. After reading the book, I felt as though it was a waste of time. There was nothing memorable or redeeming (or suspenseful, for that matter) about the book. I'm going to try some of his other works to get a more balanced view. Perhaps this was simply not his best piece of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Case Crime's weakest reprint yet","review":"While it's understandable that Hard Case Crime would eventually want to reprint a Hamilton novel due to his great successes in and out of the mystery field, Night Walker is just not up to par with previous titles in the publisher's catalogue.The story is slow, full of tremendous leaps in logic, and has areas of such lengthy exposition that the book grinds to a total standstill several times. The villain's explanation at the end of the novel, tying up every loose end of the plot, goes on page after page after page. The book also features a southern belle who starts nearly every bit of her dialogue with \\"Well, I declare!\\" Think I'm kidding? Count it up yourself, I bet she's got at least 100 \\"I declares!\\" in there. That's not characterization, it's just sloppy writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow-going soft-boiled novel","review":"The excellent, gripping first chapter of NIGHT WALKER is sadly the best part of the book. The tale slows down considerably and shifts into a rather muddled mess afterward. A Navy officer is called back to active duty and gets a ride while hitchhiking only to be attacked by his presumed samaritan. With a battered, bandaged face he is forced to play the role of his attacker, a ruse he goes along with for no good reason other than the fact that he just doesn't want to go back into the military.A vague mystery unfurls as he's drawn into a web of deceit by his \\"wife\\", a nefarious doctor, and his innocent neighbor who suspects the truth but doesn't know what to do about it. There's some hooey about communists, drop-off points for Washington attaches, and other dubious plot points, but the worst is the psychological hokum used to explain away a major contrivance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good","review":"So far this is my least favorite of the Hard Case Crime books that I've read (of 12, I believe).

It, or something similar, should be included with the base unit. At $35.00 it is a RIP OFF! You're paying more than half the price of an all-steel jack for a piece of plastic. I'm sure it's durable but the company should be ashamed of itself for charging so much extra for a safety item.

I don't like to take over-the-counter meds all the time (usually acetaminophen) and I refuse to use any prescription pain killers to be able to sleep. This knee strap helps relieve both knee and foot pain that I have been able to sleep most of the time without taking any meds. I sometimes use it while walking and it has helped relieve that pain too and support my knee well. The top strap tends to slide down a lot, but the bottom strap has never slipped. It needs some sort of side supports to help keep the top strap in place.

Therefore, Engstrom's writing and creativity were a pleasant surprise. She's very good at creating mood and (reader)empathy with her words. The plot moves along at a steady and interesting pace. For me, the highlight of the book was Enid's mipulation of Andrew in order to get money for her sons' education. The writing surrounding this plot element is fantastic(humorous too)! As far as the story, my only disappointment is no detailed recreation of the murders. I thought this would be a bigger part of the book but was only afforded a few sentences. Big letdown for me after waiting 300+ pages for the main event. Overall, though, I'd recommend this book and give it 4 stars for a job very well done. I look forward to reading another one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For the Serious Borden Enthusiast","review":"I picked up this book one day while looking for a study on the Borden case. It was only after I started reading it that I realized it was fiction. The book kept my interest and I read it through. The author definitely researched the subject, offering an analysis of the characters and living arrangements of the Borden household. But for someone like me who wanted to learn more about the history of the crime, a novel will not do. From Lizzie's odd relationship with her father to her sexual experimentation, it is a very disturbing account. Engstrom's version of the crime itself, I'll warn you, is very homoerotic. It was a little much for my tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liz the lez","review":"This novel is similar to Evan Hunter's \\"Lizzie\\" in that Lizzie is portrayed as having lezzie tendencies. In the Hunter book, she goes off to Europe to have a lesbian affair with a wealthy and amoral Englishwoman, while in this book she has a lesbian affair with Bridget, the maid. As has already been pointed out, Lizzie is over-sympathetically portrayed here. Overall, I rather enjoyed it.David Rehakauthor of \\"Did Lizzie Borden Axe For It?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting read","review":"Having been like alot of you, I've been fascinated with Lizzie Borden since Elizabeth Montgomery so aptly portrayed her in the movie. The movie, like the actual case, left us with many unanswered questions. Ms. Engstrom has cleverly filled in the missing parts of the story. According to the author, she has done much research of the case, therefore, her rendering is fairly believable. Do I believe everything she endeavored to answer? No. But her attempts are plausible. I would like to know what facts she discovered to reach her conclusions and what are really facts and what is the author's imagination. If you are interested in this bizzare case, you will enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing read","review":"I really loved this book. I was really interested and really famillar with the Lizzie Borden case way before I had even heard of this book. I hadn't even thought that there was a fictional book written about her. I went searching one day and I bought this book. I couldn't put the book down it was so interesting. I read it non stop for three days and when I was finished I was exausted from not sleeeping, but I was satisfied. Plus if you like suprise endings you'll love the ending in this book. I heard some where that there is three parts to a story, a beginning a climax and an ending. Ms. Engstrom's book has a beginning a climax and another climax/ending.

The arms are very solid so she can push up and stand,and the chair is ample and stable. I have not seen it since I shipped it to my mother out of state. Her two comments were the color is more of a rich burgandy(I thought it was pink) and the assembly was quite time consuming. My brother had to purchase additional hardware to assemble since it was not included in the package. After hours of effort, the chair was assembled and now is quite useful to my mother. It is heavy, so it needs to be located in one place( she had hoped to use it at the dining room table also but it cannot be lugged around easily)so she has it in her living room.Overall the quality, price and free shipping made this an attractive chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not by a long shot","review":"This isn't a greatest hits collection.

Already a lover of flamenco, this was my introduction to music of Morocco, which eventually became an early focus of my studies. It was hardly a gross fusion, being Andalusian, if separated by a few centuries and influences. Juan Peña, El Lebrijano, was a major gypsy flamenco singer whose voice was not rough, as many, but rich and smooth yet passionate. The Arabo-Andalusian orchestra of Tangier is a well recognized performing ensemble of la classical suites and unique in including a woman vocalist. Together in this album, they weave Spanish and popular Moroccan tunes and language into perfect arrangements that are lively, danceable, and joyous. Brightly recorded, the album feels much too short, and we want it to go on and on. Welcome to the Kasbah; the exchange of musical idioms here has a long tradition. This is an excellent recording pure and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing range","review":"This introduction to world religions is lucid and clear, but does not short change the reader with over-simplifications.

She is one of the greatest poets of all time, and should be read by everyone who loves poetry (and even those who don't).That said, this is a terrible edition. I was shocked when I opened it in a bookstore, looking to show a friend one of her poems I had just been talking about, to discover that the punctuation had been completely modified. The meanings of some of her best poems hinge on varying interpretations of Dickinson's eccentric punctuation, and to change it seems to me one of the great crimes against poetry. I am especially disappointed because Modern Library normally puts out such excellent editions, but this one is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanitized Emily","review":"Emily Dickinson is a genius and great poet, but this isn't the way to experience her work. Dickinson's distinctive punctuation and capitalization are \\"corrected\\"; the effect is maybe a smoother read but one far less rich in implications and possibilities. The division of the poems employed here , and in many of the older collections (\\"Life,\\" \\"Nature,\\" \\"Love,\\" \\"Time and Eternity\\") are not Dickinson's, and are not very useful in experiencing the poems. In my opinion, this volume omits many of Emily's best poems and includes some of her least interesting/ daring. Of course, there can be many varying opinions as to what Emily's best work was, but since all of her poems are collected in one manageable volume there's no need to let someone else decide that for you. As another reviewer has said, the Johnson \\"Complete Poems\\" volume is what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good drug store self tanner - But Beware the Glitter","review":"I tried this self tanner because the Jergens gradual tanning lotion just did not work for me. I tan easily when I go into the sun, but I am attempting to stay out of the sun and keep my skin healthy. This worked on the first application for me and I noticed a subtle difference right away. Beware, there is glitter in this self-tanner. I find that it helps in the application but at the same time I hate wearing glitter. So for me, I only use this in the evening after showering, since I always shower in the morning. This does not rub off on sheets and with showering in the morning I can get the glitter off and not look like I'm going out to the club. Love this self tanner. Its still a bit expensive for drug-store but it has lasted long enough to where I feel like I got my moneys worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"This product works beautifully. I have tried more expensive tanners that were more than twice the price that did not provide the rich color that this does. The color is even with absolutely no streaks. It wears off evenly in about 5-7 days. The color is a nice bronze color for my pale freckly skin tone. Absolutely no orange tint even if I apply it two days in a row. It dries quickly with no color transfer to my clothes even though I only wait a few minutes to get dressed. The only drawback is that is contains these little sparkly specks that some people might not like, but it goes away after your first shower. Would buy this over the more expensive brands any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only self-tanner I use","review":"I have been buying this product for years. I am actually fair skinned but find that if I apply it infrequently it lasts a couple of weeks and gives a nice glow to my chicken-white legs.

The tint really helps you to see where it is streaky or missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too glittery","review":"I cannot comment on the tan this product may or may not give, as I am instantly turned off by the glitter! I thought maybe it would wear off, but hours later I am still sparkling.

The glitter/shimmer does wash off, but of course you have to wait until the color's completely developed (I wait until the next morning). Product has a nice scent, as opposed to the usual chemical scent most have. It's sticky until it dries, but it does dry quickly and the color is great, and non-streaky if you've prepped your skin and applied correctly. Very natural color, I initially used it just on my legs and when I went into work the next day, several people asked me if I'd been laying out in the sun - the color is very natural on me, in artifical and in sunlight. I will buy this again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"The old formula back in the day, say sometime around 2005 was great- It never streaked and looked pretty natural-This stuff glitters and streaks and looks fake as the day is long. It also wears off in flakes and looks worse and worse as time goes on. I suspect this has to do with it having Vitamin E in it which causes skin to exfoliate.. Exfoliate before you tan, not after!

Yes, of course, they are falling in love.The movie flashes between the present day & the 1920's Gatsby-like setting of the novel. The problem is they are all too aware that this is happening.

The story ends up reflecting Alex's real life, as he falls for Emma but still has feelings for a more glamorous woman.In short, the story moves so slowly I wanted to stick a cattle prod into the TV, and there were so many formulaic and predictable twists, my eyes are still rolled into the back of my head.Unless you are a big fan of either of the main characters, I advise you to keep your distance from this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shock! Pocketbook More Powerful than some PDA program","review":"Tarascon Pocket Orthopaedica initially looks like another attempt at fitting both useful and trivia information (which the bosses seemed to always ask even though its trivia) in your pocket; except it IS thin and small enough for most pockets and it is full of ORGANISED data.While certainly not for exams or sorts, I use it for the 5 minutes break in between cases and a quick lookup on anatomical stuff (I really like the muscle lists).

Julia Stiles was the all-American hottie and the scenes filmed in Europe were excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous!","review":"Thumbs Up for both movies! I'm a sucker for romantic fairy tales and this two movies tops all. Luke Mably is drop dead gorgeous and he look every inch the prince that he portrays.

Julia Stiles did a fine job. But there were a number of flaws. How could Julia Stiles get picked out of the crowd by everyone when she first goes to Denmark and then later at the Princes' coronation as the new King, after she's been there a few weeks, she can just slip away in the crowd and nobody even notices her?

Julia and Luke had the best on screen chemistry I've seen in a girly, chick-flick in a long time. They lit the screen and brought their romance to life for me and I just absolutely fell in love with this movie.

First, the actor is younger than the actress. second, the actor is much more beautiful than the actress. The two could play an older sister with her younger brother. I just cannot image the two could be together. They don't look like a match made by heaven. Also, I don't see how Eddie started to fall in love with Morgan. The two lack chemstry.

Then again, there are more exciting things to do in life,... such as watch the grass grow, watch the paint dry,... you get the idea.I can not say it was that bad, but it was certainly not a comedy, or drama, or anything else.

Not where I live. I mean, they could have chosen from about ten other midwestern states if all they wanted was that 'naive farm girl meets big-city boy' feel (which is lame and predictable, by the way).I like Julia Stiles, and the young man was okay, but getting the local stuff wrong was a turnoff, and it really kind of took me out of the movie.Tsk tsk."},{"rating":"1","title":"See below I cannot play this DVD on my DVD player","review":"I cannot review this DVD as I cannot play it on myDVD player.

Every page is painted with oil colors. cool stuff.side note: Volume 2 ( i think it's vol. 2) has some curious censorship happening. Someone has gone through and placed a mesh shirt over a woman's exposed breasts. It's so badly done it makes me wonder how Segrelles must feel to see this.

Well, seems like every set designer/costumer wants to let us know what time it REALLY is. While this rags-to-riches story is set in Depression-era hollywood, its visual aesthetic lives in the future. Imagine Shirley Temple in go-go boots, mod nickers, and a leather Oliver Twist cap, and you've got a good idea of what to expect. Bouncing off the lip-glossed-over plot are startling performances by Robert Redford (for once he's a bad boy) and Ruth Gordon (she's not so cuddly here, either). A mature Natalie Wood not only goes from rags to riches, she goes from pre-teenhood to washed-up adulthood in one frenetic, teary-eyed swoop. Particularly striking is this dark musical's number, \\"The Circus is a Wacky World.\\" Clowns and nickers galore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD of Daisy Please","review":"Inside Daisy Clover was Natalie Wood's best effort, but the truly amazing performance in this movie is Christopher Plummer's portrait of the powerful, imperious movie mogul Raymond Swann.

I still keep the VHS version even though I no longer have a VCR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible movie!","review":"I HATE this film! Usually I love Natalie Wood movies, but I absolutely hate this one. Bad corny plot, unusually bad acting by usually great actors, and the music and dialog did not fit a film that is supposed to be taking place in the 1930's. I saw this years ago and disliked it then. It was on tv a few days ago and thought I'd give it another chance,but I couldn't even get through the whole thing before turning it off. I can't believe so many reviewers liked this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Above Daisy Clover","review":"This film, about the struggle of a young star movie to mantain her personality against Hollywood cruelty, will probably gives you a headache (and not a \\"HEARTACHE!, as it says one character), as it fastly turns on a bombastic, hopelessly phony melodrama.The problem around \\"Inside Daisy Clover\\" is its superficiality, that makes its characters a little more than mere caricatures. It has good moments, really fascinating ideas, but the general tone is fastidiously icy.Natalie Wood, performing a young talent (such a mix among Judy Garland and herself), gives an often exaggerated performance. However, she's always a lovely presence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Daisy Clover","review":"Fantastic movie one of the best movies of Natalie Woods films if you liked This Property Condemned you will truly enjoy owning this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandra D Rates The Classics","review":"Although I am a true admirer of Natalie Wood, I do believe that this movie diminishes her amazing talent. She was in her mid-to-late twenties when she decided to play the unfortunate, child-star, typecast role. As an adult actress, she should have declined the role of a young teenager in this movie. It was poorly written and not interesting -- to say the least. Love Natalie Wood, but dislike the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"Lets you proceed at your own pace.

You have to back up and watch it a couple of times in order to do them correctly. Example, they are telling you and showing you the movement and you have to move your feet, but they are showing the people from the waist up.The positive...very thorough, calming, they explain everything, why you do the moves, etc. The Chi Gung section is very good. The entire video is sectioned into chapters that you can skip to once you learn all the moves fluidly, that is nice.I do recommend this video for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balancing the emotions and developing awareness","review":"This exercise helps you balance emotions: fear/willpower, anger/focus, nervousness/joy, worry/connectedness, grief/confidence; and helps you quiet your ego (as defined by Eckhart Tolle's, Power of Now) and experience awareness with compassion, maturity of mind and emotions, and vigor.

I bought this tape, because it's for beginners, (me), and wanted to give it a shot. First of all, Mr. Carradine is so devoted and takes his art so seriously, as he should, but that's what makes him so good. The backgrounds are always changing, breathtaking views, as Mr. Carradine explains each move and what it's for. I've learned to focus better, and to be more at peace with myself, although I haven't gotten as far as his 'smooth moves' that he does at the end with his other expert Dr. I love this DVD and know it will be used quite a bit.

Also, it hangs at a very natural angle, so the hummingbirds get the hang of it quickly. Shortcomings: it doesn't hold very much nectar. I would estimate it has a 1/3 cup capacity. So if you have alot of birds, you need to refill it every other day or so. Also, the rubber stopper is a little difficult to keep from popping out when the feeder is freshly refilled and the lip is wet. You have to dry it thoroughly to make it stay put. These shortcomings are only minor, and I'm very pleased with the product. I am planning to buy a couple more over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some kids will listen ...","review":"Chances are this book will be used a lot as a last straw of hope.

A 12-inch bulb isn't easy to find, so I purchased this one and a Power-Glo to see which is brighter. I can only find T5 bulbs that are 8-watts, which isn't ideal as I want the tank BRIGHT. This bulb bulb is a much lower kelvin than the Power Glo, but the light looks very dull and a tad yellow once it is installed. It actually seems like it might be a bit dimmer than the original Aqueon bulb that the tank came with. Plants would probably do ok with it if they could tolerate medium light. Keep in mind my tank is very deep, so this review may not be a great qualifier for more standard shaped tanks where the light has less depth to penetrate.All that being said, it's hard to find 12\\" bulbs and beggars can't be choosers (well, except in this case they can).

Campbell Jr. He was the editor of Astounding Science Fiction in the 40s when I was in High schol and I read him and the other great authors largely unknown to present day fans. The first attempt to put the story on celluloid called The Thing was a hugh disappointment to us Sci Fi buffs as it had little to do with the plot other than the location on the polar cap. I was relieved to see that the remake captured the overwhelming ominous dread of the printed word that was new to us in our teens. This same alien horror was again used in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, now going into it's third remake I am told.

My step-mother also used an edition when my sister was born in 1988. Both are books were very similar with a nice hardcover.This new edition is missing a lot of information the older ones had, such as places to write in important milestones for babies. It's still one of the best out there and I'll buy it again for our second child. I'm also not fond of the three-ring binder setup. I preferred the old hardcover, as it wasn't as bulky.As for Amazon saying they can get the older version is just a few weeks, those few weeks turned into months and I gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson's first birthday","review":"This was a hit with my grandson, so much so that he wanted to stay in it instead of continuing to open his gifts!

But it is a good kit for young modelers to get a start in the hobby with. I first got this kit in 1976 and it helped me cut my teeth on building and painting armor kits. I bought it again for nostalgic reasons. It brings back some fond and pleasant memories for me of simpler, happier times. I highly recommend this kit for young modelers and those who have nostalgic feelings for the Monogram kits of the 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not come molded in color","review":"I bought this item together with the Mustand P51D kit for my son. Both items were supposed to be molded in color but when they arrived were in the standard grey that comes with other model kits that you have to paint. I contacted the manufacturer Revell USA to get some feedback on recourse available but they have not acknowledged my complaint (I supplied photos of items, upc code and original sales receipt). I then contacted Revell Germany who responded immediately but told me that they did not manufacture the product and I would have to deal with Revell USA.

It offers hope for those who are currently struggling with their own 'beast' (the author's euphemism for the panic attacks and other anxiety symptoms).As someone who grew up with an anxiety disorder myself, I found it a fascinating read and helpful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ BOOK","review":"With candid clarity this first time author, a basketball folk hero, recalls his heart wrenching descent from carefree honors student to self-imposed exile. His harrowing account of panic attacks, pharmacutical dead ends, and varying reactions of others to this condition are only a few of the aspects of the disorder the author covers hauntingly. His odyessy from the death of his beloved mother to hopelessness, helplessness, and redemption hard won is compelling and inspiring. The authors joy to emerge in a loving and fulfilling life as a husband and father is contagious. It is a goal for which the reader will cheer. That he also emerges as an award-winning newspaper columnist is a promise to the reader of the craft of this compulsively readable account. This self-examination serves as a MUST READ BOOK for those who suffer from this life-stealing disorder and the people who love them.

I felt that finally the HB execs are getting it together and recognizing the good stuff. After watching the first two episodes I realized I had been DUPED! Editing dialogue to be PC, using the same ending credits for all episodes and no credit for Doug Wildey. A (...)release of the best classic prime-time animation of the 1960's.After I finish watching all the episodes, I'm donating the DVD's to my local public library. I know better now to read the reviews before buying. I think Warner Brothers and Hana-Barbera owe all of us an explanation for this hack-job. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DICK WITH IT?When I pay for DVD's, I expect the real deal without edits and deception. I can only hope that they fix it with another release with everything intact except the insert commercials. And you can bet they know that we will buy it again.

The two star rating is for the presentation, merited by the following:1. Dialogue edits from \\"Pursuit of the Po-Ho\\"2. Dialogue edits from \\"Monster In The Monastery\\"3. Atrocious, hack artwork on the box4. Cutting of JQ title cards from the introduction sequences5. Use of only one end credit sequence (the only one without creator Doug Wildey's name on it) for all 26 episodes6. Amping up the colors to an eye-straining saturation level7.

Though I haven't bought this DVD yet, I do have every original episode on VHS. Tim Matheson did so many cartoon voices during that time period but Jonny was the best! I was compelled as an adolescent to grow up to be a scientist because of Jonny's influence (I did serve as an Air Force policeman without quite the glamour). Forget Cat/Dog, the Tick, and all these other cartoons of today's generation; Jonny was exciting, real and educational (and had the neatest toys too!)

This well-crafted & superbly illustrated series set a benchmark for quality cartoons with intelligent dialogue, perfect pacing and a right-on musical soundtrack that surely has embedded itself into every young adventurers' memory banks!Some notable episodes include 'The Robot Spy', 'The Quetong Missile Mystery' and 'Shadow of the Condor', among others.

Hadji is the perfect sidekick with his mystical powers and awesome turban. Bandit the pup serves as a comic relief and is funny. Race is just too cool, I mean he can fly a fa-reakin plane and fight and Dr. Quest is sophisticated. The places they went gave me an insight look into the different cultures around the world and the plots were very imaginative. JQ combined science fiction fantasy and geography into a very impressive 30 minute cartoon sitcom. The first season is amazing and I am glad that have realeased it on DVD.

There was actually a plot to the story and the animation was fantastic for its time. Great attention to detail. And if you're a Tim Matheson fan, he does the voice for Jonny Quest.

You can get it if you want it at about $8, not the $23 I paid for what I thought to be a top notch import re-mastering).

This DVD covers everything with a straightforward, comprehensible presentation.

I'd recommend this for any college students preparing to become teachers. It will give them a good basic understanding of RtI BEFORE they enter the workplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking, idea generating ...","review":"I wish Amazon.com permitted me to give this book 4.5 stars...If you're looking for all the answers, a complete IT checklist, or the meaning of life, keep looking. Having said that, this book is a 'thought trigger' that will generate a lot of ideas and stimulate the reader to question their prejudices about IT and costs. I like to think of myself as an \\"outside the box\\" thinker, and this book stimulated that even more.I especially like the way this book presents cost of ownership from a more holistic view than the traditional IT view, presenting a way of understanding that impact on the business should be factored into the equation, all the while applying \\"Occam's Raxor\\".I am hoping Drew's \\"home boss\\" (as he refers to in the book) keeps him writing and on track so that he will write his next book soon.

No specific date, just sit and wait and something may eventually turn up. I offered to swap out the whole set, or drive to a store to make a swap, but since my set was a gift I was out of luck.

Great for those long winter evenings beside a warm fire, a cup of tea & Jon Turk as he candidly recounts some of his solo & fascinating sea-going adventures of shipwrecks off Cape Horn to the seas of the Northwest Passage; from Arctic blizzards to an ancient Inuit migration route to Greenland - all by kayak, rowboat or dogsled. Jon Turk is also well-versed in the history of the places he is drawn to which gives us a broader perspective. A pleasant & pensive read. Makes a great gift! .............................."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop whining!","review":"Okay, so he did some interesting and adventurous things. However, he did them all with a minimum of preparation and a maximum of ego, a bad combination under the best of circumstances. By his own admission, he did not enjoy travel for the sheer joy of travel and experiencing life. He completely missed the point every step of the way. In the process, he casually dismissed his children, the woman he loved, and he endangered himself and others. He mistreated his dog-sled team by not properly training them, leading to death and injury. And on every step of the way, he whined about his misfortunes at not being \\"successful\\". This man will NEVER be happy in life. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great adventures but...","review":"Cold Oceans has a lot of potential but the author reveals too much of himself. Constant references about his personality and details of his outbursts are a downer. He relies on luck and risk taking as opposed to planning and knowledge of his surroundings and means of travel. For a much more enjoyable read with better emphasis on local knowledge try \\"Homelands\\" or \\"On Celtic Tides.\\" I certainly won't buy another Jon Turk book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great singer","review":"One of the members of Buena Vista Social Club project, Omara didn't pass so much time without recording, differently of artists such as Compay Segundo and Ibrahim Ferrer. She is very popular in Cuba, as a bolero and \\"son\\" singer, and has several CDs in catalogue. It's not fair to remember mainly of Celia Cruz when we think of a superb bolero female singer: Omara stayed in Cuba, singing for her people, and this CD is a must for those who appreciate romantic Cuban songs. Excellent musicians and arrangements too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining and painful historical read.","review":"Gives an amazing perspective in how far we've come in birthing.

It was cheap and wouldn't work properly. I have been trying since I've bought it to get ahold of someone to return this, with no luck. The directions that came with it was horrible.

Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man is a liar","review":"This man has been proven to be a liar by the most average historians, AND he was arresed and convicted on selling bogus antiques (Check his record--it is public). He also was a part of the most violent group ever assembled in his Russian homeland; this group later became known as the KGB. This man is a master of deception and obviously has fooled everyone on this list except me. More info on him is in a report on Michael Hoffman's website."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THOSE I LIED","review":"Martin Gray could have written a novel based on the horrific events. If he had, then this mediocre text could be judged fairly. Instead, he passes this deceit off as memoir and history with himself at the epicenter. It is a falsehood and demeans and makes suspect so many wrenching books about real survivors and their agonies."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Could My Life in the NKVD Be So Misunderstood?","review":"Previous reviewers of this book exclaim, \\"What a wonderful tale, straight from the finest experiences of the human drama!\\" Yeah, right. Martin Gray would have you believe he was up to his knees in corpses at Treblinka, when in reality he was serving as an officer in the Soviet NKVD. Once again, we find the \\"most touching remembrances of the Holocaust\\" to be fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read this book when I was in high school and it made me feel very sorry for the Jewish people. But now that I have grown some I have found that there is always more than one side to every story and the Holocaust is no exception. I read this article today about Wilkomirski's book \\"Fragments\\" in the Detroit News and I am very disappointed. I have this strange feeling that much of what I have read in the Holocaust genre is fiction written for sympathy or just propaganda. I'm not a \\"holocaust denier\\" or \\"revisionist\\" I am just someone who likes to hear both sides of a story before passing judgement. I'm interested now in finding a book written by someone who was on the other side of the fence during the Holocaust.This book had some lessons to be learned in it but not about the Holocaust or Nazism."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever Written","review":"This book has to be the best ever written,whether it is fiction or non.I have never read a book that I could not put down until I perused this one.It is a gut wrenching feeling that makes you wonder how sick people are that can go through with ethnic cleansing,in those days or as we are presently witnessing in Kosovo.It is a must read book,and somebody should send a copy to the Balkans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, Thoughtful, perspective changing","review":"I read this book in 1981...it is a book that I still recommend to people. Extremly powerful a book capable of moving the most jaded. I am now a Social Studies teacher and assign it to my students as a historical record as well as book of inspiration, and perserverance.. To read an experience such as Martin Grays and how he still have the courage to continue on is testament to the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most memorable books I have ever read...","review":"I first read this book 27 years ago. The same age as Martin Gray when we was living in the Warsaw ghetto. I pulled it of a shelf at random in my school library, read the first couple of pages and I was hooked.Martin Gray's incredible story made such an impression on me that I have never forgotten it. Over the years I have recommended it to others. It is as powerful and moving today as it was 27 years ago!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistaken purchase","review":"I bought this on the strength of an Amazon.com review and I must say I'm sorry I did. Lucky I bought a ... copy. Neither story caught/held my interest; none of the characters seemed fresh or interesting & the storylines were tired out, too. Same old, same old in my opinion. Cathy Williams' story was more boring than Kim Lawrence's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, funny, philosophical","review":"This is a favorite that I've returned to at least twice. Pollan engages with his skill in writing, but also his interesting thoughts on the mundane that make them seem intriguing. Essays are easy to read in any order, yet are connected. Much more than a garden book, will inspire not just planting and pruning, but thinking. Worth the read, regardless of whether you have dirty fingernails or green thumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawn Mowing et al","review":"Pollans description of what is a green thumb and the sysiphean art of mowing reminded me how therapeutic gardening can be and why it cures depression. Thank you Michael for making me look at my roses in a totally different way. You will love this book if you tend to think in pictures and love the art and hard work of gardening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! My sentiments exactly!","review":"This book verbalized the fascination with gardening as a form of human interaction with (and manipulation of) nature. Interesting ideas and entertaining stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought through","review":"Even though the garden philosophy gets a little tiresome, the other 90% of the book is educational and extremely interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Wilderness, Cleverly Disguised","review":"Pollan is a very bright and clever writer and all his books are entertaining and well-researched. But his point of view is all humanist and as such is part of the same old agenda as even the worse earth-raping capitalists. Indeed, his later books and essays advocate killing animals, \\"getting over\\" the \\"idea\\" of wilderness, and not bothering to preserve nature but rather to just give up and let humans overrun everything. He is a good marketer, has a huge ego, and he tells humans (especially us Hummer-loving Americans) what we want to hear, but people like him are part of the erudite, seemingly sensitive propagandists (such as Bill McKibben) who do not love earth as much as they love humans, thus missing the fact that humans are embarked on a massive earth-killing mission that combines capitalism, ecocide and ultimately suicide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative suburban landscaping","review":"This book looks at our suburban landscaping and introduces the reader to alternatives to the highly regimented foundationplantings and obligatory specimen tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I had high expectations, after reading his other books. But while this book works hard at being \\"deep\\", it doesn't look like Pollan has any real depth in the area of gardening. The book is not giving me any insights into gardening, but I am getting insights into Mr. Pollan, and it's sadly not enjoyable.In Omnivore's Dilemna, in the section describing the pig meal, there's some of the this same quality that bothers me so much in this book. It's a smug, self-congratulatory tone, while he doesn't appear to be even concious of all the things he's doing, nor seeing any contraditions. And in both that section of Omnivore's Dilemna, and in several of the essays in this book, the conclusions he draws are flawed, since he's not observing his own actions as thoughfully as he observes the rest of the world.I suppose the writing is nice, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"From bored to wanting to get my hands dirty","review":"I'm not a gardener, so why did I pick up this book? Only because it's a Michael Pollan book and I'm a fanboy of his. At first the book was boring, I mean I just not a gardener. Yet as the book went on I found it more and more interesting. As a someone working on getting his \\"Bachelor of Science in Environmental Policy and Management\\" I found the environmental stuff very interesting. By the end of the book I wanted to go out and get my hands dirty. I wanted to plain not only a vegetable garden but also one for my own aesthetic enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for a gardener or philosopher","review":"I've just started gardening and a friend gave me this book. I'm a fan of some of Pollan's later books and thoroughly enjoyed this. It's a one part personal memoir, two parts philosophical musings about nature, and a smidge of good gardening advice thrown in to boot. I'd like to see it updated a bit since times (and organic gardening) have changed somewhat- but regardless, it stands up excellently and is well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent... eye opening","review":"The author sure did his research! I was learning a new concept every page. It's amazing how involved and enriched the flora culture is. I loved the theories on lawn grass, I was right there with him thinking the same things every day in the not so distant past when I watered, cared for and cut my grass. Overall excellent book, I recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in planting, gardening or who even likes flowers. I think I found my mother's day gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melty crumble putty","review":"I assumed that all glue sticks were exactly the same.I assumed wrong.

Get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for...","review":"This book seems to be so deep that you cant swim. I found it very hard to get into a flow with. The literature seems to jump around too vastly and uses unnecessary complicated words to get simple messages across. This book is definately not for the average Christian thats interested in church history. And thats exactly what I am. I dont think it takes this much garble to illuminate such a matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Included on the Complete Season set!","review":"In a very unclear and probably intentionally confusing marketing move, this and all of the other \\"2-hour TV special\\" Little House DVDs being released separated are actually included on the Complete Season box sets being released by the same company. I purchased three of these \\"specials\\" before realizing that they were all 2-part episodes to be found on the complete season sets. Usually, a 2-part show like this is released a little while before the season it's included on is... so only buy it if you MUST have it a couple of months ahead of time. While I don't have a problem with these 2-part shows being released separately, I don't understand the need for it and I really, really wish that it would be made clear somewhere on the packaging. Considering that these single disc releases have no special features, this is the worst example of DVD \\"double dipping\\" I've seen in a long time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Albania? In a Model T?","review":"I admit to a bias. Helen Dore Boylston was a cousin of my grandfather's and I've been feeling terribly cheated since I read this book because I never met her. The story is remarkable. Two young women decide to drive from Albania to Paris. Their adventures are not, perhaps, quite as colorful as one might hope, but their daring and imagination in deciding upon such an voyage make your realize that Laura Ingalls Wilder really raised one heck of a brave and free daughter. I'd recommend it to anyone who's read the Little House Books or any of Helen Dore Boylston's books about Sue Barton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"An enchanting tale about a small pegasus who one day realizes, to her horror, that there are spots on her backside!

However, I found the movie to be a very reverent telling of the first few chapters of Genesis.I thought that it portrayed well how the O.T. was likely transmitted orally before it was recorded.I was moved at the respect the people had for their patriarch as he shared the word of God with them.The music and cinematography were very moving.I would like to have the kind of peace in my life that those people portrayed; and it seemed that God's word was first on their list of priorities."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible - Genesis","review":"The Bible - Genesis is a visual film about Genisis and was filmed in 2000. The problem is the slow pace and many of the scenes have really nothing to do with the story telling. I must admit that I was quite disappointed and I only watched the first 40 minutes since the movie was like a sleeping pill. The narration was dull and uninspiring and the acting was wooden. The music sounded like muzak more then that of a soundtrack to a movie. Not recommended. 1/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"This film is not bad in regard to biblical accuracy, but there are three problems. (1) It is primarily an old man telling the stories, rather than dramatization of the events.

I didn't have the benefit of any of Amazon.com's reviews, which certainly would have saved me the (...) (plus tax!) that I paid at my neighborhood Christian bookstore. Having seen (and LOVED!) the Esther video in this series, I made my next purchase the Genesis video (something told me to buy Jeremiah instead -- must have been the Lord trying to keep me from wasting my money). THIS WAS BY FAR THE MOST BORING ADAPTATION OF SCRIPTURE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. After nearly an hour of watching desert scenery (beautiful scenes, but not worth (...)) and listening to an old man recite scripture amid children crying and livestock bleating, I cut the VCR off.

I recommend this film just to see that part, that scence was so out of place...quite funny indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Beginning!","review":"While some of the other movies in The Bible Series have been magnificent, this particular one falls short, and was very disappointing. Although the music is very period-like for the era, the program is confusing in its depiction of Adam and Eve and the serpent. What was intriguing, however, was the concept of Eve not being Caucasian. In that part of the world (Middle East), it would only stand to reason that Eve would be a woman of color. Then things moved quickly to Noah, and another very disappointing scene. The ark didn't even look like the historical ark, and those who entered the ark looked like the entire neighborhood. Not a very good depiction. The rest of the movie was a little bit forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending","review":"This is possibly one of the most boring Bible movies I've ever seen in my life. It's slow, the scenes aren't really that interesting and why the decision to go verbatim I'll never understand. It wasn't really necessary. If you were to use this as a tool for those who are new to the stories, you'd lose them. It's just that boring. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.The best part of the whole film is maybe Noah's Ark, but it wasn't really enough to save the film.The dubbing over wasn't really that good, but I'll forgive it that. There are better Genesis movies; or it's just best to break it up into smaller stories to get a better understanding of this important book in the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I, too wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this movie, and I bought it from Amazon! I didn't even watch the entire movie. I got through the first 30-40 minutes and could see that it wasn't going to get any better.

Well, until I finally saw the Wanna-be's I was not sure. After seeing the Wanna-be's I instantly fell in love with it. I am a huge fan of wrestling especially female wrestling.This movie has an exciting plot. The Wanna-be's a tag team with rising fame must go against the dreaded Foxy Ladies. They are undefeated and very unfeminine. The Wanna-be's are given a drug that will help them win. Will this save them though from the worlds champions? Will they be able to survive this plot? Will the drug actually work or will it fail like the others in the past? Get this exciting, hilarious, action packed, and totally unexpected animation to find out! You will be enthralled from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No","review":"This lost gem from the 80's feels like a cross between Dirty Pair and Ultimate Muscle. To stand a chance against the monstrous tag team champs, two female wrestlers become unwitting guinea pigs for an experimental performance drug. Now the premise seems appealing at first glance but this, like most wrestling-based cartoons and comics, goes down for the count. It's said that this particular genre fails because the creators tend to shove more fantasy into the already fantastic world of wrestling, taking out what people love about the sport in the first place--specifically the wrestling. Speaking of which, the actual wrestling here is actually so good you can't get enough. With the lackluster main plot taking up most of film's 45-minute runtime, you don't. Overall, Wanna-Be's is the kind of movie you'd see in the SyFy channel's anime block--just not the kind of movie you'd really want to see.This film is unrated: Graphic Violence, Nudity, Adult Language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort","review":"The fact that this is a first attempt at a full-length novel by this author is glaringly apparent by his style of simple prose and over-explaining in many parts of the book.Mr. Wilson tries to inject the science of \\"criminal profiling\\" into this work, but ends up giving his readers an over-simplified definition.The dialogues were extremely fake and animated.

But this book, which had great characterizations, characters in the story you could really root for, and a 'surprise' twist near the end (which I saw coming, but I know others might not), completely falls apart in the last chapter. A ridiculous ending that doesn't match up with *ANYTHING* the author wrote in the rest of the book. I very much wish I could go into the reasons *why* it fell apart, but unfortunately to do so would spoil the book for others. Although in my opinion, save your money and don't even bother reading this one. I'm still angry over the ending and it's been 4 days since I finished it. I'm angry that this book was SO CLOSE to greatness, only to fall apart on the home stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch for Gift","review":"This watch is good for gifting.

Maybe finding true love in Los Angeles is really this difficult, but it seems that the choices made by Dhalla's protagonist Ali are not especially wise. Street hustlers usually are not good husband material, a fact of gay life that cannot have been unknown to Ali, given his sexual and social history. Neither are promiscuous party boys, another object of Ali's misguided affections. No wonder he is miserable.Unfortunately, there is no relief for lovelorn Ali, whose unhappiness is the result of his own failings, not the fault of his suitors. This sort of gay self-loathing and failure to connect is a very old, very hackneyed plot.The book does have something to offer, however, in terms of seeing gay life from the perspective of the gay Asian and South Asian subculture, which is its only redeeming point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live Fat,Die Young","review":"Fat wreckchords suckered me into this one!

The first day we had this toy, the door broke off. This was with pretty gentle play. The door is just held on with a wooden dowel and it broke very easily. We were really disapointed in the qulaity of this toy. The idea is interesting but, the execution poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"sturdy but not sturdy","review":"I was delighted at the sturdy construction of this product when it arrived. However, within just 20 minutes of gentle play use in my nursery school class, BOTH doors broke off because they are attached with weak lightweight dowels. To ship it back would be cost-prohibitive for me so I will repair it myself using a sturdier hinge... very frustrating. Besides that, it is adorable, and hopefully with the repair will last years in my classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept on the toy, but poor design","review":"I m a great fan of Melissa and Doug products. However, I am very disappointed on the construction of the Mailbox. Both the front door and the rear door are held together by weak wooden dowel as hinghes. On the first hour of play, one of the wooden dowel snapped and the front door felt off. Thumb down on the Mailbox set !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but not durable","review":"My children were very excited about this toy because my son has a mailman costume and he and my daughter love to play dress-up but just like all the other reviews, within an hour of opening the toy, the door was broken. It was difficult to even keep it closed because the wooden letters seemed to heavy and were pushing against it. Since the toy is only a week old, the door is currently being kept closed with tape until we can find a better way to fix it. Despite all that, the kids love it and they've been playing with it non-stop. However, I wish I had read these reviews beforehand because I would not have made the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool toy but brakes way too easily","review":"The mailbox is neat but not very sturdy. Just like the other reviews, both doors broke off without excessivly rough play within DAYS. More disappointing to me is that we called the 1-800 number for Melissa and Doug about this and got NO reply. If you aren't going to field and address questions or concerns, don't print the number Melissa and Doug!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I had read other reviews on this product before purchasing. I contacted Melissa & Doug via e-mail to ask if the complaints I read about the door hing (a dowl rod) breaking was fixed. They told me it had long ago been fixed. I ordered the toy and the door broke within the first 1/2 hour of play. My husband had to fix it himself by adding a piece of hardware with a drill. I'm sure the company would have replaced it but it would just brake again since the problem still has not been fixed. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"We like Melissa & Doug, but were disappointed by this item","review":"Our previous experience with Melissa & Doug products has been pretty good, but the quality control team was asleep on this particular item. The locking mechanism for the door does not operate smoothly and requires a key to turn; it would have been better to have a knob for smaller fingers and as a backup once the key inevitably gets lost. It seems as if the thickness of paint was not accounted for in the design, because all of the pieces fit tightly until your kid wears the paint off the corners. The thickest envelopes that can only go in the top slot hit the back of the box before dropping down, so your kid really has to shove them through; ours splintered the inside face of the fiberboard around the slot within a day. After one week of use, some of the seams between panels on the mailbox are already cracked and chipping. Our kid really wanted a mailbox, but we now wish that we had chosen a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for Preschool children!","review":"The children in my preschool class really enjoy playing with this mailbox. We have been talking about community helpers and I set up a post office center. TMelissa & Doug Mailbox and Mail Sethe kids love it! The product is very durable and easy for the children to use. I look forward to using it from year to year in my classroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Toy!","review":"I really like this toy and am glad that I bought it for my boys. It is not their first go to toy but they do like it. Placing the mail in the slots is challenging, especially with the stamps in place. We have incorporated the use of junk mail into their play with this. We did have the facing peel off of one of the wooden envelopes and I have yet to try to repair it. This only has happened to one thus far. A friend of mine used this when she taught preschool. The children all had a laminated envelope that contained their name on the outside. She used this to collect attendance and the kids loved it. Very good toy for imaginative play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but POOR quality!","review":"As other reviewers stated, this thing is not put together well at all. We ordered this for my 3yr old for Christmas, because he is fascinated by mail. He loved it, but the back door broke loose the first night. We used Elmer's wood glue to glue it back on and didn't let him play with it for a day. It has held since then, but we have decided that we will reinforce with screws if it happens again. Also, the paint was chipped on top as soon as we took it out of the plastic. I was just disappointed in it. I couldn't send it back because my son does enjoy playing with it. I would recommend this because there is nothing else on the market like it, but not if you don't want to have to repair it or add screws to make it more sturdy. Like I said in my title: Great idea, but very poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad toy, great company","review":"My son received this as a gift. Like to other reviews we had issues. The lock fell off and my children ended up using it as a dog house, a $40- dog house! I e-mailed the company and they were horrified that this happened and within 2 weeks my children had a new mailbox to play with (and they have been playing non-stop with it). The new mailbox is different. The doors are different. The lock is held on with screws instead of glue and the other door has 3 circles of velcro and a small hole to put one finger inside to open the door. There is no more magnet. They have made great changes in this product so I give the old version of the mailbox 2 stars, the company 5 stars and the new mailbox style 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, at the best.....","review":"It was the first book I read from that author and it certainly will be the last. The plot is almost non-existant, the dialogues are unbelivable specially the ones involving the little girl, no children speaks or thinks like that and, above all, there is the romance, what is it with american female mystery authors? They seem to be unable to write a real thriller, they always have to add these sirupy romances. I read it till the end just to see if I was right about the guilty party, I was... a real deception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the last Coulter novel I'll read","review":"This book was really a dissapointment to me. The characters were unbeleivable, the plot was predictable (yes I figured it out early on) and the romance between the judge and molly fizzled (I found myself skipping over the love scenes) I was impatient to finish this book, very syrupy, the ending was an even bigger dissapointment, it seemed like the author got tired of writing, the whole thing seemed veeeeery drawn out until the last 20 pages.

Kidnapping and child abuse are tough subjects, but a Judge who doesn't notify the police and a mother who isn't hysterical are hard to swallow.

It was as if she expected you to already understand why a childless man would take an instant liking to this child. She then exaggerates the confusion by asking the reader to belive it plausible that would endanger his life fro them. Basically it was illogical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book had a refreashing plot. It keep you thinking.

I received it in great shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, interesting characters","review":"I enjoyed The Target and thought all the characters were very interesting. Judge Hunt was an interesting mix with Emma & Molly. I was disappointed that there were several typo's (like Page 192 referring to Judge Hunt as Judge Hurt) that can be distracting and make you reread several paragraphs. I think it is nice to have an author do something a little different once in a while instead of the same \\"romance\\" stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a TRUE Coulter.","review":"I could not be labeled as a \\"Fan\\" of Catherine Coulter's after reading this book. It was too different from the rest of her books. Too based around the child. Ms. Coulter, I believe, is an adult romance writer. My preference is for the novel to be centered on the two adults and their romance, not a 'perfect' little girl. I was disappointed that Ms. Coulter would write this and I actually feel sorry for anyone who spends their money on The Target. I honestly believe that they would be better off reading the Bride Series or Legacy Series or perhaps The Cove and The Maze. I am not thrilled that I spent money on this book. I think it is a shame that Ms. Coulter lowered her normally wonderful standards. I must say though, this is the first of her books that has disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"My husband's favorite series--although he has read most of them---this time he is starting in order.

But, at the same time he learns about himself and healing.Her mother finds them and eventually she and Ramsey work together to try and figure out why the girl was kidnapped and work through their issues together.Savich and Sherlock do make an appearance with Sherlock being pregnant and having an interesting version of morning sickness.There were some far fetched things that happen in the plot, such as not taking the girl to a hospital and not taking her to get help for a while, as well as them suddenly taking off and traveling together. But overall it was good story with a bunch of twists and turns that kept it interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dud!","review":"As others have explained, a federal judge hiding out in the woods for some privacy finds a severly abused girl. For eight (count 'em, 8) days - until her mother comes blazing into the book - he nutures her and cares for her himself, without notifying the authorities, without taking her to the hospital, and apparently without any consideration of the fact that somewhere she has a family going crazy with worry. Of course, during this time, he tends her wounds, washing away any physical evidence that she would be carrying of her attacker. This guy is a judge??? Then, when her mother enters the picture, she *thanks* him for keeping her daugher with him. That's the worst kind of hideous fiction that I can imagine. I generally like Catherine Coulter, but I could not even go on with this book after the first 50 pages or so: The beginning bordered on \\"fantasy\\" not \\"fiction.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unbelievible","review":"I enjoy reading books and watching movies because they take me away from my normal existence, and have the imagination to accept when an author will stretch reality. Unfortunatly, Catherine Coulter took reality and stretched it way past the breaking point. Her description of a six year old girl made me wonder if she has ever met a child, or used Shirley Temple and a six year old Jesus Christ as her model. I got so tired of hearing about her perfection I wanted to pull her braid (mentioned approx. 1,000 times) right out of her head. The Judge and Molly were totally unbelivible. I kept imagineing myself in the same position as the Judge, finding an unconsious six year old girl, sexually abused, unconsious in the forest. Sure, I'll take her and hold her for about a week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Torture","review":"I always finish a book once I start but this one was painful. Judge Ramsey was so unbelieveably sickeningly sweet that he made my stomach turn. The child, Emma, was smarter than the adults and the mother, Molly was completely inconsistent. Emma did not behave nor speak like a six year old. It made me wonder about the children the author has been around? What child speaks this way? Molly and Ramsey's love affair? Totally unbelievable and undeveloped...again PUKE! This was my first Coulter novel and I am not sure I want to try another. Reading this one was pure torture for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last Coulter experience","review":"I, like others here, feel compelled to finish any book I begin, but this is one that makes me seriously rethink that comittment. Others have duly noted the multitude of flaws in the plot, but what really got to me was the insipid dialogue. NO ONE TALKS LIKE THIS! Virtually every time a character opens his or her mouth, what comes out sounds like something that would earn a generous D in a high school creative writing class. I guess I should have been alerted by the \\"Dear Readers\\" note on the back cover of the paperback edition. I know this was probably written by someone working for the Publisher, but didn't Coulter have to sign off on something over her signature?

This book, with its unbelievable characters,unrealistic dialogue,poor plot development, and just plain poor writing, was a bestseller? It's frightening, when you think about it.

I can't believe anyone who is a discerning reader will find this book well done. Quite frankly, this book did not even strike me as having been written by this author, but rather by someone who wished they could write. It was amateurish in its dialogue, silly in its plot and character development, and just a plain waste of time. I ended up skimming over so much of it, and I was still able to figure out the entire plot by just briefly scanning over every 2-3 pages.

This is the first time that I have read something by this author, and believe me it will be the last. The characters were unbelievable, ever changing, etc. There just seemed to be too much focus on dumb things, for example the girl's braid, I don't know how many times it was mentioned, give me a break! I kept on going just because the author promised that you would not be able to guess who was the bad guy. Turns that I did, about halfway throughout the book. I could not believe the end! Did she get bored too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"She missed the Target on this one","review":"Most of Catherine Coulter's stories are good. Not The Target. This one starts off with the main character, a judge, deciding to secretly keep and care for a kidnapped child he found in the woods. He can't stand the idea of anyone else trying to care for her - including her parents. His reasoning is frightening, to the point that I wished he would have been arrested for his illegal acts, including kidnapping and washing down a rape victim. Sorry, Catherine. This one was really off Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last Coulter","review":"I thought, a judge finds a sexually abused girl in the woods and calls no one? I must be missing something.

It was just a little unbelievable (and slightly creepy) that the man was so hung up on this little girl and basically he wants to marry, not because he's in love with the mother, but because he wants to be the child's father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok ONLY if little kids are your one passion in life","review":"Catherine Coulter is a decent writer, so even though I dislike a heavy presence of children in my novels, I could still finish the tapes. But I wouldn't have bought it if I had known that this little girl was in almost EVERY sentence. I don't know much about kids, but I have never seen anything close to this one. She was so unbelievable I almost laughed several times. I hope the very low reviews of this novel convince Ms. Coulter to abandon this type of story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy to put Catherine Coulter's name as the author","review":"I have read 20 or so, C. Coulter novels and The Target was a study in frustration and disappointment for me. The dialogue was trite and seemed fragmented and disjointed. Sometimes I wasn't even sure who was speaking or what they were talking about. The storyline started out good but got lost in unbelievable situations. The characters were likeable but lacked depth and history. I was very sorry I spent 18.00 on this book and will read several critical reviews before I buy another contemporary suspense novel by Coulter. The Cove and The Maze were much better. She should stick to historical romance-she's much better at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rainha do Axè","review":"One another great album, is not the best album of Daniela but Songs like top of the world e levada brasileira are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is one of the best.","review":"Buckshot Shorty and Evil-Dee are two of the best hip-hop artists of all time.

They lack any sort of musical complexity. The instrumentation is thin and undynamic. Black Moon is essentially hip hop at it's most mundane.

It was pretty easy to install, The wall mounts are best if you can hit a stud, but on one end I was only on drywall, so a couple of those expanding bolts did the trick. The ceiling rod is included and necessary. I thought the set screw that holds it in place looked a little wimpy, but it seemes to do the trick. The pieces were easy to cut to length with a hand saw with a metal cutting blade. I would suggest drilling a very small hole through the rod where the set screws pinch the rod. That allows the screws to dig in to the rod, and hold it much better.

Its debut came the same time as the Depression, therefore I never saw The Invisible Man in the movie theatre. While surfing the web I came across this movie at Amazon.com and to my amazement it was the original movie from 1934.I had to order it immediately and it quickly arrived at my home.I was very impressed with the movie. It has a good mix of comedy and suspense; the special effects are very realistic. The movie's theme is current with today, as it depicts a person who gain power over other people and then uses their powers for unjust purposes.This is a truly a classic/entertaining movie and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"INVISIBLE RAINS","review":"In one of the most unusual film debuts of any actor (because the character is seen only briefly in the end), Claude Rains was obviously chosen for his impeccable speaking voice. Filmed in 1933, this is a macabre horror/comedy which has a resemblance to \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\". The invisibility was achieved by dressing a stuntman in black velvet and then removing the bancdages and clothes against ablack velvet background; Rains' appearance at the end, his head seemingly coming out of nowhere as he lays dying, was accomplished through elaborate stop motion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparison of new vs old release","review":"The sole purpose of this review is to compare \\"The Invisible Man\\" in this collection to the older DVD release.EXCELLENT. Dramatic improvement - much better contrast and detail. It appears that a different source print was used, and it's much better than that which was used for the older DVD. This is unquestionably worth the upgrade, regardless of all the added benefits.You can view screen capture comparisons on my website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, poor \\"extras\\"","review":"For those who enjoy classic monster movies, this series will delight and amaze you. The special effects, particularly in the original movie, were incredible for the time, and easily contribute to the staying power of The Invisible Man. Claude Rains performance, especially, is incredible and easily overshadows any other performance in the sequels.For those like me, however, who were hoping for the extras to detail the processes that went into making the movies, be prepared for a possible disappointment. They seem to concentrate more on the life of James Whale and the fact that he was a homosexual (and how noble that made him) in Hollywood at the time then they do in speaking about the films and what went into making them. I dont really see what the man's sexual orientation had to do with it; had it been a biography of him, I could understand.All in all, a good collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible Man Classic Monsters Collection","review":"The Invisible Man is an excellent movie with great speical effects. Do not buy The Classic Monsters Collection version rather spring an extra few bucks for The Universal Legacy Collection. Why? I just bought a big screen tv and this dvd looks horrible on it. Alot of crackles and lines going down the film. The Universal Legacy collection is cleaned up and has an extra 5 movies dealing with Invisible theme.You get a neat little card in these Classic Monsters Collection card with these dvds as well, at least I did.

Beside the superb performance (or \\"voice\\") by Claude Rains, who delivers his lines in an unbelievable clear accent, director James Whale manages to create the same kind of \\"fairytale world\\" he used to deliver in \\"Frankenstein\\". The images of the snowy English countryside, the inn, the dead trees behind windows and the lonely small town streets are unforgetable. But besides this the black humor and the fine \\"English\\" characters are wothy a movie admission alone. Just sit down on a quiet Winter evening and watch this science fiction vision from another time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!","review":"This movie is spectacular! I did find some flaws but it's still a good movie and deserves to be as famous as Dracula and Frankenstein. I loved the movie, still do, and i enjoy watching it.

I love it, don't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I disagree with previous comment","review":"Omitting the Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man is nothing to be concerned about since, as you noted, it is in the A&C; volume 3. The Invisible Man would be in one set or the other, and it makes more sense to be in the A&C; series. If they put it in both, people would complain that they are being forced to buy a movie twice. Just like the movie \\"Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein\\". It has Frankenstein's Monster, Wolf Man, AND Dracula; in which set should it have been included? Rightly so, the Abbott and Costello series.That's my opinion, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it live.","review":"I bought the pedal to use 2-4 times a night to get over the top 80's hard rock/metal tones.

Trials can be fascinating theatre and the purpose of political show trials is partly to provide some relief or satisfaction for the suffering public out for revenge. Mr Barnes is outstanding at getting inside the heads of the protagonists, and some of the funniest moments are the monologues of the accused Petkanov. But he also provides witty asides into fashion, folklore, and history. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"You come upon pure evil between book covers as rarely as in real life. This is one such case. In this novel, the writer presents the proposition that the the true villains of the Liberation of 1989 were the dissidents, the true heroes the communists. That's right--Havel and Walensa are fiends, Ceaucescu, Andropov, and the rest giants. Imagine a serious literary figure publishing a book praising Hitler in say, 1950, and you've got the picture. That no such novel was ever published reveals how far the intellectual has deteriorated in our time.I'm glad I read this book, since it provides a facet of the Depths not to be found in Celine or Burroughs.

I generally love the classics and have a high tolerance for slow, plodding books, but I found this one painful.I understand that we should allow Lawrence a different standard for his portrayals of Mexico and \\"natives\\" since he was writing before our contemporary multicultural awareness. Nevertheless, I would expect insightfulness in his portrayal, whereas I found a simplistic racism. Had I finished the book, perhaps I would have found that he had more to say than what I have gleaned so far- that Mexico and Mexicans are evil, reptilian, and hopeless. That message was so repetitive that I had to give up on the book in order to save myself from the dark mood of the whole reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Sons and Lovers instead","review":"At times lyrically intoxicating, yet mostly just a flawed, rambling novel that gets painfully tedious towards the end, this is definitely one book by Lawrence that you can safely skip. It unfortunately isn't just bad writing - it's also a poor reflection of Mexican society. It makes you wonder how much time Lawrence actually spent in Mexico before he wrote the book. His depiction is stereotypical throughout, and often borders on racism. He seems to have skimmed the surface of Mexican culture, but he hasn't gone much deeper than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Narration ...","review":"One of the most boring books you'd ever read. The language is as rich as it'll ever get, but it used to narrte the muse of someone tethering on the verge of insanity. I've battled through 150 odd pages of the book and can't understand the premise. The ruthless (upto 5 times on every page) use of the word \\"naked\\" & \\"ruddy\\" gets irritating. I fail to understand as to why would the author think that people from Mexico are evil and are pulling the earth beings down. A dark & useless book.

I remain deeply impressed with the level of detail - it's written as a unit account in the manner of an S.L.A. Marshall book. I notice some complaints about the quality of the reprint and I think the reviews of some other edition migrated here. My copy (cover shows infantry attacking tank)has absolutely crisp typesetting throughout. However, the publisher warns that the images reproduced in the book are scanned photocopies, with some degradation. This is a good book that needed reviving.

He loves the neighing and galloping sounds that come from the rocker when you press the horse's ears, and he thinks he can't rock on it without the sounds first coming on! I love that there was NO assembly required. It's very soft and sturdy. It's the perfect height for a 1-2 year-old, and I like knowing that if he loses his balance he won't fall far. He is still getting the hang of getting on, but can get off easily. The toy says it is geared toward ages 1-3, but I would say age 3 is too old for this toy--by then a child will be too tall to really get much out of rocking on it.

It also seems very sturdy, with a wooden frame under the plush. I read some reviews of other rockers where people complained that their child was able to tip over while rocking.

By being skeptical about things and using the information and excercises this book provides, one can prepare himself to deal with a world that is mostly insane.

The authors style of writing and thinking also show some example of being outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author with BIG ego","review":"As a practising therapist and a reader of many psychology/self growth orientated books I found this one to be a little astounding in some instances. I found the very patriachal approach quite off putting.....especially in one part where the authors answer to a very unhappy wife with an abusive and neglectful husband was to advise her to have more sex with him! I didn't like this book at all, out dated, insensitive and patronising to women in its style and well behind the times in the present day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose a Different Book to Purchase","review":"This review is directed to anyone deciding whether to purchase this book and also read this book. Save your time and your money; there are books far better than this one. I don't agree with any of the 5 star ratings people gave this book. The authors are writing from an ego-centered perspective; they are critical of the patients they use in examples, and they are critical of readers in that they don't believe any of us are able to \\"self-help\\" correctly. If we are not able to self-help, it is because they do not explain how in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skunk Hour - Feeds the Soul","review":"A great album for off the wall house/funk/rap enthusiasts. A band of New Zealanders formed in Australia. Hard funky baselines, grooving rhythms and two contrasting singers. Mixes spoken lyrics with deep and powerful.Funky \\"Strange Equation\\" and \\"McSkunk\\", Soul-full \\"Up to our Necks in it\\", mixed with \\"Green light\\" and \\"Skeleton\\". Some serious lounge music... a must have for any lounge music fan, I can't go past this album for what it is, an awesome early variation on what is now considered \\"new age funk\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"Small writing area but very sturdy. I also bought copper ones that were very very thin. If these were twice as wide as they actually are they would be perfect, but there are no surprises. They look like the picture. At least one of the labels has a stain/defect - a light grey mark on it that will not come off. Not a deal-breaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valley's View","review":"When I first listened to the \\"State of Mind\\" cd I really \\"vibed\\" off the lyrics. Keith sings about things that people think about on a day to day basis,(consciously or subconsciously --the kind of world we are living in, the future of our children etc.)So not only do you have someone singing your thoughts out loud, the music that accompanies tells the same story instrumentally--it's like you're sharing your thoughts with friends.My favorite song is \\"Spiders\\" -- from the moment I heard that song I programmed my cd player for repeat. But I'm sure you'll enjoy the entire cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"I was disappointed when I got the book and looked through it. Nowhere on Amazon did I find the disclaimer that was in the book. This is published as a print on demand and has ALOT of typos and gibberish where the computer could not pick up the words. The company claims that this is to keep costs low, but I paid a good amount for this book. I was excited to find this title because I had looked before and never found it recently published. The typos are going to make it hard to read and took a lot of the enjoyment out of the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNFORTUNATE","review":"For a 11+ year collector like myself, this book has too much misinformation to be of much help. Unfortunately, two or three high price dealers do not make a price guide (although EBAY auctions can get higher prices depending who is bidding). Also, many particular items and/or factory lines are missing or sadly underrepresented. Many items or photos are repeated several times. I expected better from the cover photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPOINTED!","review":"I just recently discovered Wm. Coughlin by reading \\"The Judgement\\". I loved it and started searching for others. I read Heart of Justice after reading 5 others and cannot believe this was written by the same aurhor as the others. It is far inferior and I'm sure not written by a man (not saying a man could do better) as the way characters are depicted implies to me a woman is writing the prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be a phony one?","review":"This one was published after the author died over one or two years. It's a totally bad story and bad writing. Didn't look like a genuine work of Coughlin's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book??? Surely, NOT William Coughlin.","review":"This book could not possibly have been written by William Coughlin!! The writing style is completely different...and greatly inferior to his. The plot is slow and ponderous, and the dialogue is dull and amateurish compared to his other books. It's a shame that his name has been attached to a book that is so poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Then Zero","review":"I must have missed something, considering the amount of praise heaped on the author on the dust jacket, I thought I was about to read War and Peace. There was nothing new here, and the story line moved around like a heart monitor display - no consistent track - grabs something here, something there. This really is a very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not William Coughlin!","review":"After just a few pages I felt 100% certain that William Coughlin did not write this dreadful book. Read any of his Charley Sloan novels (especially \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\") and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is completely misleading","review":"To the best of my knowledge, there are freshwater fish and marine (saltwater fish). A book called \\"understanding FRESHWATER fish\\", so I would have thought, would include information about coldwater AND tropical fish, since both are, in fact, freshwater fish. This book, however contains information about ONLY coldwater fish. The title, therefore, should be, \\"understanding COLDWATER fish\\". Also, the author is ONLY Dick Mills; Gina Sanford's name appears nowhere in the book, as far as I could find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Little Light","review":"These make a great outdoor spotlight and the price is very reasonable. I replaced 3 of these that were the exact same light that had been up for almost 20 years. And this on a salt water front home and the lights are on the water front side. One did arrive with a bad bulb, but I decided it was cheaper to replace the bulb than to send it back. Shipping was prompt and they were seemingly well packaged (though see the previous sentence)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap","review":"I bought one of these and it was dead on arrival. Clock did not work. I returned it to the vendor and they sent me another. Once again dead on arrival. The clock did not work and also the time adjustment dial did not work either. I'm guessing based on my experience that this is just a low quality product all around. Why else would the two that I got be dead on arrival?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece!","review":"Couldn't wait to start reading this one after having read Mr. Simpson's first work, Until Death Do Us Part. This book was just as addictive. Mr. Simpson's style of writing is such that he brings you into the story physically somehow and you're wandering through the tale with the characters! This installment had me at the edge of my seat and once again got through this book in record time. You are missing out if you've not read this man's work. Bring on Unconditional Love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon deal of the day","review":"I got this for $27ish when it was Amazon's Deal of the Day. What a steal. The movies are great and it had all my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks","review":"Love his style of comedy. Enjoyed viewing the titles very much, good family entertainment, children are grown adults. Too funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks Collection. [Blu-ray] & Red Dwarf: The Complete Collection.","review":"Mel Brooks Collection. [Blu-ray]. Excellant price, arrived ahead of schedule. Very pleased. Thank you very much. Red Dwarf: The Complete Collection, came in the same package. It may be an older show, still makes me smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"BROOKS IS OFF NORMANs ROCKER","review":"They say imitation is the best form of flattery or maybe satire in this case. If you like Alfred Hitchcock and know the madness behind his method it is very likely that you will enjoy this picture. Brooks takes on the master of suspense and you should be amused. Brooks plays Dr. Thorndyke a psychiatrist who becomes the new director of a West Coast asylum. And so it starts... There are reference to \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"Spellbound,\\" \\"The Birds\\" and other Hitchcock classics which are very jolly indeed. Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman, Ron Carey and Dick Van Patten are all featured. It was also good to see the forgotten Howard Morris once again. Albert Whitlock who was responsible for \\"The Birds\\" did the special effects on this film! One great asset to this film was John Morris' brilliant score, which was a tribute to Bernard Herrmann."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel like I'm caught in a web...","review":"...a web between 2 Mel Brooks movies that is:) This and 'The Producers'. This movie is one of thoes comedies when while you're watching it you are thinking: \\"this is so stupid!\\" but after the movie is over, you think about it a few days later, and start cracking up! My favorite part is probably the end when the camera busts through the wall, that is just too funny! Oh and by the way, if you're a Hitchcock fan, see this movie! If you don't know who Hitchcock is and have never seen his films- then this movie will not be funny to you at all. The only reason I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the other Mel Brooks classic- 'The Producers'. I think that 'The Producers' is probably just about the funniest movie ever, and definatley Brooks' best film, with 'High Anxiety' trailing behind:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"I've enjoyed several of the mel brook films such as Blazing Saddles, Men in Tights and others in that same strain. I was incredibly satisfied with my purchase of this movie series as it is more of mel brooks at his best. Even though the other films may not have made such a large name for themselves they were definitely worth watching and rewatching. And as with all my business with Amazon so far the discs were delivered in perfect condition with no defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks Boxset's a winner","review":"I bought this boxset for my girlfriend. She's a Mel Brooks fanatic and can cite Brooks movies like they were Shakespeare. To quote Mel, \\"Dare I say it (dare, dare)?\\" She absolutely loved it. Great boxset - great Amazon price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed until my sides hurt!","review":"This was the first Mel Brooks film I ever saw, and I am thrilled to see a new generation enjoying it again. The humor sticks with you and the inside jokes are forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks Collection (Blu-ray)","review":"I am a huge Mel Brooks fan..such a talent! His movies are always so entertaining in a class of their own. He always keeps you laughing with a cast of notible stars. History of the World Part 1, as with Blazing Saddles and many others, you will have to watch dozen of times just to catch all the jokes, pranks and facial expressions. No matter how bad a day I have had, I can put in Mel's movies and laugh things away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most are cropped for widescreen look, shot full frame.","review":"FYI everyone, Mel Brooks only shot TWO films in wide screen: \\"Blazing Saddles\\" and \\"History of the World Part 1\\".If you compare the rest of the films to the original full frame laserdiscs you will see that FOX just masked off the top & bottom of the picture to make the films look widescreen. They should have been presented in full frame to give us the complete picture, some signs & faces get cut off.So now I have to keep my 1987 laserdiscs, even though these new transfers look sharper.The missing films not in this box set are not owned by 20th Century Fox. We are lucky they made a special arrangement with Warner Brothers to include Blazing Saddles (although it is the old master) in this set.\\"The Producers\\" , \\"Space Balls\\" and \\"Life Stinks\\" are owned by MGM.\\"Dracula Dead and Loving it\\" is distributed by Warner Brothers & owned by Castlerock."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup.\\"","review":"Oh, man, is this film quotable. Don't get me started. \\"He wanted to change the drapes.\\" That never fails to make me crack up.This movie is Mel's homage to Hitch, and it's so much fun from start to finish. I should mention that my favorite comedy film of all time is \\"Young Frankenstein\\", which I give five stars to.What a phenomenal cast (just like most of his films). Howard Morris, known as the wild Ernest T. Bass from The Andy Griffith Show, makes a wonderful Professor Lilloman (and Mel's mentor in the story). \\"Do you really think this is nessa-\\" \\"Of course it's nessa!\\"And this is highly rewatchable comedy. You giggle at Nurse Diesel's moustache, at the \\"coffee table\\" scene (\\"Finish your strudel\\"), the dollying movie camera that smashes through the wall, and so much more. Just deliriously silly comedy that they don't make anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies ever","review":"High Anxiety is one of the funniest movies ever.This proves the genius of Mel Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long. Plot not compelling.","review":"This film seems to have a degree of acclaim in certain circles; however, I cannot count myself among those that understand the appeal. The plot, in my opinion, is weak. The characters are two-dimensional. The ending is flimsy. I know that some people quite enjoy this film, so you may wish to decide for yourself based on available reviews and comments. As for myself, I could have found much better uses of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is with the BLANK DVD of Blazing Saddles","review":"This looks like a ripoff of some kind - absolutely nothing on the Blazing Saddles DVD! No name, no nothing...... completely blank DVD.... Can't afford to put a title on the outside?Love Mel Brooks, but should have bought the individual DVDs..$71.88 - forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, Mel Brooks is not a comic genius","review":"More of Mel Brooks's lame silly humor, or what passes for humor. He plays a psychiatrist. So what. It doesn't matter what he plays. This is just a vehicle for his silliness, and it isn't very funny. The first half hour was so lame that I had to walk away. Later I returned to it and it was mildly amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us the option to buy them separately","review":"The rating (similar to another review) is not low for the content but for the fact that Fox is so provincial that they haven't offered to release the titles separately. As mentioned in another review, most of us have the titles that have already been made available. Don't force us to buy copies of something we already own. Allow us to pick the titles we'd like to purchase or, at least, have a little common sense to offer a package of the titles that haven't already been released. Did someone at Fox let their 3-yr old put this together? C'mon.Enough said....separate the titles. Think, man...think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Release \\"men in tights\\" on it's own already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I've been waiting for \\"men in tights\\" to hit dvd for years now, and all they are doing is releasing it in this set???????

Box set..........smmmh","review":"See this a problem right here, all i was wantin was the Robin Hood : Men In Tights, I been waitin for years, now FOX put it in a box set where i gotta spend $70 for it? Box set before single releases, thats a mess. Yea im mad, I mad cuz its a marketing technique, the box set. I think it be fair to the consumer to sell them single. N 2 of the dvds in this set are already done released. So whats up with that? What Is Up With That?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel spoofs Hitch--and gets crapped on by pigeons for his effort","review":"Very little that is funny or works here. Loved The Producers, though (1968 original version.)Sorry, Mel. I know, comedy is tough to do. If it makes you feel any better, I think Sir Alfred is waaayoverrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME COLLECTION","review":"I received this in perfect condition! The movies are in excellent quality! It's been fantastic going down memory lane with Mel Brooks :-) I recommend this collection to any fan of Mel Brooks! It's GOOD to be THE KING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks is a genius!","review":"Mel Brooks' movies are top-notch. They are a laugh-a-minute roller-coaster ride. Every plot is clever, the characters are humorous, and the action non-stop. These movies are definitely a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Box full of laughs","review":"This box set is just packed full of laughs for any mel brooks fan, bought it for my dad for christmas and I can't wait to sit down on the couch and laugh with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect service!","review":"The item came exactly as described, right on time, and at a great price! I couldn't ask for better service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Collection","review":"This is a great deal for a great price. It is missing a few of what I would say are excellent Mel Brooks films (The Producers comes to mind), but that's not enough to subtract a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fox Oversight","review":"Many reviewers and fans have taken this boxed set to task for not having commentaries from Brooks on more of the films. While he might not have been willing to record new ones, he did a full length commentary for the laserdisc of \\"Robin Hood: Men In Tights\\" and Fox didn't even bother to include that audio track on its DVD release. It was \\"necessa,\\" and they blew it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boxed Sets","review":"This is not so much a review as it is a comment about boxed sets.As far as the movies included in this set I already own three of them, Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles & To Be Or Not To Be. I have been looking for \\"Robin Hood, Men In Tights\\" since it came out (I thought). Its cost through Amazon Satellite Stores is almost $60. Blazing Saddles is not one of my favorite movies, now I will have two copies,Young Frankenstein is great, but again now I will have two copies. I've never heard of twelve chairs and am not really interested in History Of The World or Silent Movie, which brings me to my point. I cannot understand why the studios make these boxed sets. This purchase for me is a ONE TIME deal as boxed sets really turn me off. It almost seems as though studios include movies that they might not be able to sell as a stand alone movie (Twelve Chairs)and look at boxed sets only as increasing the bottom line rather than customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"never buy again","review":"The video color faded in and out like it was a pirated copy. It also froze up toward the end for a few seconds. I will not buy anymore videos from you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Not release The New Films Seperately??","review":"I've given this release a one star review not because of the films, all of which I love, but because it included several which have been available on DVD for many years and because there are no seperate releases listed for the new-to-DVD films.I have no intention of buying this set. If and when the new-to-DVD films are released on their own, I'll be first in line to buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"One thing is STILL missing...","review":"DRACULA DEAD AND LOVING IT! why hast though foresaken it, mel?as much as i see people ignore or hate on it, it is a good funny little movie, and is necessary to cll this set \\"complete\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks Blu-Ray Collection is EXCELLENT!","review":"I love Mel Brooks.

I really can't say anything bad about it except it is missing The Producers. It's good to be the king..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bargain, Yet!","review":"For those who like Mel Brooks and are upgrading from tape to DVD, this is a bargain. Not every film is equally strong, but Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Robin Hood: Men in Tights are worth the price of this collection alone. Not all are the films are comedies, but most are. The bonus material is OK, particularly a long interview with Mel Brooks that is really just an audio track. This interview gives some real insight into how the creative process works for Brooks. Happy endings are a part of the Mel Brooks tradition, and these are found here, along with his unique style of humor that pokes fun at everyone and everything... even Mel Brooks himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazing Saddles is an \\"Edited\\" Edition","review":"Many fans who grew up watching Mel's early movies of the 60's and 70's, would probably agree that \\"Blazing Saddles\\" (along with the first \\"Producers\\" and \\"Young Frankenstein\\") represents his finest work. Therefore, I was disappointed to discover that a number of classic scenes have been cut from this version of \\"Blazing Saddles.\\" In a single casual viewing, I noticed that (at least) the following scenes are missing:1) The scene where Mongo is tricked by Sheriff Bart into duelling with a mechanical sheriff.2) The scene where Mongo is tricked by Sheriff Bart into diving down the town's well to search for hidden treasure.3) The scene where the gibberish-speaking prospector (\\"Gabby Johnson\\") tries to explain why the dynamite didn't go off.Yes, getting all these great Mel Brooks movies for under $60.00 was a great value. But to have Brooks' \\"crown jewel\\" edited in such a way was a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"MPeg2 - Quality","review":"I may had too much expectation and I was hoping these are actually BlueRay quality but they are Mpeg-2 DVD quality that their resolution have been upscaled. What you get is grainy images in most scenes and distortion in shot cuts. To those who will comment about my equipment calibration etc. I must say save your breath, I have top of theline samsung TV which shows most Bluerays great. Just handfull have sud-standard coding and this collection is one of them. This review is not about the movies and is (Story, acting, ...) only about blueray coding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Mel Brooks!","review":"I scored this collection on a day when it was on sale and I was stoked!!

A special treat is having that wonderful scene with Anne Bancroft, Mel's better half. A question - whatever happened to Charlie Callas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite comedy movie of all time","review":"This homage to Alfred Hitchcock is a work of genius. The shower scene in this movie remains one of the best parodies ever. Madeline Kahn's role is one of her best and Cloris Leachman looks as if she enjoyed playing her character. The casting in this movie is inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anamorphic copies of Young Frankenstein do exist","review":"I ordered this set from Amazon and my copy of Young Frankenstein definitely was anamorphic. I was lucky to have gotten one of the correct copies. If you got a non-anamorphic copy of YF you should call Fox or exchange it where you bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a look whether you're a Brooks fan or not","review":"If you love Mel Brooks, you've probably already seen this one, but if you're newly discovering this amazingly funny man, include this one on your must-see list. Brooks is a psychiatrist with high anxiety, which means he gets totally scared when he is forced to go up in elevators, buildings, etc. The clinic he is working at has strange things going on, and it's up to Brooks to save the day. All the gang from Brooks' others are here, including Harvey Corman (who is drop dead funny in a werewolf encounter), and Cloris Leachman as Nurse Diesel is pretty scary. While not his best film (it tends to drag a little in spots, and doesn't have the outrageousness of others), it is quite funny and well done. It'll make you think twice about feeding pigeons. For real belly laughs, rent or buy Brooks' \\"History of the World\\"; one of the classics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooks and Hitchcock Make for a Fruitless Marriage","review":"An opaque send-up of Alfred Hitchcock's legendary suspense pictures, this probably sounded better on paper than it looks on the screen. It's to be expected for a Mel Brooks movie to be filled to the brim with cheap puns, obvious punchlines and loads of sight gags - that's part of his allure, actually - but this seems thin even by those standards. A basement-level plot might have something to do with that; beneath the dense surface of each of Brooks's best pictures lies a surprisingly rich, inherently funny basic storyline. That's missing in this dim, forced tale of good, evil and jealousy in the hallways a California psychiatric ward. If Blazing Saddles is a novella, High Anxiety is a two-page pamphlet. It's got some value, but not enough to justify a very long sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars for the movie, one star for the DVD","review":"I'd like to start out by saying, the MOVIE is fantastic. I absolutely love it.The DVD, however? I've bought it twice, NEW. And each time, the foil within the DVD has been so degraded, the movie is unable to be played on my DVD player(s).If you're going to buy it, buy it from someone who is selling a \\"Like New\\" used version. At least THEN, you'll know that the DVD has been tested."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK.....","review":"Well then I guess it is unanimous!

Endless humor. New details come up at every viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks Movies Still Funny","review":"I was much younger when I thoroughly enjoyed movies as Blazing Saddles. As with the original Archie Bunker episodes, the shock element of the scatological & sexually and racially offensive language used is now quite offensive to me, and I'm a bit ashamed that I once roared with laughter. Such language has been over-used and has become fully uncouth rather than funny. Maybe I'm a victim of maturity? But I still gave the collection four stars as I realize back to the original time/venue - it was meant to be absurd in the extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks","review":"Mel Brooks - what can you day?

Spoofs of everything are his forte. Political correctness is not a priority in a Mel Brooks production, but he is never mean spirited. His company of actors make everything work. I love this film and spent money to own and enjoy it.

Brilliantly crafted parody fits with the perfect comical acting of Kahn, Leachman, Korman and even Brooks himself.

But the DVD was damaged even though it was suppose to be new. It had an obvious scratch on it and hung up in several places. I notified Amazon of this problem and they sent me a label to send it back to them which meant I had to make a trip to the local UPS facility. They told me they would credit my account but would not send a replacement because it had been shipped by a sub contractor.

All these movies were done so long ago that no one should expect HD quality but alas once you see DVD you expect it.

Most of the music he's put out is forgettable, but every once in a while he just knocks me over with an original song or cover.I wasn't expecting much from this CD. How's a Claremont, California boy going to hold his own against a sturdy, first class gospel group? But somehow this marriage works. Harper's slide guitar adds a nice dimension to standard gospel arrangements. But it's his voice that shines here. Who'd have thought he could be this soulful?This is just plain good music. There are better gospel albums out there to be sure. They're just too raw for popular consumption. For gospel for the masses, this album does a fine job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhhhh.......the world of Sweet Valley..........","review":"Meet the Wakefelds.

WHAT a heartbreak. So let's see....she steals her twin sister's crush....oh GREAT IDEA!!!!!There's Liz.I thought oh HERE'S a realistic chariter. RIGHT. She turns out to be the snivling little whimp that kind of reminds you of a deer hiding in the woods all the time. Of couse she's got that perfict hair, eyes and waist as well.EW oh give me a break!!!!!!!! Senior Year is MUCH better, and so is the new series by Ann M. Martin called Friends Forever.

They are adored by their friends, families, and let's face it, the world. Yeah right. Elizabeth, Ms. Goody-Two-Shoes, lets her twin sister Jessica worm and scheme her way into everything. Liz is supposed to be a brain, but is instead, a whiny pushover who can't help but be boring. At least Jessica is selfish and manipulative to even things out. Um, if you think that's how people live in real life...well, you need to move to Sweet Valley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a cliche!!!","review":"The author of this book does so much stereotyping it makes me sick! I mean, Jessica is the typical blonde, blue-eyed (rah-rah) type cheerleader riding in a red Fiat convertable. Can you get anymore cliched? It gets boring after awhile hearing about the sunny California sky & blue-green water & white sand beach. It's so unrealistic! Everyone is rich, everyone has a pool in their backyard, everyone has cars, every woman is a perfect size six figure. This is not a healthy book for an adolescent to read! A child the age of 12 is going to think she is less beautiful because she is not a size six & does not have blonde hair & blue eyes. And Ms. Pascal needs to be more realistic when it comes to situations in the book. I am so sick & tired of Jessica Wakefield getting her way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is just the beginning . . .","review":"Elizabeth and Jessica are identical twins living in Sweet Valley, California.

What guy wouldn't want Jessica? So she swallows her love for him and tries to forget about him.Jessica chases after Todd relentlessly. But he just isn't interested. She drops him once she sees how \\"boring\\" he is. This leaves Elizabeth free to go out with Todd, who only wanted Elizabeth from the beginning.I really liked this book. The plot itself is realistic, two girls falling for the same guy. I have to admit that the twin thing and their lifestyle is a little unrealistic, but hey, it's a book, go with it. All in all, a pretty good read. And to think this book was only the beginning . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book I've read","review":"I'm sorry but this has to be the worst book in the entire SVH series. How many identical sixteen year old girls are that beautiful in real life. Puh-leaze. Perfert size six figures, eyes the color of the Pacific Ocean, hair spun like gold. I can't believe how ridiculous this book was. Are we supposed to believe that two sisters who are really that close would fight over the same boy! As an identical twin myself my twin sister and I would never fight over the same guy the way the Wakefield sisters were. And Todd and Elizabeth have got to be the two stupidiest people throughtout the book. Instead of admitting their feelings to one another we have to sit through Todd pining away for Elizabeth and vice versa. Why didn't they just open their mouths up to begin with? The other books in the series are much better than this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Valley High","review":"My teenage daughter loved this old series....the publisher should consider updating the cover art and re-releasing....they could definitely find a whole new audience of teenage girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was obsessed!","review":"I loved the Sweet Valley High books when I was in junior high! I remember going to the bookstore about once a month and buying the latest book about Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield and their friends' adventures. I would often read each book in one day. These books bring back a lot of fun memories of my early teen years. I still have a large collection of Sweet Valley High books. I don't know if these stories would appeal to young girls of today, but I do know that many other girls loved these books as much as I did in the '90s!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They ruined it","review":"I went to my local bookstore and saw they were re-releasing Sweet Valley High and I was excited because now I could finish my collection, I had no idea they were rewritten and when I was reading one of the books in the store I was shocked to realize this. I almost flipped out.I can see the whole email thing and cell phones but changing story lines and characters and other stuff wasn't necessary they pretty much rewrote the second book. This is very upsetting.They didn't need to change their sizes from a 6 to a 4. Teenage girls already have issues about that and now they are trying to say a size 6 is too fat? Since when?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the original","review":"As a self-proclaimed SV addict I followed the series throughout my teenage years and began re-reading them well into my late 20's and early 30's for nostalgia's sake. I was so excited about the re-release, yet after I read the first book I was very disappointed. It's as though the authors are trying to hard to compete with Gossip Girls. I didn't buy the updates and \\"modern\\" language and I doubt teenagers will either. As much as I would love to see this series continue to grow (and I am anticipating Sweet Valley Confidental or Sweet Valley Heights) I think the biggest fanbase will be readers like me- those looking for a bit of nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The PERFECT size 4!\\"","review":"I was so thrilled when I found out they were rerelasing the SVH books.Then, I found out the shocker: As if a size 6 wasn't perfect and threatening enough, they've gone and made it a size 4!Come on, people! There's enough pressure out there today. Why not the perfect 10, 12 or 14..or why \\"perfect\\" at all?!?!I, for one, will spend my money on the rereleases of LJ Smith's novels, and the new Baby-Sitter's Club graphic novels.

So you can imagine how happy I felt when she told me it feels cool after a few seconds of spraying her back and relieved the pain enough to stop taking Alleve every morning. I also got her a gel-filled heating pad that wraps around her waist and back which she puts over the spray application. So we're back to smiling again, thank heavens!The only improvement I hope for is that it relieves her pain 100%. Right now relief is something she is grateful for, however. Otherwise, I would've given it a 5-star.What I like about it is that it is all-natural, no added toxic chemicals or other additives.

While a spray can help you reach areas you can't as well with a roll-on, it also can make a bit of a mess and get to areas you don't want it to. But it just doesn't work as well as Biofreeze, which I've gone back to. Biofreeze goes on easily and the scent disappears (which would be nice for Tiger Balm, which is the best but the smelliest), and is a far better product than Cryoderm."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker of a book..:(","review":"I probably would never have had this book in hand if not for buying it for 25 cents at a tag sale..I am a loyal Red Sox fan, have been for many years and thought I would give it a browse..after the first few chapters I found it to be clearly a ME ME ME, I, I, I, sort of book, Damon loves Damon, that is one thing that is clear in the book... after he left the Red Sox high and dry for the almighty more $$$$$ I really had no use for him..he got what he deserved the first time he came back to Fenway and stood up at the plate..you cant be a Judas and expect to be welcomed with open arms. A badly written book, Im glad I did not spend any more then 25 cents for it, in fact I never finished it.

I was really excited to pick up this book, especially in light of beating \\"The Curse\\". This is a great book for Red Sox fans and baseball fans alike. It goes into alot of detail about Johnny's road to the majors but mostly its a blow by blow description of the 2003 and 2004 seasons from Johnny's viewpoint. Initially it took me by surprise how Johnny sees himself in terms of his talent and his role on his various teams. He came off as vain and a bit of a bragger but after I finished the book I see that he is a great ballplayer and he takes pride in the game, his teammates and his place in baseball and he should be very proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh....","review":"I am a huge Red Sox fan and I used to be a big Johnny Damon fan too. After reading this book, I dont see him in the same light. He is constantly talking about how he is such a great player, how the team couldnt win without him and blah blah blah. He loves himself a bit too much. It gets a bit boring throughout the book, and I found that hard and odd considering last season was very exciting. Having Damon talk about how they would have won more games if he had played those games shows that he is NOT a team player. Don't bother wasting money on this. This book was obviously written just to make a quick buck....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny is a Jerk","review":"Yes, that's right. My mistake as a die hard Red Sox fan was reading this book. I used to think of him as a smart intelligent baseball player, but after reading his autobiography, I flinch each time he steps up to the plate.REASONS WHY JOHNNY IS A JERK...he compares himself to Ted Williams, gets pissed off he didn't make the All Star team, admits for using a seperate cell phone for his one-nights stands (while mentioning his two year old twins only twice in the entire book....HE MENTIONS HIS HAIR more often that that), and solely credits himself for winning the Championship...so much for team player!I am still a die hard Sox fan, and after reading Damon's book, I wish he never got a ring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...he is an idiot (or whoever wrote it)","review":"This book was written like a 17 year old suffering from ADHD. It jumps around and repeats itself so much, it's difficult to follow an even flow. He comes off a little like a braggart and kind of a dunce with very little depth to him. Its too bad, I like him as a ball player, but the book made my head spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy Book","review":"Johnny Damon seems like a really great guy, but this book is pretty darned lousy.My biggest problem with it is that he is too nice, and says nothing negative about anyone. After a while, I got tired of reading page after page about how every 60 win team was scrappy and difficult to beat as well as how every journeyman ballplayer that he ever played against or with was so talented and had the best \\"stuff\\" he had ever seen. There was nothing interesting and this was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointing...","review":"I am glad I read this book before I saw Johnny Damon in a Yankee uniform, because the book is boring and could have been written by a tenth grader.

I can happily look at Johnny Damon in Yankee gear and know it's no loss to the Red Sox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick To Baseball","review":"Idiot is a good title for this book because it's written more like a high school dropout than a high school graduate.

And I was not disappointed by it. It was writen well considering a baseball player wrote it.

The guy holds his own against Frey and Walsh and more than carries his weight.Aside from the above stated, it's a great concert that I'd rank up there beside \\"The Last Waltz\\".

Besides the incredible music, the change from song to song (what a great, wide range of music styles), the quality of this DVD was incredible. Walsh's true beauty in lead guitar really shows up on disk 2. Henley may look older (and even more handsome) but his voice hasn't changed one day - stunning.

If you don't like the Eagles, you probably didn't buy this. I grew into whatever passes for my maturity with them as part of the background music.

They fire Don Felder and still carry on with this tour. Sorry, it has turned into a Vegas act. How many side musicians do you need, anyway?

I use this disk as my demo disk when I really want to show people what High-Definition is all about. If any Eagles fans read this, it would be worth it to try and find a HD/DVD player (they should be pretty cheap these days) and get a copy of this disk. Believe me, you won't be disappointed!

They also include There's A Hole In The World, a tribute to 9/11."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE: Not worth purchasing if you don't have DTS","review":"I'm not throwing any rocks and stones at the band. Their performance is top notch and the song selection is a true representation of their best. Perhaps Witchy Woman should have formed part of the set but only they know why it was not included.My main gripe about this purchase is that we are not offered a Dolby 5.1 surround sound track. The fine folks at Warner Music Vision & ERC have decided that if you do not possess a DTS system, you will be punished by being forced to listen to the DVD in 'glorious' PCM (2-channel speaker) stereo.Is there a legit reason why there is no Dolby 5.1 surround sound track?This is a true sign of disrespect towards not only the fans of The Eagles but to all consumers.Review by Brian Grindrod"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful with this one.","review":"I had seen this prior to ordering - Awesome concert - however, I purchased 2 DVDs for gifts from Amazon and neither worked.

I noticed a couple of things with the audio that I wasn't too crazy about, however. One, it doesn't sound like a concert but sounds more like a studio recording because the acoustics of the arena and the audience noise is minimal. So it sounds like they are in your living room rather than being viewed in a large hall concert venue. Some of you may prefer that, but the sound doesn't match the setting to me. Secondly, the bass, especially the kick drum, is very prominent in the mix. I had to turn down the subwoofer a few notches to make it more balanced.The concert itself is great - they play a wide selection of their hits and the musicianship is precise. Very well done, but with the caveats on the audio portion I mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good memories","review":"We really enjoyed this album several years go when it was first released.

Anyone who wishes to buy this should not have any doubts and will never ever regret for buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars for an excellent show","review":"One thing you can say about the Eagles is that they don't cheat you on their effort. This package includes the 175 minute concert which carries over to disc 2 on DVD. There are some additional interviews on disc 2 as well. The DVD is beautifully shot with thoughtful direction and includes a DTS 5.1 audio track along with PCM Stereo.The Eagles are more than 4 these days, at least when they tour. Here there are 8 additional musicians including a horn section and some terrific guitar work by Steuart Smith. Skimpy on new material, the boys manage to add some verve to the 30 songs here. They are one of the few groups from long ago that manage to do that. There is no denying their impact on popular music over the years. They are great musicians, excellent song writers and can harmonize as well as anyone. They remain relevant in the music world which is evident by their sold out shows across the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"it was totally awesome and very well done and enjoyed watching the whole tape and friends enjoyed as well...go eagles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert!","review":"The best of the entire catalog!

Great A/V production with more songs than the other Eagles concerts, and needless to say, this group has one of the best combination of American musicians playing as a band and their Grammy music awards speak for themselves. I've seen their first two 40th-anniversary concerts here in Vegas 2012 but this video outweighs these Vegas performances as far as the number of songs they played.

As much as I enjoy many of the songs - No More Cloudy Day is the main reason for purchasing this DVD. It's great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Fan","review":"This performance was simply the best. I saw this on NBC with my wife and daughter. I told them that I saw the Eagles in concert just after Joe Walsh joined them when Bernie Leadon left. Randy Meisner was still on bass.

The characters are decent, nothing more. The story is alright, nothing more. The music is passable, nothing more. In other words this movie is mediocre and slow. I tried to sit through this but it just takes to long to do what it does. This could have been a much shorter movie and it would have been better. It is obvious they tried to stretch this out to be televised over a week as a mini-series. I suggest you rent this first. It may put you to sleep and regretting you listened to one of the reviews praising it. Although a decent family movie, it should be watched over 2 or 3 sittings to keep boredom from setting in.

It was an awful movie that was drawn out to it's fullest extent. The humor was crude and suggestive, and many of the main characters had swearing problems. The trolls were incredibly annoying and looked as if they had stepped right out of the '80s. The characters were undeveloped, excepting only the Wolf who did a very good job. However, I was disgusted at how sex was so widely accepted in this movie.

I had missed the beginning though. When I bought the DVD I sat down and watched the whole thing (it's 7 hours long). My children loved this movie. They asked to watch it over and over again. None of them are over the age of 6. Wolf made the movie wonderful. His acting ability made me look up every thing he's ever done just to watch him again. The New York scene in the beginning is unbelievable. The twin towers sinking out of sight is eriely forebodding. The extras on the DVD are worth the little extra you pay. I laughed so hard there were tears. Another reviewer complained about the moral aspect of Wolf and Virginia's romp in the grass. She must not realize that the original fairy tales have had their \\"questional morality\\" removed to appeal to the broader market of children.

I forgot it for a long time, but then started trying to remember a certain movie with faeries in it...I thought of this one although it doesn't have faeries... nonetheless I remember liking this movie. I recently bought it on DVD and watched it with my boyfriend who has never seen it. I'm afraid I got him hooked! Sometimes the movie seems too long, but it's the kind of movie you never want to turn off because every scene it's something new. One of the best magical journey movies I ever watched. I really love the message it's trying to say too. I really love the acting, which started out kind of choppy, but gotten a lot better during the movie. I'm also very drawn to Wolf, I guess like ever girl out there is. Hehe. This is a great family movie, but I probably wouldn't let really young kids watch it. It's a great adultish faery tale movie. :) WE WANT A SEQUEL!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A film ahead of its time","review":"I was referred to this DVD a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed watching it as a DVD. If it were released today, it would be a huge hit. The concept is similar to the new TV series ONCE UPON A TIME or GRIMM but done with the style and deft touch of the first SHREK. It is a play on fairy tale characters interacting with modern day New Yorkers. There are scenes - one in particular of two villains in a rowboat - that make you laugh so hard you can't breathe. If you look at the credits, you'll be amazed at the well-known actors in this not so well known film. I've watched it twice now and will likely do so again...and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Scenes","review":"I loved the mini-series and was very excited to be able to see it again on VHS. I couldn't wait for it to come out. It's a fun adventure that addresses today's social relationships within families and also between friends. It has may comical moments, and really made me laugh out loud. My favorite scene is when Wolf talks with the Psychologist. It great when he says, \\"I just met a girl, and I don't know whether to eat her or marry her!\\" Unfortunately, many scenes are cut out on this VHS version, including my personal favorite noted above. I do not recommend buying it if you've seen the original. There's too much missing.

However the picture and sound quality is so poor I would have done better to record it off the T.V. with the irritating commercials left in.

I would have preferred not having to explain to my children why Wolf and Virginia were having a baby without being married, it would have been nice if that little bit could have been left unsaid. 95% of this movie is very fun and most of the double entendres went right over my kids heads, which I appreciated. It's a great movie for parents and kids to watch together because mom and dad get all of the jokes and the kids just enjoy the silliness of the whole thing. The production values and cast are absolutely first rate Kimberly Williams, John Larroquette, Scott Cohen, Dianne Wiest, Rutger Hauer, Camryn Mannheim, Ann-Margret, EVERYONE did an outstanding job.

I have to say, though, that I was supremely disappointed by the quality of this film! Most of the acting was embarrassingly bad and the script wasn't that good, either.

It was slow in the begining but once it got going it got going. I did like that they did show the other side to fairy tales & what couldve happened after the \\"Happily Ever After\\", the original grimm fairy tales were very violent and served as a warning for children, so they did keep a darker side instead of ignoring it. The Trolls were annoying after a while with there 3 stooges slapstick. Some complain about the contemporary themes but then again, they story is about two people from Now going into a \\"Fairy Kingdom\\" so u expect some modern themes to come thru.I watched this DVD with my niece and nephew and they love it...they like the fact that it is modern and isnt a boring fairy tale to them, its holds there very short attention spans and not too many movies can do that.

So no matter how good the movie turned out to be, at least I'd have a lot of it. The 10th Kingdom is not a great movie. In fact I once made a few of my friends sit down and watch it and they wouldn't go past 2 hours. But they are pretty busy guys. The movie is good, and no one says you can't watch it in a few sittings. It's not very complicated or deep, but it is entertaining and captivating, and its basis in fairy tales makes it familiar. There is also a cool map on the DVD of the 9 kingdoms. At less than 5 cents per minute, this DVD may be the best bargain out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of Another","review":"This movie had it all, suspense, drama, love, and adventure. Diane Weist was excellent in her role as the queen and the chemistry between Wolf and Virginia was wonderful. It is refreshing to see a fantasy that doesn't deal with demons and of the sort. Even though those nagging, annoying trolls appeared way to often, the movie was great. The movie was quite long and might be to much for a young person to handle. But for adults, it's a trip back to your childhood where at one time, all this was real to you. The only problem I had with the movie was the actress cast as Snow White. She just didn't have it. I pictured Snow White as a young Beauty, but now she's portrayed as a housewife who sleeps all day.

I thought it was moronic. Most of the characters are incompetant idiots who are overdrawn and overacted. They were the type of characters I would expect to find in a movie for 5-to-7-year-olds. However, there is so much sexual innuendo in this movie that it can't possibly be meant for that age range. Essentially, it was a bunch of silly, irritating characters trying to express adult themes. It just didn't work.To be fair, maybe it got better further in, but I doubt it. I don't think I made it past the first DVD. I donated the whole set to a rummage sale. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst TV movie ever made!!!","review":"I decided to take a risk on this film because of the great reviews. I am the essential kid at heart. If it brings out the kid in me then I love it, yet this movie left me cold. I give it 1/2 star because there were some funny moments in the movie and another 1/2 for some decent special effects, but otherwise it [was no good]. The acting, with the exception of Diane Wiest, was sickening. The script and everything about the movie failed to entertain. It's almost like one extremely bad romance novel that has gone way way over board. If I had children I would never let them watch this because it is way too indepth, and there are some very un-child like scenes. This movie was sooooo horrible. I had to force myself to continue watching. It was soooo bad. If you are looking for enjoyable entertainment for the entire family bypass on this movie.

I had never seen it but she rented the movie. It took it all of 2 days to watch it but it was well worth it. I couldn't think about anything else. The mystery and the chases. They were all the things I look for in imagination. This movie was my fantsay. I absoluty loved it and would recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"I can't wait to see this movie uninterrupted. I think I would have enjoyed it much better without a commercial every 5 minutes. If you like fairy tales, this is the best series to watch.

The scenes were awesome and you will wish that there actually was a different kingdom that we can visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD is definitely better than the VHS version","review":"Just received the DVD today, I browsed thru them, all 3 DVD discs. Definitely better than the VHS set (got from NBC) because it's 7 1/2 hours long.

I have never felt this way about a movie before. It was sweet, entertaining, and I fell in love with the characters. My favorite is Wolf. He was so charming and funny.

It's a wonderful fairy tale which starts in modern New York and then in an Alice in Wonderland kind of way changes to fairy tale reality. Due to circumstance outside their control Virginia and her father enter fairy tale reality and in the process of trying to get back home meet fantastic creature after fantastic creature of both good and evil intent and nature and as in all fairy tales they learn something about themselves. I thought all main characters well-chosen and I enjoyed watching them. I most admire the wolfman's performance and I wonder at how he kept the energy at such a high level throughout. It's wonderful DVD to own and watch once in a while. Maybe after a hard week at work when you need a dose of magical to keep you going."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mini-seriews","review":"I just finished watching this series again. This series is a great combination of the modern world and the fairytales that we all grew up with. I also appreciated the use of a creative vocabulary so that I didn't have to endure endless curse words.I wouldn't recommend watching all three parts in one setting, though. We spread it out over several evenings. Although it's appropriate for older kids, I think that they would miss some of the hidden alegories. Also, this isn't the neat kids fairytales--it's closer to the origial Grimm's fairytales."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"This movie was great!

After the first 3 hours, she was kind of bored with it and wanted to stop watching (especially since there were 2 discs left to watch). Then, towards the end of the first disc, and definately the beginning of the second disc, it started getting more interesting. As long as you can sit through the first 3 hours of plot building, you will definately like this movie. It is full of adventure, mystery, and fairy tales, with twists and turns that you wouldn't expect. I would definately recommend this movie (especially since it's only 12 dollars for around 8-9 hours of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"My best friend lend this video to me and told me how good it was. At first, I wasn't very interested. But, after watching, I must say that it's an excellent movie!

This is a film that will definitely appeal to people of ALL ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Listen to the Critics...","review":"Fairy tales have always been cheesy, yet enormously entertaining. When the critics pounced on The Tenth Kingdom, they weren't thinking of how much life was breathed into the stories we all heard as children.

Don't let a few embittered, OLD critics tell you that you can't find simple joy in this work of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 10th Kingdom","review":"I love this movie.

I was riveted to the TV screen when it aired and was so sad when it ended. Thank goodness for DVD! I've watched this mini-series so many times, I know it by heart. It's often on in the background just so I can listen to it.At about 7 hours long, it's a great way to lull away a free day (like any of us has those just laying around). Be sure to watch it at least once. I'd recommend it for kids 12 and up. There are some parts not appropriate for the little ones (sexual references, murder)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewer: Big Zach NOT A KIDS REVIEW!

SERIES EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. IT WAS CRUDE IN BOTH THE STORY LINE AND SCRIPT. FAIRY TALES HAVE A MYSTERY ABOUT THEM WHICH COUNTERBALENCES THE CRUELTY. THE CREATORS OF THIS SERIES,COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTANDING THE POINT OF FAIRY TALES, TAKE THE WORST ASPECTS OF THE STORIES AND USE THEM FOR CHEAP EFFECT,WHICH IS HEIGHTENED BY THE VERY UNSUBTLE PERFOMANCES BY MOST OF THE ACTORS. NOT WORTH THE WATCHING TIME OR THE COST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever but slow","review":"The movie, though cleverly plotted, lacked percision when it came to makeup and setting. The characters of fairy tale legends looked more dolled up \\"trolls\\". It was also far to long, and no matter how great a movie may be, not many people can sit through something over two hours. The acting ranged from excellent to poor, with an exceptional prefromance from \\"the evil stepmother\\". But the slow pace makes even the most avid of movie go-ers feel confined and bored.

I bought the DVD set as soon as it came out and find myself watching it over and over again. It is such a well-rounded story, sprinkled with both overt and subtle references to the fairy tales we grew up hearing and reading about. The end of the series hinted at a sequel, but after 11 years and no news, I assume either it hasn't been written or it hasn't been picked up by a network. I would faithfully watch a series sequel of The 10th Kingdom if it was written by Simon Moore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"The movie is awesome! It has been so hard to find it anywhere, and when I did it was extremely expensive. I even went as far as to buy a copy online for $100 just because I love it so much, to find out that it only played in Europe. I ordered a copy of this movie on Amazon, and got it three days later. I popped it into my DVD player, and it worked! Bonus: I got it for less than half the price of the previous copy I bought! I love Amazon. Oh, and the person I got it from also included a note for me in the package. I love getting notes like that. I feel like my purchase is valued, unlike other places like Ebay.The 10th Kingdom takes all the fairy tales you read as a child and morphs them into one. It has romance, action, adventure, horror, ect. all in one! I definitely recommend watching this movie. It's eight hours long, so it takes a little time to watch, but it is so worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Movie Series","review":"Not to be missed.

It is long (approx 6 hours), but you'll be glued to your seat, not wanting it to end! I'm hoping there's a sequel because I fell totally in love with these characters, especially Wolf & Virginia. This movie is great for the whole family, if you love fantasy, action, romance, adventure and comedy. Adults will love all the scenes that go over their kids' heads. My friend commented that in some of the scenes if you weren't watching and just listening you would do a double-take! \\"What did he say! \\" Lots of sexual inuendos. Lots of comedy.

Didn't care so much for the immasculation of the male characters for the sake of empowering the female characters, but that's par for the course these days with super powerful heroines like Xena and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Furthermore most of the actors are very good (except for those who are... well... not). In better hands this could have been a brilliant production. Some people clearly love this show, but to do that, you have to turn a blind eye to its failings. (Love is blind, though, is it not?) In good fiction, the plot feels like a natural extension of the characters choices. In this production, the characters are dragged from plot point to plot point like some absurd relay race. It strained my suspension of disbelief until it snapped. By the third act, I was literally throwing my hands in the air in frustration.I instead recommend \\"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles\\" novels by Patricia C.

First off, I needed to rewind the video, which tells me that it was not new. Ok fine. Slightly used. No big deal, I can deal with having to rewind something. However, after rewinding, when we tryed to watch it, it was unwatchable. I don't even know how to describe it. Flashes of white every second or so as if you were trying to watch it through a thunderstorm or something. And not just in the beginning, but through the whole thing - beginning, middle and end. I was very disappointed. I thought \\"Friends of the Library\\" would understand the importance of product representation, but I was wrong. I will never purchase anything from them again.

Just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric At Best.","review":"Two (2) Stars--and that's being generous--is the most I can give this film. Sorry to say that--for ME--it was a severe disappointment, too sophomoric in plot/script/execution/direction but with some--only some--interesting special effects. Yes, the CONCEPT is a good one, but it never comes to fruition in this film with flawed character development [too comic strip simplistic] and only the Evil Queen barely believable in her malice. If you MUST, rent it vs buying it for viewing or else you're wasting your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a fantasy","review":"I love fantasy and magic realism. However, this is not really a fantasy film. It's a frenetic series of adventures featuring a group of bumbling characters who somehow manage to do things right by accident once in a while. The humor is slapstick. The atmosphere is not magical. It's a predictable type of Hollywood film dressed up with a bunch of special effects, plus special side jokes for New Yorkers. And it's tiresomely, tediously long. I could barely get through it.

Even though it's 6 1/2 hours long, it's great for kids who are sick in bed, or a family when they are vacationing or on holiday. I really LOVED this movie, and if you are ANYTHING at all like me, you'll love it too. It has faries, swamps, evil witches, trolls, talking dogs, princes, warewolves and more.

It combines humor, drama, slapstick, tragedy, horror... oh gosh, you name it! It is thoroughly entertaining for all members of the family. It can careen from one extreme to another (at times jarringly) - but even in its failings it is great. We are watching it as a family for the 5th time now, and since it is so long, we take about 3 weeks to see it (only on weekends). Each night is an event we look forward to.

For anyone who has ever wished to live their own fairy-tale story, this is for you.Virginia Lewis, a waitress from New York, thinks nothing interesting will ever happen to her. That's before she meets Prince, a prince-turned-dog from a different dimension! She follows him back to his world, and the story begins!Kimberly Williams is great as Virginia, John Larroquette the perfect Tony, Dianne Wiest as the evil queen is so scary, Scott Cohen is dashing and handsome as the conflicted wolf, and Camryn Manheim as Snow White--- good choice!Give this movie half a chance, and you will want to visit the world of 'The 10th Kingdom' again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Miniseries-Warning this is the edited version!","review":"Warning this is the edited version!

I was in middle school when this aired on NBC as a miniseries and I admit, I didn't watch every night, but as soon as I found first the VHS tape and then the DVD, I was hooked. This is a fantasy, action, adventure with romance intertwined and I found the acting to be supurb, especially Kimberly Williams-Paisley (Virginia) and Scott Cohen (Wolf, whom I felt deserved more critical acclaim for his jaw dropping performance of bad guy turned hero). I also admit, I find the first hour or so to be dull, but after that, when Virginia and her father come to the kingdoms, the pace picks up and the storyline is much better. I have so many favorite parts that I can't pick just one or two, but I recommend this to my friends- and I got one of my friends hooked too!

Every minute that you watch makes you want to watch even more to find out what happens. This is a great cliffhanger movie to see over and over again. John Larroquette and Kimberly Williams are great actors. John is very funny as Tony Lewis and the golden retriever who plays the prince in the dog costume (just kidding it's a dog in the dog costume) is so cute and is very fun to watch. This miniseries is the best and I think that every household in the world should own this miniseries it is better than Merlin, Gulliver's Travels, The Odyssey and even Noah's Ark. This movie is a perfect 10 in fantasy and is the one to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"10th Kingdom","review":"I absolutely LOVED this movie the first time I saw it!

I love all the quirky cultural references, it's great fun. The DVD version has a crazy bacon sandwich scene with Wolf that always cracks me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun fantasy","review":"An enjoyable light-hearted fantasy loosely based on fairy tales and fairy tale characters. Stars the very attractive and sexy Kimberly Williams (the daughter from Father of the Bride), with John Larroquette as her father and Scott Cohen as Wolf, a man with a tail :-) With a few cameos including Ed O'Neill (Al Bundy from Married with Children) as the Troll King. Lots of pretty special effects. Would probably appeal to kids but has enough of a plot and enough humour for grown-ups too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell Binding","review":"This 7 hour epic is wonderfully brought together with an excellent cast, enthralling characters, and breath taking scenery. It's about a 20-year-old waitress named Virginia (Kimberly Williams)who finds herself in another deminsion known as the 9 kingdoms with her father Tony (John Larquette) and a dog who used to be Prince Wendell(Daniel Lapaine). There they meet Wolf (Scott Cohen), a half/man and half/wolf, who helps them on their journey to save the 9 Kingdoms from the evil Queen (Diane Weist). This is a beautifully written and exciting movie. It's full of laughter, suspense, romance, and surprises.

I watched it at a friend's house one night and absoulutly had to own it. Ordered it the next morning and watched it the day I got it, work pushed to the back burner.

They cited the \\" commercialization of punk \\" as their main reason ( hear that, Blink-182 fans?). Being somewhat old school myself, I could only nod my head. This is perhaps their sweetest album. I say that in a positive way. It seems to be one of their most commercial albums also. Whether this was intended or not, only the artists know. At first I was taken aback by this one, being somewhat disappointed. The Banshees, however, often fail to resemble themselves on their previous albums. \\"Rapture\\" is perhaps their most pop offering to date, yet it was not a carbon copy of the pop music of the early nineties. Sioux gave up screaming for crooning years ago. My recommendation for new Banshees fans: buy this one and work backwards. Few artists are as versatile and indestructable as Siouxsie and the Banshees.

The waffle maker went to Good Will - someone else's problem now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for the price.","review":"I bought this primarily to braise but found it valuable for other things too. The cost is little more than a cheap non stick fry pan. You can make it braise. It sears nicely but heats in bursts until the desired temperature is reached and the direct contact with the heat source can overheat your food. Keep the setting very low after searing. Practice is the key.I turned out to be more useful as a frypan for quick meals. Stir fry, pancakes, eggs, bacon, potatoes etc...I have a flat top induction stove(yuck). This little pan heats up in seconds. It's a great extra burner as well.Cleans fast and easy. The down side is the high sides. Makes it harder to flip eggs and pancakes.Worth it? Yes.

I cook a lot of one-person meals, and this pan is great for that purpose. But, it holds a lot more than I would have guessed from seeing the picture. You can cook main dishes for several people, and side dishes for a larger group because of the depth of the pan. I am a vegetarian, cooking mostly Asian food, and it works for stir-frying, braising, steaming and just about any other method you can think of. The only things I would use my conventional stove for now is boiling big batches of noodles or pasta. This elctric skillet and my rice cooker can handle everything else, and they take up very little counter space. Easy and quick to clean.

Not only does Paula Peck hit every target for worry, but she presents simple, coherent advice on how not to sabotage your own best efforts. I came away feeling smarter, better armed to deal with the new realities of my surgery, and most importantly, like I had made a friend. The best part is that this book doesn't read like a textbook.

Many of the stories have the feel of \\"urban legend\\" having been passed around NJ for decades and morphing over time.And we all know that \\"real guys\\" don't talk about emotion - they just complain about how bad things are, so there is nothing in here that I felt captured the motivation that keeps people in this business.

Many authors share the good and the bad of EMS, but overall reflect on the satisfaction of helping others in their time of need... This is NOT one of those authors. This book tells many stories of calls from the perspective of an EMT with a chip on his shoulder, resenting those he serves, and resenting their requests for help. Another reviewer said the book would set EMS back years, and I have to agree, primarily because of the stories of intentionally mistreating patients, bad attitudes, and off color jokes at the expense of others. If you want to read encouraging stories about life in EMS, consider stores by Canning, Patterson, or Perry. If you want to read about the unfortunate EMT that is always difficult to deal with, and seems to resent his job, this is the book. Advice to the author, if this describes the job of your life, then you might want to consider a career change...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey through the Eyes of an EMT","review":"Devin Kerin's is very creative at describing various entities within the emergency services sector.

EMS is still a young profession and the public does not have a complete understanding of what we do. Kerins' book portrays EMS providers in a less than positive light. The endless complaining and whining about having to respond to calls even during meals did not sit well with me. Perhaps I am wrong, but as an EMT or Paramedic, it is my job to respond when someone is in need. I have also been on a lot of calls that were less than emergent, but in each situation I have always maintained a degree of professionalism. This book hurts all efforts that we EMS providers have made to advance our profession.

It documents the earliest days of a young baby black leopard (Eddie) born in a Colorado animal sanctuary to newly arrived black leopard parents.

Fortunately, his caretakers' patience and innovations overcome the problem, and from ther Eddie thrives.It is impossible not to be taken in by Eddie and his playful antics - both with his caretakers, and their dogs.

They're durable, comfortable in the hand and stable on the table.

It is just like all previous review books with no mention of the four big ideas or any other changes to AP bio. I originally bought the book so I would have more conceptual based questions to show my students and was severly disappointed with this book. It even states that there are four essays with equal amounts of time (when in reality, the new test will have two longer questions and a few short answer). Anyway, don't waste your money if you're hoping for an up-to-date book. Just buy a used one. I will be returning this one tomorrow :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated for an update!","review":"I am extremely disappointed that The Princeton Review completed missed the revision made to AP Biology. As a teacher I purchased this book for students to borrow in preparation for their AP exam, but it will do little good.

I think you should offer a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They have tricked me again...Dont waste your money!!","review":"So I purchased the version earlier in the year and was very disappointed that the book did not cover the new changes. With this revised version Princeton claimed to have fixed the problems. While on one hand the new practice tests do fit the right format and they made some other changes the rest of the book is WAY out of date. It doesn't even mention the Big Ideas or Learning Goals of the new system and the labs it covers are the old \\"Dirty Dozen\\".

After looking it over, I found very little I could actually use. It does not reflect the changes of the new framework. It still has too much emphasis on memorization and nothing is mentioned about he the 4 big ideas. Don't waste your money as I will not even mention this to my students. I am no fan of the Princeton Review books anyway so this is the icing on the cake.

I purchased multi-pack and threw the entire lot in the trash after about 5 minutes trying to use the first roll.The adhesive paper has more of an affinity to unrolling and sticking to itself than anything else. The roll was poorly perforated so removing a used strip resulted in little gaps in the smoothness of the roll.

So far I take 2 capsules in the a.m. & 2 in the evening. I'm going to try reducing down to 1 in the a.m. & 1 in the p.m. & see if it still works. Nonetheless, I reiterate so far so good.

The bottle actually says take 2 capsules 1-2 times daily as needed. I went with this over Nature's Plus because this had reviews, and I figured they were similar in dosage. They are 100mg.

You can't include one without the other, as \\"Moving in Stereo\\" segues right into \\"ALL MIXED UP\\". Its omission here makes this incomplete. There is NO argument there...everybody knows this!

Otherwise, this is a very good, comprehensive one disc compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Cars collection to get.","review":"The Cars have a few hits compilations out, but this one is by far the best.

Their lead singer RIC OCASEK sings horribly and sings like a baby. This greatest-hits album was a huge joke that each and every song is incredibly bad.Their guitar playing is really bad. They are only recommended for loosers. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this album and avoid CD's from the Cars, Nirvana, and AC/DC who suck.

Since the original left out my all time favorite \\"Dangerous Type\\" from the classic \\"Candy-O\\" LP release, I was glad to see it included here.

I'm surprised more people haven't commented. The clarity is excellent, but for example, on My Best Friend's Girl, and Good Times Roll, they have the lead guitar part louder than Ric's vocal, which proves annoying, and even more so when you turn it up to hear him. And then they have the awesome guitar part on Magic mixed behind the synths and bass! What were these guys doing?? It's a great collection of the Car's music at least. If you have the original 1990 compilation, I would suggest hanging on to that and download the missing tracks you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marketing Directors With High Shaking Heads","review":"Long overdue -- the inclusion of Bye Bye Love in a hits package, I mean.

This was the first cd I bought of the cars, and I bought it about a year ago, and have since then boughten more and more cars' cds. I like all of their records, but most especially this one.

Not quite, but close enough","review":"This definitely improves on the 1985 release \\"The Cars Greatest Hits\\", and may appeal to casual fans a lot more than the excellent-but-sprawling \\"Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology\\". But it leaves out three favorites of mine - \\"Candy-O\\", \\"Don't Tell Me No\\", and \\"Gimme Some Slack\\". All three were singles, but all three appealed more to the band's New Wave fans than the Top 40 crowd. All three of them are available on JWIN, however, JWIN omits the excellent \\"Bye-Bye Love\\", which should rightly be there side-by-side with its companion piece \\"Moving In Stereo\\" like it is here on \\"The Complete Greatest Hits\\".I own JWIN and the Cars' self-titled debut, so I'm as complete as I need to be.

The sound is great and the collection wisely focuses on the early years by devoting 6 of 20 tracks to songs from the debut 'Cars' LP. While there were 3 tracks from 'Candy-O', at least two others, \\"Got A Lot On My Head\\" and \\"Candy-O\\", should have been considered. And why to all of the Cars hits packages only include the hit \\"Touch and Go\\" from 'Panorama'? I will be the first to admit that 'Panorama' is not one of their better records but there are a few good songs, particularly \\"Gimme Some Slack\\", along with \\"Misfit Kid\\" and \\"Down Boys\\". The tracks that I would remove from 'Complete Greatest Hits' are \\"I'm Not The One\\" and \\"Why Can't I Have You\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of THE CARS","review":"I casually discovered The Cars listening to their wonderful performance at the Live Aid. Then, in order to know more about them, I bought their Greatest Hits and found out that most pieces of the 80's pop music are from Rick Ocasek, The Cars ndr.The dancing rythms of their melodies make a fascinating musical alchemy, creating a world as much punk as art-rock.In the CD you can find well-known songs just like MAGIC, JUST WHAT I NEEDED, GOOD TIMES ROLL and the marvelous DRIVE, which is in my opinion one of the most wonderful ballads of the last 30 years of music.The above-mentioned CD is the perfect evidence of their magnificence."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Cars are the best","review":"the cars have so many sounds on this cd and they are all great I love this cd so much i used to hum the songs to myslef in class this is a great cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Candy-O, I need you so....!","review":"I'm a huge Cars fan. I really enjoyed The New Cars on their tour last year. The question I have with this collection is where is the track \\"Candy-O\\"? The song is so quintesentially Cars.

Other favorites are \\"Drive\\"--probably because it's not as pop-ish/upbeat as most of their other songs--and \\"Tonight She Comes.\\"The Cars' \\"Complete Greatest Hits\\" remedies this aforementioned missing track--as well as a few other missing tunes--but if you're a diehard Cars fan, then I'd recommend the double-CD \\"Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology\\", which includes several additional hits and obscure tracks.

Greaton's book teaches a few very important lessons about love, understanding, forgiveness, hope, and acceptance.Unlike some who have commented, I was able to connect with the main character, Skip, right away. I rode the tide of pain along with him as he speaks about his losses, which are many. I also fell in love with the characters who, although had smaller parts in the book, made a big impact.This is a lovely book that needs to be shared with the world.

I've never really had a strong desire to visit the Northeast, so I couldn't believe how much he had me wishing I could take a trip to the small Vermont village he describes.

The plot could have been interesting if there had been any attempt at character development or fleshing out of details, but it was just page after page of bare bones information without the detail needed to make it interesting. The writer made the mistake of telling the story instead of showing the story.

A wonderful mix of fantasy and fact, we are lessoned with the meaning of living a full life, and reminded of how much we have to look forward to.

It's hard to get a good feel for a new shoe because it hasn't broken in so I bought them thinking the extra cost would mean they were more durable. It's been a month and I've worn these every day with about 30+ miles of walking overall. Every step feels like walking in huge leather work boots. The huge solid squarish back of the shoe doesn't roll down, it just pivots and smacks the rest of your foot down on every step. I keep thinking the sole will break in but it hasn't. My poor feet ache if I walk even a mile.What's good about them? The venting is ok but not as much as a running shoe or something like that. Absolutely perfect fit on the inside and didn't have any issues with chafing while breaking them in.You'd probably be better off buying some cross trainers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merrell Women's Moab Hiker","review":"I bought these shoes specifically for hiking in warm climates.

My husband has a similar shoe by the same maker & is the one who recommended it to me & I'm happy he did. I am usually an 8, & these do run small so needed a 8 1/2.

I was in the market for a new pair of tennies and decided I'd give these a try (because of all the positive reviews I'd seen). I love these shoes! They are an awesome fit for me. I never had to break them in as they were a perfect fit from the beginning. They have great traction in wet conditions, are extremely flexible, and wash well. I definitely recommend these shoes to those of you looking for a good hiking shoe especially, or just a good pair of all-purpose shoes.Update 12/3/11: Still loving these shoes!

That line you've heard about punk being about attitude, not music? It's a lie. Whatever lifestyle choices the term connotes, it most definitely does specify a type of rock 'n' roll, and \\"The Music Power from Okinawa\\" most definitely has nothing in common with it. Shonen Knife? Punk rock. REO Speedwagon? Not punk rock. Green Day? Perhaps a matter of opinion, but judging strictly from Amazon's sound clips, Shoukichi Kina makes them sound like the baddest, most strident, least socially acceptable punk band on earth. Sorry to rain on the parade, but I've read two reviews alluding to the \\"punk\\" nature of this album, and I have better things to do than to spend time previewing a mislabeled recording and be reminded that some ignorant music writers can't fathom the most obvious fine-points of pop-music analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Star Plus","review":"Genuwine (as an Artist) puts a lot into his work with creativity.

I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of the book in Australia, but when I first saw it, I was disappointed by the bland cover and photocopy- paper quality of the book. Nevertheless, I bought the book in anticipation of a gripping and realistic story as only Clancy could write. I was however, disappointed by the obvious lack of discipline of Rainbow Six members after each operation, in particular the talking to rescued hostages and one of the members smoking a pipe in full view of the TV cameras. It was fairly predictable that the Russian ex-spy Popov would catch on later. Definitely not up to Clancy's usual accuracy on military operations, but it was a page-turner nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"War-Horse Clancy Running Out of Oats?","review":"The episodes of an elite counter-terrorist unit in action make for decent escapist reading. Beyond that, Clancy makes use of an uninspired, all-too-familiar biowarfare system taken directly from his last book. John Clark becomes judge, jury, and executioner at the ending which is at once rushed and trite. There are pages of tangential dialog that can be skipped without being missed, but unfortunately each reader has to discover this individually. In Mr. Clancy's defense (and I am a fan from the first) what does one do for an encore, especially when Jack Ryan is now the President of the United States? To see John Clark become an unprincipled vigilante is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy Gets Better and Better!","review":"I've been a fan of Tom Clancy's work since his first book. He just gets better at writing and at capturing his reader's attention and interest. With Rainbow Six, I realized that I couldn't put the book down and when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to it to find out what the Six team were doing. That's because Tom Clancy has mastered the art of giving detailed scenes and background information without boring the reader as sometimes was the case in his previous books. I enjoyed very much reading Rainbow Six and getting to know better John Clark and his family. However, I cannot wait to read more about what Jack Ryan is doing as the President! I am very much looking forward to reading that story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"John Clark is the ex-Nacy SEAL from the book \\"Without Remorse\\". He continues his secret operational missions by creating the a group the governments of the world keep \\"in the black\\". Few people know of its existence. John is head of RAINBOW SIX. They are better than the best!They combat terrorism mostly. They are called in when no one else can handle the job. To save the lives of hostages, they \\"take down\\" the terrorists. Forget prisoners! When Rainbow Six goes in it is eliminate! The hostages are their only concern. Of course, terrorism is not the only thing Rainbow Six combats, but it is the biggest.***Tom Clancy brings it all to life! Not only are you riveted to your seat by the action and efficiency of the team (which is made up of several nationalities) but by the plot which slowly comes to a boil between it all. I highly recommend this one!***"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much inconsequential detail. This book really drags.","review":"Bought Rainbow Six and had high expectations. Expected a fast paced and action packed read, similar to Clancy's earlier novels (Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, et al.) but got just the opposite. The novel drags as a result of Clancy's painstaking descriptions of the inconsequential. The book could be edited at least in half, or maybe two thirds could be edited away and the story line wouldn't much suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caricatures, stereotypes and an impossible plot","review":"What else can I say? It's the nature of the publishing business that Clancy could write his laundry list and people would buy it. Don't buy this. Go look up Bob Mayer and buy some of his Riley series special forces books. Mayer was in special forces and knows what he's talking about. He also doesn't waste your time with fast-paced, to the point stories. Try CUT OUT, based at Fort Bragg and involving a special forces soldier in the Witness Protection Program. Or DRAGON SIM-13 which reminded me a lot of Fail Safe except using a special forces team instead of a bomber. Every time I get on board a Combat Talon for deployment I wonder . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor thriller-- read THE OMEGA MISSILE","review":"Clancy doesn't care about his readers any more-- that is obvious from this lackluster effort.

Great thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable!!!","review":"Why did I buy this book? Answer, \\"Tom Clancy has written many books which I enjoyed no end. They could be re-read more than once and still be enjoyable.\\" Sadly Tom Clancy has used up all his credit with this one.It doesn't get off the ground at any point. Although it is a \\"speed read\\" it never captures the reader like \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin\\" , \\"Clear and present danger\\" or \\"The sum of all fears\\" did. It hasn't got the \\"I must read one more page or else...\\" feeling that his previous books had. It is as predictable as watching paint dry - and you feel just as cheated afterwards.

The premise of an international anti-terrorist unit is great but the villains were absurd. With the fall of the USSR and frequent use of middle eastern terrorists, I guess militant environmentalists are the only bad guys left. The book's saving grace are its protaganists, Clark and Chavez. The bio-warfare was done to death in his last book and he needs a new threat to the world. It's good mindless summer reading, but if you're expecting a good \\"Tom Clancy\\" novel, maybe you should check out his earlier works (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger).

You seem to know the chacters better and better and they are like you best buds when you get done with the book. But I should stick more to the plot. The plot is very very good and it does not really become apparent of whats really going to happen to about page 400. The boom!!!! put on your seat belt for one hell of rollercoaster ride of suspense, terror and tears!!! -Daily World"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"What a poor book this is. Gone are the days of the techno-thriller for a re-hash of previous plots and performers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartoonish","review":"Let's face it. This book is one long cartoon. The good guys? Not a scratch on 'em. The Bad guys? Nuke 'em. The good guys? Fine, upstanding family men. The bad guys? Dysfunctional low-lifes. Clancy's politics? To the right of Rush Limbaugh. Clancy's women? In the kitchen (or the hospital ward) where they belong. The plot was laughable. And I used to be a Clancy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two lumps of coal","review":"Tom Clancy is my favorite author. Waiting for a new book from Tom Clancy is like Christmas for me. Today, I found lumps of coal in my stocking. All Clancy fans who want or need to buy this book should wait till it comes out in paperback...and at a used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"It certainly seems to me that Tom Clancy's political grandstanding seriously detracts from the story. It's getting harder and harder to wade through these massive tomes. Mr. Clancy's political beliefs have always been apparent in his work, but now he seems to feel that his novels are podiums fit for bludgeoning us over the head with. He always has been an excellent storywriter, but the dogma is very much overpowering the story. I find that I as I reread his earlier novels, I enjoy them less because of the civics lessons I was forced to endure in \\"Rainbow Six\\" and \\"Debt of Honor\\". I certainly could not reccomend this book to a non-fan, and fans should definetely edit as they read. I just hope Mr. Clancy realizes before his next novel is finished, that Ronald Reagan is no longer in need of a speechwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Clancy I've returned to the store","review":"As a longtime Clancy fan I've picked up this book without hesitation the day it came up. Coming home, I breathlessly settled in for another exciting read...only to be throw back with all gentleness of a car crash. What the hell? Environmentalists who would like to kill all the people on earth. Well, gee, that's right on the par with generals who're just itching to start nuclear war in the believability department. \\"We project 85% casualties Mr. President, but our way of life will be safe!\\". Pfft.But what really killed it for me (besides the paper thin plot and cardboard characters) was the continuous exposition. \\"And now I,Dr. Gene Evil, will explain to you my motives. In excruciating detail. And repeat it couple of dozen times so you don't forget.\\" Oh gawd...After the 2nd half of the book, I was reduced to just flipping through the book to find some action scenes, which at least were moderatly involving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, dull, bloated mess","review":"This book was surprisingly bad. Clancy's flair for telling an exciting story took a vacation on this one. The basic plot isn't very interesting to begin with and then he fills the book with pages of exposition on the environment and government and I felt like I was at a lecture, not reading a novel. The terrorist plots the group foil along the way to the main story are poorly executed. The team never misses a shot or takes a misstep while the bad guys are like Keystone cops. When you get to the main story, your boredom turns to laughter. It was like Simon Bar Sinister on the old Underdog cartoon and his plots to \\"ruuullle the world\\". Clancy has written some classic thrillers. Go re-read one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This [is terrible]!","review":"Rainbow Six is a sad, disappointing book. It makes it even more disappointing when the author is capable of writing much better books such as The Hunt for Red October. Rainbow Six is about an elite international counter-terrorist group that tries to stop some nature-freaks from destroying the world's population.Depending on who you are, you will either love or hate this book. I hated it. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the far-fetched scenarios that Clancy thinks up are ridiculous. ... The game that is based on the story is actually much better than the book. Half the story is about how these druids think and only about twenty pages in the entire thousand-page book are about actually executing the missions.Better luck next time, Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have been a Clancy fan from the beginning, but don't expect that I'll spend another dime on one of his works. If you want a disgused diatribe against environmental extemists without the snappy thrill and demonstration of techno-thriller know-how such as Hunt for Red October or, even more so, in Red Storm Rising (my favorite Clancy book), then this is a great book for you. The stupidly outlandish ultimate raison d'etre for the Rainbow team is absurd and insulting to readers. What is Clancy trying to do, simplify complex issues with simple jingoistic positions? I can get that from most of the people I know for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Long, Lazy Writing","review":"Absolutely the last Clancy novel I read. Mr Clancy is getting lazy in his wealth. His research used to be maticulous in every detail. As an Air Force Special Ops pilot I can say this one is full of slip ups.Another 900 page plodding novel that, typical of his books, takes the first 700 pages to get it's act together. Then he cobbles together the last 100 pages. Too bad, he used to write really good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's typical Tom Clancy: It's too much.","review":"Rainbow Six is all too representative of what Clancy has done since his first book, The Hunt For Red October. Rainbow Six is overwritten and underedited. It will become a best-seller on the strength of Clancy's name, but since Red October, which was a very fine tale, he's done only good book. That was Clear and Present Danger."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's an REMF?","review":"I'm not quite done with Rainbow Six. As always, Clancy's novels are page turners. I can't wait to get home to get back to it. However, after the first 40 pages, Clark has called himself an REMF 5 times. Not being a Viet Nam Vet, this was really annoying and forced me to go on line to search for the term. And what is tempesting? This is mentioned twice already without any explanation. So far into the book, it would have been better if there had been explanation of these esoteric terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy's Good, But Not The Best","review":"Tom Clancy is a fine writer and I enjoy his style and characters. He crafts entertaining stories and keeps the reader on edge waiting for how the heroes will save the day. However, I must temper this praise by saying Clancy is far from the best writer of the 20th Century. For you Clancy buffs out there I strongly suggest you read Alistair MacLean's \\"Ice Station Zebra\\", \\"Force Ten From Navarone\\", or \\"Puppet on a Chain\\". MacLean writes with a style and flair which is thoroughly engrossing, technically exciting, and light years ahead of Clancy in artistic ability and the shear art of storytelling. Clancy is Salieri to MacLean's Mozart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring novelization of a game","review":"... and, if you like repetitive, episodic action, you should buy the computer game ... or watch six episodes of a bad TV show. The only reason to buy the book is to prove to your peers that you can read. Tom Clancy has, regrettably, taken the final, fatal plunge into complete commercialization of his waning talent. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst TC book ever written! Like a bad sequel.","review":"So far, I have read and enjoyed all of TCs other novels. However, 'R6' ranks rock-bottom. After finishing the book, I began to question whether this book was even written by THE Tom Clancy I've come to know and admire. Over the years I have read other books on counter-terrorism, and the plot for 'R6' lacks plausibility relating to the subject. The plot and the characters seem to be out of a comic book. There were also technical inaccuracies to types of counter-terrorist weapons and tactics described in this book. The idea of having a powerful villian with the ambition to wipe out most of the world's population in order to create an eccological utopia is just too much like a generic 'James Bond' movie. Like my other TC books, I bought this book in its original hardcover edition. However, I am quite disappointed in this book. Cmon TC, I know you can do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An exciting book attacking the environmental movement.","review":"I have read most of Clancy's books, and, as time goes on, they offer more and more of Clancy's political and philosophical views and less and less story and excitement. Rainbow Six is also a thinly disguised attack on the environmental movement, dismissing such organizations as the Sierra Club as fanatical, with a strong implication that environmentalists are exceptionally naive at best and extremely stupid at worst. They are all emotional \\"tree and bunny huggers,\\" rather than thoughtful and intelligent people. Clancy continues to be enamored with organizations like the CIA and the FBI, who alone have the welfare of the country in mind. I think this is the last Clancy book I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot line is simple; full of errors","review":"Though the plot outline is intriguing, Clancy has developed an annoying habit and going into extraneous detail. This gets him, or his proofreader, lost. Character names are changing within a few pages (Tim, then Tom, then Tim); new characters suddenly appear and interact as if they have been introduced before; mystery characters are revealed accidentally in conversations (confirming one's suspicions) and then are dumped back into the shadows for later revelations. Sorry, I've enjoyed Clancy's earlier works but I've lost my taste for details of minutiae (e.g. what they ate for breakfast), repitition of character's motivitations and lack of details on key events in character's lives (Ding's wife's delivery is quickly passed over though we hear about the team's morning routine ad nauseum)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy's Best Ever","review":"At its heart is ex-Navy Seal John Clark. He is the newly named commander of Rainbow, a international taskforce created to battle terrorism. In a trial by fire, Clark is confronted with a chain of seemling separate incidents. But there is no way to predict the true threat: a group of terrorists like no one has ever seen before. A band of men and women so extreme it could truly mean the end of life on earth.This book is action packed. It is full of munitions experts, sharpshooters, and all-around daredevils. Clancy carefully researched this book to make it truly realistic. This is Clancy at his best. His description of special-forces operations is as real as anyone will ever see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please bring back the Clancy of old.","review":"Tom Clancy seemed to be filling pages as if he has a contract for somany words. The idea of the book was solid but came across in rather boring and repetative way. It wasn't hard to figure out how things would go. One bright spot is Tom is continuing to develope tried and true characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major plot flaw","review":"Mundane book with two dimensional characters marred by a major plot flaw.When it's summertime here, it's winter in Australia. Why would they need a multimillion dollar cooling system?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not impressed.","review":"What Rainbow Six amounts to is a 900 page sermon on the widespread and rampant leftist terrorism that plagues the world today. Never mind that it's right wing extremists such as Bin Ladin and Saddam Hussein that have given the world so much trouble since the collapse of communism.If the preaching isn't bad enough, consider the barrage of two dimensional characters. The heros have no personality whatsoever. They are basically automatons going around killing the equally shallow bad guys. Clancy might know that even soldiers have feelings and individuality, had he not been a draft dodger himself.Clancy is an author I would compare to Arthur C. Clarke, in that both are fully competant with the technical side of what they write, but seem to be incapable of expressing any real emotion in their work. With Clancy the world is just a black and white place where communists still hide under the beds of all God-fearing people and governments do no wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"this book was a very boring book. i injoyed the acion parts but most of the book was talking about nothing!over all i really disliked this book. there is to much about americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"My girl friend's vibrator could write something much better","review":"You're old, you can't write something new, but you're famous by now.

Binary rules.That's probably why the ex-King of Techno-thriller needs to publish such a lousy book without ashamed for its low quality. Because it sells the video game. We old timers may not like this book, but some kids with much money that can burn a hole in their pockets will buy the video game of the same title. That's the point. If it's just a game, it'll have to fight any other games in a fair game. With a name like Clancy's, it's going to sell. If you don't read, or can't read, you can still play the game. You can still pay for it. That's the point.Can't wait to see if Michael Crichton's upcoming _Timeline_ will follow the same logic like Clancy's.

Sorry Tom but only US citizens may travel on a US passport.What happened to the level of accuracy of Red Storm Rising?

I knew about the same before I read the book as after. Too much discussion about cleaning and caring for one's guns. All the characters were shallow and lacked all emotion. The only real character was the former KGB agent and even he lacked substance. 750 pages of wasted time. I can't believe I read the whole thing. I would not recommend this book for any reason except a cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know what everyone is complaining about","review":"Tom Clancy continues to keep you on the edge of your seat with his latest, \\"Rainbow Six\\".

Right-thinking fascists blow the daylights out of horrible, menacing tree huggers. The characters were so unreal it was hard to finish the book. It would have been much better to portray the trained killers (the supposed heroes)as tortured ambivalent souls rather than caring family men. Caring family men do not become covert operatives, stroking their guns for a living. Also Clancey allows his own disdane for environmentalists to show through and often allows his characters to preach to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy at his worst.","review":"As a long-time Clancy fan, I was deeply disappointed with this latest effort. The plot was lame, the ideology was shallow (and endlessly repeated) and the characters nanometer thin. Looks to me like Clancy has gotten so big for his britches that he has demanded publication of his first draft without meddling by a copy editor -- and that was a big mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for public libraries!","review":"This book was absolute, long-winded drivel. Time for clancy-San to come up with some new characters. I usually enjoy Clancy's work because of the attention to detail that he gives the readers, but that attention to detail, not to mention character developement, is glaringly lacking in this novel.I have been waiting for Clancy's work to improve since he wrote \\"The sum of all fears\\" but I have been consistently let down. I didn't even bother to buy this one, I got it from the library. Good thing, I would have been really angry if I had spent 30 dollars for it.The thing I hated most about this book is that Clancy creates an aura of greatness around the \\"Rainbow\\" (stupid name) organization, whenin reality they weren't doing anything that a good polce S.W.A.T. Team couldn't do with a tenth of the assets.Absolute garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Clancy! Yet another plausible ride of your life.","review":"Clancy has a great opener for the set up to the story. Many will remember the mid 70's and through the 80's as hostage ridden. This story will take you into the world of the terrorist like no other. Clancy delivers a high impact ride through the world of those who would terrorize and those whom the terrorist themselves fear. As a military officer some would say that I am biased to this type of reading as it is a story line that is of great military interest, however, Clancy does his homework and has your attention from start to finish with a storyline that reaches global proportions and has you guessing. The reader is not just treated to the story of what is going to happen, but all the behind the scenes detail that rounds out the story, bringing it to a greater level of reality.A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright Tom!!! Where's the movie?","review":"I just got through reading Blind Mans Bluff and Lady President and decided to pick up Rainbow Six. Very impressive work Mr. Clancy. I especially like the way you stick to details and the idea that we must always keep fighting for freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another preachy tome","review":"The Hunt for Red October was a great read, and I probably can't expect Clancy to reach that height when he's expected to crank out a 700-page tome every twelve months. But this was the worst product he's produced. It appears to be ready made for Hollywood. Maybe he's tired of scriptwriters butchering his product and has prepared a ready-for-Hollywood text, but this is trite and preachy. While trying to get into his characters' heads, he has become an apologist for the Conservative Agenda. This time the enemy are enviromentalists. If he keeps up with this trend, I expect Jack Ryan to have an affair with an intern in the next book. Well, maybe he can get some good material from the Starr Report."},{"rating":"2","title":"All right, could have been better","review":"Not Clancy's best, but still good. I would have liked more development of the characters, both good and bad. They were too black or white. As a special forces soldier, I know that we have a spectrum of people serving and our potential enemies also run the gamut. I recommend a few other books: Coonts latest, Andy McNabbs-- BRAVO TWO ZERO is real good about the SAS; Bob Mayer's SF books like CUT OUT or ETERNITY BASE; Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE. All those guys, unlike Clancy, actually served in the military so there's an extra edge of realism to their books.

I even felt that I had wasted a weekend reading it. This book Lacked just about everything that has made Mr Clancy wealthy enough to consider buying the Vikings. I missed the very things that made Clear and Present Danger such a good read. Excitment, and the great villians. These villians may be great scientists, but they probably could not find there way across the street with out a map and detailed directions. I was bored during the 3 days it took to read this book, and if it were not morally wrong I would return it and get my money back. Every one gets a clinker now and again and even if he is looking for a post Ryan direction this is definatly not the way to go! Are you listening Mr Clancy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book but with a disappointing end.","review":"Tom Clancy done it again! I just couldn't leave the book alone till the end. The only thing that ruined the experience for me was the very-unsetteling end, which I disliked (very un-heroey of the soldiers...) But it realy worth all this reading, and the thrill and suspence are just as real as hearing the news on TV.... Scary as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy still loves guns!!","review":"Does Clancy ever tire of being a stereotype? Let's see - Bad guys: tree-hugging eco-terrorists, Good guys: anybody who knows their way around a Heckler&Koch submachine gun. These types of war-worshipping authors have become a little tired in this post Cold-War era. They were entertaining when there was a real enemy that was capable of competing with the Western Allies, but nowadays they have to stretch pretty far for a story. It's always amusing to see that the He-men in these books are married to nurses (more nurturing you know). Thus the scene is set:\\"Gee Honey, how can you kill somebody?

I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything. Stephen Coonts is a former combat pilot who knows whereof he writes. Bob Mayer, whether writing under his own name or the pen names Joe Dalton and Bob McGuire, is a former Green Beret who has a bunch of very good books out there begging to be read. Check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Clancy's best","review":"This is the first book of Clancy's I read. And I think it was a great choice! Rainbow Six is a suspenseful, action packed and entertaining book. This is one of those books that when it gets to a good part you can't put it down, it's like it is glued to your hands. Occasionally it is so boring you wish the Rainbow team would bust into that chapter and kill the guys talking. But that rarely happened in this thriller. Just as a hint all chapters are important and have an effect on the ending. If this book to you becomes a let down, skip to the last 60 pages cuz they are so cool. Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it to all of Clancy's fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Crafted & Edited","review":"Just finished 'Rainbow Six'. Big book. Big disappointment. I counted probably 17 editing and continuity errors throughout the text. Apparently there are also significant spelling errors, too. I don't expect this is a $30 novel. It almost seems to be a ghost-written. Perhaps Tom is spending too much time developing the computer game versions of his books? Even worse, perhaps he's writing the books with the game in mind(!).

And I'll be reading the next one in my local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy didn't write (or even read) this book...","review":"The 2 possible scenerios:1) Either Clancy didn't write this book, and then was too busy to read it or 2) He fired his editor, and now we know who the real talent is.The book is unbelieveably repetitive: it could have been written in half the pages. There are technical errors not worthy of a Clancy novel. The re-use of phrases (\\"faster then closing a zipper\\" and \\"niggeredly\\" were both used 4 times that I counted) made me scream. And Tom, Richmond is not a borough of New York.This is the worst book of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Clancy Stuff","review":"Tom Clancy has provided yet another tale. Same thing different book. It reads well, but is unsatisfying overall - no new ground is being broken here. His best is still _Red Storm Rising_. His characters are starting to appear similar to those in Ludlum's sequels: older, but still trying to be the original characters they once were. The characters have not evolved. A new set of characters, ones who haven't had a chance yet in Clancy's tired realm, might breathe new life into the world. But he continues to use the same names, the same mannerisms, the same threads. The tale might be better told from the perspective of John Clark's lieutenant, Dingo Chavez, and only from there. We shifted from Ryan to Clark, now let's shift from Clark to someone new. An evolution, shall we say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Sux","review":"I have been a dedicated Clancy fan since \\"Hunt\\" came out way back in 1984. It used to be that the only requirement to being a Clancy fan was a desire to be entertained by a well crafted techno-thriller. Now, it seems that you have to be a right-wing, anti-environment Republican to enjoy his latest books. As a Democrat and environmentalist, this is the last Clancy book I buy-next time I'm making a $25 donation to Greenpeace. Unrealistic bad guys, a comic book plot, various elements taken from his other books, and insulting pot shots at anybody who doesn't share his political views all combine to make R6 a real dog.

Page after page of attacks and operations keep you reading. The only real downside to the story is that it is missing some of the depth and mystery that Clancy usually brings to a novel. Also, the book is a little bit to predictable. My biggest complaint: Clancy uses the same team over and over again on missions when it should have alternated between the two. When he finally uses the other team, what happens?? Read it to find out what I mean! All in all, an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Rainbow Six was a wonderful book.

I've read all of Clancy's non-fiction (not counting the ghost-written pulp he puts his name on) and they have steadily declined since the Sum of All Fears. His right wing paranoia has overtaken his ability to write a plausible plot. Character development has never been a strong point for Clancy, and here he has taken his least interesting, most one-dimensional character and surrounded him with a *team* of uninteresting characters.This isn't a politically based review. One *can* write a book on eco-terrorism, however, Clancy's villains here are completely wrong and I can think of no real world equivalent.This is not just a book to be set aside and put away; it is one which must be hurled as far as possible, while yelling as loud as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Effort,Bad Book","review":"What was Clancy on when he wrote this?!I'm not even past the first 100 pages,and already I want to return it!I'm not in to the whole military thing,so half the time I don't even know what the ... he's talking about.I giving him another chance though.I have The Hunt for Red October and The Cardinal of the Kremlin.I'll review them and if they both don't get at least 4 Stars,I'm through with Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not a book, its a promo for a computer game!","review":"After enjoying many of Tom Cancy's books, I must admit this was probably the last one I'll read.

As soon as I picked the book up, I was glued to it and just couldn't stop myself from pulling on to see what would happen next... This book has a much deeper plot than most of clancy's other books and adds a whole new dimension to the video game experience. Spine tingling excitement from pages 1-740!

It is an excellent book that I couldn't be pulled away from. I knew what was going to happen but it didn't matter. The story still captivated me. I enjoyed the continuation of the characterization of Ding and Clark. I was however dissappointed with Clancy for leaving out Jack Ryan. His name was mentioned only once. This leads me to believe that there will be a blockbuster of a book with all the characters in one final Jack Ryan novel. Also a request that Clancy put in for a movie for some more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The terrorists are just too stupid in this book","review":"*spoiler* The terrorists' master plan is to kill off all humans that are polluting and destroying the earth in order to save the earth. To do this they intend to use a virus to infect and kill everyone except themselves because they have a vaccine that will protect them from it. They test the virus and it works on rats and monkeys and they even test it and find it works on humans. Never mind that some of the biology is wrong, the point is that if it works on rats and humans it's going to kill off a majority of the mammals on the earth - they're trying to save the animals! These are supposed to be smart terrorists with the ability to create a virus but for some reason they don't realize they're about to kill everything they want to save."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed!","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. I stopped at the 100th page, hoping for it to get better at page 50 but it didn't. I only gave this book 2 stars because the beginning was suspencful and entertaining. During the first 10 pages I was so pleased and I thought I was into a real adventure, but then it got a little too complex and the action was just plain boring. After reading Tom Clancy's Net Force, Debt of Honor, and Executive Orders, Rainbow Six was just plain. . . BORING! I'm looking forward to reading Patriot Games soon, but after reading Rainbow Six I'm not so sure about Tom Clancy's books, although that'll change soon after reading Patriot Games."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK book... but","review":"I started reading this book expecting another Hunt for Red October, but it was different. I didn't expect a \\"clean\\" book concerning swearing, but it was a little over done. It was a well written book, as Tom Clancy usually puts out.My advice is that this book is for older teens or adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"I'm a 15 year old female, who was assigned to this book by a group of, suprise suprise, 3 males of my same age.Now, I'm a big TC fan, I loved Red October, and I'm fairly up-to-date with my techno-jargan, but honestly...Without reiterating what many have so eloquently posted, my copy (which I bought used for $1, a bit over-priced if you ask me)now sits half burned, torn to bits in a corner of my room where I flung it against the wall.*headdesk*Really Tom?"},{"rating":"1","title":"damn... sucks!!!","review":"first of all, i bought this book expecting for the thrills. and theres no lack of thrill obviously. but, this is the story for too machoic and selfish people for other PEOPLEs.main characters lead the story as if they are such a super-man or justice of the peace. they think describing this way is so rightful and powerful(not cool at all ever!!!!).im veryvery disapointed now for buying this, not in rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down... again.","review":"Along with many of the other reviewers, I too was diappointed with Rainbow Six. I'm a big fan of Clancy's earlier books but his work has been on the decline for some time now. The battle sequences held my attention but the rest of the book was a snoozer! Poorly written and poorly edited. And what is up with the photo on the back cover? Did he even serve in the military? What a poser! Enough with the ego trip, try producing some quality work Tom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but a good read","review":"Just finished reading the book last night -- actually the wee hours of this morning. Not as good as some of Clancey's others such as Clear and Present Danger and Debt of Honor, but it held my interest. With the exception of the book's climax, which I found riveting, the action \\"scenes\\" were not as suspenseful as in previous novels. John Clark deals with the antagonists in his usual unique and creative manner at the book's end. Overall, Clancey fans will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment...","review":"Tom Clancy wrote a new book!! CLANCY! CLANCY!! CLANCY!!! Hey, wait a second. This isn't by Clancy! It's terrible! The plot is a rehash of his last two novels. The characters, which used to be interesting and \\"real\\" are flat and boring. Oh, I'm sorry. There's lots of shooting and explosives. Oh, right, that's what makes a book good. Tom, I'm sorry, but your old stuff was far, far, far superior to Rainbow Six. We know you can write. You just decided to pretend that can't. Right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst Tom Clancy novel, to date.","review":"I am a big fan of Tom Clancy and all of his previous works. Having said that, I also think \\"Rainbow Six\\" is one of the worst books ever published. This book is living proof that Clancy's reputation and marketability has outpaced his capacity to write. The book is MUCH to long. The story line would have made a nice short story at best. Dear Tom: You ripped me off! I want my money back. Also, I should receive compensation for dragging this thing across the country on airplane flights. It appears you are starting to believe your own BULL@#$?. You owe us big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad story, bad writing, bad characters.","review":"Did I leave anything out? Don't buy this book. Instead, if you like thrillers, take this recommendation: buy EYES OF THE HAMMER by Bob Mayer in paperback for $3.99 from Amazon. See if you like it. Then if you do, get the rest of his special forces series featuring the same main character; although the rest are only in hardcover, they are well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does familiarity breed contempt?","review":"As soon as I saw \\"Rainbow Six\\" on the bookshelf, I bought it. I never wait for the soft-cover to come out, however, this time I should have. Editorial errors such as a character changing names from \\"Tim\\" to \\"Tom\\" in a page shows that speed was the driving factor not quality in this latest Tom Clancy book. Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened in a Clancy novel. The plot was generally plausible, but the lack of substance to the characters was most dissapointing. All the \\"good\\" guys were alike, almost like clones of each other. The book reads like it followed a standard formuala for its construction and so consequently it is highly predictable. The one refreshing departure from past books was that the \\"bad\\" guys were from the US. I would not recommend you rush out and buy this one, but if you have some time to pass and want something not too challenging, then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Jack Clark and Tom Clancy!","review":"This book is a waste of time featuring ludicrous plots and a plethora of unreal, dumb, \\"bad guys\\" It becomes obvious immediately that Mr. Clancy has run out of ideas, what is next, Jack Clark and Ding battling aliens or perhaps giant prehistoric creatures?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a thinking book, good for passing time","review":"I forgot it on the train in London after 300 pages. I was inititally upset, but had absolutely no desire to purchase it again. Sorry Tom, but you blew this one. Where is the twisted plot that uses the 150 pages for plot foundation and another 800 to unwind? It read more like a Grisham...not a thinker, just a time passer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A betrayal","review":"Normally I would keep my disappointment to myself, but having read some of the five star reviews, I just can't. If you've read Clancy's books, actually read them, then you've already read this one. Tom just wasn't trying. The IRA are back and attack the hero's wife and daughter - Patriot Games. Baddies using a devastating virus - Executive Orders. The evils lurking under the cover of the jungle - Clear and Present. Bad guy becoming the saviour of the day - Cardinal of the Kremlin. And there's a lot more - I don't want to ruin what little excitement in the book there is by giving away the other deja vu moments. Tom, if you can't be bothered , why should we?"},{"rating":"2","title":"He has done it Again!","review":"Just when you thought Clancy has, and others in the Techno-War genre, written every conceivable plot post WWII, a new interesting scenario pops up.Here you have an innocent bio-firm that has infiltrated all levels of the American system, only to deceive us with a sinister plot to change the face of the planet-- literally.Its up to Rainbow, a covert multi-national anti-terrorist team to unravel the many far-fetched but related clues to stop this atrocity. Led by the secretive John Clark, Rainbow scours the political scene, sending his troops to disolve these threats as they happen, before any more innocents get caught in the crossfire.Like all of Clany's works, the situations are highly detailed and descriptive. Many technological wonders are used, as well as luck and detective work on a global scale.The only thing missing from this book was Jack Ryan, and I thought the conclusion was a slightly anti-climatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this only if you are really bored.","review":"I guess no one dares to edit Tom Clancy because this book could have been halved without losing anything. Not that it would have gained anything either. If you want some excitement read an author whose books I found here at Special Forces museum at Fort Bragg-- Bob Mayer. Amazon also carries his titles. Try EYES OF THE HAMMER or DRAGON SIM-13, SYNBAt, CUT OUT or ETERNITY BASE. Great reads and from talking with guys who serve in special forces here, this is the real thing. Mayer was a former Green Beret himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Read","review":"This book was very good, but in this review I'm going to post negative aspects of the read. 1. The book is strongly biased in favor of the militant right. 2. Supports the myth that Americans are of course, the very best. 3. Supports the myth that terrorists are nearly harmless. 4. Openly bashes the vegetarian and environmentalist lifestyle. 5. Openly bashes and secular movement in the USA today. I hope that should prepare you for an other wise great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"97 degrees in Sydney in July?","review":"The book was fine (if you're a Clancy fan), but quite predictable and repetitive. The worst part, though, was the poor research. The Summer Olympics are being held in Sydney in July, and it's 97 degrees? I don't think so. Down under, it's winter, and in Sydney the temperature ranges on average between 46F and 62F degrees (according to my National Geographic atlas). This would eliminate the need for air conditioning and defeat one of the main premises of the book! This book was written way too fast. Clancy should be forced to re-read The Hunt for Red October five times before writing his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy does it again!","review":"This book is awesome. That is all that can be said about it. It is awesome. I am currently in the military, which did help a lot when referring to what the hell he was talking about. Whenever someone comes up to me asking if I like it, just one word awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to this author's previous efforts.","review":"The cast of characters in this book will be familar to readers of other books by this author. The action in RB6 is good but the goal of the bad guys, who the reader KNOWS will never be reached, is too much to believe. The notion that a large group of people could conspire to pull off such a double bad deed without somebody spilling the beans is way beyond belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Scenario","review":"Thought this was much better than his last one but still something lacking...Just couldn't give it five stars. Good group of main characters just wish I would have found out something more about them. If they are part of the plot of his next book then Clancy needs to do a better job focusing on their work not just their personalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friendly heroes and idiot villains","review":"Clancy's books are often uneven, but usually they are strong overall. When this one focuses in on the main plot halfway through, one can't help but notice that the villains are very poorly rendered. They seem like a hodgepodge of misguided keystone cop bad guys. Their logic and actions are so ridiculous that the book falls apart by the end, leaving the reflective reader very disappointed. If only real life terrorists and mad scientists were this incompetent, we could all sleep safely at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOOCH! Mr. Clancy falls of his bike!","review":"I am a huge Clancy fan! Unfortunately this book does not measure up to the author's reputation. I became bored with the repeated rescue operations that seemed to contribute nothing more than weight to the book. In Mr. Clancy's previous books, it was clear that the long buildup to the conclusion would all come together in the end but also that the buildup/plot building had meaning and interest of its own. It is obvious that much of this book is filler that an intelligent reader is not going to appreciate. I am ashamed to admit it but I could not even finish it. I feel like a blasphemer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the cut and paste Tom!","review":"I used to be a Clancy fan.This has changed with the last few novels. Way too much repetition. Rainbow Six has great action, a vaguely believeable plot (you have to try!) but could easily have been written with half as many trees!I saw another review which commented that descriptions were repeated - this is absolutely my impression as well. Please Tom, if you have described something already, give your readers the benefit of the doubt as to whether they will remember it! Some of the descriptions of plots/ people are word for word the same in multiple places in the book.Having said all that, I was vaguely entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie for this book will be in black and white.","review":"\\"They made me write it,\\" or so Tom Clancy would seem to imply. Perhaps he is disinterested with his past style, or maybe this book fulfills a contract. Rainbow Six is analogous to Beethoven played on a Casio toy keyboard -- the talent is hidden somewhere, but the result is too mechanical to be enjoyed. Those who have read his other (very good) stories must, of course, read this superfluously opinionated sermon/novel. A word of caution: be prepared to bulldoze your way through every tedious, exhausting minute of seemingly never-ending verbiage. As a die-hard fan waiting with sweaty palms, this book was most disappointing and irritating.Rainbow Six belongs at the grocery store next to the \\"Bran Flakes,\\" with a stark white cover displaying in large, black letters only the word \\"CLANCY.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Tom Clancy's best work.","review":"RAINBOW SIX is not a classic Clancy. After reading it, I felt that I had been burned by a new author. The fresh perspective is gone. If you loved the \\"OP-CENTER\\" novels this is for you. If you expect a quality novel this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics has hurt is writing","review":"Clancy was at his best in Red Storm Rising, Red October, and Clear and Present Danger because his plots were bold but plausible. That's not the case with this book. His notion that a small group of environmentalists would seek to destroy the human population of earth to protect the animals is illogical, impossible, and ludicrous. The conservative Clancy is trying to pose a threat (which doesn't exist) from the \\"greens\\" to validate his right-wing paranoia. Stick to subs and tanks, Tom."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time .... and paper","review":"I'm certainly gonna become a tree-hugger, as Mr Clancy calls conservationnists. Indeed, it really is a shame to grow and fall trees in order to print his latest novel. Mr Clancy's writings get more voluminous every time. However there is a difference between volume and quality.There is in fact no suspense at all. It is a very linear story. That combined with the size of the book (900 + pages) makes it a real bore.Too many considerations about what manhood is, as if we had awaited Mr Clancy to think about it. However we may not have drawn the same conclusion ...I promise : that is the last time I buy a book from that gentleman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tooo....much reiteration.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Clancy novels but this one had a couple of hundred pages of discribing stuff that everbody knows already, and more than once, instead of developing the story. This could have been a great novel. Sadly it was far below Clancy's best. The only reason I finished it was because it was written by Clancy and I wanted to see how the stars of the story did their thing, IE Clark and the boys. The real star of this story is really Popov"},{"rating":"2","title":"well crafted theme of rain and light","review":"Clancey's use of instinctive notation registers his reader with facination. An awakening to the now. A plot that hits close to home, he confronts the harsh political reality of our current world community."},{"rating":"1","title":"The action scenes are fun, the rest not so much.","review":"Rainbow 6 is okay.Positives:-Clancy is masterful at describing the Rainbow team's actions in the field.Negatives:-The book is way too long. So many of the chapters felt like unnecessary filler. Clancy spends way too much time with the people testing the virus on the kidnapping victims in the lab. We get it, the Shiva is a killer virus. We don't need a chapter devoted to every single time a patient coughs.-Clancy has no idea how normal humans interact. The conversation scenes between Domingo and his wife are painful to read. Steve Seagal movies have more natural sounding dialogue.-Rainbow troopers are too much like super heroes that can never be harmed. Every mission goes perfectly. Every shot is hit. The bad guys are all bumbling idiots. The only time they ever took a punch was when the Irish terrorists basically ambushed them. Besides that brief moment they were 100% successful at every single task."},{"rating":"2","title":"So why not five stars?","review":"Rainbow Six, he indulges in small unit tactics for a whole tome. In many ways typical Tom Clancy, the book is instructive at a layman level about anti-terrorist tactics as practiced by special forces units. I have little doubt that the usual level of research went into this book that Mr Clancy usually carries out. I admit to being an unabashed fan.So why not five stars?Well, to be honest, nothing ever goes wrong for these guys. The books continuously alludes to the virtual certainty of problems with operations, but then nothing really does. I kept waiting for the problem and the subsequent analysis, but it never happened. I realized that, among the other obvious things that I like about Clancy, the recognition of the failings that people have and the way these play out on a broad stage are much of what I enjoy about his books. This one doesn't really have that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing how bad it can be","review":"This book is one of the worst written books I've ever read. The author keeps describing the same thing over and over again, and he forgets what he wrote. At one point one captured terrorist says something in a taped confession, but it takes a few hundred pages to another terrorist say the same thing and that be received as a total surprise. It looks like the author is paid by the page, and has no time or will to think. Keep away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure garbage","review":"I haven't read a clancy novel since Patriot Games, now i know why. How many times can we hear the same one dimensional characters mouth or think the same monotonous drivel? This book is plotted at the level of a nintendo game, first mission; handle the hijacking on the plane, second mission; handle the terrorists at the bank; third mission etc... Clancy fails utterly to invoke any depth into his characters. The bad guys (which are referred to as \\"bad guys\\" about 500 times in this massive pile of crap) are consistently the same self-deceived zealots, time after time, and the good guys after killing the bad guys move into the same self satisfying passages of supposed reflection. His portrayal of environmentalism and environmentalists is a pathetic and transparent attempt to vilify politics and ideology he clearly has no understanding of, merely to serve as the punching bag for his own right-wing longwinded philosophy. I can't believe i read this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Incredible Disappointment","review":"Clancy has finally done it. After a long and illustrious career of writing techno-thrillers that I have enjoyed, he has finally produced a major snafu. I have been a fan of Clancy's book for the past 16 years and finally decided I have had enough.Clancy's characters are so wooden that they must have carved out while the tree is still standing. His apparent bias on Team 1 success is so blatant such that when the only time Team 2 led by UK based Covington was in action, the team got plastered.The killing of a hostage was glossed over and justified by the team as \\"she's going to die anyway\\" despite the obvious fact that it was an action prompted by the team's psychologist decision to push the terrorist. How obscene.Clancy obviously needs new material because repetition is getting obvious as you go through the book. I simply couldn't wait to finish so that I could recycle the book and save some trees. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Cussler, Clancy's work deteriorates.","review":"I used to love Tom Clancy. Granted he is no John Irving but his stories were fun and well told. But this book is a drudge. I've grown tired of the mutual admiration society the characters are mired in. And everything is just too simple. There is no gray area, just right and wrong. And the conservative political agenda sticks out a little too far for me. Clive Cussler lost me with that book where he and Giordino trudge through the desert (Sahara?). His shallow characterization and endless macho themes finally turned me off. I shall never read another Cussler. Rainbow Six challenges Cussler for emptiness and will be the last Clancy I ever read unless he regains his old fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story ruined by \\"magic\\" tech","review":"I liked it up until the final confrontation where the team used some completely unrealistic \\"magic\\" technology to defeat the bad guys without any kind of difficulty. It was rather anti-climactic and destroyed the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific plot, with lots of hidden clues.","review":"Clancy has again come up with a truly believable scenario for evil vs the rest of us. I really like the solution to the problem posed for extremest environmentalists.Furthermore, the plot raises some questions we all should ponder about our relationship to environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"5.5 out of 6.0","review":"This one's in the upper 87 percent of Tom Clancy's books.Althought I missed seeing a lot of Navy action in this one, there's another excellent mind-tweak as the plots come together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy's worse book yet.","review":"Unlike most other Tom Clancy books, this one is not well researched nor well thought out. The plot is almost regurgetated from part of his last book. He is extremely redundant throughout the book - he repeats parts of the plot so many times you cant help but skim though portions of the text. Usually Clancy is dead nut's on technical accuracy. This time however, some of the technical aspects of the book are pure fantasy - ridiculously so. Is it a good book? Well its fair as books go, but its well below par for Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not one of his best","review":"Looks like Clancy and his editors were rushing to get this one out the door. Numerous editing errors (e.g. Clark leaves his house twice (pp. 25/26)). Lots of repetition-how many times do we need to read the same graphic description of someone getting shot in the head or the number of shots that each character fires with their silenced weapons? No real climax, it just withers (meanders) away to a predictable ending after the hospital scene. And what mysterious disappearance at the end of the book? The Gulfstream pilots knew where they were...Tom, we expect better."},{"rating":"1","title":"no major injuries through 2/3s of the book","review":"I found myself hoping that several of the \\"enemy\\" missions were far too incompetent. I felt that the Rainbow team was no challenged enough after the various terrorist scenes. They always ended up fairing well. For example, there were only a few injuries suffered by the 1st team during the hospital scene. Those injuries were only on undeveloped characters in the novel, not signifcants characters like Chavez's or Clark's wife. I wanted the terrorists to succeed more than the Rainbow team. I quit after that scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickenly verbose","review":"This was my second attempt at reading Clancy and it will be my last. I've read thru boring, repetitive, slow, drawn out submarine chases in \\"Hunt for Red October\\" awhile back and thought maybe this would be an improvement but no such luck. This book is just a slow and drawn out and wordy. After drudging thru 500 pages the plot finally starts to unfold and makes sense but it's still disjointed. The other pieces unfold after another 100 or so.What's worse is that he's not even a great story teller. He definitely knows his stuff, I give him credit for that, but when it's overdone it becomes banal so how interesting can that be to read. You might as well read an encyclopedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged. ; ;","review":"Has anyone been able to find this in unabridged audio, I was about to purchase and realized it was abridged. ; ;"},{"rating":"2","title":"No pot of gold at the end of this rainbow","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was too drawn out and too many subplots. Hard to keep all the characters in mind. Actually, if I hadn't read any of Vince Flynn's books, I might have been a little more excited about this book. I have read some other Clancy books and enjoyed them, but this one dragged on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Familiar","review":"Another drawn out Clancy thriller in which I had to wade through hundreds of pages in search of some thrills. I didn't find many. What's happened to Clancy's inspiration? Everything in this novel is recycled out of better books and movies. For a much better techno-thriller about genetic engineering and biological terrorism, check out Joseph Massucci's Code Alpha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, poor writing, lousy editing.","review":"Rainbow Six is a good story which is badly written and disastrously edited. The characters, whom we've met in previous Clancy works, are stunted; their dialogue stilted; and their emotions stereotypically trite. The book's cumbersome, redundant prose is peppered throughout with grammatical gaffes.A strong blue pencil might have debulked this book, rendered it more readable, and reduced its price to that of its better-edited peers.All-in-all, this is Tom Clancy's worst offering to date. He gets two stars for the story and none for the storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Six best used as a doorstop","review":"What a McNovel. The same phrases and cliches were repeated several times (why do people complain about the food in England......have you tasted this bread?), the characters never develop, what a shallow piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Too Far","review":"I want a discount on a future Clancy for finishing this one. Too many scenes at the firing range. Too many undefined acronyms. Too many reminders of what happened in earlier chapters. An incredibly insulting ending. I chalk it up to author arrogance. A victim of his success. I hope he gets a wake up call from his publisher and rebounds with something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This is by far the worst Tom Clancy book...TC really seems to be short of ideas... Caricatural characters, a VERY POOR ending (for those who might think that the punch is worth it!)Those who gave a 5 stars review to this book probably only read the first chapter, the only good one of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a long time (early) Clancy fan, I read the Navel Institute edition of Red October, before his discovery by the general public.

I looked forward to Rainbow Six. I was sorely disappointed. The characters wrer colorless. The plot was bizarre and the action sequences were anti climatic. The ending was a drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you would expect","review":"Here's a quote. There are some questions in this life that we never can answer properly. Fortunately, the chicken or the egg question about the Rainbow Six game and book that's gone around the block in this space a couple of times in the past couple of days is not one of them, as Red Strom Entertainment's Jeff \\"Mad Samoan\\" Wand, modeler/artist on Rogue Spear, sends along what's hopefully an authoritative explanation of which is the cart and which is the horse here:The book was based on the game. The original concept for the game was conceived in a brainstorming session with Clancy. The original idea was that it be a 3D first person SWAT game, but Clancy threw in the idea of taking it on a grander scale and giving it an international antiterrorist angle. Some time later after the brainstorming session, he decided it was such a great idea that he'd make a book out of it, tie it in with the game, and maybe someday, a movie. Hopefully starring me."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm bored..... (tom clancy) me too! (the reader)","review":"Any review of a new Clancy book must take into consideration his library of prior novels. Even though each new book stands alone, it can not be separated from it's brethren. When reading RB6, I kept getting the feeling that something is wrong here. After finally finishing the book, the problem hit me. Clancy is getting boring. Whereas prior novels kept getting more intense as they went on, RB6 just kept going on and on. It seems as though Clancy himself is the one getting bored with the writing, and we pay the price, (twice!). To test the thought, I re-read the last 350 pages of Debt Of Honor, a recent Clancy full novel. You're interest doesn't wane. After Red Storm Rising, Clancy's focus sharpened considerably, and hopefully he will get back on track with his next major novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but a bit too much repetition.","review":"Well, I read the Dutch translation of this book and I think TC should have written it in about 500 pages or less. I would have rated this book 5 stars if RB6 couldn't save the world. But then TC had to use his fantasy :) After all I liked this book. But the personality's could have been worked out better. O yeah, one last thing: In my opinion TC used a bit too much repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a complete bomb.","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Try anything by Connelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best work sience Patriot Games!","review":"From \\"Hunt for red October\\" to \\"Patriot Games\\" this is by far the best ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"At times it is slow, and you wonder when something will happen.

This time I really ask myself how'er they (Clark & Ding) going to get out of this one? This makes Flash Gordon, Tom Mix, Hoppalong Cassidy and John Wayne look like pikers! If I had to pick which book was the most thrilling of the decade, I would have said The Firm, until I read Rainbow Six. I found myself yelling at a book! ...Look out! ...Duck! Get the long un-abridged version ...it's the only way to out Clancy, Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring, repetitive imitation of Tom Clancy","review":"As a die hard Tom Clancy fan from his first book on, how disappointing it was to discover this re-hash of Clancy standard themes that is mostly fill. I have my doubts if he did all the writing himself -- it smacks of pay-by-word. The plot has absolutely NO credibility and is slightly silly that he would ask us to suspend belief to this degree. Clancy was an embarrassment on the Larry King Live show. He seemed to have absolutely nothing to say -- just like his latest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"They left stuff out.","review":"Like all of Clancy's books, it's a good read when you don't want to have to use your mind much. I own the hardback, and the Kindle version leaves stuff out, mainly the prologue. What's up with that, Amazon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Writer?","review":"It doesn't seem possible that Tom Clancy wrote this book. The characters have no depth (John Clark and Domingo Chavez don't even resemble the same characters from the Jack Ryan series), the socio-political elements are one-dimensional and the book is filled with jargon and idiomatic expressions that Clancy never uses.I've just finished reading non-stop 5 Clancy books, starting with the \\"Bear & the Dragon\\", and then reading in order from \\"Clear & Present Danger\\" through \\"Executive Orders\\". Each of these books were addictive and provided insights on a wide variety of levels. You could get into the minds of the characters and understand their multi-dimensions.I'm having trouble finishing \\"Rainbow Six\\" as the characters and plot are so superficial.Hopefully \\"Rainbox Six\\" was written by a ghost writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad book","review":"While my expectations were much higher for this book, I did get a good laugh at the end. Other than that, I wrote the story about 100 pages in, the political rambling on various topics got old really quick, and the perfection of the Rainbow group was boring. Also, I felt that the characters were never really developed. I'd skip this one and read Without Remorse instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy almost does it again.","review":"Rainbow 6 started well enough. The action and pace is typically Clancy, but after that, the book goes downhill. Characters are shallow, and we never feel for John Clark and Ding as we felt for Jack Ryan. The plot is not as believable as Clancy's Ryan novels and the bad guys even less so. As a Clancy fan, I felt a little cheated. From anyone else, this might have been a decent enough book, from Clancy, this is a let down indeed. I keep flipping the pages thinking it will get better, I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant novel which I could not put down","review":"I would have given it 5 stars had it not been so long with so many spaces between the action sequences. I agree with other reviewers that it could have been written in 400-500 words instead of 700."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's new low...","review":"Nowhere is the decline of Western civilization more evident than in its art, and Mr. Clancy's latest attempt at a thriller is artless indeed. Poorly developed characters, a plot line written with aspirations for the silver screen (and not the page), and Mr. Clancy's nauseating platitudes to the gods of technology make Rainbow Six among his worst in recent memory. If he cannot be persuaded to take early retirement, then perhaps he might recall those early days of red storms rising when the desire to tell a great story superceded the need to placate a great and growing ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"As an avid Tom Clancy fan, I was excited to read his new book, but was very quickly disappointed. His repeated phrases and tired plot of commandos against crazed environmentalists was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, overdone, simplistic","review":"I've read all of Clancy's major novels, and this one was boring. I finished it (simply to see how the story turned out), but it took me three weeks and wasn't very enjoyable.The armed services men are great, men are strong (but can't handle babies), corporations need to be watched very closely (the're so prone to evil), and environmentalists are the enemy. These themes are all laid on over and over again.This book and Cardinal of the Kremlin will go down as Clancy failures. My copy will be available at my library used book sale for a dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy Drops a Bomb","review":"In the spirit of classic Clancy novels, techno-talk that we all love, action scenes that Spielburg only wishes he could come up with, Rainbow Six is....not among them. Rainbow Six, in my humble opinion, having read all of his works, is his weakest to date. The story lines are elementary, the dialouge is forced, the action scenes, usually superb, are weak and the plot is something that could have been ghost-written by Pieznick or whoever in his bathtub. Clance; what happened, man? All that money boring you? Dulling the brain? Dishearted over the Orioles? You owe it to your loyal fans like myself; who own every one of your books and who are trying hard to not conceed #1 to Stephen Hunter. You're better than this. Don't rest on the laurels. This latest effort is stunningly mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly long, exhaustive, utterly boring and lacks direction.","review":"I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books except Rainbow Six. The plot was confusing, no idea of what the plot was supposed to be until better than halfway through the book. The book lacked direction, had no real character development. The length of the book could have been pared down and would have made for less boring reading. The commitment of the bad guys, their love of nature, was endlessly dribbled in most of the pages of the second half of the book, so that more pages of the book could be filled . The space should have been used for better plot development. Overall, this book was very dissatisfying for a major Clancy novel. I shall hesitate before venturing to purchase the next one. Get an editor and trim down the inconsequential garbage that seems to abound in the stories more and more. I give this book a zero star, even though the rating is one star. Amazon.com doesn't have a zero rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of an era...","review":"The end of the cold war has put many people out of work and one of them might just be Tom Clancy. History will record Rainbow Six as the book that caused many Clancy lovers to move on.Although the concept of an international anti-terrorism force has great potential, Clancy squanders the opportunity by taking on a plot that couldn't be handled even by this bloated 900 page effort. After suffering through page after page of dry character and plot develeopment, I was amazed at the lack of pay-off at the end.If you are the weekend paintball type, this book will probably still turn your crank. If you're like me and love Tom Clancy novels for their mix of real drama and high tech narrative, you will be sadly dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Just) 10 exciting pages","review":"When I read the book \\"Hunt for Red October\\" I became fan of Tom Clancy. His best one is \\"The Sum of all Fears\\". But when I bought \\"Operation Rainbow\\" (thats the name of this book in the german version) I really was bored. This book starts a little bit interesting. The kidnapping of the millionaire in Austria is written good and the Austrian Police is described, how it really is. But the large middle part of the plot is not very exciting. Some pages are really boring. Just the last 10 pages are exciting in the book.Not a very good book at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another can't put it down book by the master , Tom Clancy.","review":"I enjoyed RAINBOW SIX as much as the last four novels.The way he writes these books makes you wish the world realy had a special counter terror unit lead by a man like John Terrence(Kelly)Clark. The only thing I missed from the book is the lack of the caracter Jack Ryan.I hope the next book is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Tom Clancy fired his editor?","review":"You have to wonder if Tom Clancy has fired his editor. This book is much too long. Which is too bad, because the basic story is good and the action sequences are very good. However, it would have been a much better book if it had been boiled down to half its size, or even less. In order to get at the story, you have to wade through page after page of pointless introspection, needless description, and unnecessary dialog. As a long time fan of Clancy's work, I was disappointed. == Come on Tom, you can do much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shalow, shallow, shallow","review":"Geez, Everytime Clancy writes a new novel it seems things get more and more the same. He seems to take marvelous characters and cut the heart out of them. Then just to top everything off, he appears on the back of cover looking like a fighter jock ready to launch off the Eisenhower. Has he perhaps become a \\"wannabe?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The new word for thriller is RAINBOW.","review":"The book Rainbow Six is a well crafted and very exciting thriller from Mr. Tom Clancy. I read it and couldn't put it down. It ranges from intelligence and espionage to an all out global biological threat. This is one of Clancy's best.

If you like true thrillers Rainbow Six is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame, Shame","review":"If your a die-hard Clancy fan, go for it, if your not, then skip it. This is just another tired killer virus novel, that has been done much better way too many times. Mr. Clark in \\"Without Remorse\\" and in the Jack Ryan series was always well done, in this novel he's not done at all. Talk about a let down, I was *very* disappointed... Poor Plot, really bad editing (mispelled words, poor grammer, etc.)Poor Character development, way too long, and an incredible mismanaged climax (finish) and to top it off we have to listen to Clancy's right wing rants and raves throughout the book. So much anticipation, so little satisfaction...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old plots and characters re-hashed","review":"Certainly not up to the standards of originality found in HFRO or Cardinal of the Kremlin. Tom, you've already used a death virus against the world.On characters, Clark and company are not saints, the efforts to make the characters more \\"real\\" comes across as contrived. The only interesting character was Popov, because his greed and questioning were real. He (Popov) would have figured out the dastardly plot about 200 pages earlier. At least he got the gold in the end.One other note Mr. Clancy, I do not need to be told fifty times that all the dumb terrorists are either dead or in jail, I got it after the first five. Summary: I have the distinct feeling that this book was a \\"vehicle\\" for a best selling author to come out with another best seller. I wish the current reviews had been posted before I bought the book. Re-read Cardinal of the Kremlin for a good Clancy story. He knows how to do it, he needs to dig deeper next time.,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another donation to the Tom Clancy retirement fund......","review":"I really didn't want to be disappointed with this one. Clancy's fame is well earned after penning such winners as Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for Red October. So, setting aside the multitude of grammatical and spelling errors, what's the explanation for the redundant descriptive phrases and shallow dialogue that riddle this story like rounds from an MP-10? Furthermore, I couldn't get past the basic fallacy of the plot, which was that no evil scheme of such cosmic proportions as this one could plausibly escape the notice of the general public. And how about the families of all those Project members? Finally, as if Clark's punishment of the environmentalists wasn't enough, Clancy wastes a good portion of our woodland resources in pages and pages of empty writing which don't provide the readers or the characters with anything useful. If this had been a movie, I would have waited for the VHS version...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I have always been a HUGE fan of Tom Clancy's books and went out of my way to buy this one as soon as it hit the stores. I am really sorry I did not read some of the reviews here first. I could have saved myself a lot of time.The book is WAY too long - the eco-terrorists plan is outlined so often by so many characters that I was beginning to wonder if Clancy was being paid by the page. Also, the typos and syntax errors are worse than any I have ever seen in a book being released with this much advance press.Overall, I found the book extremely disappointing. Clancy has gotten lazy in using the same characters once again rather than taking the time to develop new ones - and I won't even mention his portrayal not only of female characters but the way in which is primary characters interact with them.As well, his personal views have colored what was at the core a good story line with lots of action-packed conflicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I loved the book. Clancy spends a lot of time setting up the story, but with action all throughout the story, you hardly notice it. This is definately my favorite of Clancy's books.

I will buy more books of this series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Double-tap the messenger, but I have bad news","review":"Tom Clancy is running out of bad guys and plausible situations. The book opens with a potential terrorist attack on a passenger jetliner in flight. Lo and behold, the world's top counter-terrorist team just happens to be there, in transit to their new headquarters in the United Kingdom.While Clancy is known for his intense action situations and eerily accurate military knowledge, I had to force myself to finish this book. Will Tom Clancy kill off the ENTIRE WORLD? Take a guess. Read on as a group of highly intelligent scientists and doctors hatch a wholly ridiculous plan. Count how many times the authors use the word 'niggardly' and wonder why (I counted six). You're better off reading Clancy's 'Cardinal of the Kremlin'. Strange to think that a video game would be better than the book it was based on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy is an exiting, thrilling book because there is a great deal of action, there are many thrilling fights and brawls, and there are many dangerous situations with bombs, guns, and firearms.One of the dangerous situations was when one of \\"the banks glass doors opened and a man in civilian clothes dragged a body onto the sidewalk. It seemed to be a man but his head was a red mess.\\" A place in the book that had action was when \\"they heard a loud metallic crash that shook the whole world.\\" A good fight was when \\"the phisician reacted by dropping away from the gunman behind him with his hands over his head.\\" In conclusion the book held my attention and was an action packed thrilling book with fights and many dangerous situations. The book also taught me all about terrorist attacks and how they are handled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"This is one of Clancy's best and should be read by all of his fans. Though it is long (Almost 900 pages) it does read fast and for the most part is interesting. Some parts drag but these are far and few. If you have read Clancy before or want to reading him than this is the book. If you really like it try the game titled likewise and the sequel Rogue Spear both of these while not having many of the same people or missions are just as good"},{"rating":"1","title":"No pot of gold at the end of this \\"Rainbow\\"","review":"It seems as though this has been done before. The same ideas, format, novel progression, and hokey idealistic themes are present here that have been in the \\"Op-Center\\" drivel, only stretched out to 700 pages. The only thing that this book has to offer is Clancy's detailed explaination of some of today's newer gadgetry. In fact, if one were to review some of the earlier novels and compare it to this book, one would have to wonder if Clancy wrote this himself or if he hired a ghost writer to do it for him. If you must read this book because you have been a Clancy fan, like myself, be sure to buy the cheapest paperback that you can find so that your disappointment can be minimized."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I will keep this short and get the point acrosse. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. Once you start reading you can stop. There is great action from the first to the last page. I definately reccomend buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Sox","review":"Since I got access to Tom Clancy's books back in 1992, I have been a big fan of his books and tried to read all new ones. While the general plot of the book is very good (as usual with Tom Clancy) it seems that he became too assured of his success and he does not pay attention to details that make the good fiction book. I did not like that there were so many places in the book where Tom Clancy repeats his lines over and over. It also appears that Clancy was tired by the end of his book and tried to finish it as soon as possible making the book crippled at the end. One more comment (that is just one more example of his failure to pay attention to the details) - all references to Russian words in the book do not make any sense (it looks like Tom Clancy just opened a bad English-Russian dictionary for pre-school and took the Russia words from there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely below par for the course","review":"As an avid Tom Clancy fan, having read all of his Jack Ryan novels as well as his previous John Clark story, I was excited about reading his new book. But unfortunately, I finished it with a bitter taste in my mouth. The story, while well researched as always, and including all the technical detail Clancy novels are known for, was just too far-fetched. While one could easily imagine his other stories as really happening in the real world, this was just too much to grasp. The majority of the characters were very two-dimensional, leaving you wanting for more insight. Not to say that there weren't good parts...the terrorist takedowns were very exciting, and Popov's role was intriguing, but it didn't make up for the glaring weaknesses elsewhere...and the ending was very frivolous, with the superhuman team armed with everything going against people with next to nothing...he could have done it much better. Overall, quite disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbow Six - The best yet","review":"I don't know what some of these people were smoking when they were writing these reviews. This is Clancy's best book yet. He has wonderful details, a great writing technique, and a storyline that even suprised me at the end. This is Clancy's best book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clancy's Best","review":"While I love everything else Clancy has written, this book was a disappointment. The same Clancy technical knowledge is there, but the plot leaves you wanting more. It starts great, but by the end it becomes a bad spy novel of world domination. Read Jon Land if you are into that, otherwise go back to Clancy's other proven winners."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This is by far the worst of Tom Clancy's books. The story line is predictable, the characters are all one dimensional, and it is boring. Mr. Clancy had several opportunites to explore the contradictions in the \\"good guys\\" that kill for a living and the bad guys that want to kill everyone to restore earth to a \\"pristine\\" condition, but he never took them. His bad guys are just plain unbelievable. Even the most extreme environmentalist would believe that a small colony of 5000 people would survive without support from a much larger group. Where are they going to get their fuel? How about supplies for their research? Electricity? Spare Parts? The bad guys act like these things will magically appear. Totally unbelievable. One of the main tasks of an author is cause us to suspend our disbelief in favor of the story. Mr. Clancy failed miserably. If you are not a die hard Clancy fan, avoid this stink-a-roo at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Had Read The Warnings","review":"Only after reading Rainbow Six did I look up the reviews.

I am personally absolutly dissapointed. The writting is as usually good. But first the plot is thin. He could have shortend the book to 100 pages. The worst is the research. For example two out of three german words were misspelled. In school you would get an F- for that kind of spelling. Second Mr. Clancy interpretation of terrorists is laughable.

Give us a break"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Six: Clancy's worst book to date...","review":"I was extremely disappointed with Tom Clancy's latest work. It falls short in all areas where he is normally praised.The dialogue in the book is poorly written. He frequently uses all the names a character has in one brief discussion. After the second or third time it became simply boring to read everyones name.The level of detail used in R6 is very substandard. Clancy only mildly describes weapons, scenarios and tactics. High intensity encounters are normally over in a few paragraphs.I can see a reason for this though. In real life these encounters would be over in a matter of seconds, in the best case. It seems awkward from a normally thorough writer.I also found the plot to be very predictable. Normally you get a general feel for what is going to happen and then are suprised at what takes place. Not in this book.Two stars may be generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one star too many","review":"Being an avid Clancy fan, I was looking forward to this newest effort. Liner notes sounded cool. I thought, \\"Clancy ought to be able to put together a killer with this plot.\\"Well, it was a killer all right. This is by far the worst novel Mr. Clancy has written. Now, with a writer of his caliber, this would normally mean that it was still better than most books out there. However, in this case, it doesn't. If fact, I can't remember a more awful novel I have read voluntarily.The characters, usually a strong point for Clancy, are complete cardboard cutouts. The plot is inane. And the ending is anti-climatic to be generous.Save the cash and borrow the book. You may need to read it only for reference later on when a conscious Tom Clancy writes another good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy has lost his touch","review":"Clancy has lost his magic with Rainbow Six. It just plods along with limited thrill. It's a long read with no climax; it just runs out of gas. And why are there typos? Tom, go back to your roots and write more like Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising. That's where your magic is."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same -- just like all his other novels","review":"Come on, what does Clancy do -- take his other books, put them in a blender, mix up the parts and pour out a new book. Wives getting kidnapped, IRA terrorists, Russian spies, tough husbands, wives involved in the medical profession, etc., etc. Haven't we read this same book about a half dozen other times -- all of them with Tom Clancy's name on the cover. Nearly every character in the book repeatedly utters Tom Clancy's favorite 4-letter vulgarity. And, of course, the dozens of graphic descriptions of bullets entering (and exiting) villan's heads add a charming touch to the book. If you can stomach all of this and then manage not to get bogged down in the huge loopholes, unsympathetic characters and implausible sequences of events, you just might have a fine read ahead of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this.","review":"I like Clancy's earlier books but I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this. One dimensional characters, a predictable plot-- hey the good guys always win!-- and way too long. You want good action, check out Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE, Bob Mayer's CUT OUT or DRAGON SIM-13, or Bob McGuire's THE GATE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong Clancy offering","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable read, Clancy again shows his stuff as master of the techno-thriller genre. In his latest book, Clancy explores the end game of the fanaticism of intellectual pride and arrogance. His protagonists provide contrast with strong character, honor, integrity and duty in defense of the defenseless. We could use more of these in today's world. Too bad we have to wait another 2 years for his next book. In the meantime, I will watch the news and see if the \\"people-finder\\" gadget is real or science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst to date.","review":"Clancy obviously has different constraints nowadays like publishers to satisfy, etc. As a result he is having to move with the times especially with the end of the Cold War being witnessed. His usual attention to detail is obviously missing. Some may argue why worry about such trivialities (e.g. the VC.20B that Clark and Chavez use to fly from Canada to the U.K. is not a Gulfstream 4 but a G3!. In the U.K. we talk about a draw in Football - Soccer, not ties!) but things like this should be easily verified and was the thing that won him many fans in the first place. This is a good book and easy to read but when compared to the very high standards that he set early on this one falls well short. It will appeal to the masses who aren't quite so discriminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated thriller by out-of-form author","review":"Anyone expecting the quality of \\"Hunt for Red October\\" in \\"Rainbow Six\\" will be sorely disappointed. This book is repetitive, illogical and poorly researched. For example - the Sydney Olympics will be held next August while it's winter in Australia. Clancy's plot however, is built on the premise that it'll be so hot during the Olympics that an extensive cooling system will be relied on to help spectators and competitors cope with the 90 degree+ heat. His characters are also uniformly 2-dimensional - see how action man grandad John Clarke's repeatedly bemoans his role as a desk jockey while his macho Spanish son-in-law's (Ding!?) most gruelling experience seems to be a flight from England to Australia - my seventy year old mother complains less than this anti-terrorist superman ... And there is not a scrap of humour on any of the 800 odd pages (not intentional, anyway). Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst in the series","review":"This one was a big disappointment. Missing are the believable military-political scenarios that characterized Clancy's earlier works; in their place, the author inserts a storyline that moves the book from the techno-thriller genre he pioneered into the realm of B-movie sci-fi. The ending takes the right-wing preaching that began to assert itself in _Executive Orders_ to a new zenith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but could use more","review":"Rainbow Six was one of the best books I have ever read. It had action, suspense, drama, and a lot more. I loved the novel and would recommend it to anyone. I would personally love to see it become more than just a novel and game. I'd really like to see it become a movie. However I do admit there might be a bit too much dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping read","review":"This book was ther first Tom Clancy book that I read and it was even better than I had expected by word of mouth. The characters were realistic and also very human, the plot was huge yet simple and the action was fast-paced and shocking. If you are looking for a good book to read then pick this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite there","review":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six gives the very inside details of what it's like to be behind-the-scenes FBI agent. If you have completely no interest in crime scene srategies I highly recommend you choose a different book.Rainbow Six takes a little while to get into, but once you hit the teams first climax point, you will be stuck to the plot. The relationships between the teams members also carry the plot to a true American genre.I can't quite agree with one of the quotes on the side covers as \\"thrilling\\", but I can say there are points were you coerce yourself into reading passages again in disbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts bad and gets worse","review":"All the stereotypes are here: the big men with their big guns, the crazed terrorists with their slightly smaller guns and for good measure he throws in a bunch of mad enviromentalists ready to wipe out the entire population of the earth. It's clear that Clancy stopped doing research for his books years ago (his lack of knowlege is pretty glaring - he obviously doesn't know the difference between the Provos and the INLA) and this book proves that he could no longer bother to think up a plot either. The book is little more that a set of predictable action sequences strung together on the back of an absurd story which, thankfully, is little more than filler.If you enjoy a good thriller, read one of the masters like Forsyth or le Carrier. If you enjoy books written by a computer program, read Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book by a Great Author.","review":"Rainbow Six was a great novel that kept me thinking and plotting through the whole book. It opens up with a great action segment and introduces readers tho the main characters. Throughout the book it unfolds a great storyline of espionage and terrorism. Its action-packed and full of suspense.It is about a team of awsome military perfectionists put together by the government in case of a world crisis.The team is called Rainbow Six and is headed by John Clark, an old war veteran/espionage expert. The team travels all around the world tending to terrorist acts that the local police cant control.All in all, this book was simply amazing and i recomend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys action/suspense novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a Break","review":"Although I've read everything but those op-center books, the declining quality of his latest offerings caused me to buy Rainbow 6 with some trepidation. I now regret buying and reading this ridiculous book. There is no reason for this lightweight story to occupy 740 pages -- is Clancy getting paid by the word? Clancy should place more emphasis on tight plotting and omit the right wing paranoia. Also, subtlety is definitely not his strong suit. The ham-fisted superhero treatment of Clark, Chavez, and the rest of the Rainbow 6 team is straight out of a comic book. Finally, I won't spoil it by telling you who the villains are, but if you find them as scary as Clancy does, you are part of the lunatic fringe. What happened to the guy who wrote The Hunt for Red October?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has John Clark gone ??","review":"What a disappointment! For the first time Mr Clancy has filled his novel with cardboard characters and a turgid story. John Clark is portrayed as a bumbling and shortsighted leader whose constant shortcomings are highlighted by the intelligence and abilities of 'Super' Ding. Where has the John Clark from Without Remorse gone. Even Jack Ryan seems to be an incompetent president. It is left to Mr Clancy's newest hero, Ding to almost singlehandedly save the world.Normally I read Mr Clancy's books in one sitting - this one I had great difficulty even finishing.Please Mr Clancy revert to your old writing style, save your political philosphies for your non-fiction works"},{"rating":"1","title":"wake me when it's over","review":"I've read all of his books and let's just this one just hasn't grabbed me just yet. Unfortunately I dropped the book and damaged the corner so I \\"have to keep it\\". Otherwise I would have returned it. What struck me as funny is the fact that both John and Ding are so happily married and that both have kids (or kids on the way). Very non-realistic. I've met a few Spec Ops people in my day and none of them are happily married if married at all. I know I'm nit picking but every single one of his characters are \\"the best of the best\\". The story is kind of like watching one of those PrimeTime movies that the big channels puts on during re-run season. I guess if you can't find another book to read and you do like his style then you might as well pick it up. But don't buy the hardcover...wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbows End, Not!","review":"I think Mr Clancy has given in to pressure to produce or he had a ghost writer do this book from an outline. All my favorite characters were present but the book lacked his normal attention to detail and the story seemed to be aimless and not sure where it was trying to go. the bad guys were presented as a bunch of misguided militant vegetarians, (Vegans) and environmentalists who couldnt see the forest for the trees, the thought of killing every man woman and child on earth to advance the causes of enviromentalism and animal rights was just a little to much to swallow. I wish Mr Clancy would back up and re-group and write a story about Mr Clark during his hey day at the CIA. If you have a 10 hour flight and this book is all you have to read, then go for it. It will be better than staring at the walls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second hand copy for sale - only 300 pages used.","review":"Gave up after about 280 pages - no research done at all. Mr Clancy should use some of his money to take a trip to some of the places he set the action. There is no ambassador in Geneva (Bern is the capital of Switzerland). Bern airport is a well mown field. BA do not fly to Bern. There is no highway from the airport to the town. There are no school near banks in the centre of Bern. Etc. (see review regarding Sydney also) In this day and age why does the guy have to smoke (a pipe) after operations. I echo other reviews about the length of the book - could have been written in half the number of words. Unless you think Clancy is the ONLY writer on the planet don't buy this book - if sales are low enough maybe he will try harder next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy does it AGAIN","review":"Tom Clancy has proven, once again, why he is the foremost author of the military thriller. A book that focuses on Clark is a nice change of pace from Clancy's last work (Executive Orders), focusing on political intrigue. Clancy demonstrates that, despite his expertise in other fields, he still shines brightest when writing of espionage and counter-terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick a fork in him - Clancy's done.","review":"Clancy has clearly gotten full of himself over the last few years, and it shows in this book -- it seems hastily written, with many continuity errors and few attempts at creating the plot intricacies or action excitement that his first five books did. The characters in Rainbow Six are all one-dimensional, cookie-cutter stereotypes. They even all think and speak the same way, with the same key phrases and idioms, which becomes intensely aggravating after a few chapters. The plot is thin, and depends on several chance occurrences or perfect deductive reasoning by the good guys to move along. I loved Clancy's early works, but they've been getting worse and worse. This one is just crap. I couldn't even make myself finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the Op-Center books - Utterly boring","review":"At least the Op-Center books were not as long. I thought his last book was tedious, but this was far worse. This is nowhere near as good as my favorite - The Sum of all Fears. I usually finish his books in 2 days, but this one took 10 days. I wish he would give up trying to proselytize people to his ultra right wing views and get on with writing good thrillers, and I usually vote Republican!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way off Clancy's peak.","review":"Rainbow Six was disappointing. On the positive side, the characters are familiar and comfortable. However, they've become so familiar, you know almost exactly what they will say before they say it. The villians were cardboard figures with no depth. I'll still read his next book. When he's on, he's great. {note: Editing was sloppy.}"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I suffered through this book, and now remember why I swore off Clancy after \\"Patriot Games\\". PG was the FIRST time I ever recall a movie version being superior to the book. It got me wondering about who Clancy is and if he realy does his own writing. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and \\"...Red October\\" had me by the jewels until the last page, but those two books Clancy gives a \\"lot\\" of credit to others. Is \\"Rainbow Six\\" an example of the \\"real\\" Clancy? It is boring, repetitive, and totally unbelieveable, plus it should have been half the length. The heroes are all sickly-sweet and the villians belong in comic books. Maybe this should be made into a movie, like \\"PG\\" it would probably improve it. I think I really will swear off Clancy now. I gave my copy to someone I don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to remain of fan, don't even start this one.","review":"Clancy must have been paid by the word for this book. Redundancies abound! Not to mention the plot was neither original nor were the charaters believable. I think I'll give up my rule of 30 yrs. to finishing one book before I start another."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the Contractual Obligations book!","review":"I've been a Clancy Fan since Hunt hit paperback. My copies of Hunt, Red Storm and Patriot all fell apart from over-reading. All the other hard covers are on my shelf.That established, this book was mediocre at best. Most of the positive reviews seem to be from people who read Op-Center or this is their first Clancy. It really is like someone else took his notes and wrote it for him. The plot just isn't there and the character are weak. TC is capable of so much more. I may wait <gasp> for the next book to come out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice","review":"If you disliked his Op Center series, you will really dislike this one. The slowest reading Clancy book to date, it'll put you to sleep. I've read everything written by Clancy and this is, by far, the most disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Research","review":"While I admit that Clancy has written another page-turner, as a German speaker I deplore his obviously shoddy research. Virtually every reference to Germany and German (of which the book abounds) is false or erroneous; he obviously neglected to take the elementary precaution of having a native speaker at least correct his spelling of words like \\"Schreklichkeit\\" (correct: \\"Schrecklichkeit\\") or \\"Burger Fuhrer\\" (\\"Bergführer\\" - his version sounds like something sold by McDonald's. This lack of writers' craftmanship may not distract from the power of the story, but it does induce skepticism towards other details of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story but tedious, repetitive, and trite dialog","review":"I liked it as I do most of Tom Clancy's books. The story is spellbinding. I thought the dialog was repetitive. Characters made statements and 20 pages later the same thing was repeated verbatim. I think Mr. Clancy was either trying to make the book thick or needs a new editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good from one of the greats","review":"I just finished Rainbow Six and my wife is greatful. Most of the book is the intricate, high-tech, cerebral thriller one expects of Clancy. The ending, however, fizzles somewhat despite the nice twist on the last 2 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"very predictable","review":"If this is the first book of Clancy that you are about to read, pick another one. This is the worst book he has written. The book has about 300 to 400 pages more that it should. Most of Clancey's books have enough exiting and intriguing areas to outweigh the slow areas, but not this time. I had to be very determined to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed w/Latest Clancy Work","review":"I have read every one of Clancy's novels up until now. However, Rainbow Six and Executive Orders were mediocre at best. I sense that Tom may not have any more good ideas to use now that the Soviet Union is gone and he has taken his other hero Jack Ryan all the way to the White House. As for John Clark, well I think Clancy should have stopped at Without Remorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delete the redundancies and the book is 1/2 as long.","review":"Clancy seems to have written several chapters, all independently of eachother. Then he put them all together in some order to create this book (screenplay?). He repeats over and over again the exact same words, phrases, and thoughts throughout the book. After you finish skipping half the book, as you go through it page-by-page, you will find yourself bored.This would be a good Clancy to skip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and don't read this.","review":"All the things that made Red October and Red Storm Rising great are missing here (feasability of the plot, attention to detail, exploring new areas). How long can an author get by on his past accomplishments ?Tom Clancy has become interested only in becoming a revenue machine, putting his name in a series of products of very debious quality. This is sad comming from a man who's main character stopped trading in stocks because he become bored with making money and wanted to do something meaningful with his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Extremely boring... The first Clancy book that was not a constant page turner for me. What happened Tom?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Let's start with a disclaimer - I am a huge Clancy fan. Debt of Honor was one of the best books I've ever read. I thought Cardinal of the Kremlin was the best espionage novel I'd ever seen.So, here's the new Clancy novel. It's huge, but that only makes me anticipate it more. More thrills, more great technology, etc.After finishing it, all I can say is - what a disappointment. The Prolouge is vintage Clancy - greatness! From there, it gets progressively slower and more implausible. The bad guys never seemed as horrifying as I think Mr. Clancy intended. The good guys are a little too super-human. And the last 150 pages made me feel completely ripped off. I could not believe the magnitude of Clancy's cop-out.Previous Clancy misfires (most notably, Sum of All Fears) were still pretty good, just not up to the usual Clancy standard. Rainbow Six is just bad. Please, Tom, take a few years off and come back with stories that live up to your earlier great works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrite, ill-researched, poorly edited garbage","review":"Now that Clancy has made a name for himself he seems to be happy to pump out total pulp garbage. This book is rife with political correctness and plot errors. Who honestly believes that the weather in Sydney is 100 degrees and dry during the Summer Olympics? Remember, this is winter in Australia. The entire plot hinges on this ill-conceived notion. To boot, Clancy continues to show his total blind spot in subjects such as small arms (don't even get me started on the subject of a supressed 10mm...), high-technology and small unit tactics. The book is entertaining from a pure adrenaline standpoint, however, if you're looking for literary fulfillment (or even a credible plot line), look elsewhere. Clancy's days as a credible author were over after he wrote \\"Debt of Honor\\" and he continues to prove this with every new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of plot is this??","review":"I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books. And while Rainbow Six is not necessarily a bad read, it has some very lame aspects to it. The plot is so far fetched and downright offensive toward environemtalists it scares me. Also, Clancy's writing is incredibly repetitive at times. He uses the word \\"niggardly\\" 3 times in 20 pages. And he uses the analogy \\"as regularly as he zips up his pants\\" a couple of times. What the hell kind of writing is this? I was laughing at how bad some of the writing was. But on a side note some of the action sequences are cool, but again it kind of wears old after 700 pages. I wish Clancy would stop trying to showcase his extrememly conservative views through his novels. Tom, this is your readers here, WE DON'T CARE. You may be a good writer, but as a person you seem to be a total jerk. Get back to your old self and keep it real next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of something better to write about I guess","review":"I've read better Clancy. He needs to take some time off, find a suitable enemy, and come up with a realistic plot. R-6 was almost impossible for me to get through. I don't plan on buying any more Clancy novels on blind faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below the personal standards I have had for Clancy ...","review":"I was truly surprised by how un-interesting the book was. Till now, I usually can't stop reading one of Tom Clancy's books but this one just seems too unrealistic. The conversation is awful and some of the slangs were really out there. In general, I think Clancy has gotten too much of a love for John Clark and made him this indestructible super human - for this kind of character, I could read just about every other action-thriller book. Also, his attack on environmentalists was just plain stupid - they are NOT murdering pscyopaths bent on eliminating humans and it was a very unfair characterization - shame on you Tom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What big authors don't need editors?","review":"Rainbow Six is about...400 pages too long. There are about 300 pages of good Clancy here, but someone has to tell him when he's repeating himself. I can only handle so much description of training exercises. Yes, Tom, I get it, these guys are really well trained, now can you get on with the story!I started skimming this sucker at page 280 or so; and that's never a good sign. I would have quit reading it completely, but I kept hoping something good would show up; and it did occassionally. I give it two stars just so that I'm not lumped in with the reviewers who just wanted to trash Clancy's political views, but this books is probably more of a one and a half star effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible pulp.","review":"Previous TC books (not including his various Op-Center type \\"franchises\\") have required at least some massaging to yield a feature film of varying quality. Rainbow Six is a prefab script, ready to be filmed as soon as the money appears. John Clark's mention of SPECTRE (the evil organization in some of the more dubious James Bond films) was less self-effacing humor than a recognition of what he has decended to: a pulp fiction writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of exploding heads but no real suspense.","review":"I left this book in a hotel room. That's how disappointed I was after reading Rainbow Six. The only reason I finished the book was that I have enjoyed Tom Clancy's other books and kept hoping that it would turn around. It didn't. It is a simplistic book about a highly trained counter-terrorist group that never fails to kill all the bad guys. Since there is never developed in the reader any real sense that the good guys might fail, the book seems to move from one self-serving win to another. At best, this book is long and boring. At a deeper level it paints a picture of covert operations agents as a group of psycopathic killers who have thinly sheathed their obsession in questionable purpose. The story would have been ever so much more interesting if Rainbow Six had to deal with the ramifications of a successful Dooms Day plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too formulaic and predictable","review":"This book is too much like the Op-Center series: It's an easy read and fairly entertaining, but it lacks imagination, intrigue, or any great characters.Rainbow Six revisits many characters from the early Clancy novels, centering on John Clark and Domingo Chavez. While they were undeveloped in the earlier Clancy novels, they remain so here even though they are the main characters. Rainbow Six is an antiterrorism team led by Clark, which could be interesting as it takes a military operation into an urban setting. However, as the team emerges from all encounters victorious, it's boring.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone that is a Tom Clancy fan. If Op-Center is your bag of tricks, you may enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Too Bad","review":"Too long. Too little action. Too many wasted words preaching Clancy's views. Too boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give up the ghost on Clancy-- try other thriller writers","review":"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating. A riveting novel which is so real it's scary!!","review":"This action packed adventure is a roller coaster ride through the harsh realities of terrorism and the almost untouchable secret counter-terrorism group, Rainbow Six. If you've never read Clancy before read this first. You'll love it, and you'll get a sense of Clancy's unique style. He creates 5 or 6 strands which he will tie together at the end; perhaps the most incredible Clancy finale ever. The end will leave you in awe. Also read Without Remorse, which is the Clancy book which developes the main character, John Kelley, who becomes CIA legend John Clark, one of the main characters in Rainbow Six."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy is the man when it comes to these kind of books.","review":"I just finished this book and Tom did it again. He brings out bestseller after bestseller. Who cares if a C-140 can't land on that airport in where ever, the point is he made it fun to read. They made a great game out of this and now there starting a movie. If you say this book sucks then better go back and read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book from Tom Clancy","review":"The story has some stuff that Mr. Clancy wrote before ,like an attempt against wife and daugther ,the character of Mrs Carol is like Mrs Elliot, and big mistakes . A good geographical research would avoid some mistakes. Manaus is in North Brazil not in Central part . Brazilian Army and Security agencies looks with care all foreigners settlements in the Rain Forest. Manaus Airport is also a Brazilian Air Force Base . Never , I repeat never, a chopper with a machine gun would land or lift without permission from Brazilian authorities. Best Luck and hard work will bring a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom has produced finer works in the past.","review":"Tom Clancy has always been known for his accurate information when writing a novel. I think in this instance he should fire his research assistant. Hereford was never visited during the writing of this novel, or so it seemed to me. I lived in Hereford for 3 years while serving with the Royal Air Force, where did he land the C130 ?? Apart from that, the storyline was average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and without much merit","review":"Well, he's nuked a football stadium, biowarred the United States, fought desert storm II, put japan back to warring against us and it is no wonder this book fails miserably - what can he do for an encore? Well, he tries to drag us into a biowar two theme, but it just doesnt fly. Evil enviromentalists plot for 10 years to kill everyone but themselves to save the world - it just didnt generate any excitement.It would have been far better had he just let the Rainbow operation work its way through it's missions and left out the end of the world stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty poor","review":"Tom Clancy was once my favorite author (Red Storm Rising is one of the best novels I've read). I have all his books.But ... I read this book for the military bits and the action sequences and actually skipped over much of the dialogue. Jack Ryan, John Clark and Ding Chavez are all mirror images of each other. They all think, talk and act the same. Clancy has a shocking lack of ability to create anything other than 1 dimensional, wooden leading characters. Popov was the only interesting guy.I ended up hoping that the bio-terrorists WOULD succeed. That would have been much more fun.Final point: why does every British character have to say 'Quite' or 'Quite so' in every conversation???I'll keep buying the books, but I'll be treating them more as magazine articles than novels. And I thought I saw light at the end of the tunnel when I read Exectuive Orders.By the way, I echo other comments about reading 'Blackhawk Down' - excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a complete bomb.","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Try anything by Connelly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!Why did Clancy write a book so below his standard","review":"This book was way too gory and had no suspense at all. I didn't feel it was up to Clancy's usual standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like gore and madmen and no plot, get this.","review":"Clancy's latest offering is yet another decline from his high level of excellence in the eighties. Hunt for Red October, Cardinal in the Kremlin and other similar works were well researched, had well developed characters and a pace of plot development that kept things moving and exciting. Rainbow Six depends more on heads being turned into pink meat than anything else to sustain interest. It also suffers from the drag it out write as many words as you possibly can to get your point across for absolutely no reason syndrome. This is one to avoid unless you are truly an avid fan or desperately need some beach reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very exciting and descriptive.","review":"This book is very real and actually lets you see what a swat team does and the thoughts of the terrorists. The back-lying plot is so cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very detailed book.","review":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six goes into the detail of all the terrorist plans. He doesn't leave out any minor things that could affect a mission, yet he pulls it off to make the good guys win again. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot but too obvious from the start and repetitive","review":"This is probably one of Clancy's worst novels. The plot is good but it is completely given away far too early. Add the relentlessly repetitive nature of what goes through each characters mind and I was tempted now and then to pass a few pages and find a place where the story would resume. The main characters long-winded thoughts about surviving in the \\"new world order\\" left me wondering if Clancy himself is going through a similar crisis. It seems to me that this fine novelist is going for the easy money this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling Read: A Good Book for Clancy Fans.","review":"The book begins with an airplane highjacking and ends with a stunning climax. A fascinating look into the anti-terrorist world, it is a must read for fans of Clancy and his John Clark thriller Without Remorse. At times, this book makes you want to grab a weapon and go at those looney \\"tree-huggers\\" along with the Rainbow team. At times, a little predictable, but an intersting look at the post Cold War situation of terrorism from within the U.S. Not his best work, but still very readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great action packed adventure","review":"Thrilling book. One of Clancy's best book, I don't care about other reviews, this is an awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is one of the most thrilling books I have read since, ever. So if your a type of person that always likerd the bad guys then this book will change your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the editing?","review":"This is the last Clancy book I buy hot off the press in hardback. From now on, I'm going to check the Amazon reviews before risking my money.Rainbow Six looks like the result of a rush writing job with almost no editing. Certain peculiar phrases, while interesting on their own, show up two or three times. Made me think that Tom was trying them out in a few places and was too rushed to figure out the one best place.The pace was very non-Clancy like. The action dragged frequently and the good guy descriptions became routine and boring. This was my first Clancy novel I found easy to put down.Fortunately, I found sufficient satisfaction with the ending to somewhat make up for the unpleasantness of the read but overall, I still cannot recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranbow 6 is the most compelling book I have ever read!","review":"Being a great fan of Tom Clancy's writing, I believe that this is his best novel since The Hunt for Red October. I think this is a flourishing beginning to Tom Clancy's action packed books about Navy Seals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clancy's best work. Phase one of a new movie.","review":"This book was a predictable disappointment. Clancy got himself between a rock and a hard place with the Delta Force community and elected (correctly) not to give the company store away. With a good director i.e., Tarentino, and some gang members from LA... Rainbow will make for an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK...Ha Ha....Now tell me..Where is the Real Tom Clancy?","review":"Well Tom you finally did it..740 pages (hardcover) of slow reading, repetetive, predictible nothingness. John Clark the \\"Dark Side of Jack Ryan\\" is nothing but a suit and tie white collar whimp. Ding Chavez must have 240\\" thighs from all of the working out he did. The Rainbow Commandos well, I hope that I can read more comic book stories to my 7 year old about virtually invicible heroes like these guys,the X-Men,and Sergeant Rock.I hear there is a new \\"Techno-Thriller\\" coming out called \\"Tree Squad Six\\". They are an elite group of commandos who seek out and destroy authors who kill trees for the sake of wasting 740 pages of paper on...well..books that are just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very inspired writing or story.","review":"I took the recommendation of an earlier reader and bought EYES OF THE HAMMER for four bucks. Great book-- real special ops guys in action. Indeed, based on my military experience in the Rangers, its even more realistic than Clear And Present Danger. I plan on buying the rest of Bob Mayer's series in hardcover-- a better investment of my money than this book was. RANGERS LEAD THE WAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too verbose and slow paced.","review":"I found the book slow moving and over weight. There was too much detail and meaningless info. It felt like he was writing to fill pages rather than fill out the story. Once he got off the soap box, the action was typical Clancy; good. But there wasn't enough of it. This is by far his worst book. I was extremely disappointed, it took me 5 weeks to finish as it never really grabbed me by the throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cotton Candy","review":"Tom's book is large, leading one to imagine great plots and page-turning frenzy, but no. The book is just like cotton candy - you think there is something substantial to sink your teeth into, but there is nothing but fluff! A waste of my hard earned funds (I'll not send Tom anymore for future books) and waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm depressed they chopped down a tree for this book.","review":"I have a library of Clancy books. I delight at each new one. The book is not a worthy read for his fans. It is time he changed his pattern. Like Ludlum, Grisham, and Sanders, Clancy needs to change his protagonists and his research. If not, his loyal readers won't keep reading his books. I never thought I'd say this, but it's true. I enjoyed the book very little, but the best book I read this summer is your new posting of Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture, where secret government technology, murder, torture, and plot intrigue rule supreme. Reminded me of Red Storm Rising and Search For Red October by Clancy in his finest form. I do not recommend this book to every Clancy fan. Tried to read it 3 times, no luck. Sorry Tom, you missed the mark by a mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Class Clancy","review":"I've enjoyed all of Clancy's other works, especially the concise way he changes venues and characters. This had very little of this. Muddy character descriptions, almost no plot, just vaguely interconnected scenes, (some that don't appear to connect until 2/3 through the book), and the worst villians I've read in a long time. His book reads like half political diatribe and half like the first draft of Executive Decision. This one should be missed completely and allow Mr. Clancy a chance to try again, this time without the political undertones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy outside his realm of expertise-Weak in the extreme.","review":"Proof that Clancy is extremely stale. I was left with a feeling that he threw this one together on a whim without much, if any, forethought or research. This was stunning in that Clancy is THE master of research and detail. Having come to expect that bit of realism Clancy usually achieves by a mastery of technical detail, Rainbow Six was an utter disappointment and waste of time. The story was so incredibly farfetched as to be fantasy. This, in itself, would not be fatal but for his failure to develop that fantasy in anything but the most rudimentary way. Rainbow Six is simply shallow. Even in that puddle, Clancy waded in way over his head with Rainbow Six. Where his research and detail usually provide an ample life raft, this time he sunk like a hefty 700+ page bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexciting and prolonged","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books and must agree with those who feel this is far from what we have come to expect. Almost the entire book was spent in story development, leading to one very predictable event. With Clancy's books I find myself unable to put them down. With Rainbow Six I found myself having a difficult time picking it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good--not his best ever.","review":"As usual for Clancy, a well written, exciting novel. I even had to skim through the World Park section, because I couldn't take it.That said, I wouldn't have minded a few less pages in the middle, and a few more at the end. I think it finished up (relatively speaking) a bit too quickly. And yes, a few sections were far-fetched. But I think that, for the most part, is nitpicking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money or time.","review":"Tom Clancey used to write good books. What this was is easy to describe: PULP. If I took every repeated sentence, that he used to describe the same tone for the character, and removed them the book would have been about 200 pages shorter. It may have been worth the read if I didn't have to watch Seinfeld reruns. Tom should go back to the drawing board and look for a high tech war somewhere, and not some soap opera trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Six: Should be a Comic Book","review":"I won't go into deep detail, because you've already read the reviews and you know--by now--the plot of the story. Well, I think the story could have been better, but it was a fun read, and it appeared to me Clancy wanted to broaden his imagination abit, taking us on a ride where the threat is real but--like a good comic book adventure, as done in the Batman series last year, I think--the execution of a super virus is exaggerated. Mr. Clark (Rainbow Six) would be better in comics and the movies than in this form. At least great artists would make it better off.Well, send any comments. I'm sure I could challenge them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!!!!","review":"How horrible was this book? To begin, the main character dies in the end, only to be brought back by the terroists? How lame! Avoid this if you have spare time. There are so many great books out there, and this is not nearly one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-read Hunt for Red October instead of this book","review":"It's too bad that Clancy has become so powerful that he could tell his publisher's editor to f*** off. If there was one thing this overlong book needed was good editing and about five more re-writes. The result is a boring, predictable, cartoonish tech manual. It was as if he wrote his first draft as a story outline and went with it. Character development? Forget it. There are no interesting characters in the book except maybe the ex-KGB agent, who's too dull to figure out the obvious until just in the nick of time. And, by the way, the \\"nick of time\\" ending is obvious and unexciting. The heroes are mere vectors of action and have no interest to the reader as human beings. I feel used by Mr. Clancy who must have figured his reputation would sell a lot of books without really working too hard. I doubt I will buy any more of his books if this is where he is headed in his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop action that keeps you up all night.","review":"Clancy keeps the action going from the very beginning of the book. It was enjoyable to see him develop Clark and Chavez into \\"real people\\". While the good guys win easily, would we expect it to be any other way? Mr. Clancy seems to have a way of taking actual world events and weaving them into a piece of fiction that makes you set back and wonder how close the world has come to this scenario."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashingly entertaining book!!","review":"This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read (or will ever read). The plot is gradually revealed, but not too gradually. People often criticize Tom Clancy for using too much detail, but I think that the detail is what make his books so unique. He has just the right amount to keep you going. He describes all situations well and you know exactly what he's talking about with the words he uses. Almost all types of readers can get something out of this book. There's something about the life of soldiers, terrorists, an ex-KGB agent, and a facility in Kansas. But I don't want to reveal too much. Uncovering the plot is one of the joys of reading Clancy's books.

His black and white view of the world works best when he minimizes character development and maximizes action. Unfortunately this book is loaded with the interior thoughts of his characters. Chop 200 pages off this book and it would be a passable thriller. For Clancy's next book, the most important \\"good guy\\" would be a competent editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing plot and character development.","review":"I have long been a Tom Clancy fan. I have read all of his books, except for the OP-Center series. Executive Orders was and is a personal favorite. Rainbow Six is a disappointment. There is a formula feel to the book along with a manipulation of the reader to Clancy's political point of view. It is all quite obvious. The characters lack depth. The plot is contrived. Finally, at a time when we could do with some reasoned discussion of serious environmental issues, couldn't Tom have found other villians than \\"tree huggers\\" bent on killing off the human population to save the planet? Instead, Mr. Clancy has chosen to polarize the debate in a poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"And he used to be such a good author...","review":"Poor Tom Clancy. The Evil Empire is no more, and he has to go looking for villains elsewhere. First Japan, then Iran, with plots becoming less and less believable. And now something that reeks of James Bond's standard \\"saving the earth from the evil madmen\\" scenario. I have read, re-read, and re-re-read pretty much all of Clancy's work, I own it all, and I dearly love most of it, but it's going seriously downhill. I will continue to buy his books, I guess, because I like the characters (even though I did miss Ryan in this one) and I like his writing style. I guess I'm a sucker for really thick bricks when it comes to books. But this one was the least enjoyable so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Swallow","review":"If you can believe that super intellectual Earth Firster's can be bested by even more intellectual military ranger's....this book is for you.Poor character development, ridiculous plot, and paid by the ounce writing style.Do yourself a favor.

There are just so many reasons to. Whether it be an engrossing storyline your after, the knowledge of a few new guns, or graphical explanations of people getting their head shot off. This book tells the epic tale of a top secret military service that travels around the world stopping hostage events, or other terrorist plans. ... Do they make it in time? You'll have to read the story to find out...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last 50 pages were the worst","review":"This is by far the worst Clancy book that I have read. The last 50 pages were the worst. Beside his deep hatred for environmentalists, Clancy showed the world that he has no clue on what rich and educated folks would do when they have committed a crime. The ending of this book is just unbelievably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Clancy trademark book: long, poorly written, boring.","review":"It is amazing how Clancy continues to get by on the reputation of \\"Hunt for Red October\\", (his only really \\"good\\" book.) Rainbox Six is just another inarticulate, long, snooze. For techno-thrillers, try the works of Stephen Hunter (Point of Impact) For good spy, political thrillers: try Charles McCarry (Shelly's Heart) Believe me if you read these authors, you will never again waste your time on another Clancy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy's newest book is a boring mishmash...","review":"Rainbow Six started off with a good premise. About one third of the way through the whole idea became absurd. I felt like tossing it but stuck with it hoping the plots would come together but it never happened. I am usually sorry to see Clancy's novels end. When I finished this Rainbow Six I sighed with relief and wondered why I had finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbow six","review":"I am a Clancy fan.

The story concept is interesting, but horrendously and repetitively told--editors must be in short supply these days. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorification of Government Illegal Activity","review":"This book is not up to the standards of previous Tom Clancy novels. The technical research is not nearly up to the standard of Hunt for Red October and his other novels. In addition there are several references that suggest that not only is gun control good, but illeagal activity by government agencies is necessary and acceptable. The end of the book glorifies a government agency violating the territory of another nation, and murdering United States citizens. Considering what our government has done on its own the past few years I do not enjoy reading books that claim the end justifies the means. I had come to expect more from Clancy's books, but do not intend to waste my money on another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Tom, you're boring us","review":"I can take a lot of faults in Clancy _ wooden dialogue, stick-figure heroes like Jack Ryan _ even when I can't tolerate his politics (Has there ever been a drunk, a racist or a psycopath in the U.S. military?) But this one's too much. complete with Rush Limbaugh fantasy villains _ murderous environmentalists. Worse, IT'S BORING. The only reason I've read Clancy is for a quick, interesting read and a little information. But this kept putting me to sleep. Keep trying, Tom, you hit on a few _ you even made John Clark into a real person once. In this one, he's as simple-minded as Jack Ryan and he only puts in a cameo appearance anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go re-read an older Clancy novel...","review":"I'd recommend this book to a recycling center, but I'd probably have to pay them to take it. The whole plotline of this book is based on a terrorist act using the public outdoor cooling system for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Did anyone forget that the summer games in 2000 are going to be held in WHAT IS WINTER FOR THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE? There goes the whole plot, eh? The characters are bland and all use the same fake Clancy LA slang \\"y'know\\" that is then passed off, in a sweet racist tone, as 'the pre-educated language of'. This is a novel that, in my not-so-humble opinion, got rejected before Clancy was big and has been repackaged with the characters we are familiar with (J. Ryan, Clark, etc...) and is being passed off as 'new'. Do yourself a big favor if you want to stay a Clancy fan: Don't read this pile of refuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single dimensioned, naiive, typographically flawed.","review":"I've read nearly every Clancy novel. Over the years I've detected a gradual diminishment in the quality of plot, character depth, subplot integration, and richness in wording when comparing his first series of works to this. It's quite possible to skip entire sections in the book-and I did through sheer boredom-yet stay connected with the main plot. I'm disappointed with how unidimensional the novel is with its sophomoric approach to both \\"global/environmental\\" terrorism and special operations units and tactics. A 300 page novel crammed into 700 pages. Too bad, Tom, you could have done much better....you did before."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair read. Technically sloppy. Not up to Clancy form.","review":"Has the timing of the \\"Summer\\" Olympics moved to January? Only that way could the outdoor temperatures in SE Australia be in the 90s.It read like several separate novellas, strung together. Poor continuity. Many technical (and typo) errors, some glaring (e.g., forgetting season reversal for the southern hemishere).Clancy peaked with Red Storm Rising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy is at his best","review":"The new book by Tom Clancy certainly views the world issues in an intense, excelently documented view of life-changing scenarios. Buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENNED???!!!!","review":"As an amateur novelist, I look to seasoned writers as examples for my own aspiring work. However, it seems that many of the writers I have come to admire, have fallen short of their former expertise. ROBERT LUDLUM is one example. In this instance, it is Tom Clancy. What in the world was he thinking about when he wrote this book? Another payday from the studios? While the story itself could have been interesting, it was crippled by shallow characters, villainous conspiracies that lacked believability, and Tom Clancy's enduring curse, TOO MANY SUBPLOTS. Why is Tom Clancy so hell-bent on writing long drawn out stories? I think he should go back to some of his earlier works. Tom Clancy needs to go home, and find his origins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Book but a Script for Games","review":"While reading the book I noticed technical errors, unlike Red October.

A good author prints a couple of really good books and for whatever reason ends up regurgitating poor books with little plot but guaranteed to generate revenue at a phenomenal rate. This book had very little of substance in it. The plot was weak and predictable and the writing marginal. With this book I will have to add Tom Clancy to the list which includes Steven King and John Grisham of authors that generated a few great books and now can't seem to write anything worth reading.Truly a shame"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Ridiculously Long! (and heavy)","review":"I have been a Tom Clancy fan for a long time, ever since the release of \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" which was by far the all-time best of Tom Clancy (as well as the movie! ) I was sadly disappointed in Rainbow Six for more reasons than I can list here. The book is entirely too long for such a limited storyline. The details strayed far from the well researched \\"techno-babble\\" that I'm used to from Mr. Clancy; who cares about every little movement the character makes, or breathes or sighs? Well I don't, it gets VERY boring. I read the hardcover...and it was hard! Hard to hold...darn heavy and I'm no weakling it's just bulky, but it's great for the collection and in the event I need a large prop. I have a feeling this book was written to compliment the computer game... not the other way around. Come on Tom, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real deal","review":"For all those reviewers who say this book gives a good idea what it's like to be a special operations soldier-- wrong! I spent twenty years in spec-ops and these charicatures are a disgrace to the men I served with. Clancy is an ex-insurance salesman who has no clue either a) what it's like to serve and b) what combat is like. Having said that, I accept this is fiction and needs to be looked at in that like. As far as that goes, how about bad guys who aren't stupid and good guys who believe in the American way-- such as posse comitatus, trial by jury, etc.? If I wanted to go live in a police state there are plenty of countries I could move to. You want real? Try Andy McNabb's SAS books, or James Webb's Fields of Fire, or Stephen Coonts for air combat or Bob Mayer's special forces books. All those others walked the walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, predictable, turgid. Wait a week for bargain book","review":"Tom Clancy is not known for his ability to write prose but at least he usually writes an engaging techno thriller.(Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising). This time his characters aren't substantial enough to qualify as cardboard. The plot is not so original or well written to even be a cliche and is about as exciting as a glass of cold spit. Half-way through the book you may start hoping the terrorists win. A world-wide plague couldn't possibly be more miserable than trying to finish this book If you are a die-hard Clancy Fan and MUST have anything he has written, at least wait a week for it to show up on the bargain table. Better, wait for the paper-back and buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Tom Clancy's getting lazy in his success.","review":"Yuck. Double yuck. And a big yawn. Biggest problems were: (a) too long by at least 40%; (b) characters didn't keep you engaged, except perhaps for Popov; (c) Tom's political views were way too evident; (d) did I say it was too long? Found myself skimming the last half. Much of it seems to be meaningless filler - like he had a page count he was shooting for, and that's further reflected in how incredibly fast the ending was wrapped up; (e) good guys are perfect, bad guys are idiots, how's that for a recipe for boredom. Basically, just an overall bad book. Doubly tragic because he _can_ be a very good writer when he wants to be. Do yourself the favor - go reread Hunt for Red October before picking this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom, stick to what you know.","review":"I have had been a real fan of Tom Clancy until I read this book years ago. First problem with this book as that whole paragraphs are repeated throughout the book. Tom seemed to be adding his own padding to make it a \\"Clancy\\" length book. but by far in the most way I find this book awful is his view of the Irish and the Irish troubles. \\"They are basically English anyway\\" is his view of Ireland. Tom in a world of slack jawed yokels militias all over the USA, maybe you should write about them as you seem to have digressed to this level over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy wrote this?","review":"By far one of Clancy's worst novels. Is it me or has Clancy fallen into a formulaic style now? It's not even the formula of the book that is disheartening -- it's the grammatical, spelling, and general mistakes that makes this book bad. My general feeling was that this book was rushed to the press and not enough edits were done to it.Aside for the glowing errors in the book, the book is too fluffy. The ending is too neat. And there is just too much \\"stuff\\" added in the book to make it longer. The \\"bad guys\\" in the book are way too crazy and the \\"good guys\\" are way too good.Stock characters, stock story, and bad writing. Shame on you Tom.I hope Clancy's next book is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time!","review":"The last time I will pre-order a release.

Now, Tom's been heading downhill since Clear and Present Danger, but this is by far his worst work and perhaps the worst novel I have ever read. The plot is thin and repititive. The supposed \\"climax\\" of the book seems almost an afterthought. The dialogue is pathetic and the characters fill typical racial and ethnic stereotypes. Just try saying a few lines of dialogue out loud and you'll realize how silly you sound. No one talks like this. Ever since Debt of Honor, Clancy's right-wing political views have kidnapped his writing (with the exception of Without Remorse). In fact, I was very much looking forward to the next novel featuring John Clark -- Clancy did an admirable job in developing Jack Ryan's alter ego in Without Remorse. But Rainbox Six was sadly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"A masterpiece! Clancy again proves that he is the master of the political/military thriller. Like the Rainbow teams he created, no one does it better! Truly scary, too real, too believable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"typical clancy","review":"I liked the book. It was long with only a few breaks in the action. This was my 1st read in the ongoing saga. Not the way to read Clancy but I saw Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and Clear and Present Danger as movies so I knew the storyline. Clark and Chavez have come a long way. Action in this one starts with the initial plane trip to England. If you like stories of Super elite teams of good guys beating the daylights out of terrorists, this ones for you. Alot of interesting stuff and some good action."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm depressed they chopped down a tree to make this book.","review":"I have a library of Clancy books. I delight at each new one. The book is not a worthy read for his fans. It is time he changed his pattern. Like Ludlum, Grisham, and Sanders, Clancy needs to change his protagonists and his research. If not, his loyal readers won't keep reading his books. I never thought I'd say this, but it's true. I enjoyed the book very little, but the best book I read this summer is your new posting of Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture, where secret government technology, murder, torture, and plot intrigue rule supreme. Reminded me of Red Storm Rising and Search For Red October by Clancy in his finest form. I do not recommend this book to every Clancy fan. Tried to read it 3 times, no luck. Sorry Tom, you missed the mark by a mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is the Coolest","review":"Anyone who thinks Rainbow six is a bad book, they can go to hell! Rainbow Six is a book that keeps you reading, reading, reading, did I mention it keeps you reading. \\"Why does it keep you reading\\", you ask. Because it has a good storyline, good solid characters and is also pretty acurate. I strongly suggest you read it, even though it is about 750 pages. *Solid Snake over and out*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Clancy only getting stale and sloppy","review":"What was once fresh and interesting about Clancy (red October/sum of all fears) has become stale and hackneyed. There were so many typos and repetitive passages, I am left with the sense that he bypassed the editing stage due to a tight deadline. The technological insights I enjoyed in the past were exaggerated in this tome with out the benefit of a trully riviting storyline to balance it. Lastly, his descriptive treatment of women leads me to conclude that he's been frustrated in his attempts at relationships with them. This book has convinced a longtime Clancy fan (I've read'em all) to seek out greener pastures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Clancy I know...","review":"What happened w/ R6??? What a bummer...I bought the book the day it was released and frankly had a tough time finishing it. I'm a Huge Clancy fan but am really disappointed with this one...a couple of things irked me, one was the repetition of descriptive words (can someone say...\\"niggardly\\"). And the plot had a Huge hole...without spoiling it...Why, if you spend billions on your \\"plan\\", would you send ONE guy to carry it out (to the olympics)...where's the backup...STUPID, STUPID.

I agree with the reviewer who was chagrined that a single tree was cut down to publish this thing. I also agree with the reviewer who recommended Bob Mayer's special forces books.

At first it held some promise but lacking the necessary research and understanding of even the basics like; what a vegan is or what a vegan eats among hundreds of other improbable components made it impossible to reach any rational ending. The length was partially a result of poor writing, poor continuity and redundancy. Characters deteriorated in believable personality and events had obvious plausable alternatives that made the course taken by the plot naive. Terrible wasted effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is just way super awesome","review":"Ok, I'm just reading this book and it's just awesome. Actually I had to make an essay in school about a book I had read then. So I took the rainbow six and was looking for some stuff about it. Then I got so excited about it, that I bought it and now I'm reading it. It's just action, action, action...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, different direction. Couldn't put it down.","review":"I was hoping for a follow-up to Executive Order, which left us hanging, wondering about the future of the US government. What Clancy gave us was a change of direction. Rather than terrorists after the US, they are after the world as we know it. The ultimate of idealistic cleansing.While the characters were familiar and the book was thoroughly enjoyable, I hope Clancy takes a step back and fills in the gap between Executive Order and Rainbow Six."},{"rating":"1","title":"the WORST Tom Clancy to date","review":"Tom's finally hit bottom...all those million dollar advances have made him soft.

The shear weight of this monstrosity falliing on my face as I fell to sleep reading it may have caused permanent damage. But every night I plodded on, waiting for the big event. It came with only 40 of the 740 pages to go and I thought the most interesting plot aspect was an opportunity missed. I'm glad I read it. I think it has ruined the movie for me though.

The moment one major event occured, another was automatically brewing. The story's characters were realistic and the plot was, unfortunately, believable.

This book had a huge flaw than unbelievably got past all of the editors. Without giving too much away, the bad guys decide to release a deadly biological agent during the Summer Olympics in Sydney by releasing it in a special cooling system designed for the very hot weather in September. How could that moron not know that September is WINTER in Austrailia? It's COLD then. Super-brains that want to take over the world usually don't miss details like that. To slog through hundreds of pages to come to that glaring error was irritating to say the least. Clancy should retire before he embarrases himself any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor effort by Clancy-- recommend others.","review":"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything. Stephen Coonts is a former combat pilot who knows whereof he writes. Bob Mayer, whether writing under his own name or the pen names Joe Dalton and Bob McGuire, is a former Green Beret who has a bunch of very good books out there begging to be read.

But not like The Hunt for Red October","review":"Clancy has pulled off another great book. But not as good as Patriot Games or The Hunt for Red October. This is because usually an author can only make only one or two exceptional books. There are exceptions and to date Clancy is not one of them.

Old Tom should read other works like Lady President, Blind Mans Bluff or Fortunes or War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Clancy Work Yet!","review":"This book should not be read unless you have read ALL of the others first(not includining OP CENTER). Failure to take this advise will cause you to miss out on some truly fantastic writing. This book should only be used for kindling to start a fire, it is truly horrible! The story line begins slow, as with most Tom Clancy. The characters are well known to those who have read the other books, so interest is kept in this regard. The story never gains momentum to keep the reader interested, it is truly an effort to finish. In my humble opinion the climax of the story is about 2/3 of the way into the book. The ending is totally unexciting. Where is Jack Ryan?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent story, but far from Clancy's best effort","review":"While John Clark and Ding Chavez are two of my favorite charactors in the Clancy stable, the story of Rainbow Six was among the slowest, most laborious books I have ever read. I have read all of Clancy's novels (including the Ops Center series) and concluded that this story was more a rip off of the Ebola-scare plot in Executive Orders than the fresh storyline each of his other novels have been. Even the sequel nature of Debt of Honor/Executive Orders was fresher and more interesting than Rainbow Six. I have normally finished each of his other novels in one or two weeks because the stories grab you and you can't put the book down. I took me months to finish this one. The only reason I did finish the book was out of loyalty to Clancy.I will buy and read his next one, but I hope it's much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Tom Clancy?","review":"I've read six or seven Tom Clancy novels, and this was by far the worst of the lot. I could barely finish it, and when I had, I donated my copy of the book to my local library. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" was great - moderately plausible plot, interesting characters, shades between good and evil, enough technical detail to keep one's interest. This book had a totally implausible plot, a collection of cardboard characters (GOOD/BAD), an absurd ending filled with shooting fish in a barrel... It is hard to imagine that this would have been published if it had been written by an unknown author. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is inane --almost funny! - Clancy'e worst novel.","review":"I've read all of Tom Clancy's novels and have enjoyed most of them.

The only reason I gave it two stars is because it gave me something to do on two plane rides. I was initially excited because it was focused on Clark and Ding (Without Remorse was one of my favorite Clancy's Books). I agree whole heartedly with some of the other reviewers, the plot development and resolution left me wondering if Clancy actually wrote this one. Definitely not one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Tom Clancy really write this?","review":"I don't believe Tom Clancy wrote this. I've read two of his books, and each page of each one taught me something. The only factoid that I learned in this book was that people with licenses to carry guns on airplanes have to meet each other and the pilot before getting on board. Tom probably gave that factoid to his ghostwriter on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the last Clancy book I'll ever buy.","review":"Clancy has hit a new low. I would have given this book no stars if I was allowed to. Good seemed to overcome evil all to easily in this weak plot. The book became boring at about the second sentence.

I can barely close it and go to sleep! I am, however, very surprised by the amount of errors in it. What gives with the editor? The story is still great, so far. Clancy has not lost his touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Clancy has moved from an adventure novelist to a right-wing loonie standing on soapbox spouting his views. His book lampoons the Constitution, the environmental movement, individual rights, the press, non-smokers and gun laws. In between shot outs, he tries to rewrite history and show off his \\"technical knowledge\\". I wish he would have left his political agenda at home and gotten an editor, who would have trimmed the book by a couple hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonder what happened to Clancy","review":"It seems Clancy is getting into his slump period, unless this book is written by his ghost writters. Clancy has written theose wonderful stories in his earlier books like \\"red storm rising\\", \\"cardinal of ....\\" and etc... This \\"Rainbow 6\\" makes Clancy fan ,like myself, wonder if this is the time to wander away from his new writings.This book is like a Elton John's \\"Blue Moves\\" album.Ater those series of shining brilliant works, this book was giving signals that the talent of the writter is finally start showing the sign of waning. My hunger and thirst to Clancuy's new books is drying up as well. Unlike before, unfortunatly, the time has come that grabing his new books without consideration could be a total dissapointment. I hope this is just a temporaly set back, and expect his come back with books with edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy Displays His Arrogance","review":"If Clancy had cut about 300 pages of repetitious internal monologues it might have been at least readable. He didn't. Clancy thinks quantity makes a good book. He proves that wrong. The plot was unbeliveable. The characters flat and poorly motivated. Clancy is obviously not a student of human nature--not even to the extent of creating believable villans. The premises in the book are completely implausible. Thousands of people banding together to kill off humankind--with almost perfect security? Right. He doesn't even bother to check the tempertures in Sidney in July. It's winter there, John. It's cold. It's not 97 degrees F. He proves that all it takes is a big name to sell a book. I'll never buy another one of Clancy's peices of trash. I've been burned once. I won't be a fool and be burned again."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute disappointment","review":"First let me tell you that I've always been a Clancy fan and have read most of his books. From \\"Red Dawn\\" to \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" I always enjoyed his attention to technical detail.I'm sorry to say that this book has none of that. It's as if a different person wrote it. The characters are shallow, boring and not very believable. The story line is almost a repetition of his prior work. I found myself skipping through pages in order to make it to the excruciating end.This is the last Clancy book I'll read. I consider my money wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy, dull and all that","review":"I'm a fan of Clancy's early efforts but stopped reading after the Debt of Honor fiasco. I sympathize with the author in that the end of the cold war has led to a dearth of good material. However, Clancy doesn't need my sympathy in that plenty of people who read Red October and loved it, keep buying these stupid books (like me). Put it this way, when you start to suspect that this is going to be the worst novel you have ever read, stop reading. You'll be doing yourself a favor because I can promise you that your suspicions are correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLANCY IS THE KING!","review":"This book was outstanding! I loved every single page of this incredible story. I read this book the summer it came out during that time the embassies in Africa were bombed, Rainbow was looking very good about then. This book has one of the best storylines i have ever seen! It makes you think if we really have a group like this out there i think it would be a good idea. They aree probably operating right now......and we would never know. If one of them is reading this keep up the good work....."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Doe","review":"Unfortunately I am one of those people who crave the release of a new Tom Clancy novel, however, being so few and far between, I have found myself passing time reading non-fiction books and research on specialized warfare. It becomes painfully obvious within the first few chapters of this book that Tom didn't do his research. He may have gotten a little information, but he most certainly made most of it up.Being well versed, myself, in the tactics, weaponry, and explosives used by spec-warriors, his accounts lacked realism. His depiction of British SAS standards, German GSG-9, and some US forces just weren't true to the levels that these individuals truly prepare for.I must admit I tended to enjoy the tedious technicalities in Clancy's novels, but in this one, the technicalities are WRONG, and I found myself agitated when reading them.If you enjoy quite a few action scenes with predicatble outcomes, this one's for you, but if you know anything about specwar, stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been good at 500 pages.","review":"I had only read one other book by Clancy (SSN), when I decided to pick this one up. I expected something action-packed, but what action there was, was dull and repetitive. It's the same \\"aamericans are better than everyone else in the world\\" plot, and it seemed that the terrorists never really stood a chance during any of their missions. This book also should be clipped down to about 500 pages, and it probably would be much more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good action scenes","review":"This is my second Clancy book I have read, and yet again I find myself wanting to read more of him. Being the teenager that I am, this book taught me a lot of useless information, which is always good to know. I have not yet fininshed the book ( I am on 720 give or take) but I find this book very interesting and entertaining. These 50 page action scenes keep you hooked on the book, and the plot all finally started to fit together around page 500. I want to read more clancy because of this book, but I cannot for I must get to that stupid summer reading list...The Count of Monte Cristo...ehhhhh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the editor?","review":"I was looking forward to reading another book focusing on John Clark after enjoying \\"Debt of Honor,\\" but this one is very disappointing. Usually it takes a hundred pages for me to \\"get into\\" a Clancy novel. This book starts out OK, but gets more and more boring as the lengthy pages progress. What I really wished for was a decent editing job that would have cut the pages in half, focused the plot, and cut out the unnecessary diatribes against the environmental movement, entertainment industry (Disney), and so forth. I wondered what Newt was doing these days - he was secretly collaborating with Clancy on this book! On the plus side, Clancy has put more focus on the characters; however, it will be a long time before characterization alone can carry his books. If you really need to read every Clancy novel, at least wait for the paperback or, better yet, an abridged audiotape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad-- read something else","review":"This book is simply bad. Apparently Mr. Clancy feels he had it made and doesn't have to really put much effort into plot, characters or setting. I took the advice of earlier reviewers and read THE OMEGA MISSILE by Joe Dalton. A very good thriller. You also might want to check out Bob Mayer's special forces series of books, like DRAGON SIM-13 or CUT OUT. At least Mayer wore the green beret and knows what he's talking about. And his books are damn good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who kidnapped Clancy and what's the ransom??","review":"Really disappointed in this book. Love the characters Clark and Chavez but this story was packaged and tied with a bow. I figure they could do it in a two night mini-series on NBC. Loved the gadgets but don't any of the bad guy have access to these?? How come Clancy never mentions Jack Ryan and always refers to him as the president? Is he trying to distance Clark from that series and if so why does he mention all the other peripheral characters like Murray, Mary Pat and Ed Foley etc?? I think he needs a good editor to give him some feedback unless he reads these critiques. And while I'm at it did anyone else notice that he repeated himself so many times with phrases and comparisons. I thought I was reading the same pages over again sometimes. Pleeeaaassee!! Cut some of fat next time and give us a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy has lost his touch","review":"This is a real third rate book - implausible plot, improbably perfect good guys, and unbelievably evil bad guys. The political intrigue, careful attention to technical details, and suspenseful plots of some of Clancy's earlier books don't appear in this volume. Suspense in the story is soon quashed because the good guys are absolutely perfect and flawless - nothing they attempt ever fails in any respect. Have a serious hostage situations? No problem - sneak in, shoot all the bad guys, save all the hostages - repeat, rinse. There is no attempt to keep the bad guys in character. Need to kill off a mild mannered laboratory researcher in order to tie up some lose ends in your store? - its easy, just have him grab a rifle and charge out to shoot at the good guys. I think I've read my last Clancy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Clancy, same style and plot? But a good read.","review":"I have a library of Clancy books. I delight at each new one. The book is a worthy read for his fans, but it is time he changed his pattern. Like Ludlum, Grisham, and Sanders, Clancy needs to change his portagonists and his research. If not, his loyal readers won't keep reading his books. I never thought I'd say this, but it's true. I enjoyed the book, but it was a hard read. Not fun. The best book I read this summer is your new posting of Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture, where secret government technology, murder, torture, and plot intrigue rule supreme. Reminded me of Red Storm Rising and Search For Red October by Clancy in his finest form. I recommend this book to every Clancy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to TC????","review":"After Executive Orders I told myself that I would give him one more chance. He had his chance with R6 and blew it. Boring characters, bad dialog, implausible plot, questionable political (and moral) ideologies.... R6 has it all! Hopefully he'll reread Hunt for Red October and re-realize what it takes to make a good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real disappointment","review":"This book is a let-down. I have followed Jack Ryan's life through many of Clancy's books and this latest pales in comparison. It left many questions such as: 1) Why was it necessary for the villians to research into Clark - contributing to the exposure of the Russian agent? 2) Why was it necessary to keep the agent alive if the objective is near? 3) Why the need to use the method of delivery? Why was there only one delivery? Why wait until the end of the event? All said, the villians are made to be unrealistically stupid. And the ending is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT Read!","review":"I just finished reading Rainbow Six by John Clancy. It is a GREAT read! I could barely put it down. It had action from the very first page to the epilogue.Clancy did a wonderful job of developing the characters and bringing characters from the past back in this novel. You got to see John Clark become a granfather and Ding Chaves become a father.I would highly recommend this book to everyone who likes the techno/political/thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is an excellent complement to the game!","review":"After having the game and playing it for a few months, the book Rainbow Six came out and I grabbed it right away. The book adds a new dimension to the game and it was nice to be able to read a story instead of play the game all the time. Playing the game actually makes the book a whole lot better because you are put into scenarios that are very much like the ones in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Long...","review":"Exciting story, packed with slanders to Discovery Channel buffs. I only found this one offensive: he used twice as much \\"tree\\" as he needed to with this adventure. Clancy takes much, much too long to develop his plot. Read this book only if you have an unhealthy amount of spare time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little exciting but very far fetched","review":"Rainbow Six is a somewhat nice book but falls in a lot of nonsense and political babbling. Clancy centers more in the paranoid extreme political views of heroes and antiheroes characters using sci fi tech rather than giving attention to the special operations area. He centers very much in Clark but leaves outside other potentially interesting characters. There is also a lack of a well defined, really exciting climax point in the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Clark meets \\"Op Center\\", or \\"Sophomoric Power Politics\\"","review":"Tom Clancy has built a reputation for impeccable research and gripping plot lines. \\"Rainbow Six\\" fails in both regards. While I consider \\"Hunt for Red October\\" to be the archetypal \\"technothriller\\", \\"Rainbow Six\\" reads like one of his mass-produced \\"Op Center\\" books with a couple of familiar characters. Mr. Clancy has trouble differentiating between the strategic, operational and the tactical levels of warfare -- and although the basic plot lines of \\"Rainbow Six\\" are astute (growing threat of terrorism; danger of biowar; ascension of the multinational corporation as a mechanism of political power), he drops the ball by giving us shallow characters with only a thin veneer of credibility. I think Mr. Clancy does his reputation a grave injustice by pawning this dime store piece of pulp fiction in the guise of his far-better written Jack Ryan sagas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing. Looks like a rush job.","review":"Maybe it's time for the dean of technothrillers to retire and let someone take his place. If this was a first novel by an unknown writer it wouldn't have been published. An outlandish plot, a political agenda by the author, distasteful characters-- what more can I say? I recommend getting Coonts latest book, FINAL FLIGHT or one of Bob Mayer's Special Forces books: CUT OUT, ETERNITY BASE, DRAGON SIM-13."},{"rating":"1","title":"A script for a \\"B\\" movie","review":"Clancy's first 3 or 4 offerings were thrillers. His latest is a predictable, flight of ideas, stream of consciousness. He has run out of technobabble with which to wow his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with Tom Clancy's latest John Clark novel. The plot was somewhat predictable, devoid of most of the technological wizardry present in his other books, and simply just not that exciting.I hate giving away the ending of the book, so don't read further if you don't want to know how it ends. This is, however, crucial to my review.How can we like a book where all of the good guys win all of the time? In previous books, unexpected villians have committed unspeakable acts of war, terrorism, and crime. In Rainbow Six, the \\"unspeakable act\\" never gets off the ground.Those of us who find Clancy's novels to be a guilty pleasure won't stop reading his books because of Rainbow Six. However, I for one am anxiously awaiting the next Jack Ryan novel, hoping for a return to the qualities that have been here to fore a consistant hallmark of his craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking your audience for granted.","review":"While I don't expect literary perfection in a tecno/spy/military thiller, Clancy's work in \\"Rainbow Six\\" is poor enough to insult the itelligence of even his most die hard fans. While the over the top portrayals of the environmentalist-wackos were entertaining, they were overshadowed by the weak develpment of a shallow and repetitive plot. The poor quality of the book's editing make it clear that this book was rushed to market to satisfy the expected ( and,no doubt, realized ) demand. It appears,( to use a metaphor that is repeated three times in the first half of the book ) that Clancy gave no more thought to the crafting of this book than to \\"zipping his fly\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"As a novel, this book is poorly written. As a Tom Clancy book, this is criminal negligence. It seems like whole sections of irrelevant material are stuck in just to make the book longer. This book bears no resemblance to any previous Tom Clancy novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I read this book a couple of days ago (after I could get it off my sister) and it only took me about two days to read because I could not put it down. It is probably one of the best books Tom Clancy has ever written. And that's saying something, because Clancy has written a heap of excellent books."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO JACK RYAN, BUT STILL A GREAT READ!","review":"Tom Clancy once again shows he's the \\"master' of adventure thrillers. This is scary stuff, luckily \\"Rainbow Six\\" is up to the task. May be not quite as good as Clancy's \\"Jack Ryan\\" books, but Mr. Clark and Mr. Chavez handle the situation, barely in the nick of time. A fine novel with a fitting ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranibow Six Review","review":"My opinion of the book is that is was a great one. All of the characters in the book are the best the world has to offer. This includes the best troops from the US Navy SEALs, US Army Rangers, US Delta Force, The highly trained British SAS, French Special Forces, US Special Ops. Aviation Unit, and the German GSG-9. This book also brings the return of two of my favorite Clancy characters, Domingo Chavez and John Kelley a.k.a. John Clark. The book also brought in the newest arsenal of counter-terrorist weaponry and technology. I could hear the gun shots from the H&K MP-10's. The new 10mm version of the MP-5. By far I think this is the best Clancy novel and suggest you read it. I loved this book so much I even purchased the game, and hopefully there is a movie in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A greatly detailed and realistic book","review":"Tom Clancy gives so much detail in the story that you almost believe you are there. You can practically hear the gunshots, the orders, the helicopter overhead, etc. Tom Clancy puts you there and allows you to almost perfectly understand the life of a secret anti-terrorist group and the life of terrorists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, Pat, and Kinda Dull","review":"This was not very good Clancy. For one thing, everything worked just too well. The action scenes and the way the good guys always won were too pat. I didn't think he did anything particular with the characters. Of course, as a long-time Clancy reader, I have a pretty good idea of Clark and Chavez. They weren't very interesting in this one. I read a library copy. I don't think I'll bother with buying a copy of my own, even in a couple of years at the used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Here are some lyrics from a Randy Newman song that probably wasn't about this book (but they sure do fit!)I have nothing left to say But I'm gonna say it anyway I have a family to support But surely, that is no excuse I've nothing further to report Time you spend with me Is time you lose Why do I go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy's Best Ever","review":"Rainbow Six is a very important novel. Although it is fictional, it tackles a very important issue, terrorism. The book was suspensful, action packed, and had many very good characters. It was hard for me to put down. An outstanding book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is about a C.I.A. counter terrorism team","review":"I think RAINBOW SIX was a wonderful book.I realy think that the weapons they used were the best for the job,Hekler&Koch MP10 10m.m..I realy liked the situations also,like \\"WORLDPARK\\",or C.I.A. v.s. the I.R.A. .It realy was a great book,although a few rather repulsive parts which didn't realy mess with the story that much.I think everyone should read this book to learn how the government works these days,and how hard these situations can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy has done it again!","review":"Again Clancy amazed me also with his Net Force series. Rainbow 6 in my opinion is his best book yet! His writing makes you feel like you are there in this EXCITING Action/Adventure"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands off!!","review":"Don\`t read this book, it isn\`t worth the time and money! No real characters in this book, just killing machines on both sides of the law trying to look at least a little human, but failing. Lots of stereotype impressions. The only good thing is the tension during the counter-terrorist attacks but everything is over soon and you have to wait for the next terrorist happening because the story between the action is so boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"This was my first Clancy book, and it is now one of my favorite books. Since it was my first, that may be why I liked it better than some of the other people who reviewed (I may not know what to compare it with), but I thought it was good. Since Rainbow Six, I have begun to read The Hunt for Red October, and, frankly, I like Rainbow Six more. In my opinion, it had the right amount of action but was able to stay intelligent. As I said, I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best-selling Rainbow Six is formulaic and wooden","review":"A re-reading of Tom Clancy's initially disappointing \\"Rainbow Six\\" would suggest that the best-selling author needs to take a sabbatical. The plot, to use the term loosely, is reminiscent of a series of scripts for a television series. The book is formulaic and, much as it pains a Clancy fan who has read all his previous work, having purchased them in hardback, the characters are wooden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Global Crisis Book Enthralls Reader","review":"The prelude starts the book rocketing off with a nice dose of action, with a plane being hijacked. The book then slows down for the next 50 pages or so, but then goes right back up to lightspeed pace with at least 3, I think, different terrorist situations! Afterwards, the book slows down and then, like a fuse to a bomb, sets it off and the plot ends with a satisfying BANG! The length of the book seems long when you start, but begins to seem reasonable as you see the real depth to this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Books Plods thru'....","review":"Take the usual Clancy team, add a few terrorists, viruses, egomaniacs and a splash of KGB - shake hard. - Garnish with a stick of global techno globedegock - and viola - you have Rainbow Six !!The book lacks the punch and the grip that one is used to from a Clancy thriller. The plot has promise but the deliverable is not upto the mark. Pages can be skipped without missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should really only get half a star.","review":"Repitious, boring, techno-babble that makes you want to skip pages. If I read the word \\"double-tap\\" (Dings' favorite word) I thought I might puke. Plot was too anticipated. It always seemed that I knew what was going to happen a chapter before it actually did. And by the way Tom, since your Rainbow Six warriors had had four or five missions in row, in a three month period, don't you think they'd be a little suspicious about the Olympics? I could think of a better way to release an airborne contagion than that. Australia is a little too isolated from the rest of the world to let loose a plague that is going to wipe out humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Clancy I knew & loved","review":"Rainbow Six is a long, drawn out, way too wordy, lousy clancy book. The plot is intriguing, but the book could have been written within 200 pages instead of 700+ pages. I have read all of Clancy's first 8 or so novels, and they were great. Then the next few I read, it seemed as though he had others writing for him, because the style, and especially the content, changed. I would not recommend buying this book. It is not worthy of the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Clancy sold out for a port to a computer game?","review":"It's no surprise that the Rainbow 6 computer game came out around the same time as the book. The book seems to have been written to make a computer game of it really easy, sacrificing a good deal of suspense once you realized his formula. Also, the book was too easy. No surprise that good defeats evil here... pretty boring read. Oh, the editing was lousy too. For all the eco-conscious verbiage in the novel, Clancy could have easily pared 100 pages off the final length w/o the reader noticing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback","review":"Unfortunately, you can't always have a winner. This latest effort by Tom Clancy was a major disappointment. It could pass for a tupical commuter junk book. If this was a movie it would be considered a B-Movie. The plot was just a rehash of his last novel. There was little suspense and you can figure out who the hero was very early on. It was too predictable. Frankly his op-center novels have been better than Rainbow Six"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, not enough characterization and what an agenda","review":"I'm not sure Clancy could go any more right wing than he does in this book. Success seems to have gone to his head and he's slapping his name on anything and everything to get a buck. I won't read any more of his books. Instead I'll support writers who actually served our country and can write fast-paced, well-researched action. I recommend Harold Coyle, Stephen Coonts, Bob Mayer, and Joe Dalton. Take a look at their books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contrived piece of trash...","review":"After reading between the lines of Clancy's last three novels, I expected the plot of the next one to center around a Sino-Russian rumble for Siberia (which would have been great I might add), but instead we were treated to Rainbow Six, an entirely implausible and ridiculous story. I'm no tree-hugger, but this book shows such contempt for environmentalism it'll leave a bad taste in your mouth. Try not to let your hate show so plainly next time, Mr. Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad the Project didn't succeed, sparing others from this","review":"Although not as awful as Executive Orders, Rainbow Six confirms that Clancy's basic formula is worn out. I am left questioning whether or not we need a new cold war to get something tolerable out of this fellow."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least good of Tom Clancy's Books","review":"I have been trying to get through this book with two thoughts in mind - when will it get better and why is he just rehashing the last book. If I had my druthers, I would have just listened to it on cassette. The specifics of the special ops unit has been the only part of the book that has been interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy the gun totin, wanna-be Soldier of Fortune loser","review":"If this book doesn't take you back to GI Action Series comics of the 50s, nothing will. This is about as 2-dimensional and dumb of story as you will find in your airport's bookstore. And that includes the romance novels. Clancy's bad-boys tote the 10mm MP-10, which Clancy seems to have an infatuation with, and \\"double-tap\\" all the bad guys. Even when he kills a little sick child at an amusement park, his macho boys write it off as \\"well, she was gonna die of cancer in a week anyhow.\\" Give it a rest. Do us a favor, make your testosterone overloaded characters do somthing realistic, like turn the guns on each other, and remove the woman-bashing prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Clancy's normal excellence.","review":"The plot was a little too contrived and too far fetched to be belivable. Some of the stuff sounded like it came from a Mac Bolan story. I think Clancy is resting on his laurels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad they didn't sell this by the pound","review":"The story while rather mediocre and most unbelievable could have been told in 200 pages or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly long and disjointed.","review":"This book is typical Clancy; written as if he has been paid by the word. Disjointed, hard to follow plot, brings in names and then changes them in middle of story. It is about a group of men who come together and are involved in a number of various plots. Nothing seems to fit. A real waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate waste of paprer","review":"It is hard to believe that such a gifted writer as Clancy could produce something like this book. Premise is absolutely unbelievable, many of the characters are shallow, political statement is stupid. Unfortunate that paper had to be wasted to produce this book! What is his publisher thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technobabble; little suspense; environmentally ignorant.","review":"I've always enjoyed Clancy, because he usually taught me something in a suspenseful, quick moving story. Yeah, it was apparant his political view wasn't quite mine; but, hey, he often made a good case for the other POV. Until now. Clancy has absolutely no understanding of environmental concerns. Equating them with druads and cultish religious fringes is pure nonsense. Its the author who sounds like a \\"bomb hugging\\" nut. Clancy has lost his credibility, which was barely floating after Executive Orders, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's CTL ALT DEL Book for the recycle bin","review":"Maybe Clancy was trying to raise cash to lay down for a football team, maybe he wants to earn enough money for a Presidential bid someday. Maybe he was writing for Television. Who knows why he wrote and published this work? In the ideal world a Publisher would have done the right thing and trashed this gratuitious quick cash maker. It was predictable. It was boring. It reminded me of a cheap movie. It was nothing like what made him great and his books highly anticipated. I can wait for the next one because even I could have written this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Clancey?","review":"I have read most of what Clancey has written. His first novels were hard to put down. This one is hard to pick up. Degenerating story line and dialog makes me believe Clancey now writes the outline for someones idea for someone to write to be published in his name and meet his deadline and he rides his previous successes all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. You have to be kidding me.","review":"Clancy has officially hit rock bottom. I couldn't believe how ridiculously one-sided this book was. The good guys are perfect, and the bad guys have the emotional intelligence of a six-year-old. I'm hoping that the American military doesn't have the same perception of our enemies as Clancy does.What really bothers me is that even some of the most successful special forces operations in history--especially those which took place in such public settings as what is described in Rainbow Six--had a few things go wrong; hostages were killed and soldiers were injured. Some even completely fell apart. Clancy apparently either didn't do his homework on this or simply chose to disregard it.I was really, REALLY disappointed in this book. I am (or maybe was) a huge Clancy fan, and while the technical details were still there to satisfy a hard-core military techno-geek, the story was somewhat absurd, and the dialogue is bad, even for Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly bad","review":"Formulaic garbage. Major errors in the plot (i.e. Gives one character the knick name Bear and names another Oso (Spanish for bear) who is sometimes called Bear, it's cold in Australia in the summer...DUH). Clancy, who used to be cutting edge, should have retired about three books ago. What an embarrasment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply his worst","review":"Does he ever have his books proofread before they are printed? I've never seen so many spelling mistakes in a book before.To make matters worse, the plot of this book is absolutely ridiculous. Mr. Clancy obviously doesn't have any clue about environmental issues.On top of that Rainbow Six is repetitive and just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regression to the mean","review":"This book lends further credence to Galton's principle of \\"regression to mediocrity.\\" Not only does Mr. Clancy give readers a feeble conclusion to his tangled plot, but he also managed to give the impression that the reader is in a video game, with the end of each chapter leading to a higher level of difficulty for Mr. Clark and his team.I was one of those tricked by the \\"TOM CLANCY\\" on the front cover of this book. If you want to be entertained while getting some insight about the world we live in, get a good history book. That would be a better use of your time and money. To Mr. Clancy, thank you for sharing with us your exceptional stories, but I think your Ryan and Clark franchise has already ran out of steam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, bad tasting...","review":"I am glad that I finished Rainbow Six.The story is simple: An american-british special operations outfit, with two NATO and one Israeli alibi members, \\"zaps\\" incompetent terrorists in European countries. Only with more grueling gore and technical detail than in the statement above.Then there is that Eco-terrorist conspiracy by some gene-splicing geniuses and their likewise ecologically indoctrinated co-believers. Nice idea, bad execution.Previous Clancy books had me hooked as to their outcome and to the twists Clancy could apply to the storyline. This one I was glad I had finished.Even the rants about Eco-activists, vegans and feminists were boring after the first few. It is only symptomatic that female characters on the good side are either physicians/nurses or moms/grandmoms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise, Clancy's Usual Mediocre Writing","review":"Clancy has gotten the best-selling writer thing down to a formula: a taut, suspenseful plot populated by militaristic all-American heroes and the evil-doers de jour. His merit lies in coming up with gripping, if improbable, settings for his stock characters. On the other hand, his actual writing is mediocre, unimaginative, and devoid of art.Rainbow Six is the conservative Clancy's broadside against the environmental movement. The book's basic (and typically unbelievable) premise is that, in order to save the planet, fanatical environmentalists in charge of a major corporation devise a plot to kill off nearly all of mankind, while the brave men of the elite multinational force to which the title refers strive to thwart them. The unbelievable part: environmentalists in charge of a major corporation! Everybody knows that all the big corporations are in the capable hands of patriotic, polluting, profiteering Republicans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Political Rant Done Badly","review":"One of the things that made Clancy's best novels great was the way he kept 20 interlinked stories going at once in descriptive, but not excessive detail that kept your heart racing. He had an amazing ability to protray each group from their viewpoint without judgement, and with some accuracy. He did the best and the worst of society. Apparent his hate of even the mildest of Environmentalists is too great to allow this type of protrayal, or he just didn't have time to do any research on Environmentalist any place other the National Review. His protrayals of the groups involved is shallow and unbelievable, and he has conpensated for only involving a few groups by increasing detail about things he clearly doesn't understand. This book is so bad it goes on the very short list of Books that I can't finish and plan to throw in the garbage to avoid punishing others with its poorly written drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy needs to get his head back down to earth","review":"Tom Clancy has a big ego and is not afraid to let it show. Just look at the back cover. This book is about three hundred pages too long. All the extra material is Clancy demonstrating his knowledge of all things political, historical, and military. There is no character involvement and very little tension. The premise and some of the plot are fascinating and very thought provoking. That is the only thing that kept me reading until the end.Bring back the old Clancy please! Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising are five star books. Everything since then has been on a downhill slide. Read \\"Arc Light\\" by Eric Harry if you want to be reminded of Clancy in his good old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. This book is terrible! Since I read \\"Sum of All Fears\\", I've anxiously awaited each new Clancy book. Not anymore. I've likely read my last Clancy. He should be ashamed of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb plot.","review":"I have eagerly awaited each of Tom Clancy's new books since Red Storm Rising. Each has been worse than the previous. This book has hit rock bottom. This book has a dumb plot and is rounded out by dumb characters. I'm ashamed to say that I wasted around $6 and numerous hours reading this dumb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling commandos- cum- terroists story","review":"This is one of the best friction written by Tom Clancy. Simply exciting for those who love to read how the terroists are being killed by the elite commandos. The story is great, though the ending is a bit disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much to wordy and predictable.","review":"I usually really enjoy Clancy's books. But this one is not one that you will read without putting it down. It took me over a week to read and I had to force myself to finish the book. Really not up to his usual standards. No suspense in the book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable - but great","review":"After reading the prolouge of this book, I just couldn't put it down until I was finished. I've read several other Clancy books, but this one takes the price. Sure, it's a bit predictable, but it's written with the words of someone with real insight in the business, so it's well worth a buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Predictable","review":"Rainbow Six just seemed to lack that element of the unknown that won't allow you to put one of Clancy's books down. It was as easy to predict as a Disney movie. Other than that it was fun, and if you've already mowed the lawn and washed your hair it might be worth a read. Just too predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak.","review":"The poorest of an increasingly weak string of novels from the factory known as Clancy. Suggest he retire. Try others. Like McNabb's SAS series of Mayer's Special Forces series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A darn good yarn about the ultimate eco-terrorism incident","review":"Typical and good Tom Clancy -- good action, fair character development, good plot (though bordering on the unbelieveable). If you know some of the more intransigent people in the ecology and animal rights movements, it is not too much of a stretch to see how someone could contemplate such a wild and crazy scheme. Clancy is erratic -- some good and some bad -- but always compelling. As long as he keeps writing, I'll keep buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks credibility of Clancy's other books.","review":"When I read this book I was very disappointed. It is just about a SWAT team that goes around Europe shooting bad guys. Big deal. Even worse, the plot (which I won't reveal here) isn't as chillingly plausible as those in Clancy's earlier works. It's not believable, it's just dumb. This book falls far below Clancy's usually high standards. It propably makes a better computer game than a book. You'll want to read it if you are a Clancy fan, but if not, read one of his earlier, and much better works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Same Formula","review":"As a reader of all of Clancy's Jack Ryan books, I find Rainbow Six to be the latest in declining quality. The storyline was not creative and seemed to be an extension and rehash of the ebola storyline of the past. The overall research was fair and not up to the high quality of some of the first books, i.e., Hunt For Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin and Without Remorse. Troubling were the seemingly unprofessionalism idiosycncrocies of both the good guys and the bad guy. This book was definitely not up to the standards of Clancy's earlier books. I hope the next is back to his excellent researched and plotted books of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong and unoriginal","review":"Mr. Clancy is getting lazy. This novel comes across as an expensive, overlong, self-indulgent Mack Bolan yarn. The author basically rehashes actual terrorist events, especially the exploits of Carlos the Jackal and the PLO. The German terrorists who conduct the assault in Vienna are virtual carbon copies of actual Red Army Faction members.Another flaw with this story is the near-invincibility of the protaganists. Clancy's commandos are basically bulletproof, which eliminates much of the suspense inherent in such a tale. The only \\"good\\" guys killed during the book are tertiary characters at best. Clancy's vaunted penchant for realism is sorely lacking here. I recommend Clear and Present Danger for a more accurate portrayal of combat.If you're interested in stories such as these, pick up a copy of \\"Blackhawk Down\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I just finished the book and I was disappointed. The realism of the plot, technology and the real-life type characters (that were hallmarks of his earlier books) have given way to story that is dumb. Not only are his books getting really fat --Tom: as a helpful hint, let an editor do some trimming-- but it is now populated by characters who are all super men, super dedicated and fighting to save the world on a just in time basis. While that formula may work for Robert Ludlum, it detracts from the believability that have made the earlier Clancy novels so entertaining, engrossing and keeps you eagerly waiting his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a really miserable book...","review":"I hope till the end that the story would improve in a strange and dramatic way... but it doesn't... this is really a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly predictable","review":"Poorly written and thoroughly predictable. At one point I wondered if this book was not written by TC since the style was miles away from 'Red Storm Rising' and 'The Hunt for ...'. Then I wondered if maybe TC needed money and it was therefore necessary to finish the book in record time. In any case the next book from mr. Clancy that I buy will not be a hard cover, instead I will wait untill the paperback version comes out. In short mr. Clancy has been removed from my 'must read' list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, but not supreme","review":"This Clancy book was a good one, but several have topped it. I sorry to say this, but there are too many grammatical errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs realistic action","review":"The idea is good. Anyone who thinks that this cannot happen has their heads buried in the sand. However, the story itself is weak. The \\"good guys\\" win way too easily. Anyone in REAL spec-ops knows it is never this easy. There is even some hints of plagiarism in this book. Tom, have you been reading Dick Marcinko's Rouge Warrior books? If not, and I think you have, you should, and you will see what REAL spec-ops personnel go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucked.","review":"This book reads just like one of his op-center \\"gee, i need to make an alimony payment, better write something\\" books. It is terrible, with the worst ending he has ever written.

I was actually bored while reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break-- reality check here, folks","review":"I'm tired of people who know nothing of what it means to be in Special Operations writing about it-- and getting it wrong, time and time again. Clancy doesn't have a clue what the true spec-ops guy is and this book is the worst of his stuff yet. Hunt for Red October was good, but this-- the bad guys are such idiots a girl scout troop could take them down. And the good guys aren't. I served in the military because I believed in democracy not to be judge, jury and executioner. Even Dick Marcinko's stuff is better than this. Or check out Andy McNabb's SAS books. Or Bob Mayer's special forces series. Let's get is straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Clancy's standards...the formula is over used..","review":"I have read all of Clancy's novels. I even buy them in Hardback because I can't wait to emerse myself in his world Jack Ryan etc. This anticipation magnified my dissappointment with Rainbow 6. This is a formula book with way too much formula. I found reading this book like jogging, you have to push yourself not to give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, before this is released as a paperback...","review":"...*somebody* needs to edit it for spelling and punctuation. The errors are glaring. It's distracting to read.And here's an idiom that is used too often: \\"for him, killing is as automatic as zipping his fly after taking a leak.\\" Interesting the first time. Do we have to repeat it again and again?I always expect the best from Tom Clancy, and he should hold his editors to the same high standards.I remain an avid Tom Clancy reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"Tom Clancy has gone from bad to worse. Both \\"Executive Orders\\" and \\"Rainbow Six\\" have basically boiled down to Republican manifestos and Clancy's own paranoid delusions. In this book, the Rainbow team is basically invincible and the battle sequences are all the same. The end of the book was too short and was not very satisfying. Clancy's books have become longer but lack the character development and plots of his earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best book I have ever read!","review":"Tom Clancy out did himself this time with this fast paced novel, I couldn't put it down it was so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly predictable and sadly one dimensional","review":"I have been a Clancy fan from the first time I picked up Red October. While his characters have always been two dimensional, the plots and action sequences have kept you glued to the pages and the story lines were never been predictable....until now. R6 bears none of the hallmarks we have come to expect from Mr Clancy. Instead it feely borrows from the plot lines of previous novels while the action sequences stumble along like a drunken sailor on a week long binge. This novel might have done better if his editor had been awake when it crossed his or her desk. We might have been spared the sophomoric moral pontifications and interminable political rant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riverting, fast paced and thoughly enjoyable.","review":"From the moment you read the first page, the text grabs you. I personally felt that the book was excellent. Tom Clancy from the start keeps you interested in the doings of ex-navy SEAL John Clark and son-in-law Ding Chaves. As a new forse in counterterrisiom arrives on the scene headed with Clark as the new director of Rainbow Six. Six is also helped with Chaves as a team leader. Following an excellent plot written by Clancy his new book is a must read for all of those techno-thriller fans out there.Nicholas Jorgensen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Yellow Pages-sized winner from Clancy","review":"I bought my copy of Rainbow Six for someone (a gift) and once they finished it they offered it to me. Reading nearly 800 pages of techno-war-political-thriller has its pros and cons; Clancy's stuff is great, but the story--and I thought it was a good, if not completely plausible one--is spun out over a mass of pages. I recall \\"Without Remorse\\" as less complicated but a lot more entertaining than ...Six. I enjoyed reading it and it's worth reading, but for those who don't want to devote a month or more of reading to one book, go elsewhere. If you, on the other hand, want to achieve the feeling of accomplishment, you'll be proud to complete this novel (and the ending's great, too). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"This book is good because it is something that could happen. John Clark and Ding Chavez return in this story about a multi-national counterterrorist team. Clark, whom you remember from Without Remorse and every Ryan book from The Cardinal of the Kremlin on, is the leader of the team, which is headquartered in Hereford Air Force Base in England. This book is simply excellent. The action sequences where team rainbow takes down the terrorists are great, and the story is good, and makes you wonder what will happen next. The mail problems are the lack of character development and the Australia Olympics scheme. It is cold there in our summer, that is why we had to wait several months, for it to warm up there. Nevertheless, an engrossing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge disappointment","review":"I used to like Tom Clancy's books. But it seems to me, and a lot of other people, that the newer stuff is just crap.Where do I start with this one? The characters were two dimensional, they heroes were more like superheroes that could do nothing wrong. The story if so repetitive it borders on funny. The villian is an oxymoron, he's the president adn CEO of a corporation, yet he's a tree-hugger. And to make it worse, he has an idea for world domination that looks more like something out of a bad James Bond movie. Then to top it off, Clancy obviously didn't do his research when he was writing, because he seems to have forgotten that when it's summer in the US and England, it's winter in Australia.Overall, the book is lacking and seems to be on the collapse of a once good writing career. If you want to read a book written by someone who knows how to write an anti-terrorism unit book and not as long, go get OMEGA FORCE: THE GHOSTS OF WAR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible-My last Clancy book.","review":"When I was a teenager, I burned through all of his early books in a few days, completely absorbed in the exciting military battles and intriguing political maneuvering. But it's clear that starting with this book, Clancy has run out of boogiemen. I'm an environmentalist, and although his topic of environmental terrorism didn't insult me, the bumbling, utopian narrative spewed by the disturbed tree-huggers did make me cringe. I remember turning each page, hoping, begging, to find something interesting to grab onto, but in the end it was a giant letdown. He started to lose it somewhere around Debt of Honor, but this is sure proof that he simply ran out of enemies. How much more Robby Jackson talking jive can you take? Or Ding spewing his East L.A. street-slang? The characters and plots are now cliches. Oh well-it was good while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I bought this book for my brother.

I bought the game (PC Version) first and then read the book. I must say that the game pales to the mastery that Clancy exercises over the written word.In the game, you have a lot of characters who weren't in the book which is sad because I would have loved to see what Covington and Tomlinson were like on the game.The book is top notch in every way. It starts with a hi-jacking that is un-related to the crust of the book and builds from there believe it or not!!!If you had to narrow down this review to one word, it would be WOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"rainbow six","review":"This being the only Tom Clancy novel that i have read, i have to say i was greatly dissappointed. I found Rainbow Six an extremely predictable story of good guys versus bad guys. This book logged in at nearly 900 pages and yet the charactors were all one dimensional, the plot could be seen a mile away, and there were no suprises at all. The women, although educated, were incapable of comprehending the hard realities of the job the men performed - killing terrorist. Huh? The sexist nature of this novel portrayed women as liberal, pouting, drones best left to mothering children than worrying about politics. The vigilanty style justice at the end of this book was pure fantasy.On the positive side about this novel was, although way too long, it was a quick and easy read. The action was fast paced and rarely bogged down too much. My recommendation is that if you like this type of genre, you would be much happier reading anything by Robert Ludlum. His novels are far superior to Tom Clancy's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a chance...","review":"I thought I'd give Clancy a try - after all, so many people read his books on the train that I am taking to work.

The true beauty of this and all of this series of books is that you can actually learn interesting things while escaping the four walls that surround you. The only pity is that Clancy isn't one of a series of clones so that more books can become available faster.

Whether it is because of his interest in writing Rush Limbaughish right-wing drivel, or because he is paid by the weight of his books, he has managed to become a caricature of himself, much like the pose he affects for his picture on the back cover. The characters are unbelievable, the plot is labyrinthine, and the dialogue is sophomoric. Shouldn't there be a lemon law for books so we could get our money back? That's a rhetorical question; I read a library copy, thank goodness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging actions sequences, separated by 50 pages of drivel.","review":"I've run into a first with a Tom Clancy book...usually, I'm interested that I literally hang on to every word, but in this one I've started to skip all the exposition scenes, in which the various eco-villains paraded their villany around in great tedium. Ah, yes, another page and a half of the Science Advisor thinking how much she hates all humanity. And now the researcher. And the hunter. And what feels like every one of the people who are involved in the project. The anti-environmentalist position started grating very early as well.

I found the plot to be extremely predictable, anad at no time was I worried that the bad guys would outsmart the good guys.On the plus side, this novel was easier to get into then the last couple of Clancy's novels.In other Clancy novels, the plot has been strong enough to carry the lack of character development but this one wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book really disappointed me. I've read all of Clancy's stuff except for his last couple and the Op-center series. Since it has been so long since his last one I was hoping this would be gripping. It's not.

It starts out with a bang (literally) in the very first chapter and, with Clancy's usual flair for the inexorable twists and turns of a good plot, kept this reader turning the pages (and ignoring other things that needed to be done).I laughed out loud when reading the guidelines for the review, and #1 was to leave out profanity. If Clancy overdoes anything in this book, its the gutter-talk that permeates every bit of dialogue. Please! Anyone could expect some #@&*#!, but enough is enough!5 Stars, definitely, and I'll be first in line for the next Clancy novel, and won't be disappointed if it's a sequel.And by the way, has it struck anyone that the Sudanese factory bombed 8/20/98 was called \\"SHIVA\\"???"},{"rating":"1","title":"very mixed","review":"Interesting anti-terroist commando missions, and lots of them -- these parts will be read with pleasure, compulsively.But the book is fatally flawed -- bland villians, and a pathetically ludicrous MacGuffin...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Clancy has EVER DONE","review":"Clancy really missed the boat on this one, the plot was foolish, the characters were stereotyped comic book characters, he might as well have been writing a bat man book! I was a HUGE Clancy fan, but this was a book I had to struggle with after 200 hundred pages. It is not the size that is a problem, but the politics and missing story plot. This book offended me pretty harshly, so much so I might not pick up his next offering until I heard a lot of good reviews. I have never agreed with Clancy politically, but now, I think that Clancy is actually MORE conservative then Rush Limbaugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Americans are always brilliant...","review":"I wish Clancy would get off his high horse. Why is Rainbow full of Americans? British snipers have represented their country in the Olympics and won medals yet Clancy reckons they aren't good enough. He rightly points out that the Special Air Service Regiment is the best unit at Anti-terroism yet the force is made up of Americans who have had little experience in actual situations. Not a bad story, I bet the tree huggers have a go at him now. John Clark is the best character he has created, Ryan is such a goody goody. By any chance is Clancy Catholic, like his heroes, and Jesuit trained, like Ryan? Red Storm Rising, Sum of all Fears and Without Remorse are his best to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book.","review":"Tom Clancy should be ashamed of himself. Its' (too few) action scenes are suspenseful. The part of the book, however, that surrounds these minor sub-stories is absolutely lacking in plot, character development or focus.

No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable & disappointing","review":"This reads like a wooden Ops Center book, where we at least expect ghost writers.The characters have no individuality; the dialog looks like it was generated by a \\"Mad Lib\\" process (how many military types from different countries use \\"Fair enough\\" as a standard rejoinder?).The plot is beyond silly: not only do we have 3 basically similar setups to bulk up the book, but we also get the obligatory and pointless attack on Clark's family. The center in Brazil for the bad guys is only created in order to make the closing plot joke possible, and has no other reason to exist.Altogether, this was very disappointing. I've already stopped buying the Ops Center books. If Clancy can't be bothered to do a decent job, he shouldn't keep churning them out - he ought to have enough money by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detail overkill for 700 pgs, then rushed & sparse end.","review":"Clancy's last several books have been interesting reads, but not the well rounded efforts of Red October, Clear & Present Danger, and Without Remorse. When Clancy is on top of his game, you find the exhaustive detail-work of his lengthy set-ups to be fascinating and enhancing. It leads to a climax, a or series of them, that are equally detailed and thorough. When he's not, as in Rainbow Six (and his previous two efforts), the details are just formalities that come as Clancy-style literary baggage.I didn't throw the book down in anger when I finished it. But I was left with the feeling that the author had run out of energy and didn't want to devote the same attention to the books conclusion that he had to the massive text that preceded it, ...

All in All a pretty good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy delivers another great book.","review":"If you want to talk about a page turner, this is it. I would lock my self in my room so I could get through a whole scene. Clancy goes into so much detail about what is going on at that moment. Not so much as to bore you. This is a great book to start out with if you are just starting to read Tom Clancy's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy delivers another action packed thriller...","review":"Rainbow Six has everything one would expect from a Clancy thriller, so for Clancy fans, they shouldn't be disappointed... or should they? Clancy doesn't deviate much from his tried and true formula, so the book DOES prove to be a quick and exciting read. However, it isn't a stellar Clancy novel like Without Remorse or The Cardinal of the Kremlin. It is more along the lines of The Sum of All Fears or Debt of Honor. The premise of the book is fairly weak, but with the state of the world, who's to blame Clancy for choosing environmental terrorists? Clancy's novels have always been like Action movies, you're entertained while you're in it, but afterwords, you're just wondering what to have for dinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"I liked Tom Clancy's early books, _Red Storm Rising_, _Sum of all Fears_, etc. However, I was pretty disappointed with this book. It was interesting in places, but too formulaic. He tends to get lost when not speaking techno-babble - the character development is poor, there isn't alot of tension, etc. And long...way too long. It could use some serious editing. Has anybody else noticed how Clancy has started using the same phrases repeatedly in his books? For example, two or three novels ago he started using the phrase \\"been there, done that\\". Not just once, but many times per book. Rainbow Six has 3-4 \\"been there, done that\\"s in it, several comparisons of the men on Rainbow 6 to \\"lions\\", that sort of thing. It is as though Clancy is writing each scene in his story outline, then just glueing them together. He needs an editor. Also, this book could have been written by Rush Limbaugh. Yeah, vegetarians are a pretty serious danger to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Settle an Estate by Plotnick","review":"This work sets forth the extensive requirements to probate awill.

Harlan and Lyons, while the first on the scene to mass popularize the concept of buyer agency, have done so more as a marketing method, than as a representation first model.Harlan and Lyons's book is not threatening to the desire of traditional real estate agents to control and influence both sides of the transaction, which explains why they have had success in promoting their book on a wholesale basis.With them, it's about what is best for the licensee, not the client.Reviewed by Jay Reifert, Broker/OwnerExcel-Exclusive Buyer Agencyand Director of Operations for REAL-ReformReal Estate Agency Law-Reform"},{"rating":"2","title":"I got nudged","review":"This book takes a look at different situations we encounter in life. It compares how we DO react to how we COULD react if we'd just remember God is present. Personal examples, humor, and Biblical references make this an easy-read book. It could be finished in one day, but I recommend taking it slow. Each night I looked forward to bedtime so I could read one more chapter as a devotional. I found plenty to think about and I'm guessing God had a few chuckles, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amandla","review":"A great story about a difficult point in world history. Great to use in the classroom to show music's role in Apartheid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected but interesting","review":"This was not what I expected. I expected some musical of some sort that told a story. Instead, I got what I would describe as a documentary about Apartheid that involved music. None the less it was very well done with interesting snippets from white South Africans, historical accounts and activists alike. Definitely not a lighthearted, feel good movie but it was thought provoking and educational. I would definitely recommend it to a friend, especially a young adult or teenager with the mental capacity to sit still long enough to let the story unfold."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMANDLA! IS A MUST SEE","review":"I am a black West Indian who had been fortunate enough to see this documentary before I bought the DVD....it is fantastic and moving and emotional and awe inspiring! I looked at it thorugh a veil of tears! Every individual alive regardless of race needs to purchase this DVD and take a good long repeated look at this documentary which chronicles the resilience of the human spirit....I felt inspired to stand on principle and proud to be alive after looking at the documentary. It was REAL...Nothing put on for the cameras...the pride the people felt for their songs and for their leaders and the strength to keep up the fight was palpable throughout...Hugh Masakela, Myriam Makeba and the other performers who faced racism and hatred everyday still loved their country and that was obvious throughout...from the travesty that was Aparthied we now fortunately have a glimpse into one aspect of what it took to keep South African victims of apartheid motivated to fight the power! AMANDLA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read from a good author","review":"Perhaps I am a bit spoiled with The Murder She Wrote mysteries, but I found this book to somewhat lack character and plot development. While the book is well written and esily understandable, the ending lacked much to be desired. To many twists and turns, much like the Runaway Mountain at Six Flags. All in all a good read and a good introduction to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the Buyer Gets Seduced","review":"Just in case none of you noticed, most of the positive reviews for this this book were written by Ross Jeffries! Notice the long, melodramatic reviews which drone on with lines like \\"imagine yourself with the power to...\\" Folks, I wish that his program did work, but I'm inclined to say that your luck will be the same as waving a stopwatch before someone's face & saying...\\"you're getting VERY sleepy!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Offended by the goals - Just don't think this works","review":"I read this book because I was hopeful that the more favorable reviews would be accurate. Coming off of a four year relationship and new to the dating scene, I thought this would be a helpful tool to \\"get back in there.\\" I really was disappointed. This may or may not help people who are really shy or who never had any women, but for those of us whose success with women has not been terrible, this book is a waste of money and travesty. The author's main strategy is to ask women questions like \\"What was your favorite vacation\\" so that they will think of romantic feelings and want to have sex with you. It's very stupid and won't help a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"INTO BED??? YOU'D BE LUCKY JUST TO GET HER INTO A CHAIR (if you could get her to stop laughing at you long enough)...","review":"... although Ross Jeffries' wild NLP theories and crazy schemes seemed like ground-breaking psychobabble nearly 20 years ago when gullible chumps were eating it up, nowadays a sensible man would only read it as a curiosity that's about as relevant today as the 8-track player, the waterbed and retro roller skates.The cover photo alone says it all - while the gal's lying in bed waiting for him to make a move, he looks like he's consulting a step-by-step sex manual because he's totally clueless about what to do next.To be read for entertainment purposes only."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is Hope After All!","review":"That's it! This book is the answer to my problems. I'm all done being a \\"nice\\" guy. I'm a 20 year old college student, and I have way too many \\"friends\\" for girls. Not for long though. I've been down in the dumps because I haven't gotten laid for two years. It's depressing as hell, but after reading this book I feel a lot more hopeful, and I can't wait to go out and try some of these techniques.I suggest you try them too! Great book, Ross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ve-e-e-ry Interesting - but Stupid!","review":"1) Jeffries emphasizes (to put it mildly) the use of \\"framing\\" context and catchy terms and phrases. This same approach is preached in countless books and courses on how to conduct yourself in meetings, job interviews and submitting resumes - dare we see some connection here?2) In some context this is one man's answer to all those books by women on how to land a man. And just as intelligent.3) If you ever meet anyone sucker enough to be used by this approach, lose them or steer clear of them; they're not worth knowing. Before someone tries this on you, read Sheldon B. Kopp's \\"If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him.\\"4) Jeffries' biggest selling point is his attitude; there has always been a market for it and always will be. On the whole, it's better this should advertise itself publicly than go underground - this way, we know where they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Book","review":"Guide to using hypnosis to get women horny. Author doesn't stress the fact that most states you can be arrested for rape for using these methods. My personal opinion is Mr. Jeffries picks up women at the special olympics,because they're the only women his hypno-babble would work on. His pick-up lines are THE WORST I'VE EVER READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a woman's point of view...","review":"If you are the kind of guy who has no real morals or conscience (and the woman will probably already sense this 10 minutes into a conversation with those of you who abide by this book) *and* your goal is to have the kind of relationship that lasts less than a week, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, lose the book and be yourself. Women want nice guys who *won't* use them for their body or affections. Women want men who can be their best friend -- not best lover. I have yet to know anyone who's ever said otherwise. And the one's who probably only want sex and nothing more are as riddled with problems and emotional baggage as the men who use them. This book is worthless to those of you who still believe that being a nice guy is the only real way to earn respect from women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shagadelic","review":"I think I saw a copy of this in Austin Powers' personal effects when they thawed him out!

Not only does it offer you better techniques than you have ever known, but it introduces you to what will be the most powerful and influential part of your life, getting the hottest babes into bed! But don't cheat yourself by only reading the book and order the basic home study course. The guarantee Ross gives you, is AMAZING, and the fact that it really works, is a quantumleap beyond anything else out there. Those who disagree have been known to be angry that THEY didn't discover Speed Seduction first. So do yourself, and the women, a favor, and do whatever it takes to learn everything you possibly can about Ross Jeffries' products. Your future awaits you, and she looks damn fine! That's MY opinion, but you're welcome to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"If you want a good book on landing babes, read How to succede with women by Ron Louis. It is far more thought provoking and gives you an honest chance at improving your scoring potential. This book by jeffries, is really thin. Like a pamphlet. and double spaced. It is a waste of time and money and Jeffries is a dork. Trust me, Louis is much better. I've read them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoloutely terrible!","review":"I don't know what kind of women Mr. Jeffries is dating, but anyone who has half a brain will recognize his feeble attempts at hypnotism. This book is good for a few laughs, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for the aspiringpick up artist","review":"This book was the starting point for me 5 years ago when I started my journey into the pick up arts. It is an absolute must read for those wanting to get better at understanding women and the ways a woman's mind works. Though there are countless other ideas and methodologies available today, they all stem from this book. Ross Jeffries is the father of the pick up community as we know it today and not reading this book is losing out on some valuable information. Don't take it as the last word, but it is golden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I'm not a professional pua but I've read a lot of other material on the subject and this is pure fluff. He wrote the book to make money and although some of the methods work for you if you're an expert at NLP, some are completely bogus, like the complement ladder (or something like that) where you keep giving her complements until she folds and likes you. Those kind of things should be in a guide for \\"how to make sure every girl keeps you in the friends zone\\"I recommend reading more books on the topic but not this.. start with The Game if new to the concept of pua"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the tip of the ice burg","review":"I bought this Ross Jeffries book because it was alot cheaper than his home study course. Well, there is a reason for that. This book in its time might of contained one or two good points, but now with sites like The Seduction Bible and books like Neil Struass's The Game this just doesn't offer anything fresh. Unless you are completely new to the game and this is the only book you can find, and you can't get online than skip this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Joke","review":"More than 25 years ago, there was a comic piece in the MAD magazine about a guy who follows the advice of a book entitled \\"How to Get Girls by Hypnotism\\". Ross Jefferies straight-facedly advises you to do the same. Books like \\"How to Get Girls by Hypnotism\\" have been around since the begining of time and have been ridiculed just as long. You will only make a fool of yourself with this book.A good book in this category is How to Succeed with Women by Ron Louis (careful, there is another book of the same title by a different author) and How to Date Young Women by Don Steele. Buy those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do what Ross suggests - YOU WON\\"T BE SORRY!","review":"Ross' techniques are grounded in a system of psychology that really gets results. It works and I strongly suggest getting a hold of everything you can that he publishes. I have personally used some of his techniques as well as other techniques from the same field of psychology that Ross distilled his techniques from and I have been more than pleased with the results. It has enabled me to increase the quality of my relationships all around as well as my sex life and even though there is some bad press about Ross and his system he has provided a badly needed resource to people who need a way to take charge of their love lives. By the way, his system will work for women as well as men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Futile Information about procuring Women","review":"Possibly one the worst book choices out there. Ross Jeffries the self proclaimed master over women. Writes this completely ridiculous book. The truth is that Ross Jefferies is a great marketer-that is the true purpose of the book to sell nonsense that people would buy into. Then he could use the profits to sell more nonsense. Anyhow the book has some lame tips that most guys already know. The two sections on NLP and hypnosis are the most riduculous. I suppose this book would work on woman who had the IQ of a tomato. Other then that my advice is don't buy this book. A person who reads this book will know as much as the person who did'nt read it. Absolute literary garbage. Excellent work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuel for humor","review":"The only value this has is as a basis for conversation with a woman who has a sense of humor--both parties can probably get some good belly laughs.The fake reviews by the author here are pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest your money elsewhere","review":"Although the author makes a few good points this book isn't worth the purchase price. His hypnosis technique would probably work on women with IQs of less than 80 but who want's to hang around them? Also, the whole concept of pursuing women for sex alone seems too single minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute nonsense","review":"I am ashamed I bought this book! This guy obviously has never had a date, let alone been in bed with a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"In one word, a scam. This is nothing but a pitch for additional \\"systems\\" by the author. Let me give you an example. One of the line he advocates is something like \\"Hello you fine example of genetic perfection\\". Would anyone in this day and age use such a line and what type of woman would respond positively tho this question? Nuff said. Save your $$$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge waste of money and time!","review":"I read, re-read, practiced, and made efforts on NUMEROUS occasions to seduce several different women using the techniques in this book and NONE of it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will make you facinating","review":"You wont be boring with this book. GREAT!! confidence advice and GREAT ways of planting sexual suggestions in her mind. His advice for self introduction (i.e. the pickup) are not the best however. I think a simple honest complement and a may i join you is the better advice in most cases. For that, though, you dont need a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction, pure fiction.","review":"I can't believe that people honestly think that this can work.

Even some more suggestions would be appreciated.A bit dated instead is the attitude towards interaction with girls unless you want only get laid for a night."},{"rating":"1","title":"What organ do you think with?","review":"Basically, this book gives you some semi-hypnotic tactics that I have too much respect for humanity to use.

And to top it off its done in VERY BAD taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life!","review":"Well,it wasn't just this book. The book it self is good, entertaining and very useful. But it was the fact that it lead me to Ross Jefferies that made the big changes in my life. The man is a true master in a brain science and getting laid. My friends and I were idiots till we found this stuff. Now were nailing your wife while your at work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Just to show that you can't judge a book by its title, this book promises a lot and delivers little. The premise is amazing; that you can walk up to some hot chick you've never met in a mall, get her to close her eyes and picture a delicious chocolate, and minutes later get her in bed. Nice fantasy, but it reminds me of the story about the guy who stands on a street corner asking every woman who walks past him to go to bed with him. 999 times out of a 1000 he gets slapped. Ross' advice is as practical as telling you to get rich by buying a lottery ticket; the odds are about the same.A far better book is \\"how to date young women\\" by R. Don Steele. Steele's methods are far more realistic (he doews not promise instant success) and by the way Steele's advice applies to all women, not just young women."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is crap not doe'snt work worht a damn","review":"Believe me this crap dose'nt work cause I used some of mr.jefferies \\"gurellia technques\\" that alledgely can get you \\"laid\\" and i'll tell you way I used the \\"complement string\\" where you strart with complement and another compliment then to come across as funny and cute.That dose'nt work worth a damn except feeling stupid and still don't have a date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative, Misogynist and Anti-Erotic","review":"Eroticism is involving yourself in a playful encounter. Jeffries is all about exaggerated wounded male ego, evidenced not least by his need to \\"pad\\" his list of bad reviews with inflated ones of his own. Sex should be fun, playful, healing and mutual, not a stolen trophy in a bitter gender war. Heal the bitterness, learn to love yourself, and who you'll attract will much more likely be who you'll want to keep. No wonder he hates most women--look at the assumptions he's bringing to his social universe. We find what we seek. Honest readers, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh","review":"Ross Jeffries was profiled in \\"Playboy\\". The writer applied Jeffries' verbal tricks, and they did not work! The writer DID get a date, because he persevered, and got out there talking to women, which he admitted he would not have done without Jeffries' \\"advice.\\" So the writer of that article basically gave the only (but not weak) piece of advice Jeffries has to offer that works (the rest is snake oil): the more you cast the line in the water, the better chances you'll have of catching a fish. Like the old aphorism: \\"The harder I work, the luckier I get.\\" One of those basic rules we all KNOW, but few PRACTICE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Shoes!","review":"I initially bought these for the novelty and was surprised at how amazing they are. These are the most comfortable shoes EVER! Very cushy, and the part of the thong that goes between your toes is fabric, so no painful blisters. I wear these all the time and am considering throwing away all of my other flip flops. I don't ever use the compartment in the heel, but it's good to know it's there. I will definitely be buying another pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sandal","review":"The sandals are great.

Not only that but everyone who has them has the little \\"key drawer\\" (hidden in the heal) slipping out. I returned them, and it was not cheap, since they were so heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!!!!!!","review":"This seems like a great deal with the amount of material and the price, but the truth is \\"cheap price, cheap recordings\\" . I highly suggest if you want to get the most of Richard Strauss's tone poems you should buy different recordings. The main thing I was disappointed with on this box set was the recording of An Alpine Symphony. The recording of the alpine symphony was too old and weak, sloppy and loud (only at times),and just ok overall. The alpine symphony is on the first cd so I after I listened to that, I had a bad attitude about the rest of it. Even though, all of the other recordings are pretty good or ok.Personally, I would suggest Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic when it comes to Richard Strauss's tone poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This 3 CD set is disappointing. Close to 2/3 of the music is in mono, not stereo. The mono recordings are not even close to being top flight mono. They date from 1957 when many recordings were already being made in great sounding stereo. What Deutsche Grammophon should have done is to take CD 2 (all stereo) and the 2 stereo tracks off CDs 1 and 3 and combined them with other artists and made a 3 CD Richard Strauss Panorama series set.Just about everything on Bohm's 3 CD set has been recorded in great sounding stereo by Herbert Von Karajan. If I were in the market that is the direction I would go."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing","review":"I read this book years ago and it was life changing. Terry Kellogg clearly explains family dysfunction in a personal way that really rang true for me. I have read a lot of these types of books but HIS was the best--gentle, sad, truth but with an offer of hope at the end. I had so many 'lightbulb' moments reading this--wish he had of written it when I was a teen. Ohwell--when the student is ready the teacher will come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Exploration","review":"For those who are new to codependency, self-help, and psychology should absolutely check this book out. In this book Terry Kellogg describes codependency and the family environments in which it originates in a very clear, concise detail. I was not once confused about what Terry was talking about in this book. In fact, the way he writes encouraged me to keep turning the pages to learn more.I would recommend this book to anybody who has survived an abusive family of any kind, is suffering from some addictive behavior, is in therapy currently, or for somebody who is planning on becoming a therapist.

The only thing he did differently from those portrayed here was to have Carl Rove portray him as a \\"good-ol-boy\\" just before election time so all those sad Wal-Mart shoppers would think he was one of them.

This documentary does a good job of showing that it's not like you think it would be. In some ways, life is a lot tougher. Everybody needs a purpose in life.

Well, here's one hell of a collection of games. But there's no-one to hold your hand. Oh well, pick a game from the text, play each move and think about why that move was made and what move will be made next. Hey! you might learn something.Oh, and its algebraic notation. Yeeehah!

The soloists are excellent and the choir sings with bright, pure tones, showing a minimum of legato or vibrato.It's an excellent performance on the whole, although to my ears the recording was inadequately recorded. In particular, the bass section of the chorus is frequently all-but-inaudible, buried under the sopranos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and well-played...sound a little sterile.","review":"This is an exceptional recording of the Requiem. The clarity and variety in the string sound is wonderful, the brass and timpani are bright, agressive and add a little element of terror (often taken out of this piece to make it more \\"beautiful\\"), the choir is clear and expressive, and Barbara Bonney is exquisite. I find the sound of the woodwinds, and of the overall master to be a little sterile - not acoustically dry, but rather digitally cold. The recording quality might not be noticed on average speakers, but I listen on balanced studio monitors and also on high-end home theatre speakers, and the sound just came across as a little artificial. That is my only complaint. Check out Bruno Weil with Tafelmusik."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"I personally love spice and I found just the right amount in this tea. It's not too overpowering and it blends so well with the citrus undertones. I first tried it at P.F.changs and was so pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste. It can be sipped as is without any sweetener, but I add a touch of honey to enhance the spice that I so love! It's a perfect pairing with asian dishes or alone. Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Poprock et","review":"Jay Garrigan has written some of the most beautiful quirky pop songs this side of the milky way.

Moves are not always attributed to the proper characters, the biographies of the characters are mostly badly written filler that you'd get from a quick run through of the game,the screenshots are too dark and too small to be of any real use, and the few character renders that are included are often overlaid with other graphics or charts that don't add much to your knowledge of the game itself. Minimal information, no bios and no pictures aside from more useless screenshots are included of the final boss characters despite the fact that this information would help clarify the game's storyline. This strategy guide is the only one available for Bushido Blade 2 but interested games should approach it with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well done","review":"really enjoyed watching this, I am always looking for documentaries like this one, truly a must see, this here will take you on a trip to a very dark place.

Clancy's best novels (Red Storm Rising and Clear and Present Danger to name two) were filled with action and suspense, not chapter long diatribes about such issues as abortion, population control and domestic politics. I see that Clancy is trying to move in a different direction with his writing, but it just comes of as contrived and preachy. Until he returns to his former style, I will be passing on all his future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHINESE WATER TORTURE","review":"I found this book impossible not to put down.In many of his recent books Clancy has been in serious need of a ruthless editor,but never more than in \\"The Bear and the Dragon.\\" There was so much fluff and extraneous material that I found it impossible to follow -- or eventually to care about -- the story line.Even worse,readers are continuously subjected to gratuitous doses of Clancy's political views.Do we really care in the context of the story about President Jack Ryan's views on abortion or social security? A good editor could have shortened this tome by several pages without damaging its content one iota.Then,perhaps we could have decided whether there is enough to the real story to make it interesting and entertaining.Unfortunately,we will never know. Instead,we are stuck with a cast of familiar characters who are no longer interesting or even credible and a world that is impossible to care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Typos Detracted From The Story!","review":"A reel disappointment. Four a book to bee enjoyed it helps if it does knot contain sew many speling and typograffikle errurz.I usually enjoy TC's books---but this one was indeed a disappointment. Decent story, but the typos and errors became tedious. Halfway through the book I started circling the obvious errors for entertainment value alone. Obviously the publisher opted to use an automated spell-checker because the book was filled with typos---some funny, but most were annoying and detracted from the reading experience. Just because a word is spelled correctly does not mean it's the right word to use!

And though most of his books have had the scent of the Red Scare in them, this book reeks of it. It reads at times like some sort of late '50s pamphlet, save that it's over 700 pgs. long, but the real question is why? Why take a story brimming with all sorts of intrigue, and pile on this unnecessary, and despite the author's attempts, wholly irrelevant 'Gee, Stalin was bad' material - the amount of it, and sacrifices of flow and plot to insert it are, quite simply, baffling.

Yes, I know this is only fiction, but since Clancy cares so much about little details, shouldn't he at least create a world that looks like the one we live today? His idea about China and Chinese people seems to stay in the 1980's, and they're so stereotyped that it could only be called racism. Did he spend time to even study China and it's people? I think not. Also, his idea about economics are just plain stupid. He thinks that $100bln is such a large amount of money that it would somehow save Russia's economy. Do you know that $100bln is about what Russia gets from selling crude oil this year? A compleate waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TC, please pay attention","review":"I don't expect this to be read, but I have to agree with all the previous die-hard fans (have to go out and buy the book the same day of release). I've never come here to read a review of TC before, his quality was always high. I came here just to see if I was the only one with this sense of disappointment. Not by a long shot - too long (or too thin on story line), too many phrases repeated immediately afterward by another character, an enemy that never had a chance to be a good villian, and an ending that befitted a 60 minute TV program - the list is very long and casts doubt who is writing/editing his work.I will return here before I buy my next Clancey novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy should stick to military and technical matters","review":"I will keep this brief - unlike Clancy.This book is the worse book that I have read from Tom Clancy.The characters are pretty one-dimensional.

How many times can he refer, for instance, to \\"sausage\\"?Clearly, expouses a very-right wing political view point that would never work were these characters actually running the country in reality.He should stick to his strengths and talk about miltiary technology issues as he has done in his best books: Red Storm Rising and Red October.

I had been an avid Clancy fan...until now. The Bear and the Dragon is filled with simplistic, stereotyped, and bigoted portrayals of just about everyone. It is filled more with proselytizing and what appears to be Clancy's personal views of the world than with character development. The writing is sloppy with numerous and rediculous repetitions (\\"yeah Wilbur\\") and the descriptions of technology are inconsistent, with state-of-the art weaponry and completely out of date personal computers and internet connections. I could go on, but that may be as boring as many of the detailed war scenes.

The standard characters are familiar, but I had almost forgotten the politics of the last book -- other than the fact that Jack Ryan was now president.I did love the book and this one has enough of the separate plots and subplots to be classic Clancy.

A true disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste","review":"This book is to fiction what the \\"White Raven\\" is to movies. It establishes a base line of mediocrity and tedium virtually unparelelled by anything else you'll find.

They can't even becalled right wing - more like blindly pro-government. Clancyis given to using his books as anti-encryption propaganda,presumably on the theory that the FBI and other governmentagencies are as honorable and professional as the agents in hisbooks (and there was no one else trying to read unencryptedemail).It'd be nice if it was so. Unfortunately, one incident in thislatest book was so outrageous as to be macabre: after aChinese policeman shoots a priest holding a newborn infant,a character comments that in the US law enforcement officersdon't shoot people holding babies.

Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"No one has ever accused Tom Clancy of being a great writer, but in the Bear and the Dragon he hardly appears to be trying. The book is poorly edited, plot lines are dropped or added arbitrarily, and the dialogue is so bad that it has to be read to be believed. In some of his earlier books, Clancy did show that he could construct a fast-moving plot, and turn out entertainment, if not art. But at this point in his career, he can't even do that. Of course, he continues to sell well based on his earlier work, but you have to wonder how long this will continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with four-letter words","review":"I stopped reading this book after about 100 pages. Clancy (whom I thought was right-leaning) apparently cannot go 4 or 5 pages without using the \\"s\\" word or the \\"f\\" word. Even Jack Ryan regularly uses the latter (did he do that in the previous books? I don't think so). Tom Clancy has sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain Booooorrrring!","review":"Having enjoyed many of Clancy's earlier books I was highly disappointed in this effort that seemed created solely for the purpose of putting as many words, many misspelled and grammatically incorrect, on as many pages as possible.Trying to keep track of the multitude of characters that kept popping up with different, and unpronounceable names was an exercise in futility. I gave up when less than one-third of the way through.I attempted to get away without awarding any stars, but the format wouldn't allow it. The single star is awarded 'tongue-in-cheek.It's sad when I think of all the trees that had to be destroyed to print that worthless effort. Of course, Clancy could care less. If for no other reason, his continual sarcastic reference to 'tree-huggers' has turned me off his writing for all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Very Good Book","review":"I will be brief. Do not make the same mistake that I have made: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. One of the most unrealistic books I have ever read. Mr. Clancy seems not to understand the modern battlefield. Let me just ask you a question: Is it possible for the United States and Russia to be involved in a mojor conflict with China, and only lose 800 men? I do not thinks so. To add an injuty to the insult, China invedes Russia in orderder to capture a Gold mine. Now what is this: Fairy Tale? Mr. Clancy seems to have run out of imagination, and includes all of his previous characters:Jack Ryan, the Rainbow Six Team, and etc. Do yourself a favor: do not read a 1000 pages of poorly written, unbeilivble, self centered piece of work. There are better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I have read all of Tom Claney's books and really have enjoyed them. I did feel that he was giving too much detail, but I managed to get passed that. The Bear and the Dragon was just terrible.

I won't rush out to buy another hard cover first edition of Claney's until I have read some reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for Jack Ryan to retire","review":"This is not one of Tom Clancy's best. Jack Ryan's inner dialogue gets very tiresome after the third or fourth time. One of the biggest elements missing form this book is the element of surprise.

Some of the great elements of his previous successes remain in Bear and Dragon, especially his (apparent) insider's knowledge of intelligence and military tactics and equipment. Even if half of these aren't real, they're interesting nonetheless.It appears, however, that given his significant success, Clancy has little if any editorial oversight. This should have been a 300-400 page book, not 1100+ pages. The same positions and points of view were made repeatedly. In some cases, the spoken phrases and thoughts were repeated verbatim, sometimes by different characters.Further, the \\"good\\" characters just aren't that interesting -- none are given any appreciable faults or inner conflicts do deal with. The end felt so rushed you'd think Clancy had run out of paper.Its disappointing, but this will be my last Clancy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original gimp has lost steam","review":"Mr Clancy's books have never been short, and the paperback edition I have of this one numbers 1137 pages (and this reader's head spins...). His initial production was at least made palatable by the display of a mass of fascinating technological knowledge of weapons and weapon-systems (and thus was the term \\"techno-thriller\\" born...) brought to us ignoramus-es, which even made the use of a forest of never-heard-before acronyms acceptable. In the progress of his production, we have been presented with divagations into politics and finance but, above all, with an increasing verbosity. ... Mr Clancy's production seems to be growing inflated, overfed, plethoric and hypertrophic, just as his physical appearance on the TV interviews he gives. He must have felt himself a decline in his readership's interest, if he resorted to introducing into his writing that old and stale ingredient, the torrid herotic scene...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Interesting concept: How would the world react to enormous gold and oil reserves being found in Siberia.The problem is that the book makes things so much simpler than the world really is. Every American is Clancy the corny hero. And every Chinese character is the bad guy who 'hates those greedy Americans who try to control us, because we are the superior race'.Of course this is just supposed to be one long (1137 pages) roller coaster of action, and is fiction after all. It is just that the treatment is so unfair and the stereotyping is taken to the absurd lengths that one would expect of a farce, not a serious thriller.My point is if you are setting a novel in real places like China and America at least try a little to represent the actual complexity of these places. If you're not going to, then rather make it sci-fi and set it in a made-up world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite verbose","review":"I have been a fan of Clancy's for many years and have read all the Jack Ryan and John Clark novels. This one ranks near the bottom, just above Sum of All Fears. Six to seven hundred pages should be enough to tell almost any story. Ryan and Clark need to retire so Clancy can find a new story line.

Nine hundred and fifty pages of build-up to a conflict which is superficially resolved in the last one hundred pages is not the way maintain a devoted following.

Yes, there was a section in Executive Orders that very strongly implied Cathy and Jack Ryan going to bed to have sex, but the passage was minimal and was between a husband and wife.In his latest book, Clancy has stooped to the level of discussing the sexual affairs between the main character, Chet Nomuri, and his information source. It's the type of ploy I would expect from a cheap romance novel, but not from Clancy.Clancy continues to weave multiple subplots into a good story, but it's unfortunate he felt compelled to include such a strong sexual element in The Bear and the Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to get to the end...","review":"\\"The Bear and The Dragon\\" doesn't even come close to \\"Executive Orders\\". For the first 24 chapters or so, you wonder when the story will finally take off, but it just goes on and on and on in low gear. I actually wondered if Clancy is paid by the page, or if there is some minimum number of pages to a book in his contract... If you actually get through the first half to two-thirds of the book, the rest is ok. I didn't expect the book to be as good as \\"Executive Orders\\", but I was still disappointed.

He invites the crew of the missile cruiser to his house for a party. What a great denoument! Clancy has always been a fun read (except for the execrable Patriots) and he managed to pull me through all 1000+ pages of this one, but mostly out of curiosity over whether ANY of our new weapons systems would fail. I could overlook the right-wing hyperbole on almost every page and the repeated wisecracks; the profanity was a pain in the neck, but I've seen worse. But, having had several PRC students in my classes, I really wonder about the irresponsible characterization of these people that underpins the whole plot.

He misspells the name of China's third most important city several times (like misspelling Chicago), he has people in Beijing using Cantonese slang (Cantonese is spoken only in Southern China), and he has people in Beijing calling each 'comrade' - especially odd when you consider that in current China 'comrade' is how homosexuals refer to each other now in the PRC.

Do we REALLY need to read page after page of Ryan's thoughts on why he hates being President or Noumouri's thoughts on seducing a secretary? No. 19th century novels are models of concision by comparison. He also much have discovered the word \\"f**k\\" since he uses it at every opportunity.

Most importantly, about 400 pages too long (take them out of the first 600). Obviously no one had time to proofread as the book is literally rife with typos, misspells, and tourtured constructions.If you are a Clancy fan like me, you'll buy it and read it anyway, but I hope enought people don't that he gets his act back together for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Waste of a Tree.","review":"\\"Quantity has a quality all its own\\" is a phrase repeated often in this book. Clancy seems to have taken it to heart in producing this 1100+ page work. There is a decent story here, but it is buried in hundreds of pages of political, economic, and social commentary that tends to be to the right of Rush Limbaugh.There are at least 5 stories in the book...all of which are strung together with only the weakest of links. The same jokes are repeated endlessly, and while they are funny the 1st time, you tire of them after the 3rd. The familiar cast of Clancy characters is trotted out, some just to make cameo appearances. All these different people might as well be the same as they mostly share the same views and beliefs.There is decent suspense and the mechanical magic we've come to expect from \\"technothrillers\\", but only the most diligent reader will reach the payoff.

To be cut, would be the endless descriptions of Ryan, our newly elected President, thinking and talking about social security, abortion, balance of payments and other Clancy thoughts on government and Washington policy or the lack thereof. Who cares what Clancy thinks on these subjects. Give us a good read, lots of action and plausible reality. We get enough of the rest on talk shows and in The New York Times"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive language, sexual content, shallow Ryan","review":"I found the book to be full of offensive language and more explicit sexual content than I am willing to endure. I have been a Jack Ryan fan since Hunt for Red October. I put this book down because of the f-word and other swear words occuring many times per most pages and because of the sexual detail. I also find that Jack Ryan has become less interesting and highly shallow as President. Where has the intelligent and courageous hero we all grew to love gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping pill","review":"This is a 200-page initial review: \\"Not (yet) up to par.\\" My reading habit is to go to bed and read for an hour or so. Of late I manage to prop my way through 3 or 4 pages before I drop the book.From reading some of the other customer reviews, it sounds like I have 700+ pages to go before the action picks up to classic Clancy pace --- final rating will be when I finish the book; ETR is 15 Apr 01. . . . :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing it wasn't his first book !","review":"Had this been his first book it would never have been published and we'd all be saying \\"Tom who?\\". Instead I'm saying \\"Tom, what happened to you?\\". Though slightly better than Rainbow Six, the story is far too linear, repetitive (The word \\"Klingon\\" appears over a dozen times - spread through the book!) and ordinary. The final chapter must have been phoned in by those same Klingons. (Among other things Ryan invites the entire crew of a destroyer over to the White House to get drunk with him.) The last line is simply revolting and unworthy. I suspect Tom is using some kind of high end computer program, plus assistant writers, to generate is latest \\"material\\". If so he should either get back to basics or give it up entirely. Thanks for a fantastic run Mr. Clancy. Please don't ruin your legacy with this kind of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Mr. Clancy's Previous Standards","review":"This book is in desperate need of an editor. There are characters introduced then forgotten, misspellings and redundant statements, cultural anachronisms (sorry, I have spent a lot of time in Russia and no one calls anyone 'Comrade' anymore). The whole thing feels like a second draft that could have been tightened quite a bit. Sorry, I think Mr. Clancy has stretched himself too thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy and the Abasement of fiction writing","review":"I know that I am just adding to the number of people who are displeased and thorougly discouraged the way Clancy writes; verbosity at its best. I think Clancy needs to read his first novel \\"The Hunt For Red October,\\" and classic thrillers written by such reputed authors like Fredrick Forsyth to really \\"re-learn'\\" the art of writing a thriller. It's all good to strut one's military knowledge, but for god's sake it's useless if you can't hold the attention of the reader. As readers have pointed out, this book barely gets your attention till after 300 pages. Even then, the reader has to cope with voluminous details as if he's due to sit an exam the next day. Clancy should seriously think about his future work and I dare say the publisher must be faulted too for letting this book go on the shelf. It's a total comedown for American fiction writing. Tom Clancy seems to be building a repuitation for abasing himself. Publisher, please spare us this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing -- what happened to Clancy/ Ryan?","review":"This is a very disappointing book.It's bad enough that Clancy has discovered the word f__k, but he uses it every chance he gets in this book. Clancy descends into using degrading sexual imagery -- \\"missed by a c__t hair\\" is used repeatedly in the book. And Clancy doesn't neglect the racial stereotypes liberally, either -- African Americans are labeled \\"monkeys,\\" Chinese are \\"Chinamen\\" or \\"ch_nks,\\" and the Arabs are not forgotten either.Instead of turning into a principled apolitical thinking President, Jack Ryan has turned into a trigger-happy macho who abandons his assigned post and proceeds to get happily drunk during an international crisis.Reading this book is like spending a few days in a garbage bin.The Tom Clancy we knew and read seems to have retired some years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"tediouser and tediouser","review":"In the summer of 1988, I had a day devoted to reading Clancy's first novel. Didn't eat, didn't sleep until I had finished it. And for every novel since, my life has gone on hold because I can't stop reading it. Until his latest, of course. Though some of his novels are a bit verbose at times, this takes the cake! Are his editors (if there are any) too scared of him to use their red pens? Or are they even bothering to read anymore? Publisher, beware: you will lose money and Clancy fans on this one - and deservedly so. Tom (if I may be so bold), beware: save your readers the sermons and the repetition and get back to the fast-moving thriller/suspense we have all grown to love. Might I suggest you revisit Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising? Or hire me as your editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"finally finished it","review":"Clancy has taken a medeocre 300 paged novel and expanded it into a horrendous novel of over 1000 pages. This is his worst to date and is the last of the hard cover editions of his books I will buy. He is still an interesting read but the development is so slow you start losing interest. Just think back to the hunt for red october or red storm rising. This was clancy at his best. Now he has used up the genre and should develop new and interesting characters not the same cast of characters that can do no wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I don't want to just pile on here like everyone else, but this book was such a monumental waste of time I'd feel remiss if I didn't say something. Much like the other reviewers here I'm a big fan of Clancy's earlier works. However, I'm beginning to lose faith in what was once one of my favorite writers. In \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", I found most of the dialogue to be tedious and repetitive. The plot line wanders along with all the purpose of a random Arctic ice berg. Look out Titanic fans! If you value your time even in the slightest do yourself a favor, pass on this book and wait for more reader reaction before picking up Clancy's next tome. I wish I'd had the foresight to do so this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn yawn....booooring","review":"As an old Clancy/Ryan fan, this one just didn't make the cut. Tired storyline, much too long. About 1/3 of the book is editorializing about the presidency and about \\"evil\\" China - no place for all that waffle in a novel of this kind. I waded through to the end, but it was barely worth it. Of all the Ryan novels, this has got to be the worst. Certainly not worthy of all the others. Sad to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Written by the Clancy Brothers","review":"The absolute WORST! Mr. Clancy needs to get off his soapbox and come back down to earth. We read you Mr. Clancy because your stories were often compelling, (a bit verbose and too technical at times), but the meat and potatoes of the story are well done. I could care less about your political agenda. If you need to speak about it, use another avenue.If you possess the political philosophy of a neo-facist John Bircher this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Past Prime","review":"Tom Clancy's latest effort shows that he hasn't had a new idea in years and with each book goes back to the same tired source that has clearly become barren through overuse. In addition, this book is blatantly racist. characterizing Chinese people as 'chinks' repeatedly. I wonder if more than just Clancy's writing skills are waning in his tiresome refernece to woman as sexual objects and far too frequent vulgar language. Clancy clearly sees the world through the eyes of a 14 year old -- good here, bad there. This black and white doctrine of his has always been simplistic, but was excusable in his earliest efforts in context to the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big big disappointment !","review":"I realy loved every \\"Jack Ryan\\" book that Clancy wrote until this one. This one is one too much. \\"Jack Ryan\\" was consumed to its poor end. Enough. He should start thinking of a new hero, no Jack Ryan, no John Clark, but a new one, a fresh one.The book was boring from page 1 until about 200 pages from the end. These last 200pages were more interesting, but still, as a unit, this book is boring.As a Clancy fan, I hope that he will return to himself next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Clancy; If you like Clancy you'll LOVE this one!","review":"If you're a Clancy fanatic (yes, I'm one) you'll love this book. If you've read his earlier work (the novels, not the co-written material), you'll find this one to be very similar. One big change is that because this work involves the topic of diplomacy, the major action develops very slowly and builds throughout the book. This is in stark contrast to some earlier works (like Sum of All Fears) where dramatic world events \\"take off\\" in the first 5-10 pages of the book. Some earlier reviewers commented about the somewhat more adult content (fairly minor) in this work, and I agree with their findings. Clearly a book written for adults, NOT for the younger set due to some sexual references throughout. If you love Clancy's work, you've got to read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"When I first got this book I thought it'll be bad 'cos of the reviews I read,but I found out something .The book to someone who hasn't been reading Clancy's book maybe 2-3,but for someone following all his books it's a 4.I think the only book that's beats it hands down will be Without Remorse.I honestly don't think he can beat that any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"This book is by far on of Tom Clancy's best novels besides Rainbow Six and Sum of All Fears. It's full of action, spy and mind racing adventure. The only downpart was the \\"japanese sausage\\" part. It was kind of lame, (especially since i'm a guy) Anyhow, I highly reccomend this book to all Clancy fans and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy's winning streak continues!","review":"This book, telling the tale of Jack Ryan, Clancy's fictional hero from most of his previous books, really is a classic. After Rainbow Six, which tended to have a more closed, focused story, this book is again very diverse, with many plots and subplots. Truly a great work of fiction. Long may Mr. Clancy write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Ryan has become the caricature of a crass, crusty middle-age man. Too much sex, too much foul language, too many stupid locker-room jokes, too much sermonizing and too little editing (the same clichéd phrases over and over). The book drags through the beginning and only picks up in the last few hundred pages. But the end is disappointing and unsatisfactory, as if the last few pages were abrubtly wrapped up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree -- skip this book","review":"Artless, long, and dull. I plowed through it because it was all I brought to read -- a big mistake. Notably worse than Executive Orders in style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many Sub-Plots or an Intricate Plot?","review":"As a person who reads all of Tom Clancy's books, The Bear and the Dragon, was a real treat. I was on the waiting list at Amazon and was not disappointed. I have read the reviews whining about too many sub-polts. Excuse me, but I found the sub-plots extremely informative. One of the things I like best about Tom Clancy, aside from great story telling, is his insight into global politics. This book is great and will cause the serious reader to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy's worst","review":"I'm a big Tom Clancy fan and when I did see his latest book \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" I couldn't wait to buy and read it. Looking back at it, this is my worst buy ever. I live myself in Asia (as a European) and really, Tom Clancy should have stayed out of Asia, because his views of Asia are biased, racist and simply WRONG. Besides this, the book is just never really starting of and very dreadful. I expected much better from Tom Clancy.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"This book wasn't too good. I guess it was trying to be realistic talk, but I got pretty tired of all the \\"slant-eyes\\" remarks. The sausage stuff was not clever or witty, it was just kind of gross. I don't think most people reading this kind of book (mostly men) want to read about some guys \\"Japanese Sausage\\" over and over and over again.And the whole last part was predictable...everything in the last couple of hundred pages could've been predicted by about page 500--I knew what was going to happen with the hunter guy, I knew what was going to happen with Clark and all that followed their actions, almost exactly what was going to happen, and the aftermath was also totally predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the action?","review":"I am on page 315 and bored out of my mind with this book! When will the action begin? I too am offended by the increased use of foul language in this book, a definate departure from Clancy's other books, of which, for the most part, I have enjoyed reading. Since I am a die-hard fan, however, I will continue reading this book, although my money may have been better spent on one of the \\"Op-Center\\" series books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Been there, done that. A long rehash of what we've seen before - foreign country underestimates U.S., war starts, U.S. crushes foe. Yada, yada, yada. Some things ring very hollow: I don't think I need to see the two most senior people in the CIA calling each other honey-bunny; the same goes for Jack Ryan and his 'babe' comments to his wife. He rants, even more then usual, on Social Security, \\"tree-huggers\\", gays, and women (his Secret Service agent Andrea Price-O'Day). At 1024 pages, there is way too much character development and not enough action. Finally, the whole reason for the conflict - the death of a couple of foreign diplomats, *they're not American, Tom*, is quite a stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bore and the Drag on","review":"Some how my previous lengthy review of this tome didn't make the list, therefore with public spirit in mind I will add my one star and suggest that Mr. Clancy hire an editor. No one should waste the time to read this regurgitated pap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good book, though ending was weak","review":"Continuing a series, my personal favorite being the Cardinal of the Kremlin, President Ryan takes on a fairly plausable crisis involving China and Russia. The ending was less than satisfactory, and it is unclear how the whole situation was resolved. Also, I would hope that Americans would be more resonable (Remember Pearl Harbor) and boycott goods from aggressor nations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy at his worst","review":"I agree with T. Drizzle almost word for word. I found itlong-winded and - well- boring! More superficial than Sum and less entertaining than Rainbow. I thought he glossed over sections that needed attention and poured pages into things that had no bearing on the story.I read for fun and relaxation and this was neither. Maybe Clancy suffers from too much success, since his other books were so well done, but without the Clancy name and reputation, I would have put this one down after the first slow 500 pages. In retrospect, I should have.I have read and own all the Clancy titles, but my next Cancy will come from the Library...Does anyone know a current author that writes like Clancy used to write? I guess it is time to move on...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Clancy Fan's","review":"Tom Clancy's latest is true to form. For diehard fans of JackRyan, John Clark and other Clancy characters, The Bear and The Dragon is a must read. Clancy flawlessly develops his intricate plot from multiple angles and the use of techno-speak is just enough to be factual without actually becoming an annoyance. The book is quite a long read at 1000+ pages, but its hard to put down nonetheless. Don't plan on buying it unless you have a little freetime! A couple minor criticisms arise from the several typo's I found while reading the book (editor's fault?) and a more racial slant in describing the villian of the book, China. While the Soviet villains of yesteryear's Clancy novels were easy enough to hate for their ideology and actions, I don't really find it necessary to throw in racial stereotypes to make a convincing villian. But, as I said, these are minor criticisms and I anxiously await another Clancy novel after devouring this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Each book just gets worse...","review":"I remember the \\"good old days\\" when picking up a new Clancy book was an event to look forward to. But now I find myself dreading the first few pages on any new Clancy volume, especially after the disaster that was Rainbow Six.It seems that as the threat of the cold war recedes, Tom finds it more difficult to develop interesting storylines which are relevant (and realistic). It was always Tom's portrayal of the battle or espionage, and the realpolitik which motivates governments and the military alike, which captured my imagination.I can't maintain interest in a thousand page book if it reads like a soap opera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Demeaning Book to all Chinese and Americans","review":"This book is demeaning to all Chinese, female and male. In Mr. Clancy's book, all Chinese men are sadistic, simple-minded, and evil. All Chinese women are willing to do anything for western goods and money. All American officials and military personnel are extremely casual in using racial terms and profanity. It is obvious Mr. Clancy lives in a world vastly different than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkably Prescient","review":"The main thrust of Clancy's latest novel depicts a conflict over Siberian resources between China, Russia and the USA. This part of the book contains all the combat action we have come to expect from this great author and more. It is undoubtable that the last section of the book that deals with the war itself is his most masterful piece of writing yet. I would certainly have liked to see this expanded to take up a greater section of the book at the expense of shortening some of the sidestories that are a hallmark of Clancy's novels, because I particularly enjoy the author's descriptions of military action, but those readers who prefer the build up phases will be happy with the allocation of the bookspace. Overall, this is an excellent book that I would highly recommend to any fan of Tom Clancy and it has the added benefit of identifying what may very well become a point of conflict in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"swill","review":"this is the end of the road for my reading this man's work. it was to long filled with stuffer and unintresting. the continued use of four or five names for ryan all on the same page sometimes not only felt backward but disjointed. somepages required rereading just to figure out who was being writen about potus, ryan ,jack, president ryan, swordsman as far as i can tell all these descriptions for the same character make the reading difficult. not to mention unenjoyable, as i have enjoyed all the other books (they are slowing down with the last couple)dull dull dull"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an ending!","review":"If I wrote 1000 pages of hash and rehash, I would be so tired I would probably have come up with as lame an ending as this one.

I'm not sure he ever really was. He could come up with a story, though. But now he seems to have dispensed with the skills of an editor and allowed Jack Ryan to become his ultra conservative spokesperson. And without a credible story, this book is thoroughly disappointing. Demeaning to the Chinese and women, and with most of the characters thoroughly undeveloped and one dimensional, the 1000 pages become a strain. As usual, Clancy characters don't have conversations, they lecture each other instead. And they drink coffee. Lots of it. Anyone with a lot of time on their hands might use it to figure out just how many cups of coffee have been downed in all the Clancy books put together. It would be more interesting than this foul mouthed, misogynistic and racist bunkum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad","review":"OK, I admit that I've read every novel Clancy has written. (God help me.) But they have gotten progressively worse, and this latest, Bear and the Dragon, is so bad it is insulting to the reader. It is monumentally ignorant, and the only thing worse than the writing is the editing. (Was there any editing?) All of the characters -- regardless of nationality or position -- speak in the same tiresome, moralistic, pseudo-chummy voice. The same phrases (....\\"that fellow\\"...) must appear in the book at least a hundred times. The cartoonish quality of the characters and the dialogue is nothing new, but there is little to none of the military/espionage nitty-gritty detail that made his earliest novels a success.The book is a complete waste of time, and the only reason its on the best-seller list is because of the sheer momentum of Clancy's name. It won't be lasting much longer if he puts out more like this.If you have to have a Clancy fix, go back and read Red October."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I can't share this one with my teens.","review":"I'm not even finished with the book, but felt compelled to write an online review. I have read all (except Rainbox Six) of Clancy's books and thoroughly enjoyed them and passed them along. If the character's names were changed and someone had asked me to read this book and tell them who wrote it, Tom Clancy would not have come to mind.

We are spoiled."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened???","review":"I am so disappointed. Meaningless pornographic sex, nedless swear words galore, endless preaching (literally, in some cases) and almost no action. Ugh. What happened to the story, the drama, the action? Almost no one does anything but whine and complain. Diplomats, president, field agent. Doesn't matter who the character is, no one is happy anymore and they've all lost their zest to do their jobs. I was very excited to get my hands on this book, and then it actually took several trys to get even a couple of chapters into it. I nearly stopped reading it several times. I just didn't expect to have to work that hard to get to the good stuff. Looks like Mr. Clancy is writing for the paycheck and getting paid by the word to do it. What a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither a Bear nor Dragon Be","review":"I intended to write a lengthy diatribe but had second thoughts as I would be saying nothing more than is contained in the other reviews on this site. Yet I am compelled to add a few thoughts, it appears to me that this book was hastily assembeled from a collection of disparate short stories and then clumbsily woven together. Making matters worse is incredibly poor job of editing the material for example in one passage one reads \\"tax\\" where its obvious that Fax was intended- Was anything more than \\"SpellCheck\\" used? In \\"The Hunt for Red October\\",Tom Clancy was justifiably praised for his research, yet in \\"The B & D\\" it is claimed that Jack Ryan brought out a security with the symbol SALC as an IPO out on the Big Board. The problem with this is that stock symbols on the Big Board are limited to a maximum of three characters. Four character symbols are used in the OTC market, NASDAQ. So much for research!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ponderous for words","review":"This book was much too ponderous. It was a chore to read it all the way through. I've read all of Clancy's novels, and this was the worst, even exceeding Rainbow Six. It was as if he cut and pasted dialog and scenes from his other novels to make up the first 700 pages of this one. It was deja vu, with all the same characters, and all their same viewpoints. I don't recommend it for anyone, and I won't suckered into buying the next one. Goodbye Tom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linguistic Disappointment","review":"After being a Clancy fan for a more years than I wish to remember, I was ecstatic at the prospect of another blockbuster novel. While the plot plods along at a snail's pace, one expects it to pick up tempo through the novel as does many of his other works. However, the big disappointment and linguistic \\"slap in the face\\" is his prolific use of vulgarities throughout the novel. This seems to be a new Clancy, with new and needless usage of vulgar language that seems to have little reason other than shock value. Indeed, one is reading along and suddenly is confronted phrases of \\"f\\" this, or \\"mf\\" that, that derails the reader from the story. I hope Mr. Clancy reads this and reconsiders using such language to such an extent in the future. It's not that we don't know that it exists, it's just hard to imagine it exists at such a voluminous variety and with such rapidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Clancy Ever","review":"It cannot be coincidence that this is an election year! Clancy uses this book more as a right-wing political statement than as as an entertaining story. Yes, one can predict and expect the usual military-macho stuff, but one cannot tolerate the endless ideological musings that ruin the flow of the whole story. This book is basically a rant that is anti abortion, pro religion, anti gun control, anti liberal (referring to politicians who levy taxes as wanting to 'suck the blood' out of the country's citizens), anti Clinton, and so on. Mr. Clancy, you need to stick to what you do best. Hint: it's not politics.Oh, and by the way, the language in this book is unnecessarily foul. Tom Clancy seems to be caught in the same trap as Stephen King, thinking that coarse, sexually-explicit language is a way to build up the characters in his story. He seems to use this to try to make his characters appear to be 'regular guys'...and fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I've read all of Clancy's books, excluding the paperback series.

The remaining 50% is divided between moralizing and strutting his knowledge of international and military affairs. I've read his books for the great stories, and his moralizing leaves me feeling cheated and mislead. I don't want to pay for a book just to listen to his personal moral concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it. My arms got tired.","review":"1,000 pages?

He's a storyteller, and he has a history of being a good one.

Give it a miss and spend your money somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy needs an editor!","review":"This book is really long and rather tedious. Tom Clancy needs an editor! His attention to detail is really slipping. Here are two small examples: he describes the language of China as \\"Guoyu\\" which is what Chinese is called on Taiwan. In China, everyone calls it \\"putonghua;\\" he also mentions a U.S. Navy port call to Taipei. Taipei is not a port but is ten miles from the sea. Taiwan's main ports are Keelung and Kaohsiung. In general, Clancy appears to have never visited China and so describes a mainland culture that is sadly out of date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a cut above the rest","review":"Tom Clancy's latest is true to form. For diehard fans of JackRyan, John Clark and other Clancy characters, The Bear and The Dragon is a must read. Clancy flawlessly develops his intricate plot from multiple angles and the use of techno-speak is just enough to be factual without actually becoming an annoyance. The book is quite a long read at 1000+ pages, but its hard to put down nonetheless. Don't plan on buying it unless you have a little freetime! A couple minor criticisms arise from the several typo's I found while reading the book (editor's fault?) and a more racial slant in describing the villian of the book, China. While the Soviet villains of yesteryear's Clancy novels were easy enough to hate for their ideology and actions, I don't really find it necessary to throw in racial stereotypes to make a convincing villian. But, as I said, these are minor criticisms and I anxiously await another Clancy novel after devouring this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Effort","review":"In essence, if the reader has read Clancey's prior efforts, the reader has already read The Bear and the Dragon. It is time for Clancey to move on to a new theme or re-kindle his plot development skills shown in The Cardinal in the Kremlin.Sadly, each story line reaches a conclusion hundreds of pages after the conclusion is evident to the reader. This has not been the case in previous Clancey efforts.As to the publisher, it would be nice if they hired a proof-reader for Mr. Clancey's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"Somewhere in these 1,000 pages there is a decent 250 page book trying to get out. A sentence here, a paragraph there. The problem is that we gotta read the whole thing to get the little that is there. A wonderful job of padding by Mr. Clancey. And phew, do real people cuss as much as these guys do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan is back","review":"This is a good basic story, classic clancy, and a nice continuation of the Jack Ryan saga. Excellent use of existing trade and economic relationships to make the story and reality sync up. I think its the weakest of the group though, it reads as though it was written a chapter at a time, with some sloppy editing. Reading the same chunks of dialog used by the same groups of people 4-5 times in a row gets a bit distracting, and since this comes up several different times in clearly intended comments on contemporary politics, very tiresome as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst","review":"This was Clancy's worst book. Yeah, I didn't want to put it down - it was gripping - but it was wholly unsatisfying. It was simply too fanciful. The good guys got ALL the breaks (to a sickening extent) and the bad guys could do nothing right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, great book, topics and whole genre is real","review":"I do not understand why people say that Tom Clancy is making the whole China culture to be a bad guy, tell me something, if they were such a bad guy in this book, why did one member of the PRC made a apology to the United States and started working on making this ordeal in the book justified. This book, the Bear and the Dragon, is masterfully, skillfully written, superb sub-plots and plot, great telling of the the story, very realistic, and a very honorable read. I would recommend this book to all who likes Tom Clancy and has an interest what China and Russia is currently like right now. Some reviewers do not know what they are talking about when they downright bash this book, Clancies writing didn't declined in greatness, it heightened in greatness. One of his best books I or you will ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thought this was a good book. If I can read a 1028 page book in three weeks it has to be pretty good. I'd like to see more action with Ding and Clark though. They are two of his best characters. Ryan's choice for a VP was excellent and any true Clancy would agree. This isn't the greatest book he's ever written but it wasn't a bad one. Another good book is The Lion's Game by Nelson DeMille."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing instalment of Jack Ryan","review":"I'd loved all the other Jack Ryan stories I'd read (though I hadn't read all of them). This was a little too coarse and nowhere near as good as the earlier ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stupid book","review":"One of the most boring and stupid books I\`ve read in a long time. Full of ignorant remarks. From Mr Clancys observation that asian girls like westerners because they are better \\"equipped\\" than the asian males, via people saying Comrade Doctor etc to each other in Russia, ten years after the Soviet Unions fall, to the \\"fact\\" that american girls are slimmer and healthier than the rest of the world(when we know that they are sicker due to overweight than the rest of the world). Well, a writer can write about his white supremacy but when he writes as boring as Tom Clancy does in this book it gets completely uninteresting. Just pure typewriting and after 350 pages I had to give up. \\u0004 Yes, and I spell terrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a time machine?","review":"I am a fan of Tom Clancy, mainly for the TV game plotted by Tom, and I have spent tons of time on that. This is the first book I have read by Tom. But what a Disappointment! As a Chinese, all the details, scenes, and characters Tom written could be real, but not at a time of 2000, not even 1990. All the Chinese plots may be true 30 years ago when China was still under the control of \\"MAO.\\"This book simply reminds me the Chinese movies and books I watched and read when I was a boy in China. The time when every foreigner has one ugly face and on stupid mind.Tom simply surprised me that as a write who grew and educated in a free world, he is as stereotyped as those \\"Chicomm,\\" who are single minded, ignorant, and arrogant.What a joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terror at 1152 Pages","review":"Tom Clancy's magnum opus, The Bear and the Dragon (starring movie hero Jack Ryan), is rollicking good fun for about the first 400 or so pages. Around then, the rollicking fun subsides for a couple of hundred pages, but then - Whammo! - we are back in the action. It is a testament to clancy's skill as a thriller writer that he can write over one thousands pages and have most of them not ... . Some could say that this book lacks realism. I say, why look for realism in a Tom Clancy book. You're looking for action, adventure, detailed descriptions of weapons, stock military characters, and the president of the United States Jack Ryan kicking some serious international ... . That's why you read Tom Clancy. That's why I read Tom Clancy. And that's why you should read The Bear and the Dragon. Get to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Clancy novel yet","review":"I have to agree with the majority on this one, I wondered whether actually wrote this book! The repetitive dialogue, cliches, and profanity are not hallmarks of the earlier Jack Ryan dramas. In fact, Jack Ryan seemed different; does being President cause one to become profane, cynical, and less intelligent? Oh, yeah, I forgot...I think Clancy needs a hiatus to reclaim the essence of writing about techno-political issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bore and the Drag On","review":"Good Grief, it takes nearly seven hundred pages to get going! It is too long and drawn out, not nearly as clear and concise as it could be. How many times must we hear President Ryan refer to his wife as \\"Babe\\", enough already. It is time to develop new characters, Ryan has lost his fire! He is no longer an interesting character. Tom Clancy- start fresh with new characters please!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the old Clancy?","review":"I think that Tom Clany is either over the hill, or just not working hard anymore. There was a point in his career where i loved nothing more than to be reading one of his books. But now, he makes everybody so wimpy. Where are Ding and Clark???? In my opinion his two strongest characters, they are left behind in the field!!!!!I want the old Clancy, or i want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"unBEARable and DRAGsON","review":"Give the Chinese a break. I found Clancy's redundant attacks on Chinese views and policies to be offensive. As a subway reader, I felt compelled to put a brown paper cover over the book to hide what I was reading. Sounds hypocritical but I kept hoping there was a point to the China-bashing. (There wasn't!)As an aficionado of Clancy's action writing I continued on with the book; however, I was dishearted at the often repeated paragraphs that were anti-Chinese. It appeared to be more a book on what Tom likes and doesn't like. Maybe Tom needs to travel abroad a little bit more.Villains should be people not countries. Find a bad person in a country's heirarchy and make us hate HIM. Readers can't hate the entire country!And finally, have someone proof your books for consistency and repitition, this book could have been reduced two to three hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy in his twilight...","review":"If someone had attended a creative writing course and was given an assignment to write a 'Clancy-esque' military-thriller but had then decided to turn it into a parody or 'literary-caricature', they would have ended up with 'The Bear and the Dragon'. It was ponderous, predictable and way too long. It took me less than a week to finish my library copy but then I would speed read past the tedious sections (which was frequent). Eric Harry did a much better treatment of the subject in either 'Arc Light' or 'Protect and Defend' and he went so far as to actually take out DC with a nuke in the first one, something that I think most readers were rooting for especially after Ryan does his idiotic Clint Eastwood routine with the aegis cruiser as the warheads are falling. Also, Clancy has quite a set of double standards considering that he broke up his marriage through infidelity. I guess his Ryan universe is a 'do what I say, not what I do' kind of place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Starting at the end... (Careful, gives ending away...)Communist nuke ICBM land on Wash DC, but no-harm no-foul. Clancy then writes to justify how the the communist leadership is not responsible for this 'mistake', and everyone on 'our side' can be a hero, and feel good. Bad joke?This book is a bad joke right from the beginning. I agree with some of the other low ratings posted on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A racist piece of junk","review":"Bought the book in a used-book sale a few years ago, and thought I'd finally read it. Too much narrative, not much dialogs. But I kept reading it until the author starts to write about the Chinese, and then I skimmed it to find more ignorant and racist remarks, some of those came out from the mouth of Jack Ryan, a character I'd liked before. I don't think I'm going to read another book by Tom Clancy. As for this one, it is not worth the 50c I paid and belongs to the trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not done, but so far so good","review":"This is actually a response to Easy To Put Down. If this is to be your first Clancy book, DO NOT buy this. This is the newest book of the John Ryan series. Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, Sum Of All Fears, Debt Of Honor, Executive Orders all come before this book. If you pick up Bear and the Dragon, you will be lost, and bored like that guy. So do yourself a favor and read those books first, and you will then understand what is going on, and who the characters are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Clancy's usual standards","review":"Same old, same old. I could tell what was going to happen, who does what to whom, at every step in the story...I can even predict when Ryan will say \\"I hate this job\\".Where are the rebels in uniform, the kooky scientists, the hateful politicians, and even the journalists in this 1000+ re-hash of the 3 previous books.Don't spend your money. If you have to have it, wait for the paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Clancy years ago, right after The Hunt for Red October caught the country by storm. I liked his book and his writing. I have read almost all his books, the paperback techno thrillers are trash, and it only took 3 of them to convince me he was getting paid for his name and not his talent. His latest book has some good ideas but he gets lost delivering the material with bizarre subplots that had no meaning on the story. It is like he is getting paid by the pound for his work. This book could have been done in 600 pages and it would have been a page turner, instead it was 1000+ pages of yawner in some spots. This book was worse than Rainbow Six which was pure manure, because it could have been a good book. Rainbow Six started with the impossible and continued to get more unbelievable on every page. At least this book has some interesting ideas, but his delivery of the material to the public missed by a long shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Clancy Ever","review":"I don't read Tom Clancy books and expect writing like John Le Carre, but this one is a new low in Hardy Boy like prose. It also features a lot more of the worst written character in American fiction, his pal Robbie. Every scene this guy is in makes me cringe with embarssment that Clancy is actually trying to pawn him off as a real human. Boy's Life magazine has more real sounding dialog. If I had to read once more about \\"fighter jocks strapping an F-14 on their backs\\" (which we had to hear about, verbatim, at least five times) I was going to puke. Oh, and can you imagine a Tom Clancy love scene? Don't. I have enjoyed Tom Clancy books immensely over the years, and might again, but the next one will wait till it's out in paperback, if there is a next one. Maybe he just cranked this one out to pay for his divorce."},{"rating":"1","title":"A average Book by Tom Clancy's standards","review":"I cannot help but feel disapointed at the standard of Tom Clancy's latest novel- \\" the Bear and the Dragon\\" I feel that he keeps repeating himself and the ending of the novel is too sudden. Its almost as if he wrote the novel and then decided its getting too long or he had something better to do and finished it off suddenly. Considering his other novels, this is of a low quality. Looks like the author is getting complacent with his fame and cannot be bothered with his novels anymore. After all, he has many other \\"co-writers\\" who use his name to sell their novels-\\"op-centre\\" series comes to mind. Tom should not lower his standards just to produce novels under his name. If he cannot be bothered writing a quality novel HIMSELF, he should not write any. It would only harm his reputation and disapoint his readers/fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, vulgar","review":"At over a thousand pages this book is tedious, even for the verbose Clancy. Profanity abounds, as does sex, neither for any useful purpose except to add pages. Three or four hundred pages could be deleted and not affect the story. Even when the story finally gets interesting in the last quarter of the book, it is not up to Tom Clancy standards. The war is too simple and too easy. The American techno-whiz-bang makes the whole thing a \\"no contest\\". While American technology really is amazing, to believe that there would be virtually no casualities is not believable. The few American losses appear to have been thrown in at the last minute. We just shot down 60 Chinese airplanes? Hmmm, maybe the good guys should lose a plane, too! Definitely not up to the quality of his early works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been another exciting read BUT...","review":"Having read all of Tom Clancy's books in chronological order, I have always been inclined to ignore his blatantly extreme conservative views for the sake of getting an exciting story in return... these huge novels were always a nice read on the beach, at least.In \\"Bear & Dragon\\" though, Mr. Clancy's right-wing outlook on life has gone completely over the top. His repetitive mentioning of those disgusting \\"tree-huggers\\", \\"chinks\\" and \\"rats\\" really turned me off, as did his boring excessive macho talk and two-dimensional view of the female gender. Also, I couldn't help to notice that Mr. Clancy all at once seems to be fascinated by having his main characters use the bathroom... no problem with that basically, but his fixation on nature's call wore kind of thin by the time I reached page 300 or so.On top of that, poor editing (John becomes Jack) and stereotyped characters spoil much of the reading fun that this book could have provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist, patronizing, uniformed and soooo boring","review":"There is little to add here that hasn't been said by hundreds of other reviewers. I cannot see how anyone could enjoy reading any of this. Of all the different bad points, I think that TC's absurd, uninformed and racist fantasies about China in 1999 (or 2000?) were the most outrageous. To sum it up: poor literary style, poor editing, poor plot, poor dialogues, poor research, poor knowledge, poor readers, and a very rich author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action: OK, Politics: Lousy","review":"Mr. Clancy changed genres from technical/military to political thriller a couple of books ago. As a result his political thriller contains lots of - semi - military jargon and action. It must be said this side of the book is OK (not splendid as the \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin\\" or \\"Red October\\", but OK). However, the political part of this 1080 page book is unfortunately not op to standards: the issues have not been thought through enough to be convincing. And though some solutions could be tempting (some problems are irresolvable if all issues are taken into account), most are a mere waste of time.Another problem I have with this series is the decline in the language quality (techno talk and an overdoses abbreviations was always a part of this series, but the current level is having an impact on the readability.I would like to suggest Mr. Clancy to stop solving the problems of the world with this series and let Mr. Ryan rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"writing is ok but story is boring and stupid","review":"just another one of clancy's \\"could happen\\" stories that could never happen. he is obviously talented at writing but his ideas and stories are so boring and pointless. some of his stories like the op center series and rainbow six are alright, but stories like these are trite and shouldn't even be considered \\"thrillers\\" they should be put together nostrodomous's [ideas] and labeled as wild prognastications. if you are looking into police or government books, i suggest you look into rainbow six and op center series. some of his earlier novels such as the hunt for red october is ok too"},{"rating":"1","title":"its totally not vanilla","review":"what a complete let down. after reading rainbow six, my first clancey novel, i was tempred by this one. bad move.in rainbow six at least there was enough action to laugh at the endless repition of cliches and sermonising.its a long uphill struggle to get to the end, when the action actually starts about 1000 pages in, it makes for the biggest possible let down.About halfway through you get to the point where you dread any piece of the story involving jack ryan or numerous other characters as you just know its going to be more ultra right wing sermonising which youve read already enough times before the end of the first chapter. the book would have been improved considerably by complete omission of jack ryan. what tom clancey needs is a good editor, and some respect for the intelligence of his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"Tom Clancy's first book, \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" was probably the best and most scientifically accurate books of its genre. Clancy's grasp of military technology and tactics is close to that of a professional soldier and this shows in his books. However his undestanding of cultures and international politics is probably inferior to that of a redneck. When he sticks to writing military books Clancy is quite all right. This time he went too far into geo-politics thereby showing a dangerous ignorance which I hope is not shared by most Americans. The result is an implausible, racist book which tarnishes Tom Clancy's reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to put down","review":"This was my first Clancy book and was very easy to put down.

The problem with that is it implies that Clancy \\"worked\\" and that conclusion is doubtful. Many reviewers have noted that \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is full of repitition, that Clancy repeats himself, says the same thing again and again. Others have noted that Clancy is becoming too \\"preachy.\\" All of this is true.So, only read this novel of you are a true Clancy fanatic; otherwise, re-reading \\"Red October\\" or \\"Without Remorse\\" would be more rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"is clancy a has been?","review":"There is no question Clancy sees himself as a patriotic american. he has proselytised the great american values in all of his works. and I agreed with them in most occassions. I have always thought he makes a legitimate point weather I agreed with him or not. the latter is simply because he uses facts to back up all this points. this book, however, strays from his usual facts based arguments. I find his points on international free trade to be shallow and inaccurate and his knowledge of China next to nothing. I have not finished reading this book and I must say deviations from facts make this a very daunting task. as a result, I must ask, is clancy a has been?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Going, Going, ... what next?","review":"I have had enormous pleasure reading (and re-reading) the offerings by TC over the last decade. I was hooked with the HFRO movie with Connery & it led me to Red Storm Rising, which was an excellent 2nd offering. Over time I have looked forward to each TC book, the pinacle being Executive Orders. Since Executive Orders, TC seems to be putting out books under some oppresive contractural obligation. B&D is his worst. Little character development, implausible plot, and an ending that has made me wonder whether TC has lost his passion, will now make me think twice before I put out $$$ for his next hard cover. I'll probably buy his next book but only because it woud be difficult to get any worse. I hope TC recognises that what he started all of those years ago with Jack Ryan has resulted in an enormous responsibility to his devoted readers. His only saving grace recently was being sent up on the Simpsons --- but then, an Icon is an Icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHATS UP WITH CLANCY?????????","review":"I've read all of Clancy's books and the last few have become slow reading bores. I use to wait with eagerness for his next book. After attempting Bear which I gave up within 250 pages, i'm threw with him. TO LONG, TO BORING! Let him teach @ Annapolis or West Point or Harvard but his fiction is so bad compared to Hunt for Red October or Clear and Present Danger. I just hate his books have developed into a insomniacs cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It started off well, but the finish was flat. Clancy concentrated on numerous \\"dead end\\" sub-stories that eventually became irrelevant, and cut off other that looked as though they would have been quite substantial and enjoyable for the reader. I would have liked to have spent more time with the Chinese and Russian field commanders, instead of trapsing around Moscow and St. Petersburg. Clancy did an excellent job of describing hyper-war, but would have done better to add a few \\"survivng witnesses\\" to the destruction to add some color. This is the first Tom Clancy book that I wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Has anyone else noticed that Mr. Clancy loses a half a star with each new book? And it seems each book gets many pages longer as well. And how can they not when there are so many references to Golokov holding a gun to Ryan's head and other inane self-promoting marketing jabs for his past books? Honestly, 1000 pages of lukewarm, mundane, blase storylines, Mr. Clancy's own interpretation of historical events, and finally 28 pages of a climax you could have predicted on page 792, but still had to read another 200 pages to get to. It wasn't enough in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor considering past performances...","review":"First off, I'm a huge Clancy and Techno thriller fan. However, I found this book long and very un realistic. Do we need to know how much Ryan hates his job over and over? The US would do nothing after a Nuclear missle attack? Probably not. Fang would go talk to the people at the end of the book? Talk about a change of character from the beginning of the book. Was all the \\"sausage\\" talk necessary? Run out of bombs? Why were we not using B-1B's? B-2's All of this equipment could strike at China's forces from the beginning? Ever heard of in flight refueling? We do it all the time? Cruise missles? F-22's?I was totally disappointed with this book. Normally it is much more difficult to find discreptencies from reality in his books? As another review said wait for clearance or get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again!","review":"I couldn't finish the last Clancy book and this one is hopeless. Just hundreds of pages of research by his staff, I'm sure and no story. Plus it bears NO resemblance to what really goes on in the White House. I will not buy the next novel from Mr. Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Racist, Right Wing Dribble.","review":"I bought this book understanding that Clancy is just to the right of Attila the Hun, however he can write an incredibly tight techo-military thriller. Unfortunately, I had to wait until almost the end of the book before Clancy hit his stride. The rest of the book was right-wing, racist, xenophobic dribble. Clancy's knowledge of China and Chinese culture is totally MIA. Buy his earlier works, if you want, but stay away from this misguided tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bear and the Dragon (Jack Ryan)","review":"Tom Clancy is one of my husbands favorite authors, with the 4 for 3 sales thatAmazon.com puts on ANYONE can afford to fatten their reading library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor effort","review":"As a previously devout Clancy fan, I found this book to be boring, excessively sexist, racist, and a complete waste of my time. It was so bad I vowed to never again buy a Clancy book. If you liked Hunt for Red October or Cardinal of the Kremlin, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed attempt to continue the Jack Ryan series","review":"I've been a fan of the Jack Ryan series but this one is surely a dissapointment. The main problem is Tom Clancy's ignorance of China. If only he has been to China in the recent years, he will find things vastly different than he depicted. Instead he depicted China the same as Russian in the 70s which makes the novel looks much less real and repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"If you are a seasoned Clancy reader you will enjoy this book. A new reader of the author may have trouble with its length and style. As with most of his books it is a plot that is feasable. Many of previous character are back, such as Nomuri from Debt of Honor. If you are a Clancy fan, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same Tom Clancy???","review":"Is this the same Tom Clancy as the one who wrote such great books as \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin\\", \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" and \\"Debt of Honor\\"? I don't think so. I was very disappointed in this, even more disappointed than I was with \\"Rainbow Six\\". I wonder about a Pen Writer on this and the last. Come on, Tom, give us back the old Jack Ryan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Clancy has reached his bottom in this book, which he uses merely as a pulpit for his political/saocial preachings. The plot is thin and not plausible, the characters are stiff and unreal, and the language is stilted and meaningless in many places. He uses his word of the day several times in a few pages, then it disappears. Don't bother. I read 200 pages, then quit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked.","review":"If you have to read this book, borrow it from a friend or wait until it is in papperback, don't waste any more money than you have to. Clancy has become lazy or has a poor ghost writer. Perhaps it's a lazy, poor ghost writer. Either way, the book is a let down full of repetition, dogma, and typoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring repetitions and foreign bashing","review":"I have read several of Tom Clancies books. His best was before he turned into book and PC game packages. This book is terribly long but is full of repetition (paid by the word?) and a LOT of foreign bashing. I mean, I would be inclined to think that TC is xenophobic.The book is nothing but a lame \\"confidence booster for americans\\". I have even skipped whole pages but now that I am mostly bed ridden for a few days it was the only book I had at hand so I had to go on reading it or face getting even more bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"If you like Clancy, I think you'll really like this book. It does start out a bit slow, and it is a bit difficult to follow in the beginning. But if you can stick with it for 5 or 6 chapters, the book really starts to drag you in. At about 30% into the book, It is hard to put down. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete junk","review":"This book is complete junk. Very little research must have gone into this book. It is almost as if Tom Clancy decided to stop writing books but the publishers wouldn't let him. The characters have very little depth and the book reads like the script of a b-grade movie. A huge fall for this once great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I enjoyed the parts detailing the military and special forces operations but was less interested in his political ramblings, probably because he knows much more about the former than the latter. I could be wrong but he seems to inject quite a bit of his own politics into those sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"loooooong, boring and repetitive.","review":"this book took so long to write, that clancy forgot things he wrote and repeated it in the following chapters over and over.He takes you on a journey of all, and i mean ALL that goes on in the characters heads, and there are whole chapters that you could skip and not lose the thread of the story.And then there is POTUS, he can do no bad, he is a saint, he knows what to do and the right time to do it, hes got to be the most flawless character of any book i've ever read, and by that i mean hes just never wrong and he could teach a thing or two to the pope about morality, iv'e enjoyed all of clancy's books, but this one just [stinks]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"This tome shows multiple writing styles which begs the question: How many ghostwriters compiled this book? I've about given up on Clancy for any character development. Rainbow Six and The Bear and the Dragon show the same pitiful unidimensional characters. The conclusion was obvious, predictable and unsatisfying.For a good read, go back to the classics: Red Storm Rising is still his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"This has got to be Clancy's literary version of color-by-numbers. The plot is far-fetched, while at the same time too thin. The characters are so well-developed from previous books that all we're left with is Jack Ryan's whining about how he's not right/adequate/suited for the job of president. And while I like Clancy's books, Ryan's philosophizing on subjects ranging from abortion to religion to government smack of the arrogance that Clancy often puts across in personal appearances. Puh-leeze, keep your views to yourself, willya? On top of that, the book was poorly edited, with typos (excusable) and recurring dialogue (inexcusable). To be fair, I read the first edition hard-cover, so maybe this has been corrected in the subsequent editions, but I doubt it. The author's and publisher's philosophy seem to be \\"ah what the hell, throw it out there, it'll make money\\". Come on, Clancy, you know you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarassment","review":"I have been a Clancy fan ever since \\"Hunt for Red October.\\" However, I will think long and hard before investing any of my time in another one of his books.The Bear and the Dragon reads more like a political lecture than a techno thriller. Clancy has managed to take previously well developed characters and and make them boring and downright irritating at times. As an added insult, much of the dialogue is openly and unnecessarily racist in nature.They say that the back third of this book speeds up and reads more like his earlier work. I wouldn't know - I threw it out in disgust half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man what a lousy book","review":"There are so many things wrong with this book that it is impossible to know where to begin. Besides the blatant racism and gaping plot holes the story is just boring. It is about a one sided victory against a militarily backward foe. Does this story sound familiar? I guess in that way it is somewhat realistic. What I find frightening about this book is not its depiction of a possible conflict for the U.S. Rather it is the discription of the leaders in Washington. If our current Secretary of the Treasury is as stupid as Clancy's Whinston we should all be very afraid. He displays a complete ignorance of little things like the meaning of a trade deficit. If our diplomats are as incompetant as Gant then we are certainly due for a major land war here soon. Please God let it not be so. Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not get my interest","review":"This is the first Clancy novel (and I've read most of them) that I could not finish...actually could not get started. May have been the beginning or simply the weight of the book at over 1100 pages. I switched to a Vince Flynn novel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?!","review":"I am an avid fan to TC's past work. I think every novel up to and including Executive Orders was fabulous. Rainbow Six was a drag and Bear & Dragon is UNREADABLE.I am reminded of a once incredible athlete who has played about two seasons past his prime. We see this all to often. Tom, please just retire rather than subject us to another one of these. As it stands, TC has gone from my buy the hardcover first week it comes out list to wait for the paperback. If the next one is this bad, he has squeezed his last penny out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't finish it","review":"I didn't like all the f-words he used even when it wasn't called for. I spent 3 yrs in the Air Force and worked in public until retirement and still think filthy talk is uncalled for to get your point over .LOOKS LIKE i WILL JUST HAVE TO QUIT READING HIS BOOKS.ijfishcatcher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it up Jack Ryan!","review":"Clancy does it again! While certainly not his best work, this one is in-line with not only the technology of the times, but also with the politics of the time. China breaks out as the real villain in this continuing saga of Jack Ryan and one thread of potential history. Like every Clancy novel, this can be read cover to cover at least once, then reread as an abridged version - just picking out the action parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy's best book yet","review":"What an incredible book. Even though this book was over 1000 pages it didn't have a dull moment. It also had an ending that will leave you breathless.Also recomended: Blood Covenant By Douglas De Bono. If you like Clancy You'll love De Bono"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy books are too long","review":"This may be the last Clancy book I read, and I've read all of them so far. I want books to beg to be read. Clancy goes into such minute detail about military matters that are not needed that it is becoming a chore to get to the end of the book. I get the feeling that he really wants to write military books, or to truely be military, but enough is enough.This book is over 1000 pages long. Take out the unneeded details (100's of pages) and the excessive bad language and you would have a good readable bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ole, Same ole","review":"I had really high hopes for this book. Before it came out I knew that it was supposed to have Clark AND Ryan in it, and thought it had great possibilities.However, it just didn't deliver.The language is atrocious compared to earlier books. Clancy must have spent the last few years in the gutter learning how to talk.I really got the feeling that Clancy must be out of new ideas.The book started with the concept of Red Storm: A country goes through a calamity and decides to invade another and take what they want.Then, he delved into the area of Executive Powers and spent a long time talking politics, and ended with a small blitzkrieg.Yawn. I'll test his next book via the library before spending my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can get through the first 900 pages it ain't bad","review":"Just finished it and threw it on the stack of the rest of my clancy collection. Looks to be the thickest one yet, although the stories have changed from \\"techno-thrillers\\" to Tom Clancy's view of the politicians of the world. He devotes hundreds of pages to setting up a storyline which is blown through in just a few pages. All and I found it disapointing, longing for the days where Jack Ryan was a small character and Jon Clark wasn't an old grandfather. I think there needs to be a new story line, his first books weren't so closely sequenced, and quite frankly a lot more enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't get fooled again...","review":"Wow, where to begin. How about \\"Wish I hadn't blown $17 plus shipping on this book\\"?I have been a loyal reader of Clancy's books from the beginning. Even suffering through dreck like Executive Orders and Rainbow Six; but this is it - probably the last Clancy book I'll purchase.The editing and the plot are weak: I present Exhibit A: numerous inane turns of phrase hammered mercilessly to death, and Exhibit B: completely implausible techie tricks upon which the whole plot hinges.Memo to Tom: \\"Woulda been prudent to quit after The Sum of all Fears or perhaps Without Remorse\\". And lose the Navy ball-cap. Can you say \\"Wannabe\\"?Clancy (and editors) obviously believe that readers (such as myself) will buy any piece of junk he publishes. My recommedation: If you really need a Clancy fix, go read The Cardinal and the Kremlin again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity There's not a ZERO Star Category","review":"Turgid, tepid, tautological, terrible. Predictable, profane, putrid. Chauvanistic, racist and reactionary claptrap by a Clancy who has exceeded his use-by date. Success has obviously bred contempt for his readers. Thank goodness it was a present - it's only unfortunate that my son wasted his money on this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's previous works. I was disappointed with this one. Previous reviewers have expressed my views up very well: this book is repetitive, polemical, self-indulgent and *way* too long. Disabling the cut-and-paste ability of Mr. Clancy's word processor would have improved this novel greatly.Is Mr. Clancy really writing these novels anymore, or has he sold the franchise? It is difficult to believe that this is the same author who wrote 'Hunt for Red October' and 'Red Storm Rising'. The poor editing of late makes me wonder if the credit for these earlier should really go to Mr. Clancy's editors of the time.I deeply regret buying this book. I won't buy his next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Have read all of the Jack Ryan and/or John Clark books and enjoyed most of them immensely. This latest, however, was a major disappointment. It continues to pull down a formerly refreshing character. I understand that reality does not always present us with perfect heroes and Jack Ryan previously was probably a bit too good to be true. I am sorry to see a character I liked becoming far more crude with each of the latest books. The Ryan character (and the personal character he exhibited) used to pull me through a lot of the technical material that went somewhat over my head. No longer. I will not likely purchase any future novels by Mr. Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Tom Clancy really write this?","review":"... or was it one of the net force writers? I loved the first 7 books in this series, so I tried one of the Net Force stories (Tom Clancy's XYZ, written by John Q Doe). I hated it. The story was ok, but the writing, which distinguishes, or at least used to distinguish, Clancy from other authors in this genre, was mediocre at best. Which made sense - Clancy didn't write it.The Bear and the Dragon leaves me with this same bad taste in my mouth. You'll find an unusual expressions uttered by one character and then repeated by a different character whithin pages of the first utterance, but then never again. Swear-words fly at an ungodly rate and temper tantrums are frequent (in general the characters are represented as too volatile to be believable.) And the really sad thing is, the book is a chore to read. Too much build-up, too little execution.I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repugnant","review":"I found this book to be terrible. I am fan of Tom Clancy ever since reading Red Storm Rising and Hunt for Red October over a decade ago.This book seems to have no basis in reality at well. His description of China and its people are off the wall. It is obvious that Tom Clancy has never been to China or interacted with its people based on this book. I have been to China about 8 times in the last year and visit places as varied as Beijing to Guangdong to Kaifeng to Suzhou to Shaolin.Tom Clancy has this distorted view of China..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Just awful.","review":"If one wanted to read Mr. Clancy's views on everything from Social Security to proper discourse between nations in the new world order, then this is the book for you. If you already follow news or get a daily paper and don't feel like being preached to for eight or nine hundred pages, then move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Stinks!","review":"I used to love Tom Clancy as an author. I waited months to get my copy of the Bear and the Dragon. I even went to a bookstore across the street from my job, stood in a long line and got Mr. Clancy to sign my copy. After reading about 190 pages or so, I threw the book, with autograph, in the trash. This was one of the worst books that I have ever opened. The profanity, vulgarity and explicit sex scences were too much for me. I could also mention the typos and the strange languge, i.e., \\"honey-bunny.\\" This was not a good book! I am sure that some could argue that I should have completed the book before I formed his opinion. Believe me, I tried. However, when Mr. Clancy had Mary Pat use a vulgar four letter term for the male sex organ, I knew I was through. This was the third time the term had been used. Needless to say, this is my last Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Tom Clancy novel ever","review":"I WAS a big Tom Clancy fan until I read this book. His last couple of books have been getting less gripping and readable, but this sets a new standard for poor writing. It is just plain bad--and very boring. He must now publish books without an editor--there is a lot of repetition (like every scene between Jack and Arnie) and other scenes just go on endlessly. He used to have a lot of good detail that used to make any poor writing more palatable--and actually one of the great, distinct items of Tom Clancy's books, but now he has also gotten lazy. There are some hints of interesting classified information, but Tom must have lost all of his contacts in the government and has replaced this detail with horrible caricatures of foreigners and his biased political views. Time is better spent re-reading Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and Cardinal of the Kremlin. Do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply underwhelming","review":"The last time I tried to read a Clancy book, I put it down half way through it, never picked it back up; finally gave it to a friend who wasn't able to read it either. This book is about the same way - i'm into it about 250 pages and it is BORING, BORING, BORING. I can't think of anything good to say, so i'll stop here. I won't waste my money again buying another Tom Clancy hardcover. He goes on the list with Patricia Daniels Cornwell and Ann Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never finish this book","review":"I was disappointed when the publication date of this long awaited book was delayed. I am now sorry that I ever bought it. I have read all of Tom Clancy's books but this one. I have had it for over a month and am on page 100. It is filled with rambling drival. Jack Ryan shouldn't have run for reelection. I do not think that I will ever buy a hardback of a new Clancy again. Paperbacks will have to come from the half price store. This appears to be the sad end of a brilliant writing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Very disappointing, in fact. First of all, this book is HUGE and you need a notepad handy at all times, in order to be able to follow the plot. I agree that the book sounds like a family reunion, but what the heck happened to Jack Ryan? From a believable and likable guy, he became a foul-mouthed wimp! I am sure that POTUS does not need to use language like that to get his message accross. As far as the ending goes, what happened? It looks like TC ran out of paper/memory/patience and just stopped. Or he decided to end our misery?This is not even close to his previous books. A thoroughly disappointing read, especially to all Jack Ryan fans, who anxiously waited to see what happened next."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bore and the Dreadful","review":"This not as much a review as it is a warning.The Bear and the Dragon is by far the worst book Clancy has ever written. Rainbow Six could be excused by being in reality a backstory for a computergame, but this is supposed to be a novel. Now Clancy has never been an expert user of metaphor, simile, charcterization or even grammar (I'm neither, but then I'm not a native speaker) but he's always been worth reading because of his knowledge of politics, technology, military and his intelligent plotting.This is sorely lacking in this novel. The Sum of all Fears was the best Ryan book - The Bear and the Dragon is the worst and hopefully last. 800 pages of boring build-up to 200 pages of predictable warfare. Throw in some old friends, some small twists and a bit of Rainbow Six and you have this book.If you enter all of Clancys books into a computer, and ask it to write a new Jack Ryan novel, The Bear and the Dragon would be the result. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrub/Clancy 2000! - Ugh, a cluster...er, nevermind...","review":"I'm beginning to think that Clancy is this century's Jonathan Swift - that Jack Ryan and his surrounding story is a skeleton that Clancy hangs his political rants on. I get tired of the endless anti-abortion, right-wing demagoguery that has been slowly filling up his books and accelerated with Executive Orders and Rainbow Six. He's a good storyteller who has let his politics poison his books... because the political/social rants REALLY - really - slow down the story.Are there any editors with guts anymore? 200 pages could have been cut from this book with no ill effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disapointment","review":"I travel frequently to Bejing and the decriptions in this book are prefect.....If you were there 10 years ago. how much trouble would it have been to fly to Bejing and actually look around??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic","review":"After a long list of right wing idiocy. Clancy has frankly outdone himself with over 1000 pages of a mindless, thoughtless, silly monstrosity. Appealing to lovers of cheap tricks over realism. This is populist trash at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I'm a Clancy fan, have read all of his books, and \\"Without Remorse\\" is perhaps my favorite book. But if the Jack Ryan series continues this way, I'm going to have to stop reading. There is entirely too much time spent on the technical detail, with very little character development.Now that Jack Ryan is president, he isn't an underdog, which was the basis of his appeal and heroism. And frankly, there is too much political opinion included with Ryan as president. If I wanted to read about political debate on issues such as gun control and abortion, I'd read the newspaper or watch \\"Meet the Press\\" or some other news program. I read for entertainment, and Clancy's Ryan series has been getting less entertaining in the past few installments.Unless you are a diehard Clancy fan, save your money for the paperback, or check this out at the library. And be prepared to be put to sleep by the technical details."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cowboy's view of China","review":"The sheer number of reviews should alert the potential reader that there is something seriously wrong with this book.In it, Jack Ryan changes from an expert in foreign affairs, to a bumbling xenophobic fool, who through his negligent refusal to so much as listen to advice on basic psychology or intercultural relationships, manages to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war.The first 800 pages of the book are a litany of the most disgusting racial vilification that I have ever read, diluted with a mixture of nauseating self-righteous hypocrisy and calls to arm primary school children.Mr Clancy manages to demonstrate a staggering ignorance of China, its people, culture, language, history, and even geography. The linguistic errors, at least, are somewhat understandable. He would have been too ashamed to ask a native speaker to proof-read the manuscript."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Somewhere in this book there is a plot of about 100 pages, surrounded by 900 pages of the worst writing I have ever seen. I don't expect much in the way of characterization or poetry in a Clancy book, but I do expect at least some effort to put together a grammatical sentence. This reads like a first draft, and not a very good one at that. The tortured use of compound and complex sentences was very distracting. I finally got through this book by skipping all the long lectures and going right to the action. And I am neither a prude nor a follower of the cult of political correctness. Nonetheless, the last two words of this novel were as offensive as anything I have ever read. What a major disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"First, if you are an english teacher, DO NOT read this book. I'm afraid that you will mark most of it up with your red pen. While they seem to have run it through the spell checker, the grammar checker failed miserably! There are incorrect words on every other page.Second, I have read ALL of Clancy's books. If you read \\"Red Storm Rising\\" you basically read this book. The USS... I mean PLA needs Oil, we team up with the Germa... I mean Russians to fight the Sovie... I mean Chinese and we use our brand new, secret, ultra high tech weapons to overcome incredible odds.So if I had a choice to read this or \\"Red Storm Rising\\" again, I would take \\"Red Storm Rising\\", it's a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One from Column A, One From Column B, ....","review":"This book was not written by Tom Clancy, it was compiled by Tom Clancy. All of the passages in this book comes from all of his previous Jack Ryan novels: there's a sub battle (aka Hunt for Red October), there's economic hardship associated with a country to cause a war (aka Red Storm Rising), there's a spy game (aka Cardinal of the Kremlin), there's a fear of nuclear attack (aka Sum of All Fears), and there are plenty of Rainbow references for you John Clark fans.The plot is completely predictable. If you want to skip to the action, begin reading at about page 750. Better yet, forget buying this book, read or re-read Red Storm Rising and subsitute China for the USSR."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Clancy, can it?","review":"I've been a fan of the Ryan series of Clancy's books for years and eagerly anticipate each new release. Loved the majority of them, including the recent 'Debt of Honor' and 'Rainbow Six'. I don't know what the heck happened here, but B&D falls so far short of the previous work that I can't believe it's Clancy's writing. I mean, do Mary Pat and Ed Foley really need to call each other 'honey bunny' 50 times throughout the book? Do I need to be continually reminded that Mao screwed 12 year olds? I think not. An RPG assassination and then nothing but boring diatribe on the Chinese and repetitive nonsense for the next 700 pages until the action begins. And then it's the usual 'Americans are invincible' Hollywood nonsense. No, I can't believe this is Clancy. I'm sure the next one will be better (right Tom?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too successful to edit??","review":"This book needed an editor to say \\"Great book, we just need to cut 400 or 500 pages of the first 800, beginning with the politics.\\" I am guessing when an author sells as many books as Clancy has, he can tell editors to shut up and publish it. It's too bad, because there is a good book somewhere in there. I actually agree with many of his political statements, but I don't need them repeated 10x in a fictional work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The introduction is much too long","review":"I like the books of Tom Clancy a lot. Thus far I've read all his books and would rate them 5 stars.However, in Rainbow Six, the introduction took about 300 pages. Since there were plenty of pages left, this is no problem.In the bear and the dragon the introduction (the endless talking) takes 800 pages! It was hard to keep on reading.The real action takes place in the remaining pages and ends very quickly. In this part it was hard to stop reading. This is the Tom Clancy I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Too long by half. Wooden. Repetitive. Un-fun. Other reviewers have said it all before me.I've decided that Clancy must've made a New Year's Resolution to crank out some number of pages per day on this one. Or, maybe he had a bet going with Stephen King to see who could make the most money with the least effort. Whoever won that bet, I know I lost by reading The Bear And The Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst Clancy I have ever read.","review":"The book is extremely lengthy, full of unnecessary sexual comments, and rubber-stretched passages. I found myself skipping entire pages. For me, beeing the biggest Clancy fan up to date it is really difficult to say that his work is bad, but every other book I have read was excellent-\\"The Debt of Honor,\\" \\"Executive Orders,\\" \\"Without Remorse,\\" to name a few, - but this book absolutely does not grab attention and what is even worse, annoys.Do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody awful...","review":"This book was the worst Clancy book ever. I'd almost be willing to say this book was the worst one I'd ever read. The only reason I finished it was because it was a Clancy book and I kept thinking it would get better. It seems that the end of the Cold War has dried up material for Clancy because this one was reaching for some straws. Although the battle at the end wasn't bad but it didn't really have any suspense, you knew the US with its mighty technology would triumph over China. This one will make me pause before I buy the next Clancy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"This is the most boring Clancy book I've ever read, and I've read all of them! Fully half the book is taken up getting to the point of the story, with constant references to how difficult (and boring) POTUS' life is, constant references to how important secrecy (not to mention Clancy's pet phrase \\"need to know\\") to all the players is, uncalled-for and cryptic FBI references to characters' nicknames (SWORDSMAN, SURGEON, who are these people??!!). I'm sorry, Clancy's early novels were very interesting and readable, but his recent work has become verbose and uninteresting. Why does Clancy find the need to explain every little detail of every minute situation (which most Americans can imagine anyway?)? I can't recommend buying this book, it's a waste of valuable reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy now has ghost writer","review":"After a long wait, the great day arrived and I got to bring home the newest Clancy thriller. What a disappointing waste of time. Great characters are brought back from the earlier books and given nothing to do. Subplots are started and then forgotten about. Dialogue is worse than that found in amatuer submissions to \\"Playboy\\" magazine. Mary Pat Foley would never waltz around calling her husband \\"hunny, bunny\\" at work. Clancy apparently is running some king of contest with a prize for the reader who can accurately tell him how many times he uses the words, p--s, d--k, f--k, s--t, et al. He also goes on endlessly about the Japanese/Anerican spook's love sausage. If Tom Clancy really did write this book, he has lost what made him a great writer of thrillers. If he didn't write it, he ought to sue whoever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK storyline but.....","review":"the writing and editing could use lots of work. Constant repetition of certain 'cute' phrases is tedious. I was especially annoyed by the overuse of Secret Service codenames. Blatant typos should have been caught by good editing. The characters are not developed at all, and the way that he writes about women is sophomoric. I do not need to know Clancy's political opinions about abortion, the military, feminists, or China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost his touch","review":"Clancy sure is getting dirty in his old age. A lot more focus on sex than I remember from any of his other books. I couldn't even bring myself to finish reading it since every page was filled with the f-bomb or some description of sex. I'm not sure if I even want to bother with Red Rabbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's Lowest Point","review":"As a reader who has purchased everyone of Clancy's books within days of hitting the shelves and finishing them days later, I must say that this is his worst. I still have yet to finish this one (page 700)and I am almost dreading going back to it. Call me crazy but I feel an \\"obligation\\" at this point to finish. His work has steadily declined. The inconsequential story lines seem to take forever to gel and I am getting tired of Jack's moral dilemnas and fustrations with being in the White House. This could be the end of Clancy as one of my must read authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop now!","review":"The quality of the Jack Ryan books has reached a new level of crapdom. I don't feel like reiterating the consensus opinions about this one but I feel like throwing all of my Tom Clancy books away now. He has let the quality of his writing hit new lows.This book has forced me to come forward and hopefully help those of you who are thinking of buying this one. I would have given you mine but I left it in the hotel room so the maid staff can enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"I have read all of Tom Clancy's books, but the Bear and the Dragon is just bad. 3 reasons made me not finish this book.1) Repeated harsh ethnic slurs against the chinese. How many times can you read \\"chink\\" \\"slant\\" or \\"barbarians\\" before one gets really offended. Makes me think that Clancy really doesn't like the Chinese. Never heard him talk about the Russians like that in his other books when they were the enemy.2) Clancy has made Ryan into a whining cry-baby. All he ever does is complain about government and the fact that people don't call him by his first name.3) Just plain boring.Sorry to say that this book not up to par with Clancy's other novels. I really enjoyed them all up to Rainbow Six, which I found to be only OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy Sells Out.","review":"The down hill slide Tom Clancy has begun continues. The Bear and Dragon, is arguably his worst work. It holds the potential to be great but fizzles in the end. Clancy has a problem writing for Jack Ryan character. The Plot continues where Executive orders stopped. But, Jack is constantly whinning and moaning that he is president. He ran for re-election didn't he? So it doesn't follow that J.R. seems so victimized. I have begun to think there actually was supposed to be a book in between this one and Exec. Orders. All Tom Clancy fans be warned. This book is a waste. Tom has sold out Jack Ryan for some cheap cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe abridged was a good choice","review":"Since The Bear and the Dragon was the first fiction audio cd I have listened to, I was worried that I wouldn't like an abridged story. It sounds like it was the better choice for this particular Clancy work though. From what other reviewers are saying, the hardcover was filled with repetitive minutaeu not really necessary to the storyline. I can't speak for the quality of the full hardcover novel, but as an abridged audio cd I thought The Bear and the Dragon was good, maybe even my second favorite Clancy story behind The Cardinal of the Kremlin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy going downhill","review":"I eagerly ordered the latest Clancy title with the expectation that I would be as entertained as with all of his previous books. Rainbow Six was gripping and I simply could not put the book down. This latest novel is dreadful and I was on page 528 when I realised I was utterly board with the turgid pace and style of prose. It picked up towards the end but finished in a cop-out manner. It would appear that this was written to simply meet a commitment with a publisher"},{"rating":"1","title":"ROFLMAO! What a joke!","review":"Oh, this was a waste of my money. I normally find Clancy's books to be, at the very least, DECENT, but this one was downright HORRID. It could not have been more trite! Of course, the US folks are ALL bright and brilliant Harvard grads, there's no such thing as a dumb American, (the closest being that Cliffy guy), according to this book. And all Chinese are stupid Commie morons. It's all so contrived... I mean, \\"Japanese sausage?!\\" ROFLMAO!! There's definitely a theme going on there... every American's got a surgeon for a wife, is decorated, or something. And the ethnic slurs, oh my goodness. While, I don't doubt that, if we were really involved in a war, slurs would be the norm, I think he carries it off VERY badly in this book, and so, it's just plain bad taste. And poor Jack Ryan. RESIGN, if you hate your job so much!To Mr. Clancy - better luck with your next book. At this rate, you'll need it :("},{"rating":"1","title":"The dragon ;and the bear","review":"I am 200 pages into the book. The development is slow. Reminds me of L Ron Hubbards Battle Field Earth, a 350 page book expanded into 1000 pages. I have bought all oof Clancy's books in hard copy, this may be the last if I finish this one. So far, very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Taut Thrillers to Dull Diatribes","review":"Clancy used to pen a good yarn, though his characters were always undeniably shallow. Loved his tech focus, the thoroughness of his research, and his ability to weave them together.However, Bear & Dragon continues his trend toward political pontification. I'm more interested in how the US acquires and acts upon intelligence gained in Asia than I am in Clancy's views on abortion and the environment. (I can always tune into Fox TV news for a dose of conservative dogma).Clancy has also fallen down on his research: his descriptions of life in China range from outdated to innaccurate to painfully uninformed. As a former resident of Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, I can say there was plenty of room for better research. And he could definitely spare his readers the racial slurs. It's obvious that Clancy, and all his characters, hate Asians. If he can't overcome that bigotry, he could keep it to himself. It would make for a far better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is more than spell check","review":"This could have been a great book, but unfortunately it isn't. I got very confused several times when I had to go back and figure out what he said because of the use of the wrong word. I think I found at least 15-25 instances of the wrong word being used, example week for weak. Come on didn't anyone read it before it went to the printer!!I hope the next one is better or its on to Dale Brown or Stephen Coonts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me Strategy and keep the Partisan Politics","review":"Don't get me wrong, I did read the latest book from cover to cover, and could not put it down. I did get tired of Jack Ryan's extra conservative political views. I guess it should be expected since he is Catholic and he is President now. I miss the old days when he could be a neutral player and a great good guy, but when he complains about evolution, abortion, and gay rights, I get kind of tired of it. I hope that the next book tones it down. There were pages that I skimmed right through, because they were boring details that did not add to the plot or excitement. I love TC books, but this was not anywhere near as good as W. Honor or Rainbow. I hope that the trend reverses itself and that I look forward to rereading his newer books as much as I do his older ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book too far !!!","review":"Clancy's beauty is his knowledge of technology. His descriptions of military hardware and its uses are the reason i read his books.He's become enamored with the spy business, much as W.E.B. Griffin did in his Semper Fi series. I really never did believe that the Marine Corps founded the CIA. If I want spies, I'll read Ludlum.Rainbow Six was bad, this book is punishment. Don't buy it and maybe Clancy will go back to what he knows. 800 pages of set-up for the war that everybody knows is coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy Has Lost The Touch","review":"Tom Clancy has finally run out of things to write. As a (past) Clancy lover, I believe I have every right to stand by that comment. His new book is nothing more than a platform for Clancy to mouth off his half-way thought through political ideas, most of which are unconstitutional. A big military power needing oil? Didn't we see that before? Character development? He completely relies on the development from past books. I can't IMAGINE what someone who has never read Clancy before thought of this. Editing? I wish I had written them down, but the amount of times he repeated lines, anecdotes, and so-called \\"military jargon\\" was absurd.I have never wasted so much time. The only reason I even finished the book was to keep with my philosophy that no book is so bad that it can't be finished. This book has made me wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long and Too Morally Preachy","review":"It's bad enough that Tom Clancy feel like he has to bring back every living character from his previous books and tell their story again but in this book he also dishes out his feelings on Bill Clinton and Abortion.If he could just have a few characters retire or maybe get killed in action he could cut out about 200 pages.Also it's so obvious that he is taking swipes at Clinton that it gets annoying. I'm not a Clinton fan either but enough is enough. Levae the morality out of it.Cardinal of the Kremlin is still the worst Clancy book but this one is down there with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unreadable","review":"As a long-time fan of Tom Clancy, I find myself incredibly disappointed with his latest offering, The Bear and the Dragon. Weighing in at just over 1,000 pages, the book is filled with page after page of \\"thoughts\\" as opposed to good, old-fashioned dialog-\\"thoughts\\" so replete with poorly written, misogynistic, right-winged conservative diatribes that it renders the book all but unreadable.I can't help but thinking that 1) Clancy has completely lost touch with the reality in which the rest of us live, and 2) the man is simply using his novels as a pulpit from which he can preach his views and beliefs. I encourage everyone to save their money and look elsewhere for a good thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bear and the Blowhard","review":"It's obvious that Tom Clancy now has the clout to overrule his editor on any changes, because this book has some serious, serious flaws, ones that could easily be fixed with a mouse and a delete key. I skipped past pages and pages that had nothing to do with the plot (like the pregnant FBI agent - yawn).This book had a lot more to do with Tom Clancy telling you about his feelings toward Jews, homosexuals, the media, the Washington establishment, beer, computers, services other than the Navy, law enforcement, you name it. Cut out the dialogue and you'd have the Republican platform.I'd suggest checking this book out from the library and reading pages 1-~150 and then skipping to about pg. 800."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read the other reviews before wasting my money","review":"I bought this book with great anticipation as I am (or was) a great Clancy fan, having bought ALL of his previous books. What a let down! Clancy is trying to be something that he obviously isn't. He tries to over-build his characters (one whole page of a character's thought processes is not uncommon - of course, liberally laced with vulgarities. he should leave the pseudo-literature work to the experts). I am appalled at his blatant stereotyping of China (fried panda penises? People in Mao suits roaming the streets? pleassseee...have you, Mr Clancy, visited China lately?). His writing borders on bigotry and perhaps crosses the line into racism. Ahh...the quintessential American right-wing cheer-leader, advocating hegemony; unabashedly ethnocentric. George W. would have been proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Somewhat Offensive","review":"This book is a only a shadow of the quality and storytelling ability that we have previously come to expect from Clancy.Contrary to many of Clancy's other works, this book demonstrates little or no understanding of China and even begs the question of whether the author has ever visited or indeed spoken to anyone who has visited China within the last 10 years.Even after factoring the necessity for atmosphere and a certain realism in dialogue, this book is clearly bigoted and racist in its treatment, description and characterization of the Chinese in addition to being factually flawed.I have enjoyed at least six of Clancy's previous books, however the Author seemed to be merely going through the motions to make some money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put Away the Word Processor","review":"Sadly, Tom Clancy has discovered that his word processor makes it possible to keep cranking out words that don't tell a good story. Maybe if he had to re-type all that stuff he would be more selective. There may be a good 300-page book hiding in there but I kept losing track of characters, plot lines and any semblence of sustained suspense. In fact, along about mid way I realized I didn't care what happened to any of the people. Tom, get youself a really good editor and pay attention. Your writer's hubris has caused you to become a charicature of yourself. I give it one star because it took a lot of work -- mostly wasted -- to write a book so long for such small purpose. Maybe that's worth something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom: Find a good editor -- SOON!","review":"This is an example of a good first draft. TC needs to find a good editor and streamline the story. B&G is at least 200 pages too long. The dialog is trite and adolescent...not worthy of the adults in the story. If TC wants to advance his political agenda, he should involve himself in politics. But to make his characters his voice is boring after awhile, and ultimately useless, because I skip over those parts. The Jack Ryan of Red October would slap Jack Ryan of B&G for whining so much.It would serve a better purpose to write 200-300 pages of an encyclopedia of characters and events. I didn't have the luxury of re-reading the last five TC books to prepare for B&G, so I missed out on some of the references. At the very least, use a few pages of the current novel to tell us where and how we first met these characters.The last 200 pages -- the battle -- are standard, enjoyable, Clancy. If you can survive the first 800 pages, then you have earned your treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elaborate plot with good execution","review":"Seems like every Clancy novel is getting more elaborate and therefore longer. While I found that the characterizations aren't that deep in The Bear & The Dragon, Clancy spends a lot of time on the main plot, which is concerning China's desire to rule the world and how they might go about accomplishing it. Also, Clancy spends a lot of time on subplots and overall the story is well executed. I didn't like the excessive use of foul language which is absolutely unnecessary and it spoiled the book to some degree. Anyway, reading this Clancy is an experience. Another new thriller that features a possible China world domination scenario, but is faster paced than Clancy, and it is a very informative book, although it's plenty of entertaining, is the loaded action thriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LONG WAIT FOR NOTHING.","review":"DEAR MR CLANCY,I HAVE READ ALL YOUR BOOKS, AND I AM A GREAT FAN OF YOURS. SO, I WAS VERY DISAPPINTED WITH THE BEAR BOOK. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN, AND SPENDING THE MONEY FOR THE BOOK WAS A JOY FOR ME TO DO, BUT A HARDSHIP AS WELL. I LOVE BOOKS, AND WANT TO PURCHASE MY FAVORITE AUTHORS, BUT MAYBE I SHOULD GET ANY BOOK YOU WRITE HEREAFTER, FROM THE LIBRARY."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one Stinks","review":"This has to be the lowest for Clancy. Having read all of his novels, some are fun and some are rather boring but this is dumb. It is also shallow and insulting to men, women, professionals, Chinese, Japanese, Russians and just about everyone else. The dialogue sounds like something ten or eleven year old boys would write. Foley referring to his wife, the CIA Director, \\"Not to busy for you baby...\\". \\"Okay, honey-bunney\\".How about this-\\"Women were all the same. Treat them in the right way, and they turn to wax in your hand, to be kneaded and shaped to your will.\\"Clancy always has some clunkers but The Bear and the Dragon is gagging material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Racist","review":"I read most of Clancy's Jack Ryan series back when I was a teenager and I liked them a lot. Clancy was a mediocre writer at best but I loved the clever plots and character developments. I was eager to read this book but it was a complete train wreak. Clancy used this book mostly to express his personal right wing political views, the plot was slow and so unrealistic that it's in the realm of fantasy. Of course there were the blatant stereotypes and racist slurs throughout the entire book that I will not repeat here. If you want to read a real military novel, read it from someone who had actually served in the military, not from Clancy who got a deferment in Vietnam and never wore a uniform in his life. After I finished the book I gave away my old Clancy collection to the library save for this one, which I promptly threw in the garbage (ok the recycling bin)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic","review":"Why is it that seemingly every english speaking person on earth has a copy of this novel sitting on their bookshelf?Possibly the most bland, formulaic, unrealistic novel i have ever read. It constantly feels as though it is about to end, before you realise you still have 500 pages to go. It drags on and on.Tom Clancy writes like every other novelist in this genre, if indeed he does write the majority of his own books.This is trashy fiction in the extreme masquerading as something of a higher quality. There is no thinking involved. The 'what if' scenario of a Chinese invaision of Russia is about as far as this mediocre mass stretches the imagination, which is slightly less than your average 'Mr Men' installment.The number of hours i spent reading this book would have been better spent writing a book of equal volume about all varieties of paint ever conceived.Nausiatingly dull. The same as every other book he has ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Like most Clancy fans, I anxiously awaited his new book. Needless to say, it was pretty disappointing. The juvenile language between the Foley characters was sickening and it was difficult to try and connect any of the bazillion subplots. I got through nearly 400 pages but I think I'm going to put this one down for awhile. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle that he was no John Kennedy. \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is no \\"Executive Orders.\\" Hopefully, the next Ryan book will be better!."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Obvious can you get?","review":"Granted that it's always easy to promote a book when your publishing company invest ton of money on a sure winner (like any Clancy book) you can expect \\"raving\\" reviews from the media and some type of readers.But, nay, this is not literature: is a gigantic salad of common places, a mixture of techno blurb and doubtful scenarios, of very obvious data, and a plot thar was written by a word processor filled with not more than 1000 words.It's really amazing that this post cold war, pre new century nouvelle (I do not care that it sports more than 1K pages) finds its place in the world, and that it will make money for Clancy,.DO yourself a favour and please switch to a real book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bear and the Dragon Drags On","review":"All of his books are too long and this one is waaaaaaay to long. In the past, I didn't care because I would just scan through much of his rambling because the bottom line was the books were enjoyable. But this one is boring. Once the action finally starts, around page 750, the passages are wordy and without any real imagination. Does Clancy get paid by the word?Lastly, we all know he is a conservative Republican but the inclusion of his political views so many times was uncalled for.The writer of \\"Patriot Games\\" and \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\" is taking himself way to seriously has apparently killed the Golden Goose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too little, nothing new","review":"It is very disappointing to write a poor review on a Clancy novel. One of my favorite authors. The good is that you get to renew all the characters of the previous books that have not been killed off and you enjoy. The story line is disappointing in that it is almost a rehash of the last books with different villians. The most disappointing is even though the book is 1000 pages none of the characters has enough of a central theme to identify with unless they are old friends from previous readings. There were pages upon pages of preaching on all kinds of issues somewhat akind to Ann Rand (Atlas Shrugged). Hope he can find the forumula if there is a next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulked up on repetition","review":"As a fan of Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October, and Executive Orders, I've always loved the detail given to his plots and characters. So when I bought the book, I figured its size was due to another intricate plot.Instead, what I got was a bulked up story filled with retreads of statements made in the older books and repetitive quotes from the characters(How many times do I have to be reminded that widows of the condemned are charged for the executioner's bullet?!?), and blatantly racist remarks. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow reading","review":"Usually I cannot put down a Tom Clancy book but this one I can read 30 or 40 pages and then go on to something else I have to do. It is very very wordy. The text repeats itself in several of the chapters. I found myself flipping through the book trying to follow the plot to the end, I have not finished reading this book, I may never do so with the joy I had with other Clancy novels. I agree with other reviewers when they stated one gets tired of Jack Ryan griping about being president. I like the character but this is to much, not realistic. The book so far has been a disappointment. I should have purchased the audio tape, then I would have gotten the story without all the endless words of dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous!","review":"Clancy's right wing-nut politics are over exposed in this one. Of the 1,000+ pages, there are 500 pages of a good (not great) story, 300 pages of unnecessary detail (the minutia is overwhelming), and 200 pages of Clancy's overactive ego. This is not near a good as the early Clancy books (Red October or Red Storm). The ending was predictable, anti-climactic and incomplete. Clancy again demonstrates how misogynistic and racist he is. His revisionism of history is particularly annoying. He doesn't seem to remember his \\"heroes'\\" failings: Nixon (Watergate and Viet Nam, \\"we could've won\\"); Reagan (Iran/Contra, Ollie North ignoring the law); and Bush (Gulf War with the not-so-smart or effective weapons against an incompetent foe.) I recommend The Partner, by Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous!","review":"Clancy is (was) on a list of a select group of authors whose books I purchase as soon as they are released. I eagerly await such publications. To say that I was disappointed with the B&D is an understatement. This is a poorly written book! Too much Tom, too little Jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Plot!","review":"Looks like others have said it all already, but I wanted to add my thumbs down. Boring, repetitive, absurd plot. In the real world, the Chinese are looking for innovative new ways to defeat the United States -- but you won't see any of that here. Clancy's Chinese are DUMB and PREDICTABLE. All too many of Clancy's own infantile political opinions shine through in this book (and who needs that). Worst of all, it's a 1000 page book, and the war doesn't even start until page 800. Get an editor, Tom! In short, I was glad someone gave this to me as a gift, because I'd be very angry if I'd paid money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible Techno Shoot 'em Up","review":"Get an editor for the 1,000 plus pages of text containing repetitions of entire paragraphs, spelling errors and misuse of words. Get more thorough research on all countries that are central to the action.This book had the opportunity to educate Americans about the people and culture of the PRC, and increase international understanding of our differences and similarities. Instead, Clancy has shown us cliche mainland Chinese - and hasn't even gotten their names right! (Chinese keep the names they are born with all their lives, and they are said \\"last name\\" first.)Back to the drafting board, Tom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Should be renamed the sloth and the draggin. I have never seen such redundancy in a novel. It could have been handled in 400 pages;it certainly did'nt need 1050. And dirty language! 100 pages could have been eliminated by cutting out the cuss words. What a disappointment compared with \\"Red October\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah's Book Club For Men","review":"Okay, all of you...put the Clancy books down and step away from the cash register. I mean if he won't bother to write them, why should we be buying them? It's Oprah's Book Club for Men - \\"Must...buy...new...Tom...Clancy...book\\" Move on, you can sure tell he has. This is another dim-witted over-politicized, shallow thriller about our dear old Jack Ryan. The thing is, I feel really bad that Jack has to put up with being put in these situations again and again to sell books. I'll suspend disbelief, but Jack Ryan as President? Please. The early books were truly great, very gripping and fun to read, but God help me if I buy another one. Fool me once, shame on you...fool me 14 times... 5 to 1 the next book is ghost written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousily written, repetitive, and racist. Avoid, Avoid!!!","review":"Tom Clancy is hitting rock bottom with this book. It's not only long (all of them are) but totally unnecessarily so. The plot moves forward at snail-pace. The repetitions soon get very boring, the blatant racism towards the chinese extremely annoying, and the fact that the rest of the story is obvious to the reader when there is about a thousand pages left of the book is just daft!The worst part, though, is probably the neanderthal level of the dialogue among the \\"heroes\\" of this story. If this reflects in any way the intellectual level of the US president and his advisers - well, then I am scared! In sum, the book stinks. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boor and the Drag-on","review":"The last Tom Clancy book I will ever buy. After 100 pages I've ground to a halt. I can't take it any more.Tom, do yourself a favour: hire an editor. Hire 10 editors. Better yet, get yourself copies of JK Rowling's 'Harry Potter' books. Written for children, but light-years ahead of anything you can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic, narcissistic excuse of a story line","review":"A pathetic, narcissistic excuse of a story line with cardboard characters. The storyline is entirely unbelievable...all good ideas are from one side, all sagacious leaders are from one side, all heroes are from one side, all mistakes are from the other side... I suppose the claptrap about the weapons may interest some but anyone looking for a realistic description of international intrigue by evenly matched players is wasting his time here..."},{"rating":"1","title":"heyho USA","review":"Heyho USA thats what I think after reading this book, One of Clancy's worst books (SSN is worse) and thinking I loved Rainbox six.While the politics part isn't that bad, the military part sure is, I think Eric L Harry's Protect&Defend is far supperior on the same topic (China invading Russia for the recource deposits).Its just insulting to read how supperior US forces are towards everything else, lacks all sence of realism here.(can't remeber a single US casualty)No after reading this one I hesitate to buy any new Clancy book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE LAST CLANCY NOVEL I WILL EVER READ","review":"This novel was about twice as long as it needed to be to tell the story. Someone needs to introduce TC to a good editor, because there was no excuse for the length of this book. It really bogged down the pace and made the novel a chore to read. There was a time when you could count on TC for good tight writing, but those days appear to be over. He hasn't been the same since EXECUTIVE ORDERS. His earlier works are still his best. After this fiasco, it will be a long time before I pick up another Clancy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON YOU CLANCEY","review":"IF YOU LOVE TOM CLANCY'S BOOKS AS MUCH AS I DO THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON WILL BE A MASSIVE DISSAPOINTMENT. SHOULD YOU STILL DECIDE TO TRY IT AND AFTER 10 HOURS OF READING YOU STILL CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING OF INTEREST...THEN DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STOP READING THIS WORTHLESS BOOK. I WISH I HAD TAKEN MY OWN ADVICE. IT IS SO BAD THAT I WILL NEVER BUY A CLANCY WITHOUT FIRST CHECKING THE COSTOMER REVIEWS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Tom Clancy yet.","review":"I have read all Tom Clancy books and undoubtedly this is the worst. His books after Clear and Present Danger are deteriorating in quality. I have completed only 200 pages and could not go further. May be I will borrow his next book from the library rather than wasting a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing at best","review":"I started reading the Bear and the dragon as I was traveling in China. Someone should tell Mr Clancy that today's China is very different from the 80's USSR... I go to China quite often on business and nothing looks slightly familiar to what was described in this book. Government workers do not go to work in gray Mao style suits.....Every thing except thir state of mind is wrong. Anyway that being said, as I read the first chapter, I knew how the book would end up. The plot is predictible, Jack Ryan thoughts are predictible, the use of technology is not even as good as it used to be in the former Ryan series. What a disapointment, Mr Clancy is resting on his laurels trying to pass out his political agenda. Instead of writting mediocre books why doesnot he run for office. He seems to have all the answers..... The book is poorly documented, poorly written, it seems to me that Mr Clancy should retire with Jack Ryan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Tough!","review":"Ryan's a bit of a wuss as President, however, his staff makes all the really big decisions as any good staff does. John Clark is still \\" Da Man\\". Along with Ding, they have a some what limited role, but thats ok I got a little Rainbowed out with \\"Six\\". What really kept me turning the pages was Tom Clancy's introduction to humor to this book. He has always had a few good lines in previous books but this one is full of little (if not crude) one liners that kept me laughing out loud in a empty room. In short, one of his three best books yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless.","review":"I've never read a more shameless attempt at using fiction to spread political views. I imagine Clancy sitting in his big leather chair before a roaring fire, giddy with boyish excitement, thinking he's used his popular Jack Ryan character to execute a successful covert propaganda operation on his loyal readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not on par for Clancy, but still a great book...","review":"I have read all of Clancy's novels, and while I did enjoy this book, I think it was probably not his best. I feel that the Jack Ryan character has become a sort of \\"cardboard-cutout,\\" kind of 2 dimensional, flat hero figure. I think that the Ryan character has not really developed in the past few books written about him. However, despite that, the book is action-packed, and is as much fun to read as his other books. Clancy excells at depicting both close-quarters and battlefield combat, and his realism has never been better. It is great that he can also bring the Rainbow group into the novels, so it is not just all Jack Ryan. While I would have given his other novels 5 stars, I must give this one 4, which is not bad at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive, boring, and bad, bad writing","review":"I am a huge Tom Clancy fan. I have loved all the Jack Ryan books, and I always thought that despite being a bit obsessed with the technicalities of war, Clancy could really write characters as well. But this book was so awful I couldn't even finish it. It was xenophobic, obsessed with vulgar sexual references, repetitive, and badly written. Did Clancy's editor take a vacation for this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bear is a Bear","review":"Clancy needs to stop believing his own press. His apparant arrogance at his success has translated into his need for books that rival War and Peace in length but fall completely short on interest. Bottom line: he needs an editor who will not be afraid to cut his holy words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character, character, character","review":"Mr. Clancy has apparently forgotten that having characters one can relate to is all important in any fiction writing. In *The Bear and the Dragon* the characters are one-dimensional and raise little empathy with the reader. I really didn't care if anyone lived or died. It was immaterial to me since I had no investment in them. Now, I know technology and suspense are the chief ingredients in a Tom Clancy novel, and that is why I bought the predecessors to this one, but in all the others, I cared about the characters. In the *The Bear and the Dragon* Mr. Clancy seems to have simply dashed this one off. Perhaps he is too involved in too many other projects to really put anything into real writing anymore - even the techno-thriller kind. All-in-all, a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just showing his lack of military knowledge","review":"The novel should be used as a textbook in elementray school. It is not only plotless, some of its assumptions are just, well Assumptions. I wonder why PLA would engage US in a situation like that. Why PLA wouldn't go all out when Taiwan declared its independence? Another good try on predicting future conflicts between major powers (Which US always wins, off course). But the lack of knowledge and understanding of Asian culture make this novel suited only for the not-informed Americans. But again why would they care when they think they are always right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've read almost all of Clancy's books. Most of them were page turners which I couldn't put down. Not so with this one. Instead of techno-thriller suspense I got a reactionary, bigoted diatribe on why white upper-class Christian americans are great and everyone else (Asians in this book) are evil. It almost seems like Clancy went out of his way to offend people. Apparently he's looking forward to writing for an audience composed entirely of hard-line conservatives, beacause he's trying hard to alienate everyone else.Save your money and definately don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated and Disappointing Power Trip","review":"In 'The Bear and The Dragon\\", Tom Clancy wasted too much time spouting the right-wing conservative American political line, in what was supposed to be a political-military international suspense tale.
