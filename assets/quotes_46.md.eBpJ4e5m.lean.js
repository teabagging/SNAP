While the price of experimentation can often be the loss of your fan base, usually you find a new fan base...the problem with Calm Before The Storm is that the only people who could find this album bearable or, as I do, enjoyable, are part of the old fan base.There are a few very good songs on this album (Black Xmas, the title track, Under a Spell, Beauty and the Beast) that do hold up to their previous albums. Something is lacking without Mantas, however.But listen to this album and compare it to Resurrection. This album sounds like what Resurrection would have sounded like without Mantas. Which is why it is a step forward. Venom did what they came to do on the first four albums and killed it, so it was about time they did something different.

The number can be looked up in Strong's Concordance to see the exact meaning of each word.Lastly, I just want to say that I too take issue with the bad review titled \\"Bad textual choice, bad introduction\\" by the reviewer who did not leave a name.

His specialty was working with AIDS and HIV infected patients. He examines himself from the perspective of an outsider. He is from a different culture than virtually all the of the population surrounding him. He works with a sub-group of patients that are not welcomed in this very rural area and are often closeted. The attitudes of the town's population towards him are very questionable because they find it difficult to accept the the nature of his practice. All of this creates difficulty for the author and he finds himself more and more distant from his family.The book is written in a series of vignettes about Dr. Verghese's patients along with his concomitant feelings and thoughts about them and the particular personal and medical situations they are facing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"\\"My Own Country\\" is an unforgettable and deeply moving account of AIDS in the small city of Johnson City, Tennessee. Extraordinarily well written, with countless memorable characters it succeeds on so many different levels.

It is a brilliant first book, and a very vital and important story."},{"rating":"2","title":"By the Author of \\"Cutting for Stone\\"","review":"Having read the current best seller, I really wanted to read the author's non-fiction account of his experiences in the early years of HIV discovery.

A great communicator, speaking or writing, and what an important message about humanity and the role of medicine and healing. Vivid descriptions of people, landscape, his feelings.

It is a period of a serious disease that very little was known about, and a young medical doctor who chose a small mountain town in Tennessee to take the time to learn about a disease and took special interest in how it affected his patients from his first meeting til their death.It was a book club choice and I am glad I had the opportunity to read something I would not have normally read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost too long to be effective.","review":"My Own Country is a tough book to read. There are so many stories of people struggling to live in the early years before there were any treatments to make living with HIV at all possible. There's also the growing despair of the author as he sees the disease spreading through his rural town and of course across the globe and not having anything he can do beyond diagnosing the disease and treating the opportunistic diseases that attack his patients.By about page 250 I began to grow numb from the overload off all the personal stories.

But I was disappointed by the clumsy writing and the lack of cohesiveness. And I was irritated by his persistent focus on his own feelings while faced with the tragic stories of his patients. So often in the book, he relates some terrible anecdote and then goes on to say how it reminds him of his own situation--which, of course, is utterly absurd.

Dr. Verghese recreates this time very vividly with all the concerns and fears that people had during those early years. He is an excellent writer and makes you feel part of the situation. In addition, he reviews part of his history and describes the experience and training of our foreign born physicians. There is much empathy in this book and I recommend it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent personal account of the emergence of AIDS","review":"In \\"My Own Country\\" Dr. Abraham Verghese tells the story of the emergence of AIDS in rural Tennessee from his perspective as a new foreign doctor. In the process of describing the increased presence of the disease in his community, Dr. Verghese also tells the personal stories of his patients as well as his own story - how working with the disease opens his mind to new perspectives as well as the toll it places on him personally. The author's narrative style is compassionately captivating, managing to entertain and inform at the same time. I'd highly recommend it for those seeking to learn more about what being a good doctor is like or about the difficulties faced by those that had to deal with the disease in its emergent era."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was great!","review":"It was better than I expected.

The course I am following based on this text is my first exposure to Java and Borland's JBuilder. While the text provides many sample programs, the applications are very specific and rather contrived. If you are an experienced programmer new to Java, you will find this text to be a poor reference. The skills most important to getting started with JBuilder, creating a new project and managing the files, are dealt with very summarily and may end up causing you hours of frustration.

It claims to be the first book to take the necessary holistic approach for knowledge management from both the IT and clinical perspectives and I can well believe this.I particularly liked the KM in action section of the book.

The ease of use of this product was quite simply astounding. When you place a card in the reader, it will appear on your desktop (assuming you use a Mac) as any floppy disc or CD would. From there, you can copy the files to your hard drive by just dragging and dropping them into any folder on your computer.

Then i went to make it work in the doorway... now to be fair, i do think we have wider-than-average door frames, but once I used all /of the extenders that the gate came with, it fit, but doesn\`t look great. I would not reccommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"pet gate","review":"Product was damaged when received.But I was able to return it without a hassle and received a full refund.I do have another Richell One Touch Gate and they are very nice gates.

I have it at the bottom of my stairs and it works very nicely, plus blends into the furniture and does not stand out. It is strongly made and would work well for children or pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and functional","review":"We bought 2 of these gates so we can slowly start letting our puppy (a basset hound) have more freedom. It comes with enough extra parts that you can modify it to fit most doorways, but measure first to be sure yours isn't too small. My husband set it up so that our cats can fit through the side, but our dog cannot, which is great as far as getting them used to each other.You can open and close the door with one hand, and it swings both ways silently. If you are clumsy like me you will most likely be tripping over the bar on the bottom for a few days, but once you get used to it being there you won't even notice it.I love that it fits in with our decor and that unlike some other attractive gates, it doesn't have to be screwed into the walls. I definitely recommend this gate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Richell 94118 Richell One-Touch Adjustable Pet Gate with Wood Finish","review":"Good gate and the wood finish looks well with house decor. Easy to use with one hand. A little hard to install in doorway and the piece at the bottom can cause a tripping hazard. Would be better if the bottom rail was lower profile or if the bottom was wider and angled on both sides as a ramp so that you don't trip over it. We have all hit our toes and tripped going through this door. You will trip or hit your foot if you do not go slow and raise your feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One-Touch Pet Gate","review":"We really like this one-touch pet gate. It was easy to install, works great, and looks reasonably nice. The only concern we have is - we've had a number of visitors trip over the bar at the bottom and take a fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate!","review":"This gate was easy to install and has worked flawlessly. The one-touch handle is easy to operate even while carrying our 20-lb dog or a laundry basket or whatever. We replaced a shorter gate that we could walk over - our dog is a Dachshund - but having a walk-through gate is safer and more convenient. Our reluctance about this type of gate before was whether the handle would be easy to operate and this handle works great. I read that some people trip over the piece at the bottom. We have not had a problem ourselves, but could see how this could be a problem. So remember to lift your feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A.J. Chewed Right Through It","review":"My three month old collie chewed right through this gate. It's a beautiful gate but should have metal bars instead of rubberwood. Wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very versatile Gate.","review":"Looking for a \\"wood\\" dog gate. Found this on Amazon. The gate was substantial. A little confusion in putting together. BUT that was because it is flexible in fitting space. It works great. Very solid. Will last a long time. Dogs are happy Wife is happy! Life is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice","review":"I love the way this gate looks. It matches my woodwork nicely but it doesn't stay in place very well. It tends to slide around on the wall a little bit. Doesn't seem to matter how much I tighten it and the gate needs to be perfectly straight for it to line up right for it to lock into place at the top and bottom. Even with those problems I wouldn't send the gate back. I like the way it looks enough to deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until our Maltese began chewing it","review":"We were very happy with this gate at first (our dog...not so much). Our 7 pound Maltese has discovered that the inside portion is chewable. I saw in previous reviews, before I purchased this gate, that other people had had this experience. Thinking that our dog is not much of a chewer, we thought it would be OK, so we ordered it. It took him about 6 weeks to discover that the inside bars can be chewed. I don't understand why the sides are metal, but the central panel is not.On the plus side, it latches fairly easily, and was easy to install. Before it became a \\"home improvement\\" project for our dog, it looked nice. If the company changed the design, to make the gate all metal, I would purchase that product. I like the color, and since we have the gate in a central location, this matters. If Richell can make the sides and bottom in this nice metal color, why not the central panel?For now, we're using a baby gate we got at Babies 'R Us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet gate","review":"Arrived quickly. Was fairly easy to set up and put into place. Directions were weak. Have had no problems since it was installed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality; easy to install; nice appearance; easy operation","review":"We purchased this gate to span a width of a 30\\" doorway to keep pets out of our office. My husband thought it was very easy to set up and install (some other reviewers said they had difficulty). The Richell website also has a short video on installation--which I watched, but my husband didn't. Extra parts were included if the span needed to be a little wider. It looks very nice; good quality; easy operation; durable. This would be a good choice for those people with children. It's especially nice that it won't mar our wide oak woodwork. Would highly recommend this gate. (On an aside: we also bought the Richell wide free-standing wood gate. This is very attractive and easy for adults to step over. Probably not a good choice for children, but pets are fine.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and beautiful","review":"As longtime pet owners who want to confine our dogs to a particular portion of the house, my family has used many different types of gates. These are by far the best. They hold securely, are easy to get through (even for our 4-year-old), and tall enough that retrievers at least don't try to jump over. They're also nice looking and don't look cheesy. Immediately after we purchased and installed ours, one of our neighbors who had just gotten puppies asked where we found these gates, and ordered them for herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cats not inclined to jump.","review":"We bought this to keep our two cats out of the Study and it works great. Extremely well made, looks really great and very easy to open and close. If necessary we could put one of our electric scat mats in front of it to keep cats from attempting to jump over. The bars are close enough so they cannot go through that way. Do read the assembly instructions as hardware is provided for three different width door openings."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Brittany can open it!","review":"Several years ago, we bought three of these gates to confine our new puppy to only part of our house while we weren't home. They worked great. We subsequently moved and gave them to a friend who also had a good experience with them. We recently moved again and found ourselves needing another gate. We bought the same one, hoping to have the same experience. Unfortunately, the design of the gate has changed. It now has a clamp that goes over the bottom bar, rather than a dowel that goes into the bar. This is not an improvement. My medium sized Brittany can push the hand lever high enough to throw his weight against the gate, move the clamp over the bar, and open the gate. So it is completely worthless. It's too bad, because it is a very nice looking gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Gate","review":"I am very happy with this purchase. The gate is sturdy as well as attractive. I found it easy to install. The door opens either way which comes in very handy. I recommend this gate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate!","review":"I bought two, one for each kitchen door, and it took me an evening to install them both, but I now have peace of mind when I leave my house because the dog is contained. Easy packaging, clear instructions, no tools required - and strong once they're up. The wood finish goes well with my house and makes the whole set-up more homey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Gate","review":"This gate is great! It was very easy to install and did not require drilling holes in the wall. My daughter pulls up on it and it stays in place. It does a good job of keeping the dogs and kids where we want them! It also looks nice. It is mainly made of wood/wood-colored metal and isn't some giant, plastic monstrosity in my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"New latch lock is HORRIBLE!!!","review":"I am so disappointed in the new latch lock! I returned 2 already!! It doesn't close properly at the bottom! It was the best gate that I've ever had and I am so sad they tried to improve it. They ruined it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"This is the best pet gate I've ever used. I've had all of the plastic varieties--pressure, pressure with gate, half mount with pressure close. All of those were either difficult to use, broke when they fell, didn't stay up, fell off the hinges when opened, didn't look great, etc. But this gate looks GREAT, stays put, opens easily with one hand, closes easily. You do have to be careful not to trip on the lower bar, but since it is squared off that's much less of an issue than with other gates. I did have trouble figuring out the directions for the extended pieces--there are diagrams but not much description. Now that it's up I love it. It's secure (we have 2 full size collies) and is more like furniture than a gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice gate","review":"I purchased two gates to keep my three cocker spaniels on the tiled area. I agree with many of the other reviews, they are nice looking, wood & metal, limited in size, easy to get get through, the bottom bracket can be a tripping hazard, etc. I am actually purchasing another gate today because of the ease of use. It takes some adjustments to get the gate staight. If it is not centered properly the door will not latch. You may want to have it raised just slightly to sweep under. I installed one gate in a hallway. Be sure to align the pressure pads with the wall studs. We tightened them to much (because we have a jumper)and they created an indentation in the drywall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for maximum width","review":"This gate seems to be well designed. We bought it because of the overwhelming positive reviews. Unfortunately, our own experience was quite different. We were looking to use this in our kitchen to stop once and for all the kids from feeding the dog. The opening required that we use the extensions (included) on the gate. Upon reaching maximum width, once pressure is applied to the sides the gate bows from the joints and pops right out of place. I tried cutting extensions from pieces of scrap wood to fit the endings inside to try and offer a bit more support but not even this worked. I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of stability when it reached the maximum length.So, if you're looking to use this at the minimum suggested width, you're probably in good shape. I'd stay away if you're on the longer end of the suggested width for this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Gate","review":"I am very very pleased with this product.

When I listened to my music at a level that blocked out surrounding conversation, the whole office could hear exactly what I was listening to as if I had no headphones on at all. The reason I was ordering headphones and not earbuds was the specific reason of privacy and ambient noise blockage.

The main reason I was on the market for headphones was to grab a unit I could use at significant decibel ranges at work without disturbing my colleagues. The Sennheiser's are a very sturdy, comfortable set of headphones for the price. They reproduce sound at a very natural scale and are pretty effective. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because even though they curb sound to quite an extent, they still aren't whisper quiet to the outside world and no I'm not a maniac that plays music at insane volumes.

It was revised again in the 50's and eventually published - in defference to its historical important I presume. The novel is worthy of its rejection. It is similar to D. H. Lawrence's The Man Who Died in its presenting the death and resurrection of Jesus as a trick played with drugs - a denial of the miraculous in keeping with its era. Its feminism is based on an attempted renewal of classical religious images - Egyptian, Greek, Mithraic, ... - with a superficial presentation of these religions in a high didactic style and plot. Even fans of H.D. will be disappointed. Nonetheless, it does provide background for a greater appreciation of the environment in which it was written and of the development of H.D. thought.Read it as literary history and it is useful; read it as novel and it leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I ordered the new edition when my copy of the 1994 edition started getting worn.

Mr. Dingle now uses an external source for his radio station data, and exludes not only the smaller stations, but entire markets as well. While it is not practical to include *every* U.S. radio station, skipping many medium-size markets severly limits this books usefulness. I had hoped to see *more* radio stations added in the new edition, or possibly Canadian radio (Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver, etc), instead of drastically fewer. While still useful if you only plan to visit the largest markets in the U.S., for most travel it will leave you hitting your car's scan button,waiting until you hit the next major city.

This collection is published by the American Diabetes Association as part of their Healthy Selects series - oddly, that information is not anywhere on the product page here. \\"Savory Soups and Salads\\" is obviously inexpensive, but it's not a particularly good buy overall. Specifically, the cookbook contains surprisingly few soup recipes - 22. The remainder of the book consists of salad, bread, and salad dressing recipes.The soup recipes that are included, though, are fairly good although basic, including Italian Minestrone, lentil soup, beef stew. In addition, extensive nutritional information is included for each.

It bore a sticker stating that it was discounted via PG&E;'s Residential Lighting Program. My local utility endorses this product, so it must be good, right? Think again. I just applied to Greenlite USA for warranty replacement. Both of them failed in about three years of use. That's a 100% failure rate. LEDs are normally supposed to function for about 100,000 hours, or 11 years. These units didn't even get close, considering they're equipped with a photocell, so they only light about 10 hours per day. At that rate, they should have lasted over 25 years.My recommendation: Don't buy this Chinese-made product and be very suspicious of other Chinese-made Greenlite USA lighting products, especially if they're endorsed by your local public utility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak like all LED nightlights","review":"The light is extremely weak, like all LED nightlights.

The quality is not worth it. The slide does not stay on the ground properly. It is rolled when you receive it and for some reason I could never unroll it so that it remained flat. There was a permanent curl at the end and it would end up rolling at each end automatically! This was dangerous because I nearly fell several times trying to slide and the curved ends were not secure. The company should put the rubber backing on the entire product not just the end.

Most of the book is concerned with Scottish paranormal and supernatural tales, but a couple of pure science fiction entries, such as 'Phantom Payment' and 'The Elixir of Life', have also crept in.While never subjecting the reader to out-and-out shock, the author is particularly effective at creating unsettling atmospheres. Sometimes these involve the supernatural resolution of abuse or injustice, as in 'An Early Frost' or 'Animal, Vegetable or Mineral'. Sometimes it is by painting a haunting, word-tone picture of a remote Scottish location as in 'Wee Robbie'.Regarding language, the author has avoided the over-use of Scots words and dialect, and this should make the material readily accessible outside Scotland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection of essays, but not an introductory text.","review":"\\"The Nazi Revolution: Hitler's Dictatorship and the German Nation,\\" (Problems in European Civilization)by Allan Mitchell (Editor) is a wonderful up-to-date collection of essays from top-notch historians on the current historical debates surrounding the causes and actions of the Nazi Revolution.Books from the PROBLEMS IN EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION SERIES are designed for upper-level undergraduate and graduate level European history courses. That being said, this book is not an introductory text. The authors of the articles go directly into their subjects, without providing any significant background information.

I'm not sure how everyone could have let this one slip. Third, if you've ever watched video of Hogan swinging in his prime, that club gets back pretty far with an iron.

I wish he didn't focus so much on France's windows but spread it out with more of Europe. But you really get a sense of the Gothic age and what these churches meant to the people. You'll want to go out and watch The Hunchback of Notre Dame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"What I had expected, or at least hoped for, was a book with the more elaborate celtic knotwork letters, such as the first alphabet in this book has. However, most of the alphabets are like the one which is displayed on the cover (a-f) -- letters with a little bit of knotwork and and animal head or such, or even no knotwork at all. Another thing, I actually was needing it for a modern B, and of course this book does not have a lot of modern Bs -- only one, in the first alphabet, which didn't quite work for me. The letters are neat, but I suppose I was looking for something more modern. I think it would be a very nice resource for those wanting Celtic letters such as the ones on the middle front cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"DJ Stage","review":"I purchased this product from DJ Stage on Amazon.com.

As usual, from start to finish, it was hard to put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Unrealistic and Predictable","review":"I have read many of James Patterson's books and generally enjoy them.....except for the annoyingly short chapters. With most chapters only being a couple of pages long the books are generally about half as long as they appear. This book is just too unrealistic and unbelievable. Too many things happen which just can't possibley happen and I just can't get into the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page Flipper","review":"Seems like a book written by an amateur, not a successful and well-know writer.Totally uninteresting and predicatable.

Only Patterson could turn art thefts into a thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"FBI Agents fall in love with serial killer suspects every day","review":"Listen up, everyone. FIVE STARS means a classic masterpiece: Catch-22, World According to Garp, Deliverance, Catcher in The Rye, Old Man and the Sea. LIKE THAT. Just LIKING a novel doesn't mean you give it five stars, okay?I liked a couple of the early Alex Cross novels but this Lifeguard thing is absolutely absurd. I only read it because I'm interested in \\"Florida\\" novels but this one should have been set in California, it has no Florida quality at all. MOREOVER, the FBI vets their recruits a lot better than this. It's ludicrous. As for the people who are giving this commercial pablum five stars, they can't read many books. Try something by James Lee Burke or Henning Mankell if you want to read a really good crime novel, something by Carl Hiaasen or James W. Hall if you like a good Florida novel. Honestly, around the entire Amazon website I'm finding one thing. Write any piece of commercial garbage and someone will give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading title...but an exciting read!","review":"We soon forget that Ned Kelly is a lifeguard in Florida.He hooks up 4 old friends from Brockton, Mass. topull a multi-million dollar art heist. His only job is to set off some alarms to divert the police. He soon finds out that the theft has gone terribly wrong, and he becomes a suspect in multiple murders. His quest for redemption takes him back to Boston with questions for his dying father. FBI Agent Ellie Shurtleff becomes a most unlikely accomplice in trying to prove his innocence. Just when you think you know what is going tohappen, it takes some weird twists. It was a 2 day read, asare all of Patterson's...interesting, exciting, unpredictable.I am liking these authors he is co-writing with. Except for\\"The Jester,\\" he is back on my A-list. I think you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summer beach book!","review":"I was a bit hesitant to buy this novel after looking at the cover and reading the first few pages. It looked like another formula pulp fiction novel. I also don't like novels written by more than one person. Nevertheless, I bought it and I have no regrets. The storyline is unbelieveable at times, but it's still very entertaining. It's a good escape novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait to get in my car and go for a drive!","review":"This is my first audio book...and I LOVE IT! I used to turn on the radio when driving little 20-minute jaunts but now I'm turning on Lifeguard. I'm almost finished with it, but I don't want it to end.The story is complex, but easy to understand. There are a couple different subplots that Patterson weaves together nicely. The main character isn't perfect, but he's definitely likeable. The side characters have lots of personality, thanks to Billy Campbell's reading. Campbell may be best known as Cliff Secord in Disney's \\"The Rocketeer.\\"Campbell pulls off Australian and Irish accents. He softens his voice when reading female parts and gets a deep, but likeable gruffness in his voice when speaking as one of the character's male friends.Great story, great reading, what else can a person want in an audio book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised.","review":"Guess I'm writing because I'm not a typical patterson fan. At least, not recently. I go more for Alan Furst and Robert Wilson. Still, my wife gave me this book with the ultimatum to read it and, you know what... I was 100% entertaied. Lifeguard is basically un-put-downable!I'll let others describe the plot-- it involves art theft, muder sex, betrayal, Palm Beach-- that's not why I'm writing.I'm doing so out of surprise and satisfaction. If ther are others like me out there you can take a chance on this book. It's swift-paced, amusing, doesn't take itself too seriously-- as several reviewers seem to-- and delivers a suprising emotional punch at the end. Whoever Andrew Gross is, it's a partnership that's worth continuing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprized by the book","review":"Honestly I can say that some of the book was predictable, but you can look past that and enjoy the story. I usually read books about fantasy, vampire, and some mystery/thrillers also love Shakespeare. When this book was sent to my husband from his book subscription, we were going to send it back. However, he never did and I decided to read it. I love reading and took to this book immediately.Ned is a person who came from a hard life who is down on his luck. He tries to outrun his past and where he grew up to find out that those are the issues in his life he must face. The book is a bit like shakespeare in the way tragedies seem to be everywhere. However, if you can see this book as ENTERTAINMENT or way to escape reality/daily life, then I am sure you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story unbelievable","review":"I do like reading Patterson but this had very little thought put into it, like he's producing stories like Danielle Steel. It's little more than a short story with 2-page chapters with interesting who-done-characters but very unbelievable. Sorry, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Surely one would think Patterson was successful enough on his own and would need to lend his name to lesser works which this is clearly. He has struggled with the last few Cross novels. I wish he'd spend more time on those endeavors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"As a long-time fan of James Patterson, when I pick up one of his books I expect the writing to be tight, tense, and of page-turning excitement. This book was a poor representation of Patterson's work, which leads me to believe that while he might have come up with the plot line, his co-author did the actual writing. A tone of intensity and urgency are always part of Patterson's work, and it is sorely lacking in this \\"fake\\" Patterson novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Patterson novel without page turnability???","review":"Interesting storyline but clearly Patterson tried to turn out the next \\"Dan Brown\\" novel. All the elements of a good story are present but they are set out in such a formulaic way that boredom sets in.

I don't know who's writing these books, but it's certainly not him. There were parts in this book that didn't even make sense. I think Mr. Patterson should stop loaning his name out and get down to writing something fantastic like some of his first books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a James Patterson Book","review":"The only thing that James Patterson had to do with this book is to allow the publisher to use his name. The writing was at best amatuerish, and I will certaily think twice before buying another of his \\"co authored\\" books. The Lifeguard was pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The only \\"Patterson\\" I found in this book is his signature short chapters. The book is short, the print is large and the chapters average about three to four pages long. Obviously a reader could finish it off in a night, which I did. But it wasn't because I couldn't put it down.I found the characterization horrible. The characters were so flat and boring. How can a guy who came so close to receiving his MA be so gullible, air-headish, and stupid? Or an up and coming FBI agent so easily believe a total stranger even when ALL the facts say something different? This can't possibly be Patterson's writing. It sounds nothing like his earlier books that so easily captured the actions and thoughts of a complex character. I don't think I'd bother with another of his co-authorships again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad...","review":"I have enjoyed many other Patterson novels so was expecting another good read. However, I was totally disappointed in this shallow and unbelievable story. To me, there was no depth to the characters and the plot was unreal. I couldn't believe the book was a Patterson novel! I was also amazed at the number of mistakes in sentence structure, typo's, etc. Mr. Patterson definitely needs to find better proof-readers/editors. In my opinion, the errors were so bad and so noticeable, I laughed out loud at times. I was surpised that a book written by such a well known author could contain so many errors and then still get published! How could this be a bestseller??? Overall, a great disappointment. I will be very hesitant to buy another book by Mr. Patterson and his co-author, Mr. Gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply written, easy read","review":"This is definitely something I wouldn't have finished if I weren't on the beach. The characters are flat, and the inner dialogue is cheesy at best. It might make a decent movie but didn't fly as a book. At least it was a quick read - I read it in a few hours - but it's not in any way believable. Also I didn't really care what happened to anybody in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I didn't pay $14.99 for it","review":"To put it nicely, this is not Patterson's best work. The story drags on and on and the characters are unrealistic. An FBI agent getting mixed up with a murder suspect?

I was hoping it would entertain me during my 13 hours flight. The book was so boring and uninteresting that I can't even remember much about it except it was a story about a life gaurd taking part in a robbery scheme of some valuable paintings (or was it painting?)that was kind of a setup for insurance claim by the owner.... something like that. I don't really remember. It was not a page turner cause during the 13 hours' flight, I couldn't read it continuously like I did with other books, I had to put it down after a few chapters cause the story was so unbearably boring and dead...It was such a bad book and a boring reading experience for me that I can't even remember much about it but the fact that it bored me to death on my 13 hours flight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Very Bad","review":"It is a good thing that I bought this book from the bargain bin. I cannot tell you how poorly written and predictable the plot is. Ned Kelly may be the most stupid thief protagonist in history. Only followed by the drones in the police and FBI that try and catch him. The story is barely believable to the point where you think that the characters are so poorly drawn that you want to throw the book away. Right down to the by the numbers ending. Why would an FBI agent want to be linked and marry a felon anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not boring, fast paced","review":"I am really enjoying this book, every chapter so far has been amazing.I am so shocked! in a good way, truly good reading and not boring. Love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So This Is James Patterson??","review":"Let me begin by saying that I could not put the book down! I really needed to find out how it ended. Having said that, this was a horrible book because it asks too much of the reader to suspend disbelief. FBI agent falls for the suspect and is willing to trash her career for him? Really? Among other things this is what we are being asked to accept?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read","review":"Good for summer reading or while you're traveling.

This is not a book I would recommend, but it would do to entertain if you were trapped in an airtport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the REAL Patterson, please stand up!","review":"As someone who was Patterson's biggest Alex Cross fan, it saddens me that Patterson's books are chart-toppers because of the Patterson brand. I still read the Cross series - I guess, considering the last Cross read was, Cat & Mouse.I just can't wait for the Patterson I was introduced to when I was in my teens, to stand up & take his place on the bestsellers list for quality not quantity. Sadly, I believe he may have been a 3 book wonder.Anyway, I pushed myself through it because I am a fan of the gifted Mr. Gross & it was painfully obvious (to me) which segments were penned by the fervent Mr. Gross. FYI: Gross is w/o a doubt HERE TO STAY!!!I am hoping Patterson will emerge again in this century, but I am not going to hold my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideaway","review":"Koontz has gone to a lower level.

Not his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Authors Of a Work of Fiction Are One Too Many","review":"Over the years, I have become a fan of James Patterson. Nevertheless, in very recent years, like Tom clancy, he has been putting out books with his name and the name of a second author. I find the two author books less gripping. Perhaps it is a prejudice of mine. I wish he would stick to the Alex Cross type stories which I believe he wrote by himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson franchise thriving","review":"The James Patterson franchise is thriving. Like Clive Cussler he uses co-authors to spin out yarns under his name. At least they are given credit, unlike some others. Lifeguard is one of the better recent Patterson novels. The plot is well summarized in another review here. No point in repeating it. There are more twists and turns in this novel than on a rollercoaster. Ned Kelly is taken for quite a ride. He loses one gorgeous babe to murder but ends up sunning with former FBI agent at the story ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson fans will not be disappointed in this one","review":"After being a little disappointed in some of the books lately by James Patterson I wasn't expecting too much from this one. I just bought it because it was by one of my favorite authors and boy was I surprised. I LOVED IT!! One story line with twists and turns that make a good mystery novel. Not a bunch of subplots that blur the original storyline. I hope he goes back to this style of writing because this is what made me love his earlier works. I really enjoyed Ned and Ellie and all of the characters in the story even the bad guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap!","review":"This isn't anything I would expect from James Patterson. The plot is o.k. but the character development is so ridiculous that this book just stinks. Don't waste your time or money on this thing, buy something by John Connelly instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much There","review":"I started Lifeguard not expecting great literature, but with James Patterson as a co-author I looked forward to an imaginative and entertaining story. Unfortunately, Lifeguard fell way short as it proved to be shallow and formulaic cotton candy that can best be compared to a mediocre, cliché-ridden \\"Made for T.V.\\" movie. Those of you looking for entertainment on a beach or a plane should reach for a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"COT BookClub Review II","review":"James Patterson's Lifeguard is an intruiging fast read book. My friends and I all read the book in less than three days. The setting of the book is the lush beaches of Florida where a beach bum transplanted from the East Coast turns his uneventful life into a story straight out of a tabloid. The story is pretty unbelievable and it is hard to believe a former street wise punk can allude hired assasins and the government authorities. We would recommend this book if you where stranded somewhere waiting for a flight or a train. It will help you pass the time but will not challenge your mind. Almost like reading a movie. We hope you find our reviews to be helpful. Our next book is \\"THE HADES FACTOR\\" by Robert Ludlum. Until next time, COT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Going On?","review":"I seldom write a bad review, my motto being if I can't say something good...well you know the rest. In the case of LIFEGUARD, I am compelled to state that I am extremely disappointed.First, I'm a big big fan of Patterson's and usually devour everything he writes. However, last year, I must admit I merely put up with The Lake House. I didn't love it but I easily forgave Patterson and understood his need to try something new.LIFEGUARD did not cut it with me. I'm waiting with baited breath for the next Cross book, Mary Mary. He never goes wrong with the Alex Cross series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read in recent memory. The main character is so shallow, and says such banal things, that there is no way anyone would fall for him. I can't believe a reputable author could put out a book like this, unless marketing says that the majority of the public likes simple stories aimed at 16 year olds. It IS true that it is easy to read, but so was my 1st kindergarten book. I'm not planning on ever wasting my time on this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track/Artist Listing","review":"1.

It is a lovely, heart-warming, true story based on the written correspondence between an English Literature-ophile (ok, so that's not a word...) and the people in the London bookshop from where she buys her books. (The American is Helene Hanff, a script writer for tv, broadway, and the movies, including the Ellery Queen tv series, as well as an author of books...she's a fascinating character, on her own.) As you follow the letters, you also follow post-war history in the US and Great Britain, with captivating details that one would probably not learn about otherwise.

This is a book that has been tenderly-though not cloyingly-written about family, personal history and what really reigns important in life. The dialogue-especially from Miz Olive-is laugh out loud funny. The turn of phrase is fresh and vibrant. As in any compelling tale, the characters drive the story and keep you turning the pages to learn their fate.

Having been brought up in both the progressive world of Orange County, CA, and a town smaller than Blue Lick in North Carolina, I can understand where the ideas of the book came from. However, I found it to be a painful read. The storyline jumps around a lot, and there seems to be some irrelevant information intact as well as relevant information either completed skipped, or alluded to only at the end.If I had it to do again, I would skip this book. I think it needed a lot of editing before being published."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY FROM BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES!","review":"I purchased the AlcoMate Breathalyzer from BP Medical Supplies here on amazon.com.

For starters my item arrived late. When I emailed BP Medical about the item they emailed me back and told me to call the next day. I called no one answered and I left a message. No one called back. So called back and left more messages. No answer and no call backs. I filed a claim with amazon. They finally instructed me to return the item.

The highlights include live performances of \\"24 hours at a time\\" (with Charlie Daniels on fiddle) and \\"Can't You See\\".

But don't let the short length of the essays diminish the great things this book as a whole is capable of conveying to writers who are suffering creative blocks.

You can choose how many times the line will ring before the system answers a call. It also has a three digit remote access code. Choose from numbers 500 to 999. It has also the call screening feature which allows you to hear the caller's voice before picking up the phone.

If you're not a fan of Mr. Grimes, then this album will seem rather ordinary to you and your money would be better spent elsewhere on bands/artists that do this sort of thing better. The album tries too hard to be more than it is. You can tell that they were going for 'meat and potatoes' rock 'n' roll and ended up with something more like 80's excess. The songs are catchy and entertaining but I would never say that I would want to listen to them over and over again as some have previously stated. It's an okay album with nothing really brilliant about it. It's a good effort and fun in a lot of ways. I liked Sunset Blvd the best.

I had never heard of SR before, but I was really into metal (Testament, Sepultura, Overkill, Slayer, Flotsam & Jetsam, etc.). In the video they were playing with a white background behind them - like it was lit up - and they just threw down. I couldn't get the song out of my head and it soon became my first cd (having had a cassette collection up until then) and now SR is in my top 3 of metal bands - includes Testament & Sepultura. It's still one of my favorite metal songs & albums. Phil (vocals/bass) has excellent delivery/cadence & intelligent, thoughtful lyrics (one of the reasons I love good metal - and Sacred Reich) - great guitar & drum work too. The rest of the album is awesome also. 31 Flavors is a kick.

This CD is right along side Master of Puppets, Reign in Blood, Practice what you Preach, Thrash Zone, Lights, Camera...Revolution, etc etc. It's simply a must have.Yes, they slowed down their pace on this CD, but honestly...that's why this is so good. It has so much groove it reminds me of Lights, Camera, Revolution by Suicidal Tendencies. Song after song just hook you in with ultra catchy riffs, and vocals that you will be singing along to in no time. Pretty much every song is awesome...and when it's all in the same CD, you just have to buy it.American Way has the same riff repeated over and over, but it never gets old - like Pantera's \\"walk\\". Plus it's still heavy as hell.Anyway...if you check out my reviews, I don't give out 5 stars a lot, but this one deserves it and then some.

In our particular case the little devils circumvent our pole-mounted baffle by leaping to the feeder from a large nearby tree and then help themselves to the gourmet selection of shelled seeds and nuts that we fill the feeder with. HOWEVER, if you live in a wooded area like we do, this is a fabulous feeder for attracting woodpeckers because they can hold onto the outer metal cage with their claws while they peck at the feeding ports for seeds and nuts (again, we use an expensive feed such as Lyric Woodpecker mixture or Lyric Delite). But to us it's worth it to attract numerous beautiful hairy, red bellied, and downy woodpeckers to our feeder all year round. On the other hand, this is not the best feeder for perching birds such as cardinals. So a good solution is to have at least two feeders, the fortress for your woodpeckers and another feeder with perches for the perching birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called the Bird Proof Squirrel Feeder","review":"Bought this on Friday returned it on Monday.

Though it's not really designed for it, I am also using it to \\"cheat\\" on some light trenching I need to do for sprinkler pipes, etc. It makes a nice little trench about ten inches deep, and then it's easy to scoop out the loose dirt. Beats a pickaxe or trenching shovel, and I don't have to deal with renting a trencher for the small amount of work I need to do.Overall, I'm pleased with how this is working for me so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"Great little machine, easy to assemble. I was thrilled with how quickly it was delivered, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Mantis arrived fine and was shipped promptly by Amazon. I have about 1/4 acre and was attracted to it's durability, handyness, and easy storage. The first time I used it, I hit a small piece of crab grass which got tangled up in the gear area so I had to stop, take it apart and remove the grass. No matter how I adjust and operate, weeds get wound around the gear drive. The Mantis is also not easy to operate. The video shows by pulling back on the Mantis it actually works better but it pulls [...] your arms. I am disappointed and I think that the ads over promise. I am sorry that I purchased this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recent purchase unreliable","review":"I purchased a Mantis 2-cycle tiller about 18 years ago and got a good 15 years of use out of it. I purchased a replacement last year and got one year of service. I have experienced so many frustrating problems I have given up on it and am looking for another manufacturer. Typical problems: hard to start, loss of power, running rough and quitting.

The tiller is lght and easy to use. With no stones to deal with, the Mantis makes short work of weeds and hard dirt. I like the manuverability since our rows are narrow and short. The only negative is the tendancy for long weeds to wrap around the drive shaft but easy removal of the blades makes cleaning the shaft a breeze.Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mantis tiller","review":"I have had my Mantis two cycle cultivator for about six years (who knows why). Every spring and fall I pull it out to cultivate a small garden, work on it for several hours, call Mantis to remind them of the trash they sell and till for thirty minutes before repeating the process. I have rebuilt the carb., replaced fuel filter, lines, etc. and replaced the carb. Always the same thing, unreliable. I really like the weight and how handy it is, but by the time I'm done with the garden, I'm ready for a drink or a bullet. The drink for me or the bullet for either one of us. Every time I call Mantis, they have two solutions. One: Send it back and we'll fix it for $200.00 plus shipping or \\"Go ahead...make our day\\".

He had a problem too then once he got it started, told me I would aways have a problem because I was a woman and not strong enough to pull the cord. Also it does not do the job it is advertised to do. The sick part is that he spent a lot of money for nothing and I would like our money back please.

I was a little worried after reading some of the other reviews about weeds and roots tangling the blades. I did get the weed reducers and even the special tool to clear the weeds. After a few minutes of use, I was disappointed by a nasty tangle that stopped the machine. The tool cleaned it out fast but then I learned a trick that solved the problem. When using the tool, as soon as you notice it start to bind and slow a little, ease-up on the tool and let it run free for a few seconds. It clears the weeds almost immediately and your back to tilling. Used in this way, the tool works very well and easily digs through tough weeds and grass and even fist-sized rocks. Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews. Get the weed reducers and use this technique to clear the tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mantis Tiller","review":"I am not sure why the rating is not higher for this one, I own one and it starts every year and is a quick starter all year. The blades/attachments are legendary. I have tried the Honda tillers and even after they fixed the gearing problem, the tiller blades are still no match for the mantis. The mantis is much easier to handle and a lot more versatile. Not recommended by the mfr. but I use mine to dig large holes for planting rose bushes etc, it bounces off rocks and just goes back in and digs some more, eventually kicking out the rocks. Legendary machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mantis does not back their product (at least through Amazon)","review":"We looked into this product for quite a while and received the DVD from them. Everywhere you look they advertise their 1 year trial and 100% satisfaction guarantee. After a few months of trying to use this awful piece of equipment (failed to start, fuel problems, choke problems, getting jammed with all kinds of things every few minutes) we decided it was not for us and we were not satisfied. We contacted Mantis and they said they would not take it back that we had to go through Amazon. Amazon's only offers a 30 day still in box return. Mantis says Amazon is not a registered dealer of the product. This is not resolved yet, but I highly recommend you DO NOT BUY this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great digging","review":"I had a similar tiller (different brand) so I was familiar with the strengths and limitations. The Mantis performed well and seemed to dig deeper and faster than my other one. My only complaint is that when I was tilling and trying to move it around, I kept hitting the cutoff switch. This was quite aggravating because then I would have to start it all over again.Other than that, it did a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mantis tiller- a good buy","review":"I purchased a Mantis tiller in May '08 as a replacement for an old Mantis tiller. It works great! If you have a small to medium area to till (I use it to till a garden 25 x 40 plus several additional smaller areas) it is very easy to use and very effective. I bought it from Amazon because of the price AND free shipping at the time. The new sales tax being charged in NYS on internet sales, effective June 1, would make me think twice about buying it now from Amazon.

I guess you can afford to ship so inefficiently when you're ripping people off. I contacted Parts Express and demanded a return, and I was told I'd get a shipping label immediately--though why they'd spend the money on a return for such a piece of junk defies logic.

(If you don't know about the State Dept's travel advisory web site, or the CDC's web site for recommended immunizations, this book will be very handy, but if you are a traveler and that out of touch, I'm not sure you should be vagabonding in the first place.)I was hoping for true insights, lessons learned, things that couldn't be gleaned after spending 5 minutes surfing the web and they simply weren't in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've ever used your passport, then you do NOT need this book.","review":"I'm in the process of reading this book and I am really not impressed.

Make sure to carve out your own journey.It does give good tips if you have never traveled with your passport before, but if you are in any way experienced traveling outside of all-inclusive resorts, this book is a waste of time and will not give you any insight to traveling that you probably did not already have.

When I first heard of the book, I did not expect it to answer all my questions or help me to plan completely my upcoming trip; I expected it to be a general guide. In that vein, I was not disappointed.After having read the book, I immediately sold it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different travel guide","review":"\\"Vagabonding\\" is a completely different travel guide from the usual(although very commendable) Lonely Planet Guides, or Europe on 5 euros a day.

There are commonsense hints on safety, with some aimed particulary at women. The whole is illustrated with quotes from well known \\"Vagabonds\\" of previous eras as well as the present.

I think it is probably best suited to my demographic (single, or at least family-less young people) but would also be great for retirees who always wanted to travel. That is not to say that I wouldn't recomend it to people with families, but I do think that the kind of travel it is suggesting might be a little disruptive for kids who have friends, school, and sports (you know, all those average kid activities that are so much fun and not very condusive to long term absences, etc).

But we also get to see clips from \\"That Was The week that Was\\" (the inspiration for Laugh-In and the Smothers Bros. show) and the young Monty Python troupe as well as oldschool Brit comedians like Tommy Cooper and Morecombe and Wise who never hit it that big here in the States.

I don't agree that we should not watched Saved by the Bell if we love it, but do agree that we should also enjoy quality TV. He nails the FCC, MASH, and other things that are both overrated or underrated. He falls into the trap overpraising stuff like the X-Files, Buffy, and such.

I realized these puppies had a 2 year warranty, so I shipped them back to S and after a week and a half, I had a good to go set waiting on my doorstep. So not only do they sound great, but you can bet you'll get top notch warranty service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphones I have used.","review":"I am using these phones mainly for music mixing (because of noise restraints). I cannot fault these phones on any level. I have used AKG 240's in the past and to me there is no comparison. To my ears they tell the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"4-eyes beware of this model!","review":"I have a major gripe with these headphones: I wear glasses, and headphones can often be uncomfortable until I break the padding in a little using them with my glasses.These headphones were more then uncomfortable with glasses, they were painful. After 2 hours I decided trying to break them in just wasn't worth it, as I removed them one of my glasses lens snapped from my frame. The amount of force these headphone pads put on my glasses makes them unusable.Without glasses the HD-595's are perfectly comfortable. As other reviews have covered adequately these are excellent mid-range headphones for audiophiles, but DO NOT buy them if you wear glasses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my STARS these things are good!!","review":"I practically ripped these things out of the box when they arrived the other day. They felt so good on my head that I was half way down the street with them before I realized I had forgotten my MD player. Frankly, I was at first disappointed, thinking the music sounded \\"good but not great\\" when I noticed the swaying cord dangling around my feet...A short while later back in the west wing with a glass of chardonnay and P. Diddy blasting through my 595s I felt it was all worth the steep pricetag. I'm still sending them back because the cord is all stepped-on and scratched up, but I whole-heartedly recommend these excellent set of cans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Poor Choice for Office Listening","review":"I picked up this pair of headphones thinking that they would make excellent headphones for listening to my music at work.Unfortunately, they're open headphones, which leak sound (by design). They're so loud, my co-workers 25 feet away could clearly tell what I was listening to, which is fine for classic rock, but not so much for 90's era gangster rap.While I'm certainly appreciative of the effort to make great sounding headphones, headphones have traditionally been designed for personal listening, so as not to annoy others. I don't believe that Sennheiser should call these headphones as they are more precisely on-ear speakers. That is the reason for my low rating. I understand caveat emptor, but I feel that calling these headphones is intentionally misleading.Sennheiser makes a great pair of true, closed, headphones of comparable quality and style called the HD 280 Pro. For office listening, they're an excellent choice, and my co-workers agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 pairs. Both failed left driver.","review":"I have two of these earphones.

After resisting the audiophile urgings of a friend to drop $1300 on a set of HD800s, I paid about $180 for these. They feel substantive but light, they allow me to hear a reasonable amount of ambient noise around me, they drive very fine bass that never feels artificial or hollow, and they are very easy to put on and wear. Now if I can just resist my friend's urgings to pay only $300 for a $900 headphone amplifier..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for music and gaming.","review":"These are some of the best headphones you can buy at this price point.The sound coming out of these is amazing. Very clean and balanced.Anyone who says there is too little base is probably use to the over-emphasized base that spews out of headphones designed specifically for portable use.Bass is not suppose to overwhelm the music. It is only PART of the music / sound spectrum and should not be booming. That is not how it was recorded.Also, if you are on a tight budget, get the HD 555. They have a very similar sound, but not as refined.If you can spar the few extra $$$, definitely go for the HD595.I listened to both side by side and at first it was hard to hear a major difference between the two. I then had my wife try them....she has a better ear for tone, pitch, etc than me....and right away she said the HD 595 were much better overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"headphones","review":"Was not real happy with these,I guest because of not very much bass.Everything else was ok.I just received my Sony extra bass mdr-xb500 and could not be more happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable, Long Wearing, & Accurate Reproduction","review":"Considering the wide range of prices for a solid headphones, not too shabby for a durable set.

The two things I could say are \\"problems.\\" 1. My wife complains that she can hear too much of the music coming out of the side (open-air) ports. 2. I wish the stereo plug was the smaller 3.5mm size. With the adapter on,it sticks too far out of my iPod Touch or my mini stereo to be safe from possible damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Workmanship","review":"Not gonna get into how these sound except to say they sound great. I have no problems with the audio itself. However at this price we should really be getting better build quality. I bought this on Dec 9th 2010 (so around a year and 2 months) and the left side \`handle' that holds the earpiece breaks off from the main headpiece. Huh? How come? I treat all my things very well. This headphone even sits on the stand that comes with it when not in use. Even before this happened I saw a hairline fracture on the left side of the gold portion that houses the earpiece. (that happened about 6 months ago...hopefully it does not get worse.)Honestly... this headphone seems to be made with one specific purpose; to get the consumer to upgrade to their pricier (supposedly more sturdy) models. The guys in marketing got me this time... don't let them get you. -__-2 stars... but only because it still works and sounds pretty decent. How long that will last I have no idea now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Army Soldier","review":"Over all sound quality is pretty good. Maybe not $150 dollars worth. They are very comfortable. The bad things are: They dont block out any outside noise what so ever. The plug that goes into your computer needs an adapter and with the weight of the adapter sticking out and the cord pulling down it bends the plug. It ruined my headphone jack on my computer but widening the metal plates inside that touch the head phone jack so now I have to wiggle it and tape it in place to have constant sound through the head phones. I've had the head phones for about three months and use them every day and the metal plug that plugs into my computer finally bent and snapped off into my computer. If I could go back in time I would have just sucked it up and paid the extra $150 to get the Bose sound cancelling with overall better quality head phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"Unfortunately, I had a great pair of Dr. Dre but I used them with my phone and I lost them. I wanted to replace those with a set that was more comfortable with my glasses. The Sennheiser HD595 did just that but the quality of sound is no where as good. When used with my TV, they need the FiiO E5 Headphone Amplifier. I suggest that if you don't have an eyeglasses problem, get the Dr. Dre."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYERS BEWARE! must read","review":"Ok, so i got the Sennheiser HD595 after reading all the reviews. As most people gave it a higher review, i thought they might actually be a good pair of headphones. So in a few days i got them and saw how badly built they were..! And then i used them, and was even more disappointed. *They only have good sound if there is NO background noise and if you crank up the volume really high!!!* Does not hold in sound.. does not keep out sound. And the comfort is awful too. I returned them the day i got them.Instead of these i would very highly recommend theV-MODA Cross-fade LP Over-Ear Headphones (Gunmetal Black)Extremely stylish, amazing sound, can wear for days and built very well. Buy these instead!! They are around the same price range and much much much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best there is for those on a budget","review":"These headphones are powerful and very very accurate, they sound terrific. Put an amp behind it and it's even better- and if you're going to spend $200 on headphones, do yourself a favor and get an amp.Only caveat is you must keep in mind these are open cans and as such you can't really listen to them in public- the sound goes everywhere. For home listening though, it really doesn't get any better for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding headphones","review":"I was upgrading from Grado SR80s. Though I like the SR80 sound, they get uncomfortable after wearing them for a while. The HD595s are so comfortable I can wear them for hours without trouble. Sound is great, though a little weak with bass. Amazon placed the order with Accessory Genie and they did an outstanding job getting them to me. I contacted their tech support concerning delivery schedule and they were very responsive, even though I sent them a message in the evening. VERY satisfied with the entire purchasing process. The only drawback is that the length of the cable which is very long and I need to keep it tied up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound, but not for areas with *any* noise","review":"As pretty much every other review states, these have fantastic sound. I'm not going to get into that, it's been done.These are an open design headphone, and most complaints about that have been that there is sound bleed out, that is, that people around the wearer can hear sound. I'm not talking about that, either.I'm talking about the fact that I put these on and I can hear any conversation going on just as clear as I could without these on. There is absolutely NO blocking of outside sound. Let me say that again: there is no outside noise reduction whatsoever.I was expecting some bleed-through, but it's really surprising to me how clear outside noise, speech and even keyboard clicks are when wearing these.Again, the sound is fantastic and my music is the clearest I've ever heard it. As far as that goes, I have no complaints.If you are in an office or dorm or any environment with ambient sound, these are likely not going to be for you at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Headphones!!!!Wow!","review":"I have listened to many different headphones and own several in ear and over headphones. These headphones reinvented my entire playlist. I have found my true passion for music come back to me and hear every aspect of the music. The high's are crisp, the mid's are defined, and the bass is punchy when needed. Absolutely worth the price. Would recommend to anyone who has lost interest in thier music. Add a headphone amplifier from [...] and you have a set of headphones that will make your ears cry and simply amaze you from the clarity and sound definition these headphones are capable of. Can wear for hours and forget there on your head, but if in warmer temp's could be a lil warm due to the plush material. No complaints and will for sure buy the next step up Sennhieser HD's if it's possible to outgrow such perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This thing rocks.

While the Beats headphones are more stylish and portable, these trump those headphones on two major points...sound and price. The Sennheiser pair are MUCH more versatile with different types of music from acoustic rock to classical to hip hop. I'm listening to them right now and am astounded. Both sets of headphones are really nice and recommendable, but if sound is more important than style or portability, the Sennheiser 595 are a an outstanding purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headset on the Market!","review":"This headset is by far the most comfortable headphone is ever used.It fits my ears and is not to tight on my head.

I am so lucky to have found these, to have been able to afford them, and to be able to listen to such greatness through these.Buy them. Now. And you will only regret the days that you listened to muddy nonsense or tinny garbage through cheap, over-priced headsets.

They also were the best sounding of all of the Sennheiser headphones including the HD 650's.In the end I purchased the AKG K701's which are brilliant but I may pick up a pair of these as a secondary set. They have a very different sound to the AKG's...Sennheisers are softer on the top end and fuller on the bottom, AKG's are more balance and accurate with a more open sound.Cheers,Gregg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD 595 Headphones are TERRIFIC!","review":"Comparing other headphones in this price range to the Sennheiser HD 595's is like comparing other recent U.S. Presidents to Ronald Reagan.

Check the thread on headfi dot org for the differences.You'll find a picture of a replacement part showing that the drivers are exactly the same.For instructions on how to do the mod, check youtube.As of December 2010, the price difference is about $60.The 595 does come with a nifty headphone holder.I'm not going to return my 595s because I like the headphone holder and then the difference in price isn't really worth the hassle.But if I could do this over again, I would get the 555."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I Expected Plus","review":"I recently started getting into listening to mp3 players at work (about 4-6 hours a day) and was looking for a great sounding and very comfortable set of headphones.

I am by no means an audiophile, I just wanted something that was going to sound great, feel great, and still let me hear the phone if it rings. These do all that.Pros:-Sound wonderful (especially when I use them with my home stereo system)-work with mp3 players, no need for amp-don't even remember you have them on (wear them up to 30 hours a week without discomfort)-comes with a hanger to put them on when your not listening-can still hear if the phone rings or if someone comes to your desk and says somethingCons:-relatively pricey-look just a little ridiculouse in public-have to keep the volume relatively low when there are others around that may be annoyed by the noise"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones; fabulous customer service","review":"Not only do I love these headphones, but Sennheiser itself provided \\"beyond the call\\" service to me recently.

I was pleasantly surprise to find their unique E.A.R. acoustic design gives a Very Natural \\"pseudo-\\"surround effect that works great for movies (yes, the AV receiver was set for Stereo-Only for headphone listening). Very attractive styling; they are large and do not collapse -- they're for home use.

Fit comfortably and can be wore for hours. Even with its relatively high impedience, it can be driven through a regular headphone mini port. However, it performs much better with a headphone amplifier (I used the headphone output on my NAD integrate amp).

It is bucky and pricy -- hence the 4 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headphones","review":"Before buying these I had been a very satisfied owner of a pair of Sennheiser HD590's for a few years. I must say these are yet quite a big improvement on even those headphones. One great thing about these headphones is the low impedance they use (very easily powered without the assistance of an amp). Fantastic choice for PC users such as myself. This is very possibly the best option for the money. The sound is much, much cleaner, and the bass is still just as deep as ever. The design is a huge improvement as well. These are not nearly as bulky as the 590's, with a much more snug, and very comfortable fit. The over-ear design allows for several hours of comfort, as opposed to most on-ear phones, which used to irritate and make my ears very sore after short periods of time. These headphones can get very loud. I keep system master volume at about 50% and usually wind up turning the volume way down on most applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"need a good soundcard to bring out the full potential","review":"First of all, i want to say, this is the best headphone ive ever used that doesnt require an amp.

When you realized all along in your life, what you're listening is actually not what is intended, you get pissed off. When you put on this headphone, the same song you listen with the 20$ is tottally different with this hd595. It will literally blow you away, that why i used the term \\"life changer\\". This applies to true music lover only because those are the poeple who actually cares about the quality of music that is going through your ears, like myself, that why i recommend this headphone.Because this soundcard to so detailed, bad onboard soundcard might produce some sound glitches.

Was wearing the headset yesterday and working fine, then all of a sudden smelt a bad odor kind like something in the room was shorting out and came to find that inside the earpiece where the batteries are it smoked the unit. Opened it up and battery housing area was blackened and confirmed the unit toasted itself. No heat or injury to me but now I have a dead product and both Amazon and 17th St Photo won't replace the unit. Claim no one-year guarentee even on product defect like this.

What a way to end a long and mostly good business relationship. Happy New Year."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely annoying","review":"Whatever good qualities this product has are absolutely erased by the fact that these headphones will turn themselves off automatically when the music is too low, which means that any song that even attempts something interesting will trigger the effect.Here is how the experience goes down, which is almost like getting an electric shock that you know is coming:- you're playing your music and it has some subtle, low parts (soundtracks, classical, ambient, etc.)- there is a brief moment when the sound in the headphones cuts out, which isn't too bad.- there follows a transition to harsh static at the top volume of the headphone, which is like an ice pick to your brain.This design, which apparently was created to save power, is completely idiotic since they didn't need to play anything at all if power savings was the objective. The end result is a horrible experience where you just wait for the shock throughout the music. Do not buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"This unit came highly rated so I bought it unseen. After hooking it up, the reception is horrible.

Overall I am very happy with these headphones. I was looking for wireless headphones so I could watch my DVR recorded TV shows without bothering my wife. I do agree with some of the issues mentioned in other reviews, loose fit, popping, etc. but for my use they work just great. Sitting only 15 feet from the source I don't encounter any static, popping or fading issues. I haven't tried music with them so I can't speak to those issues. It was a great deal for some decent headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed!","review":"I have been back living with my parents for about a year now. And while there are many perks to it (no rent) there has been one MAJOR drawback. My father is going deaf. Like completely in his right ear and about 40% in his left. On top of this, he is a night owl and wants to watch random t.v. in the middle of the night. I go to work at 8 am so I am sure you can see how this doesn't work out. But I finally had the bright idea to get him these for Christmas and it has already proven to be the most amazingly brilliant thing ever. He was up almost all last night and I wasn't bothered at all.

The range of operation is fine with minimal buzz or interference. I can't speak to the longevity of the headphones but I can tell you that you will need to replace, at once, the batteries that are supplied. Even after initially charging the recommended 12+ hours we could not get more than 2-3 hours of operation before recharging was required.

The sound quality is great, they are comfortable for long periods of time, and they are easy to charge. The initial hookup was simple and I was up and running in minutes. The range is also very good as I have walked around the house listening to the TV without any interference or static. No hissing or backdrop noise when the volume is turned down on the HEADPHONES and up on the TV. They look kind of goofy on me and other family members but it's fine for just wearing around the house.

My purpose is to augment my reduced hearing acuity. The speakers of my 60\\" Samsung are in the back and the sound is fine for my wife but \\"muffled\\" for me. This headset does the trick. The volume is set on the TV comfortable for my wife and on my headset comfortable for me. This has been particularly helpful watching soccer games from the UK and Spain where the commentators' accents are sometimes difficult to understand. As a minor negative, I too, believe they should have separated the tuning device from the volume contol by a little more distance to avoid moving the wrong one. The headset is comfortable and the set-up was straight forward. I did not need to adjust anything on the TV set itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhh...freedom","review":"I love this headset!

The convenience of not changing the battery every week and a half is a plus. I bought a Kensington Headphones from Walmart prior to the Sennheiser and it broke within 3 weeks.

For some reason, after a couple of minutes without sound the base unit shuts off and that causes the headphones to blast you with extremely loud static. While browsing the internet, if I go to a site like YouTube I turn them on but if I forget to turn them off in a couple of minutes I get a harsh blast.

Range is great, they are very comfortable, sound quality is awesome, and you can fine tune the signal and volume on the headphones. If the signal strength gets too low, the headphones disconnect from the transmitter and broadcasts a ear-popping array of screetches, pops, and buzzes. This has nothing to do with distance from the transmitter, but rather the volume of the original source. I find that I have to turn up my TV or computer to a louder than normal level and turn down the volume on the headphones to avoid these nasty noises.For the price of the product, this issue is really not acceptable.

The first time I used them, it took a couple of minutes to select just the right frequency for minimum noise, but I haven't had to play with the settings since. My only gripe would be the automatic volume adjustment feature that can't be turned off. When I play video games or watch DVDs, whenever I hit a menu or some other section with no sound, the headphones try to compensate by increasing the gain, which results in a buzzing sound.

This headphone solved the problem. The only thing I find annoying is that the volume of the TV must be turned up enough so that the headphones can pick up the signal. But the volume required doesn't disturb others in the house who prefer to sleep. My pet gripe is that actors on nearly all TV dramas seem to think that moving one's lips and pronouncing their lines distinctly is unrealistic. Then, the sound recorder dubs in the background music too loud realtive to the actors' mumblings. Also, when commercials come on, you have to adjust the headphones volume. But you can't have your sound and hear it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"Started out OK, but next day no output from right speaker. Amazon replaced it in one day!

The volume & tuner bottoms are \\"wheel turning type\\", you can easyly loose your frequency if you just scratch your ear or simply by turning your head, and to tune back to the right frequency is a big challege, the stalics is constant, the volume is not consistant, one side is so much louder than the other one (they are design like this, but this one is way off the scale), The charges works just like the RS130. Only thing I like is saving you $30 buck, but I can not get though the tuner button( RS130 is push button), so we return it the next day and got ourself another RS130."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works, it works!(....but only when it works)","review":"Well...you have to be careful with this purchase.

After having tripped, tangled, snapped and spilled stuff with my wired headphones so far, I thought a wireless headphone would be my savior. But the static in these things is just unbearable. It's not that there's a lot of it, but when you keep hearing that sharp crackle every minute or so, you tend to get a headache after a while. And nothing really helps it - tried different channels, different placements, different angles, just doesn't work. You might say the Sennheiser ones are the better ones compared to other wireless ones, but after my experience I think my cheap in ear headphones are a lot better than these."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy","review":"I bought this headset for my husbands birthday (he wanted a set with an extra long cord - he didn't even know wireless existed! lol). After much investigation regarding wireless headphones I thought I would give these a try. He loves them. He can walks all around the house, and outside and he gets great reception, and the cd player is in the basement. Also, the headset is not hard to recharge, you just place it on the charging cradle, it's not rocket science, I don't understand why some reviews here list that as a problem, you'ld have to be a total buffoon to screw it up.One small thing Ladies, I find myself calling, Rich, RICH, more and more now, before I was only NOT heard over sports, now I have added this new nightmare to the mix!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"they are good but not perfect.","review":"Sound quality is great.

Great sound and no static due to the awesome easy tuning. I use them while I'm on the treadmill and they tend to slip a bit. The range is exceptionally good and they receive well through walls.I wore them outside to the mailbox which is over 100 feet from the house and they still had great sound. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that the tuning and volume dials are so close together. I guess it's just a matter of getting use to. Other than that it is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, a few things buyers should know","review":"The major imperfection I've discovered is they don't stay securely in place when I bend over or move quickly. So wearing these during yoga or other vigorous activity may not work. The sound is very good and I do not experience the hiss some have mentioned, at least within my 900 sq ft. condo. It all hooks up easily (in my case to my stereo receiver). I have noticed some interference (again it's a condo), but the ability to change channels and fine tune makes it pretty easy to solve. I think the range gets overstated. I was able to get a (fading) signal about 100 feet down a corridor (while doing laundry) but lost the signal in the thick walls of the laundry room. No biggie. In terms of comfort, I find my ears and neck start to feel a little strain after a couple of hours. That's to be expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rechargable Battery Problem","review":"Charged unit and it only lasted for 20 minutes before the batteries went dead. We then replaced the batteries that came with the unit with different ones and charged the unit again.

Nothing BUT hissing and popping sounds came from this headset!! So I used them for about 1 hour when they first arrived and for the second time I've had them on my head, NOTHING!! And yes, I did try to tune them by changing the setting on both the base and earphone, without any success!!The return window expired in October!!That'll learn me!!

Not in my surroundings.","review":"I purchased this item largely because one review claimed a range of 300 feet, although the \\"technical specifications\\" listed say 120 feet. I can tell you that the range is not 300' at my home, and it may not be the advertised 120'.

Works well once you find the right frequency. Works all around my house.Cons: Unless you're using the 3.5mm adapter, this is a piece of garbage, best used as a paper weight. If ther eis no sound coming from the source (like if you're watching a movie and fall asleep and the movie ends) there is a loud (and I mean frightening loud) pop that is sure to wake you up in a panic when it returns to default power saver. Also a constant humming no matter how well you match the frequency"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased with these","review":"I bought these because of the high rating on amazon. I thought wireless headphones would be great. I could dance around or get things done with them on. Not so. The reception is dreadful. I get hissing and if I move any more than 10 feet from my receiver the sound is horrid. I'd also like to point out that the speaker itself it just a flat squared off piece that is supposed to sit on your ear. There is no cushion around the speaker to help keep it on. I have never seen anything like this. They hardly stay on... maybe just maybe if you want these to watch t.v. quietly they might be alright but for music, not a good idea. I would've return them but I had moved shortly after I bought them and they were sitting in a box for a great deal of time. I would not recommend these at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the real deal!","review":"Easy to set up. Very comfortable to wear. Crystal clear sound. What more do you need?

Constantly spatters noises, tz - tz when switching TV from channel to channel or just turn head, and to top it all, I feel it's my fault because the model offers a spinning wheel to tune the headphones. Who the heck tunes headphones talking to own base. is it cb station? If you dare to miss with this little wheel just one tiny turn of the teeth off of what the magician sitting inside this device approved as correct position, lo and behold, the sound appears in the right headphone only. The sound is mostly of good quality, but nobody would blame you if you feel deaf on the left ear. Returning this item the day I got it. Giving it 2 stars because it still a useable product. One has to keep in mind, loud bangs produced by electric discharge in low quality audio devices is a health hazard. People working in environments with this kind of noises wear earplugs full time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate","review":"Perfectly adequate for watching TV or listening to the radio without disturbing your spouse.

I feared I'd be unable to balance the low volume my husband likes through the loudspeakers connected to the TV with what I need through the headphones. I connected them to the headphone jack on the front of my stereo receiver, switched them on and tuned to the TV. It works great. My husband keeps the remote to adjust as needed and I use the volume control on the headphones. Now, I can relax and watch the show rather than straining to understand the dialog. Since I'm connected to an FM receiver I've also been listening to radio shows from anywhere in the house without disturbing my husband. It's all more than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review for the layman","review":"Okay, I am not an audiophile so I am not going to describe bass levels and the rest of the hokum that 95% of people shopping for this product don't care about. These headphones, for the price, are great. If you have a small space, children, spouse who goes to bed early, these are perfect for watching TV without disturbing anyone. Also, because they are headphones, you actually hear the sound much better than from your regular TV and you really don't need to crank the volume very loud so as to risk damaging your hearing.LAYMAN ALERT:: If you have a digital TV, (which if you don't at this point,what are doing shopping for wireless headphone-you SHOULD be shopping for a flat screen) you will need a few products. Order a Toslink cable, about a $1.50ish a digital to analog audio converter ($5ish)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I received the headphones in a timely manner and am happily surprised at how good they worked.

I never heard from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shockingly bad design...","review":"I read the positive reviews for this product and made my purchase based on those reviews. But this is a poorly designed product. The overall look and feel of it is fine, but there is an \\"auto-shutoff\\" feature that is incredibly annoying. I use this product at my computer, and if the sound turns off for a minute (or if the sound becomes low, like you've turned down the volume so that the music is playing softly) the transmitter automatically turns off and you're greeted with a din of static into your ears at full volume. There appears to be no away around this. And, as others commented on, there is constantly a hiss in the background. Was this product ever tested? And what philistine thought the auto shut-off feature was a good idea? Not worth your money. If I had to buy again, I'd get one with cables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I own quite a few headphones by Sennheiser and in general I like them. Their price/performance ratio is hard to beat. RS-120, from the other hand, turned out to be a total disappointment. At first, there is high frequency hissing noise on all channels. At second, pads do not \\"envelope\\" ears, they are sitting flat against them and do not reduce environment noise at all (contrary to ad). At third, charging station, while looking cute, is a pain to use. It is not easy to set headphones on it in such a way that contact is established and charging light come up. I do not recommend these headphones to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"This is my first wireless headphone purchase so I can't say if the problems I experienced are inherent in all wireless headphones or are unique to these phones. Nor can I say for sure if there was interference specific to my home. I certainly am no audiophile but I have to say I was disappointed in my overall listening experience. There is a very distinct humming sound in the headphones. It is particularly noticeable during periods of silence. I found the playback quality of the music to be acceptable, but the crackle and humming very annoying. I tried to no avail, to tune the noise out by changing to each of the three available channels. Of course the music drowns out the background noise but the silent portions of a track or album are often a significant part of the overall listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my Needs","review":"Allows me to move around the office without dangling ear-bud wires or having to carry my iPhone around with me.

I tried without success to make them work. Further, they didn't fit well. The ear pieces are flat and press on the ear, rather than cupping or enclosing the ear. There is uncomfortable pressure on the ear and if you bend over, they slip off. I went back to using my old headphones that work perfectly.

They have absolutely no bass whatsoever, and the volume distortion breaking point is only about half way. So no volume either, unless you like the clicking and twitching sound of over burdened speakers. I tried a variety of music styles and formats, along with various types of players. I also used both the headphone jack and the RCA direct line-outs. The RCA lines sounded *slightly* cleaner, but not much. Also, they are NOT AT ALL Silent to the people around you.I must add that I did not have any interference, humming or static that other people were persistently complaining about. The volume and tuning knob locations don't bother me either. Build quality is as good as anything else coming out of China these days, not good, not bad. They are comfortable, and the charging system is well designed and effortless to use.All in all, the sound is the most important feature. Unfortunately they fail miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clicking sounds, too big for my head","review":"I knew I was taking a chance ordering these headphones, as other reviewers had mentioned that they are wide and they still had problems with hissing / clicking sounds.

Terrible -- don't know why they're not adjustable that way.

I use them with both my stereo (lp's and cd's) and tv/dvd so as to not disturb others. Only negatives are with the tv when I mute the commercials a sudden loud hiss scares the #*%! out of me! Also the headphones are too hot when i wear them in the workshop or cleaning up but fine for sitting around. I am now purchasing the rs 180's after reading a number of reviews hoping for even better performance and sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Really like these headphones. They sound great. Easy to hook up. I listen to them when the wife goes to bed at night. They even work in another room from the base.

Don't plan to dance with these on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its like listening to vinyl records but not as good","review":"Well, I got this product based on the reviews on this site, and I have to say, I am very disapointed with the quality of these headphones that carry the Sennheiser name. What cheap junk these headphone are! Super crappy sound quality, a hiss like a vinyl record you can't get rid of no matter what channel you put it on. The sound quality is a bit better than AM radio. Don't waist your money on these. If you are into high quality sound, these are not for you. I think sony makes better ones that are acceptable quality sound, but certainly much better than these. I have a new nickname for them as I will use them on my computer, Suckheiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Got the product for Christmas and so far it has performed great.

I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great peace keeper","review":"Theses are the 2nd pair of wireless headphones I have owned and are by far the best. They help keep the peace around the house between my wife and I, I like it loud and she wants quiet. Guess who wins!! Sound quality is great and I have not had any interferance problems. The only issue I have is the size adjustment, for me they fit fine because I have a large head, but for the kids and my wife they are a bit big althoughthey stay on as long as they don't move around too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Timer's Review","review":"This is a high quality product.

Just terrible.","review":"Unless I got a defective product, I just don't understand the good reviews for this. The reception is bad. I constantly had to adjust the sound and there was frequently some extra buzzing or something. Worst of all, sometimes it would just lose connection with the base and I'd have to go to the base and fiddle with it.I was not using this outside the bounds of normal use either. I wasn't moving around. I was less than 10 feet away. I just wanted to watch TV late at night in my bed. I had better wireless headphones 7 YEARS AGO! Too bad I can't find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good service by distributor but bad product","review":"I was impressed by the customer service but the product was not so good. The reception was terrible and the did not service its purpose for design. The charging cradle is misleading because it doesn't really charge. The headset requires batteries and the cradle only holds the headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reliability disaster","review":"I bought these headphones for my father-in-law for his Christmas present last year as he lives with us and his hearing is not good.

But they otherwise fit well and have good sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"the answer to a lot of research","review":"I spent A LOT of time looking for wireless headphones. Stumbled across these and kept coming back to it as a possibility. I ordered them and they are AWESOME!! Hook-up is simple enough and the sound quality is great no matter how far from the base I am. The recharge feature is so convenient; I don't have to worry about batteries!! The only downside is that the frame is a little big causing it to slide occasionally, but never off completely. Its adjustabily just doesn't count for smaller heads. All in all, a great buy. ^_^ definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones work well, but there's background noise","review":"Sennheiser RS120 are the first wireless headphones I've owned, so I can't tell how the level of background noise compares to other products. However, the quality of sound is clearly inferior to that in wired headphones. The phones have a tuning control, which can be used to find the frequency with least noise, but the best it can produce is still imperfect. Nevertheless this product is very convenient if wired phones won't do, and even if the quality of sound isn't perfect it's still good enough for watching TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine product!","review":"These wireless phones were purchased to replace some Sony's that were damaged by a lightning strike (NOT while on my head.) I have owned 3 sets of the Sony product, and wanted to try something else. The Sennheisers are very impressive by comparison. Since the basics of this product are fairly straightforward, there aren't many bells and whistles to rate. They fit well, hold a charge well and the sound quality is loud and clear. The Sony product may hold a slight edge in ear comfort, but it's a close call.So far, I really like these Sennheisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product.","review":"I bought these for my husband for christmas. He loves them and the sound is excellant. You hear more of the background sounds than you do on the tv. Like a built in stereo. Also he can put the volume at any level and the tv can be low or even off for them to still work. Would recommend these for anyone, not just for those who have a hearing problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done plan on moving around in these.","review":"I like wireless headphones because I can't sit still. I garden, clean; boring tasks that don't take a brain and I listen to CNN or talk shows. These things sit on top of my ears and fall off with the smallest movement. If you want wireless headphones for sitting on the couch or in bed these will do fine. They are comfortable but I wish I had sent them back the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Headphones","review":"This is a great product!

No help from Sennheiser for several reasons; 2months out of warranty, the RS130 was discontinued, and there are no replacements. While it worked I enjoyed watching TV in peace, hence 2 stars.

The price made me think it was higher quality than it was. That attitude made me a sucker, because my headphones died after several months. The wiring inside it has such a small diameter, it wears out in no time. My headphones short-circuited one day, ceased to charge up, quit picking up any sound, and finally went dead. An examination of the wiring showed me it was little better than filament wire. Can't they afford to beef up the wiring so the device will last awhile?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructions clearly state: Does not work near/with TV's","review":"Bought this because my wife is hearing impaired and cannot hear the TV. Much to my astonishment we could get ZERO reception from ANY distance of our TV. After reading the instructions I found a footnote that says electronics can cause interference, especially TVs and you should put the base unit as far from them as possible.YES YOU READ CORRECTLY. The manufacturer states that electronics (especially TV's) can be incompatible with these headphones.Please note you have about 3 foot of cord to get the base unit away from electronics... this was not far enough to make any difference for us. We will be testing this on other TV's but my advice is that you can't afford to take the risk that this won't work on your TV. (Yes our TV headphone jack works on other headphones).My advice is to keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good","review":"I've had these headphones for a couple of months now, and I have no complaints.

And then after a month or so of occasional use it stopped working, and so I shipped it back to Sennheiser. They acknowledged receipt of it, and now it's three weeks later and I haven't heard back from them.Three weeks to repair or replace a defective part is unacceptable, in my opinion.Update: I emailed Sennheiser to ask about the status and they replied that they HOPE to look at my product within the NEXT TWO WEEKS!

I thought this headset would solve the problem. Wrong. Two problems.1. About every 15 min. the unit stops sending a signal. I have to disconnect and reconnect the cable to the audio out to regain the signal.2. The Major problem is that the headset volume is pegged to the TV volume. Turn up the TV and you higher volume on the headset. Turn down the TV volume the headset volume goes down. I can't adjust the volume up enough to really hear when the TV volume is set low. If my wife is not in the room I can unplug the audio in cables to the TV and turn up the volume to hear. But this only works if we are not watching the same program. So much for sharing the same program.Headset is comfortable and sound quality is good but volume control and transmitter are not up to snuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Counting on quality from the Sennheiser name, I was disappointed as the transmitter wouldn't power up.

I would recommend these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for my intended use","review":"I wanted a pair of wireless headphones I could use on the treadmill. Based on the reviews, I thought this might be a good fit. I tried to get these to work, but they just didn't. There was constant cracking and humming. I tried everything to limit it, but nothing helped. I moved the receiver, I spent a lot of time tuning, I spent time adjusting the source....nothing produced the sound quality others have mentioned. In addition to that, even with the volume at 100 on the source AV, the headphones did not produce a loud enough sound to completely block out the sound of the treadmill (or allow me to get into the workout). If you can figure out how to eliminate the hissing and cracking, these might be OK for use in bed. Other than that, I don't see a benefit. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"The sound these headphones produces is very very flat, no base. They are also very uncomfortable. After about an hour worth of use, my ears physically hurt from the lack of contour with the foam on the ear. The range on these headphones are NOT as advertised, either. I step 20 feet from my desk, and get static. Also, if you turn your head away from the receiver, you get an earful of really loud static. These headphones may look good, but don't live up their sales pitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Fail","review":"For me this thing was a complete flop. It's ill fitting and uncomfortable. It worked marginally well the first day except for a loud POP about every 4 minutes. The second day it lasted about 90 seconds then I could only get a loud static noise after the loud pop. The only way to get sound was to un-plug the jack and re-plug it, but then again after 90 seconds, etc etc etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Range is short and if you turn your head it gets out of tune and you hear a lot of static.

Amazon refunded promply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"I couldn't be more pleased with a purchase than these headsets. The sound quality is excellent, easy to wear, but could be a bit smaller, which would be the only change I would make. I wear them all over the house and they maintain excellent reception. I like to watch television to go to sleep, my husband does not. These have saved multiple arguments over turning the TV down. :) I wear them a lot and have yet to run out of battery life. As for the sound, it turns our regular television into a surround sound -- not actually, but it seems that way. Being older, 60 to be exact, it also makes the dialogue much clearer.I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for good headsets for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very noisy","review":"I bought this headphones couple of years ago. Over the last year, when I raise or lower the volume, I can hear very bad noise or statics over the headphones. By touching the knobs, the statics overpower the music. I had to take the headphone apart at one time to clean the electronics, that was good for couple of months, now it's worse. I might end buying the RS 140 now, since not too many companies make good quality wireless headphones, I still have hopes in sennheiser, and I'm willing to give them another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought these for my husband. Happy first father's day, I bought you a pair of crappy headphones. He's using them with his computer so as not to get distracted when working at home. Firstly, they're kind of bulky. The bar over the head is so oddly shaped, but he does have a small head. Then we plugged them in, it was easy to get going, but everyone in the room can hear what's going through the headphones. Sound quality was good but definitely not discreet or contained. The padding on the ears are flat rather than cupping around the ears, which relate to the lack of containing sound but also lends to being uncomfortable. We gave up pretty early in so can't comment to the charging, batteries, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones For Quiet Work Environment!","review":"Had the headphones for about a month now and have really enjoyed using them in our quiet work environment. Range is really incredible. As long as I don't mind looking like a dork walking around the office!! Only complaint I have is the the earpads. I really wish they were the \\"over the ear\\" (earcup?) style, rather than just flat against the ear. I'd feel better about increasing the volume a little bit. Recharging and controls are really easy and I have had no problem using them for nine hours straight and not needing a recharge."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY poor fit","review":"If they won't stay on your head there is no need to comment on the sound. I can't imagine anyone being satisfied with the fit unless they have a square head. I have a fairly normal sized head and they are very loose fitting. They fall off when I move my head. Worst fit for head phones I have seen. I modified mine and they are somewhat improved but still objectionable. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"I have used these headphones for about 5 months and pretty much hate them, here's why.* the stand allows you to select 3 different discrete frequencies, but the headphones make you tune it in to the right frequency with an analog knob, which is awkward, imprecise and is always getting knocked when I adjust volume. If there's 3 possible frequency settings on the base, there should be 3 on the headphones.* after a minute of no output from your computer the headphones will generate static VERY loudly into your ears. Apparently this is to save \\"battery\\" life, I'm not sure how generating very loud static saves any battery life, and since all you need to do on your PC to start them up again is press play, so clearly it hasn't turned off the receiver. If it went dead silent that would be fine, but generating static is annoying/pointless.I'm not an audiophile, I don't care about the sound quality so much, I just want an easy to use pair of wireless headphones, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless headphones from A","review":"Headphones were exactly as described. The way you charge the headphones is very convenient, just place them on the wire holder.

Tons of static and even after hours of tuning, I could not get them to work in a satisfactory manner. When I did have them on my head, they never fell off and although the pads are foam and not leatherette, they were comfortable. Unfortunately, comfort means nothing if all you get is static.The Amazon experience was also ugly - the order did not ship for a month, and when I returned it, I had to call them after several weeks to ask where the refund was."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have \\"listened\\"","review":"I wanted these so badly that I ignored all the reviews that discuss hiss and background noise. Even worse, the right speaker goes in and out. All of the noise is also in the right speaker and it comes and goes (but never goes away).I've tried all of the adjustments over and over again in the month I have had them and I give up. I wasted $70 and am now looking for good wireless headphones. It's nobody's fault but my own. I didn't \\"listen\\" to the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the cord !!!!","review":"What a horrible waste of my hard earned dollars this product is !!! First up, the headphones constantly refuse to stay put, they keep sliding forwards down off the front of my head. Second up, the random bursts of loud static and clicks and pops render this system useless no matter what the sound source or transmitter orientation, a simple A/B comparison versus a corded headphone told me a Radio Shack 100ft extension cord and a good set of headphones outperforms this setup by far !!!! I guess the one good thing I could possibly say about the Sennheiser RS120 is that it's range is excellent, 300ft of the same [...] !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love them...I'm buying another pair!!!","review":"After using my first pair for the past 6 months, I have decided to buy another set. I have my current set connected to my computer.

I can go into my garage, and empty out the garbage without missing any of my music as I listen to my music collection on my iTunes.The base charges the batteries without any problems. I am still using the original batteries, and they still hold a good change so I can watch several movies with doing a rechange in between the movies.I'm sure you will love this headphone as much as I do. With the price, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The sound from these is very good, as long as it stays tuned in to the base which for me wasn't very long at a time. They have an analog tuner on the headphones that you tune into the frequency of the base. It was like an old car radio from the seventies and before, every time I'd turn my head I'd have to readjust them. I wasn't far from the base either, generally within 5 feet. There was a constant hiss in the background all the time also. I have a $20 cordless phone that hisses less than these did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for people with small heads","review":"Even at the smallest setting, it slid off my head at the tiniest motion.

The previous died after about 3 years. The new unit performs well. The instructions for setup and maintenance are severely lacking. It gave no charging instructions.

It doesn't charge without fussing around, the batteries always go dead - very quickly - and now there is static that is just random and is uncomfortable. All of this happened after the 30 day return policy, so we are stuck with a very expensive product that will not work.

Temperamental and unreliable, if the audio signal fades (You Tube video ends for instance) after about 20 seconds the headset blares static and it needs to be turned off and set back on the base to reset.. also have to unplug the cable from the computer to the base. When it works, the audio is pretty good but the frustration factor makes this a horrible purchase. Highly recommend NOT buying this headset -more frustrating than convenient. This morning the headset wouldn't sync up at all which reminded me to finally post this review.Also, the headset is rather large and the contact points are slick so if you want something to listen with while being active (besides sitting) I'd find something else. It is comfortable but if you are doing dishes while listening then it may end up in the sink -not that I'd cry if the thing was ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon","review":"I bought this based on reviews, upgrading from Sony wireless headphones, for TV use.

Glad I bought it on Amazon, where I could return easily. Went back to the Sony brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take bad reviews into account, I did not","review":"I researched for a pair of wireless headphones for 1 week in several websites, even checked lots of reviews in Amazon (specially the bad ones). But since this product is showing an incredible amount of good reviews I decided to purchase them and they worked perfectly for the first 2 weeks. I even though of entering another 5 stars review in Amazon, but in the third week they just started turning off after a couple of minutes of usage. I did all the troubleshooting but honestly they just do not work as marketed. Since I'm still under the 30 day warranty, Amazon refunded my money.Bottom line, whenever shopping around take the bad reviews into consideration because people usually leave a good or excellent review for the first days of usage. Big mistake !!! This headphones are not reliable at all.

There is so much interference on these it's unbelievable. Please take these out of your store so that no one else falls victim to this scam. I'm serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sounding headphones I have ever experienced!","review":"I am an audio artist and DJ. These headphones may have been damaged out of the box, because they were one of the worst sounding headphones I have ever experienced. They were distorted and seemed to never tune-in properly. They were tinny and had no low end at all which is a must, as I purchased these phones for DJ announcing. I have owned other Sennheiser studio headphones and they were great.With the very strong possibility these headphones were not damaged, I didn't even bother to try another pair, because I was already convinced of their inferiority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this product thinking that I could put the TV in \\"mute\\" and continue to enjoy the programs. However, it doesn't work in mute mode and often cuts off even when the volume is 1/3 of full volume. At this sound level, I don't need a wireless headphone, so making this product practically useless for the purpose I bought it for.Sounds great though if working properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Instructions!","review":"When I FINALLY was able to set these up, they seem to work well. The instruction sheet was awful!! Step one - establish necessary connections. OK, and those would be???? There should be a description and picture of each component - I'm clearly technically challenged, but it would have saved me some time to dig out the power supply for the transmitter had I known it was in the box! The charging cradle feature is great, had it been explained more clearly. Set up shows only to connect to audio out. I know there are several devices you can use these with, stereo, TV, PC, etc. Would it be too much to ask to show some set up options, say with a home theater system, or to mention that you may have to turn your TV audio down so you only hear through the headphones? My initial impression of sound, range etc is good, but honestly I'm too frazzled from the frustration of setting these up with useless instructions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwearable","review":"I love my RS 140's, but the RS 120's are totally unwearable. You need a pretty large head for these to fit snugly, and there's no way to adjust them. So, I'd advise trying them on somewhere before buying, especially if you're buying for someone with a smaller head. They're just made of thin foam wrapped around the speaker - nothing anywhere near as comfortable or form-fitting as the RS140s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Auditorum: Listener Beware","review":"Reviewing a product when you've only had it for a little while--and the honeymoon's still going on--is certainly valuable. Is it as advertised? Is it any good? How's the build quality? If I had written a review back in October of 2010 when I got these headphones, I might have given them 4 stars. TV rarely involves critical listening, so what if they were a little boomy? And so what if the earpieces have less padding than a Motel 6 mattress? They worked well enough for me. Well, not any more. After just two years and two months, they no longer hold a charge; they go for at most 45 minutes when the batteries are supposedly full. Not good enough. And BTW, it looks like they have almost doubled in price. I paid $58.20, and now they're close to a hundred. My advice? Listen elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser RS 120","review":"I sent the product back. My husband was not pleased with it. Not a clear sound. Music is real important to my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable, except the loud hiss when no signal","review":"Very comfortable, but a bit loose on head, if you lean forward t0hey often fall off. The sound quality is good, but I often have trouble getting a good signal (maybe some interference on my end). The worst part of these headphones is when the cpu is no longer sending a sound signal a loud static hiss starts, because the base unit has an auto-shutoff (which cannot be disabled). These are not a good set of headphones if you fall asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally good","review":"The range is great. Tuning is a little delicate. Was picking up a phone conversation a couple of times. Changing the frequency helped. They have stopped tranmitting a few times. Turning the TV off and back on seems to reset it. Not sure if it is the transmitter or the batteries. When tuned in well the sound quality is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanity Saver","review":"Why didn't I buy these before? The tv is in the family room next to the kitchen - I complain of the tv, the kids complain of the kitchen noise. And these headphones were the answer. My son can even walk up to his room upstairs and hear the hockey game! They do leak sound a bit, so not good for someone looking for headphones to wear next to someone sleeping... but are fine for regular use. They also look big and heavy, but not so. My kids (preteens) find them comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"Worked fine for about two months, then the unit wouldn't turn on anymore. The red charging light would come on as normal while the headphones were charging, but when I put them on and increased the TV volume to activate the on/off green indicator light on the transmitter base, it just wouldn't come on. Just static through the headphones.I then unplugged the transmitter for 30 seconds, removed the batteries, reinserted them as the troubleshooting instructions say to do and still nothing. Turning the tuning wheel and switching to any of the three channels on the transmitter base didn't seem to help, either.Needless to say, this product is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Headphone","review":"I use it daily, good sound quality and allows privacy or sound adjustment for my wife at her discretion. The charging system is convenient and sure beats the first system I bought requiring replaceable batteries. It was affordable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going bald","review":"If you do not with to have hair on your head, use his headset. The connecting band, which is configured to be the means of charging it, will grab your hair and pull it off. Regrettably, I only noticed this after losing about a third of my hair. The thin plastic covering of the earcups also wears out quickly. It becomes a torn and tattered mess after about a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing technology","review":"The Sennheiser RS 120 wireless headphones are perfect for my situation. I am very impressed with the range and extended battery life I get from them. My old pair only lasted about 8 hours without charging. The Sennheiser's go at least 12 or more. I haven't had an opportunity to use them longer than that so I don't know when they quit. The only minor glitch with them is the crackling I hear every so often. It seems to be in the audio stream of the digital satellite broadcast. On other occasions, I can only hear from the right ear piece. Other than that they work great.JesseJ, Indiana"},{"rating":"2","title":"great item, as advertised.","review":"The RS120's are exactly as advertised. Setup is easy as can be, as is charging. Just set them on the cradle. It's kind of a drag to have to fine tune the reception, but once you dial it in, the audio is clear and static-free (sitting about 10-12 ft from the unit). It fades out a bit when I get up and go to the kitchen with them on, but is still clear and keeps me in touch with what's going on.Audio quality is what it is. Do not expect high-end headphone quality. Period. Do not expect sub-woofer lows. Do expect to get everything you need from sports, news, sitcoms, etc. without anyone else in the house or even the same room hearing it. My bedroom opens up over the living room and my wife often goes to bed an hour or two earlier than I do. I can watch the whole second half of a game without bothering her a bit - as long as I keep my outbursts to a minimum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"I bought these because I currently own another pair of Sennheiser headphones and they sound great. This item was a real disappointment. The power cord did not attach properly and would turn on and off with the slightest jiggle.

These are too bulky and uncomfortable. Also they slide off your head when you happen to look down. It would be a better product if the ear cups were hollowed out. The band across the top of your head is very uncomfortable. You can solve that by wearing a baseball cap but who wants to do that. I will say that the sound quality is pretty good. I ended up buying a less expensive set of headphones for 37$. They are very comfortable and have very good sound quality.You can't beat the price and quality of Audio Unlimited."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV Headphones","review":"I bought the headphones as a present for my father and was impressed with the quality of sound (and volume).

I have placed everything where it needs to go, checked and recheck and yet still nothing! I'll give this one more day to charge up and then if that fails I'll have to return for a refund! I'm going to be optimistic though. Amazon hasn't failed me yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"They're as good as, if not Better than, any theater's surround system I've heard. As for the cut-out some reviewers mentioned, yes I lose the signal after about 4-5 minutes of silence such as when they roll the credits (silently) at the end of a TV movie. But it's easy to reconnect again. My only (minor) complaint is that the volume control wheel is too recessed, and not in a location where your hand 'normally falls' when you reach for it, but I'll adjust for that in a short time. Note: The Green LED on the transmitter will stay on for a few minutes even though you've turned off the TV, because (at least with my 1990's model), they had capacitors in the circuitry that hold a charge for a while after the power is shut off to the TV set. So, if the Green LED is On (indicating that the transmitter is getting audio from the source...but then goes dark (at least, for an older TV), that's natural when a TV with capacitors is being used as the audio source, and does NOT indicate any problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Head size","review":"I am a woman and the headphones are just too big for me. -slipping every time my head moves.

I plugged it into my Roku player so I can watch shows while my girlfriend studies.- There is frequently interference, like a static hiss. This happens almost every time, regardless of the volume settings. It is not due to range...I sit about six feet from the transmitter. This huge negative overshadows any other issue, such as fit, price, or sound quality, none of which are stellar anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Product!","review":"The product is everything and more.

Quick delivery. I have to say I was shocked when I unpacked them. Absolutely cheap plastic junk. I thought because they were of German design the device would be of quality materials. Wrong. I plugged in the 9VDC power supply (very cheap looking) and observed a green led power light. When I unplugged and plugged the connector back into the unit, no power light. Tried several times.

I did read some pretty bad ones on this product, however, another thing I consider is the number of 3 or less star reviews compared to 4 and 5. So I took a chance and must say these headphones are working very well for me. The range is awesome with hardly any interference, the battery lasts long enough and the cycle of pleasing is sufficient.Yes the volume and tuning wheels are close, but not too close so long as you're careful. Only thing for me is the light weight, overall this is a merry thing, except when I need to tie my shoes or swing my head around wildly (which I often do when reviewing here).

Could hear sound but not distinguish words the RS120 has been a blessing. The sound quality is as good as the TV and can go from room to room and outside and not miss a thing. The headset is a little large but the quality of the product is worth this small objection. Was plug and play in seconds and has great range of volume. Would recommend to anyone especially if you have a hearing problem. I do not have to wear the hearing aid when using the RS120."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I could not be happier with these headphones. I had purchased a set of more inexpensive Sony mdr-if240rk headphones earlier that had an unbearable amount of noise when using them on my 50\\" Panasonic plasma flat screen. When I tried the Sony headphones on my 46\\" Vizio lcd, they worked just fine. Having had such a good experience with Amazon in the past, I knew that if I ordered the Sennheiser headphones for my Panasonic and had the same problems with noise that they would take them back. Even though the Sennheiser's cost a bit more than the Sony's I went ahead and ordered them. The sound quality and separation is amazing. Watching the World Series on the 50\\" is just like being there. You can literally hear the people on either side of you as if you were there. Sennheiser has a great product and Amazon as always is a super merchant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not as good as my last ones","review":"My old Sennhesiser wireless headphones died after bout 10 years of use. I tried replacing them with other brands, but did not like those for various reasons, so I bought these ones. The controls, sound quality, and just abut everything else are the same as my old ones. It is a fine product.The big difference is that the old headphones fit around the ears, not on them like these replacements. This has not noticeably affected the sound quality, but it makes them very easy to fall off if you walk around with them and lean over.Sennheiser may still make an around the ears model. If they do, get those."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointingly problematic device","review":"Most importantly, I couldn't get it to operate properly.

The flat ear pieces lay flat, rather than hooking around the ears, so they just slide off your ears when you tilt your head forward or back. And the bar that rests on the top of your head is horrible also... even on it's tightest setting it is loose on a medium-sized head, and the padding provides no friction. These headphones really want to slide off my head. Definitely returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless headphone waste","review":"My son in law said this was a good product.

However, I just wanted to weigh in on one flaw: the \\"auto-off\\" feature on the base causes these headphones to periodically blast the wearer with loud static if they stop listening to audio but continue to wear the headphones for a few minutes. I find that I do this fairly often without really thinking about it, so this flaw is really annoying, even though it could have been very easily fixed in several different cost-efficient ways.Also, I don't think they fit especially well. They're comfortable, but the parts that cover the wearer's ears are completely flat and can easily slide off if I tilt my head down. No adjustments seem to fix this (as far as I know, I have a normal, non-mutant head, so this probably applies to others, too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Great sound quality, very comfortableonly downside is its auto turn off feature, can break your mood hearing those distortion sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these!","review":"DON'T BUY THESE!

No complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this device","review":"I am very happy with my purchase of the Sennheiser RF wireless headphone. It is a nice product that does it's job and does it well. I know some people have complained about the buzz in background, but it is RF...that is going to happen every now and then. For the most part it is unnoticeable and does not cause a problem.After an hour or so, the headphones start to cause a bit of a problem because I wear eyeglasses. It causes the earpieces to press too hard and it can be mildly annoying.The folks who say they won't stay on your head if you bend over are correct but the simple solution is DON'T BEND OVER. Pretty easy...when I am using them, I am sitting in a chair, not doing a workout or crawling around under my desk.I find the sound quality to be quite good...for the price, you will not find better.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and am thinking of getting another set for use at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the Sennheiser name","review":"I have 10 different pairs of different Sennheiser headphones and they are all AWESOME. I have owned the HDR130 for several years and they are outstanding. I thought the only difference between these (HDR120) and the HDR130 was the surround sound feature. Not so..... These are much smaller hence do not fully encompass your ears. Rather than a frequency switch, these have a frequency dial. Finally, the sound is OK at low volumes but distorts badly at mid to higher volumes. The sleep mode did not work either. These may have been a defective set, but I really do not want to take the chance with another pair. Back they go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I can hear the TV","review":"With a hearing loss it is difficult to hear the TV. Even with aids in I still get asked to turn the sound down to a point that I can't understand what is being said. It sure is nice to hear the words again.The sound quality is great. The base/charger unit is easy to connect. The headset is very comfortable even when worn for long periods of time. The headset will fall off when you lean forward sometimes but not a big deal, It's a small tradeoff for the longterm comfort I feel. Battery life has not been an issue, I just place them on the cradle for a fresh charge when I take them off. Range seems good, I've been all over the house and out in the yard with no problems.

The Rs 120 are ok headphones just to give you the audio but the clarity and quality of the sound pales in comparison to the TR 140.

If this pair breaks, I'm not getting another pair of HS-120's.I will put my change in my change jar and buy a pair of RS-130's when I get enough. If these break after a short period of use, that mean the factory in China has a problem and I don't want to be a guinea pig for them.I'll get another brand other than Sennhauser.

The AA rechargeable batteries that you install (they provide them) are lasting, and so far in about four months I have not had an inkling of trouble with them.The clarity of these headphones is wonderful (you may get a faint hiss if you don't tune them in properly), and you can walk all over your house with them on and maintain your nearly perfect reception.The three controls are quite simple to use (on/off on the left ear, then volume and tuning on the right), and they, finally, are very comfortable to wear.....most times I forget I am even wearing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"hearing no longer a challenge","review":"this is a \\"god send\\" for me. the speakers for my tv are in the back.

They work so beautifully; the sound is excellent and much better than what I can hear from the TV. All the subtle musical enhancements that are often lost through the speakers may be heard clearly, and for me one of the greatest benefits is how I can walk about the house doing things and never miss what's going on during a game or a show. The headset is a little on the large side but very comfortable. I'd like to purchase one of the small Sennheiser wireless TV headsets but they cost twice the money, so I'll likely purchase a second pair of RS120's with cradle. They are a good buy and well worth the money.

I live in an apartment building, and I was aware from reading the reviews that interference might be an issue. The first time I used them, I picked up some sort of radio program when tuning. I finally found the correct tuning to listen to my tv program. There is a lot of background hiss in these headphones, even when correctly tuned. Now, that may be expected from wireless headphones, BUT it gets worse!When you lose the signal, or when you pause your dvd player for a few minutes, you will get an eardrum shattering HISS unexpectedly and much much louder than the background hiss which is present all the time. So if you value your hearing, don't pause your DVD player while wearing these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"they do the job","review":"These headphones seem to do the job.

The headphones are used for television viewing so I cannot say how well they work when leaving the living room. They were purchased for my father and my husband. My husband often wakes up in the wee hours of the morning and watches television. The headphones are a blessing because they allow him to view and hear the televison without disrupting the rest of the sleeping household. My father had trouble hearing the televison clearly and the headphones allow him to adjust the volume to his personal needs without having the T.V. volume too loud for everyone else in the room. The headphones are adjustable and comfortable. The sound quality is clear. They were easy to set up and use right out of the box (right after I charged the batteries). The sets came with rechargeable batteries and the charging cradle. It's a wonderful product and I would purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"These have great sound quality, and are very comfortable. The annoying static or hiss that people refer to in other reviews only occurs when it is not receiving a signal, so if you put them on while your system is off you'll hear static, or if you don't have the headset tuned to the transmitter properly (this is really easy to do since the tuner control is right on the headset)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good","review":"Haven't used them much, but I'm pretty pleased.

They are crystal clear and have great sound. I don't know why I waited so long. I'm planning on buying another pair for my living room.

I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Headphones are well built, and the sound quality is awesome. Great clarity and base, however, in my opinion, there's a design flaw that prevents these from being practical.The ear cushions are flat instead of hollow, so they press against the ears, instead of surrounding them, making them very uncomfortable, and after about 30 minutes my ears started to hurt. They also get pretty warm, perhaps for the same reason. It's a shame because the sound was great.Tried to like them and wish they would have fit better, but unfortunately I will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsure yet...","review":"We got this headset with high expectations as we heard that it is a great item for my mothers TV watching and her very bad hearing.

We now have had something thru a hard core electronics store, that Panasonic told us to get, on order for 3 weeks and it still hasn't come in!

However the newer set I bought, the padding is not offset from your ear, but rather a flat surface with fabric that flexes to your ear rather than being offset by any padding. I'm finding the new set with stretchable fabric pretty uncomfortable.Older model with offset speaker padding -- 5 stars.Newer model with stretching-fabric and no offset -- 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very dissapointed","review":"It was crippled on arrival (only one earphone would work) and within 20 minutes it was completed dead (I am guessing the transformer was defective) Sent back today..

In my office environment, however, I can't get away from annoying background noise, on all the channels and with every conceivable transmitter position.What's more annoying, however, is that if there is no audio going to the transmitter, it shuts off. I use these on computer that makes infrequent noises when I'm not listening to music - so this happens very frequently. When it does happen, the headphones just start amplifying background noise, louder and louder, until I have to take them off. There needs to be a control to disable this, or the headphones need to be smart enough to shut off when the transmitter is off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than TV EARS","review":"I bought two pairs of these headphones.

I decided to give them a go. I hooked them right into the back of our direct tv receiver, charged the batteries, and they work like a charm. No static. It was so simple. I can walk throughout my whole house and have no problems. No more turning our tv up to decibles that will break the sound barrier while walking on the treadmill.

The AR works great at home to watch TV but not at work.With RS120, I can even walk around to get print-outs and yet don't hear any interference at all! I have even tried going upto our coffee room, where there's some noise, but one can still keep the song going.Only crib I have is, I wish they were circum-aural (less painful on the ears after extended use), whereas these are supra-aural.

Am going back to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Better","review":"Overall, I'm not impressed. The sound quality was decent but other thing like comfort,fit and material quality is why it scored low. I feel for the money it should just be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging Issues","review":"Overall, this product has performed less than hoped. To charge, the metal contacts on the headphone has to make good contact with the base unit. In order for my unit to make good contact, I've had to weigh down the headphone by putting a weighted object on top of it. It's been a frustrating experience. Also, as some reviewers have pointed out, the unit goes out of tune quite frequently. Recently, the unit started giving a periodic loud static sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Headphones","review":"This is the forth set of these headphones that I ordered for friends. Two of the four of us wear hearing aids and appreciate the great bass response that we get with hearing aids out. We are all hooked up the same way, audio output from the TV. This way our spouses can listen to TV at normal listening levels, while we can enjoy loud, clear, amazing sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected!!","review":"It has static at low volume which is very irritating. You have to up the volume (which is deafening)to cancel out the static. Not expecting that from Sennheiser. Maybe I should have looked for a bluutooth technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy","review":"I bought two of these for myself and my husband because we have a baby and live in an apartment, and we wanted to be able to watch tv without making too much noise. The reception is excellent, there is no hissing noise that I read some other reviewers mention. It is actually very clear with no interference. However, when we played around with the tuner, we were able to listin to out neighbor's phone conversation. Overall, it is a great product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great wireless headset","review":"Sennheiser Rs120 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones With Charging CradleI have used the phones with great results.

I previously owned a set of wireless phones from Brookstone and even though I enjoyed them, these are even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality Sound","review":"I am very happy with these headphones. The range extends throughout my house, they're easy to set up and use and they have great sound quality. They sit conveniently on the charger, which looks good as a display stand. Also, the headphones are very comfortable to wear.The only downside is that you have to search for the correct channel and deal with static until you find it. This happens about half the time when you turn them on but once you find the channel, they're good to go until you turn them off again. This is the first pair of wireless headphones I've ever owned so maybe this is an issue with all of them. I just didn't know about it.But I'm still very happy with these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient, but flawed","review":"The sound is good, the charging on the stand is good, but the headphones themselves are bulky and heavy. The fatal flaw is that when I move my head the plastic hinges creak and pop, interfering with the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent wireless headphones","review":"I have been looking at various reviews for wireless headphones. These are great. Very comfortable to wear for long. The sound is very clear. I dont hear any static. I have not had an opportunity to roam around the home too much. Pretty much use it during late night TV viewing. I had an optimus IR headphone which had a lot of static and did not have a re-chargeability. The re-charge base is very convenient. I looked at the higher models of the same, but thought, for the money this was a steal. Got it on Amazon for $80. If you are looking for auto tuning capability or a closed ear cup, you will need to look at the RS130 or RS140."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Wireless Unit","review":"Product did not meet my expectations but did arrive in a timely fashion.

As long as I keep my head up I am OK, but when I lean forward they slide off. Maybe it is my head (mostly bald, but it is pretty big so it should inherently fit snugly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought these for my husband so he could watch TV in bed without disturbing me. After charging the headphones there was extreme static and interference and the TV was only about 12 feet away from where he was laying in the bed. No matter what we tried we could not get rid of the static. He also commented that the headphones fit okay. I should have put more time into researching before purchasing. I did return the item to Amazon and within 1 week was issued a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"My brother had an older model that is no longer available and I liked it for overall quality so I ordered this model thinking I would have the same equipment. The quality of this model was very disappointing. The headphones do not fit properly and if you move around they will fall off your head. The sound quality is not good. You cannot get the static out of the headphone sound even with constant tinkering with the tune control. The reception is poor when you move more than twenty feet from the transmitter. The unit does work if you don't mind the background static. I suggest not buying this model due to the cheap quality. I am disappointed in Sennheiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"These headphones may be OK for some people, but I find them to be uncomfortable and unreliable. I bought them for use with a bedroom TV set. They hiss like crazy, and the sound cuts out occasionally causing REALLY LOUD hissing while you scramble to turn down the volume and re-tune to the channel. After reading the return policy on these from antononline (which states that 99%of the time the item is not defective), I am not even going to try returning them. I will just chalk this up to a bad purchasing decision on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Computer","review":"Ok. Bought with high expectations. Opened the packaging, charged for 24 hrs. Got home, turned on the tv and the headphones. Nothing. Thought maybe it's a lemon. So tried it with computer. Worked perfectly. Ending to story. It did not work with my tv. Wish it had a compatability list showing which tv's it didn't work with. Feel ripped off. But eh, I have some nice Computer headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earphone","review":"Only drawback for me was that the headset now uses a flat foam product which doesn't block out the ambient noise as well as the rubber cupped earphones on an older version that I had borrowed to test the quality. Other than that they serve the purpose well. Now that I know the style of earphone, I would probably still purchase it due to the overall quality of the experience with the Sennheiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Headphones","review":"Well, this product amazed me it had the sound quality of $80 skullcandy's but it was wireless, the wireless part of it is also amazing great quality until about 350 ft, outside of my house, with the transmitter in the basement connected to my computer, i listen to alot of music and it just seems to work great, you can mow and actually hear the music, a definite good buy, i just was wondering if they could make it more portable so you dont have to plug it into the wall, otherwise I highly reccomend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider something else...","review":"You might want to consider something else. I bought this in Oct 2008. By mid 2009 it was beginning to fail: static heard once in a while, one side or the other would stop working then come back, recharging took longer & length of use decreased as time progressed. Then in the spring of 2010 it died altogether. The head piece was comfortable, but loose fitting. The sound quality was ok but I think my Inke'd ear buds to my mp3 player sound better. The cordless convenience was wonderful, but I really expected these to last MUCH longer than they did. I don't think it's worth the $69.89 price. Over all I'm not happy with the quality or durability the Sennheiser brand lead me to expect, especially for this price range. I recommend you buy something else or cough up for the replacement warranty cause I think you'll need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD BUY","review":"I am moderately hard of hearing and would have to have the TV sound set where it would be too loud for normalhearing people. This thing takes care of that problem extreemly well. It is also good for when my wife goes tothe bed room and I stay up in the family room to watch TV a while. I can have the TV's volume turned all the waydown and still get whatever volume I want from the headphones..The only con I see is that once in a while you get a short burst of static noise. But it is not enough to over rideall that is good about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"It was difficult to hook up as no clear instructions.

To me, that's the best review. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are nice","review":"I withheld rating these until I had used them for several months. I use them when mowing the lawn and doing yard work. For me, the range without static is about 50 feet. About 75 feet with mild static. I have no problems with the battery life, recharging system, hook-up, weight, price, or shipping. So why not 5 stars? Well, I find the headphones a bit bulky and the fit bothers me. There is no tension adjustment to make the fit tighter - so they tend to fall off if I look up or down. I really think the company has good electronics but the body design could use some improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wireless headphones","review":"HeadPhones easy to set up. Has three channels, so,if one goes out can use another. Currently have one set in great room that I bought 4 years ago. Now have the latest set in basement rec room.

It also does have a very nice range, so I can freely walk in my work office with headphones pretty far and still enjoy the nice reception. I am a software engineer and sometimes listening music is a distraction to me. If you will turn on your headphones with no music source attached to it than you can enjoy a white noise which is less distracting than a music to kill the sound of talking on phone or in person coworkers. No need to connect to mp3 player or online white noise generators. Very cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They hurt to wear and they make noise","review":"I don't like headphones that press on your ears. These do. It is impossible to tune them to perfect reception.

I don't notice any of the hiss some speak of. The only thing I don't like is that because the ear part that goes onto your ear is rather large, it makes my ears hot. Not because the headphones are hot, but just because they are rather large and it is like putting winter ear muffs on in your house. I would prefer a much smaller ear piece. But maybe they need to be large for the batteries? The charging craddle is very well designed. Just put the headphones on their stand and they are charging. There is even a convenient red light that comes on so you can be sure you have placed the headphones on the charging stand correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent wireless headphone","review":"This headphone works pretty good.Just a few notes of concern but frankly not anything major:The headset is little loose because it's a little too big.when there is no signal, you will get noise if you keep the headset on.The base is very light and tips sometimes when I lift the headset.Now the good side:for a wireless it produces very good sound.I keep the headphones on and go room to room without any problem or interference.

It's superb.But it's too big to wear. Forget trying to wear while you are half lying in the bed at night and watch TV, which was the whole point of buying this headset so that no one is disturbed while you watch TV at night.Put you head against pillow and it will pop out of place. So I tried my recliner but same outcome.I guess it's fine if you are standing while you watch TV or if you are listening to music only while walking around your house.And if your head is of average size, you are out of luck, there is no way to tighten it, you bend down & it slides out of place. You need bigger head that will make it work fine I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Choice","review":"After endless searching for a good set of wireless headphones - I read decent reviews so I gave them a try.

I find that while they are comfortable, they don't stay on my head. When I bend down they fall forward, I am constantly adjusting them, more troublesome than the wires that I was trying to avoid.The quality of the sound when it is tuned properly is good however as you move around there are frequent blasts of static that are totally unacceptable.

I read all the reviews on wireless headphones and liked what I read about this set. These are awesome! They were a breeze to set up. The wire holder that the headpiece rests on is what charges the recharable batteries, too, a very clever idea. The sound quality, to me, is great, especially compared to my old set. The headpiece is light weight, adjustable, and comfortable. My ears don't end up hurting from being pressed against my eyeglasses either.

Huge static noise when adjusting volume.","review":"Thought this set of headphones was great when I got them last Xmas (2011). However, that was short lived. After only a few months it started generating a large annoying amount of static crackling every time I move the little volume adjust dial on the front of the right ear phone. Some of it goes away after I take my finger off the dial, but more often than not a somewhat reduced but still intolerable volume of the static noise remains, which of course makes the listening experience far less than acceptable. More than likely this another consequence of off shoring to cheap Chinese production that we USA consumers are forced to bear. Don't buy this product because it apparently cheaply made and poor quality. Best to find another higher quality product from another manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy.","review":"This product was not good as it was very loose on the head / ears. The headphones dropped when you looked down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, Great Price","review":"I've only had this headset for about a week, but I've been able to listen to it quite a bit, and so far, I like what I hear. It took only five minutes to set up, and when I first turned it on, I was amazed how clear the sound was, especially for wireless. I was able to hear quieter parts of my favorite songs, which on my computer speakers I was never able to hear. The only bad part about this headset is that you can't go too far from the receiver without hearing loud clicks and static. I went outside no more than 150 feet from the receiver and I could barely even hear the music over the static. Overall, I'd say buy this headset if you are planning on staying within 50 feet or so of the music source the majority of the time you would use the headset. When you are close to the receiver, the sound quality is great, especially when you look at how cheap this headset is compared to other similar headsets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but cheesy construction","review":"The sound quality is very good, and its range is excellent.

I walk all over my house with them (3800 sq ft) and down to the mailbox, but there is a loud \\"shhhh\\" all the time. I have to adjust the tuner to an in-between, mono, not-as-much-volume-available place in order to hear stuff. (Like when you pull the headphone plug out half-way.) I listen to a lot of audiobooks & talk-radio, but lots of music too. I read several reviews before buying these, and no one complained much about the noisy background. On a plus side, you've got no wires and I wear them for hours without my ears hurting. BTW, I have kind-of a small head and the smallest setting on them is still loose. I can't look down or they'll fall off. Grand Total: I wouldn't buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing reception","review":"Seems like the reviews on Amazon for this product fall in two categories - 5 star love-fests and 1-star complaints of reception. I'm afraid this review falls into the latter category. I'm using these headphones literally 8 feet from the receiver, and I hear distortion when I turn my head or just when something in the universe shifts and causes these headphones to make a high pitched noise. Also, you have to get them balanced PERFECTLY on the cradle to charge - otherwise the little charging light goes out.The name implies German quality, but these are Made in China, and seem very cheap and poorly engineered. Back to Amazon they go..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Before ordering this headphone I read very carefully previous reviews. The reviews I read were helpful, well written and I was stimulated to write my own. There were basically two groups of reviews, one being highly complimentary of the RS-120 and the other group complained about noise, hiss, and comfort. My own review falls in the first group. However I must say that noise and hiss can happen in some environments and are not necessarily a problem with the headphone. In fact, it is easy for me to induce noise/hiss when I approach the motor of the refrigerator or I approach the emitter from other electronic equipment. Noise/hiss are nightmares for engineers and sometimes there is not much that we can do to eliminate these problems in the immediate physical world that surrounds us. We need to troubleshoot to get the best location of the emitter in order to enjoy this remarkable set of headphones.

I enjoyed these headphones -- until the AA batteries located in the left earphone began to corrode.

There is a constant, distracting hiss, and no amount of fiddling with the tuning dial helps, it only makes it worse. It is the same on all three channels and with different input devices. And a range of over 300 feet? Try 20 feet. The only way to be happy with these headphones is to keep your expectations very low.I originally forgot to mention the extremely loud static when the headphones don't find, or lose, a sound signal.

They were correct, I was incorrect.The headphones are comfortable and provide great sound. I have poor hearing and was amazed at how much more I could hear with these. They worked perfectly for a day or so then became a real PITA! I turn them on and all is perfect for 1 to 10 minutes. Then the power light goes off and I get nothing but static through the speakers. The only way I can correct this is by unplugging the headphones from my receiver, wait a moment for the power light to come back on then plug them back in. I have tried everything imaginable to isolate the cause of this problem but have been unable to find anything. I have a background in electronics design and repair but this has me stumped.

You cannot have your TV on mute and listen through the headphones as you can with some makes.I bought this product 6 months ago and I thought about returning it immediately because sound was only coming from one side. However, the problem seemed to be fixed after some tweaking so I kept them. Randomly, however, there is a loud crackling noise and the sound disappears.

I am a gadget hound. I purchased their headsets and, frankly they worked great, for about 3 weeks before they stopped working. I contacted the customer service organization, I sent them my headsets and base for repair, 4 weeks later, they sent me a brand new headset. *** THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THEY NEVER RETURNED THE BASE ***. I've contacted them 6 times so far. One of the times they said they were going to return the base to me but they never responded after that (no base was sent). It has now been close to 10 months... and multiple attempts to contact them... no replies... no base... wish I kept my money (plenty of other options out there.) I am writing this review after being kept on hold for 59 minutes on their customer service line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst wi-fi headphones i have ever used","review":"It's my first review on Amazon. But i thought that, i have to tell to future buyers, NOT TO BUY this item. Why? Because of the static sound. Overall, the product price/quality ratio is good. The materials are good, but the static sound is annoying, i can't live with that, despite what other people are saying. If you stay still, like a statue, there are moments when the static stops, but as soon as you even tilt your head you can hear them. In the moments when the statics stops, the sound is very clean and warm. I also have a pair of Phillips wi-fi headphones, i had never had a problem with them, but they are old enough and much heavier than Senheiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated design and poor function","review":"I just received these today and after 5 minutes I knew I had to return them. I will keep it simple and list the reasons why.1. They are HUGE. I felt like I should be walking on the airport tarmac parking commercial aircraft.2. The sound quality is HORRIBLE, buzz, hiss and very tinny sounding.3. The design is over 7 yrs old which is a millennium in electronics ( I should have paid closer attention to the review dates)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless headphones","review":"The headphones' base station is connected to my satellite dish receiver and is behind closed cabinet doors out of sight. It was easy to select the appropriate channel to get reception without any interference. I wear hearing aids and the TV placement does not let me enjoy the surround sound produced by many of the stations without increasing the volume to a level too loud for the rest of the family. The headphones fit over the ears without removing the hearing aids and I can experience the surround sound without changing the TV volume. The reception is good enough to let me walk around the house and onto the porch outside without missing any of the dialog. In addition, the quality of the sound is quite good. While wearing the headphones, the open air design allows me to hear when someone in the room speaks to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after 2 weeks","review":"The unit stopped working after 2 weeks of light use.

Do have to figure how to keep it on your head while your moving around. Knit cap maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"After several months of using, here are my thoughts: the headphones are VERY warm. Your ears will be kept warm. If you work in a meat locker, this is good. Normal temperatures, not so good. Also, I get a LOT of feedback from them. The base is 3 feet away and up no a shelf, but the static and noise is pretty bad. When I occasionally get a clear signal (not often), the sound is average. They are plugged in to my computer and there is nothing else electronic nearby to cause the issues. Also, after a few seconds of no content (for example, stopping a streaming radio program) you get a loud buzz.The range seems to be decent (40-50 feet, consistently), but quickly fades with walls and windows.I would not recommend these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheizer review","review":"I have only had these headphones for 3 weeks and they work great. The only problem I'm having is that I have another set of Sennheizer headphones and when both TVs are on, they interfere (even after changing frequencies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help!! This Thing Sucks!!","review":"I do no know who will see this but I would very much like to return these headphones. They work ok I guess but the problem comes with the AGC. The AGC clips the audio no matter what the input level. I turn it up and it turns it down. I am not trying to blow my ears out mind you. I am simply playing my computer music and mixing it with my normal electric guitar amp. A funtion that I use all of the time with standard headphones. How ever with these wireless the AGC makes it pointless. Who can I talk to about a return. I have purchased many a product from Amazon with no problem but now that there is a problem I see no avenue to find resolution. Can anyone at Amazon please help me. Please contact me via this email address."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, don't buy them","review":"These headphones are incredibly cheap, poorly constructed, and worthless. I just threw them across the room. They won't stay on your head. They are finicky about staying on. The sound quality is terrible, full of barely audible hiss and rumble. I can't believe anyone can give these a good review, they are crap! They come with two RCA plugs for some reason, when I put the RCA's into the headphone jack of my computer, they fit so loosley that I had to fiddle with them to get sound"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Wary of Rebate","review":"The product works fine however in the offer was a set of free CX 300s.

Finally we can watch the same show, music or movie with a different volume level. the sound is crisp enough vs. the convenience of having it cordless. obviuosly there is some static but you wont notice it unless there is absolute silence in what you are hearing, and it is barely noticeable to the untrained ear, though. I would definitely buy them again if I had the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Wireless Headphones","review":"I use these headphones while grilling or smoking food; primarily listening to Sirius digital classic rock.The highs, midrange,and bass reproduction are great.Set-up was completed in 5 minutes.I saved $50.00 buying these new on Amazon.com; compared to other web sites.I've been as far away as 80 yards, (outside), from the broadcast unit, (inside), and had reception; by adjusting the tunner.For the money, ($79.95), you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What Was Needed","review":"Since my wife can no longer adequately hear the TV without the volume to at least 11, hearing aids or headphones were the only options. After dismissing hearing aids, we wanted wireless headphones with decent sound and range that didn't require a battery change every few uses. These headphones fit the bill. The rechargeable batteries recharge on the stand when not in use, you can walk around the house without a loss of the strong clear signal and they sound great. They do require some initial tuning to get the best signal and sound quality, but after that. . . you're good to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, one design flaw, cheap batteries","review":"Purchased these for father with hearing aides who kept everyone up watching late TV. That problem solved! Dad loves them and the house is quiet.The controls are confusing with a tuning knob next to and same as the volume control. Have had to tape over the tuning knob, as Dad could not adjust the volume with out reseting the tuner -- then because of his hearing loss, someone else had to reset the tuner for him.Also, the batteries that were supplied were the absolute cheapest rechargables on the market, 600ma. Didn't want to hold a charge past 4 hrs. Have replaced them with 1200ma batteries ($5) that last as long as Dad wants to wear them. Recharging cradle is brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Large","review":"Don't bother buying these if you are a woman with a small to medium size head. They are unwearable. Even though they are adjustable; they are so huge to begin with there is no way to make them fit. I am so tired of companies assuming only large men buy electronic products. Hire some women for your quality control, please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones","review":"Am very satisfied with the sound quality. It is amazing for low-end wireless headphones. I havethree complaints however. There are no lights to signify on or off. The on/off switch is very small and put together rather cheaply. The headphone itself does not sit on the head very steadily; if I am in a sitting position and want to stand, I have to hold the headphones or they will fall off of my head. I have used Acoustic Resources Headphones previously and they seemed more high end, but sound quality is about the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I ordered this because I wanted to be able to watch tv and or listen to music at night without disturbing my husband. The quality of the headphones were so poor that the music and television sounds could clearly be heard therefore it kept him awake. the headphones didnt cup the ears as they should. Clarity and hissing was also a big problem. Very disappointed. Sent them right back and bought a cheap twenty five dollar set of another brand which worked just fine. On a good note...Amazon gave me no problem on the return. I was very happy about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I should have looked at the over 100 1 star reviews. My unit never even turned on when I plugged it in. You have a green on/off light and a red charging light.

This item is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"My TV bought last year did not have the proper connection","review":"The headphones worked with an older TV in the spare bedroom but my newer TV in the living room did not have the proper connections for this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Ear Muffs","review":"I bought these headphones because I am hard of hearing and I wanted to watch movies on TV at a comfortable sound level without disturbing others in the room. I played around with them quite a bit but the sound level of the TV (or the stereo system) was equal to what I set the headsets to. Also, if I tried to move from my chair the interference was awful. Eeekkk... Get the idea? I had been using an old set of Koss wireless headphones which were fabulous until they finally gave out. I could set the TV sound at one click and turn my headset up and hear every word. I was looking for a cheaper alternative. This wasn't it and I let the 30 return time expire before sending them back. Do yourself a favor and spend the money... buy direct from Koss (made in USA) and they are guaranteed for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds terrible","review":"Absolutely terrible sound quality -- constant hiss, frequent pops and static, basically takes my CDs and makes them sound like beat-up old LPs broadcast on a cheap radio. I wish I'd sent it back when I still had the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The don't work","review":"Sennheiser is supposed to be a top brand in this type of equipment and since my hearing is not that good anymore, I thought that this would be the solution. This set worked great for the first week, from that point, I don't get anything but static, and was unable to \\"tune\\" them. The headset doesn't fit correctly into the charging stand and misses the contacts to keep it charged, and it required constant adjustment or the batteries wouldn't charge. I recently tried to switch to regular batteries, but with the same results...static.My wife threw out the packing, when it first came in so I couldn't send this purchase back. It's about the worst $80 purchase I've ever made, and my wife is getting tired of me always asking \\"what did they say?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed about this hedset!","review":"I own other 3 wired headset from Sennheiser and one NoName/\\"cheep\\" wireless headset.Being so happy with my other Sennheiser headsets I bought this product hoping to improve my wireless experience but after one minute of use I was totally disappointed.Quality of sound and reception is really bad, i can't turn my head without losing reception and I can't go more fare then 5m away from my TV, a lot of background noise and the headset can't reproduce lower frequencies of sound.They are really uncomfortable, my ears hurts after use them and they got terrible hot and if I move fast my head the headsets fall down.Now I'm back to my old wireless headset which are much more better then this ones.Shame on you Sennheiser for this headsets!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Hissing and Loose Fit.","review":"Don't nod your head yes or no, because they will fall off.

Sometimes 5 minutes, 10 minutes and maybe even 30 minutes. Then it just cuts out and all you hear is noise with no sound at all. I thought that at this $90 price you would get a dependable product. Like they say; you get what you pay for. But not in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Headphones","review":"These headphones are for my mother. Everything is great except the caretakers don't always put the headphones on the metal to metal so the charger is on. I have put signs there and they don't read them. It is frustrating, but we are doing our best. My mother has dementia and can't tell them either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well designed, good for the money","review":"I got these for my dad to use when watching TV. For him they work great he just leaves them on and they turn them selves off when you lay it on the charger. Also because of the design he doesnt have to deal with plugging anything in to charge them, you just rest the headphones on the stand and they charge. The only issue we have noticed is that they just kind of float on your head and dont feel sturdy. This is fine most of the time except that he wanted to use them while doing dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen but we fear that they will end up in the sink. So if you only plan on using these while sitting down i give them a 5 star, but why would you really want wireless headphones if you cant do stuff around the house while you wear them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design flaw wipes out anything positive I have to say","review":"These have to be the worst designed headphones I've ever purchased. Unless you have a head that is sized and shaped perfectly for these, expect them to slip and fall off at the slightest tilt. Both my husband and I use these and it is horribly frustrating when you need to reach for something or move about and have these slide off your head. I dont understand how these have gotten such high reviews. On a positive note, the charging cradle is great because Ive owned other wireless headphones and it was always a pain setting them down just right to get a charge but that is small consolation when having to deal with these falling off all the time. They are EXTREMELY expensive considering their quality and design flaws. I would have expected something leather-like which might have provided better grip. Instead, you have some sort of cheap foamy material. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Tech Support!","review":"I looked at reviews here and decided to purchase.

To our disappointment, that is not the case at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas Gift Ever!","review":"This is the best Christmas gift I have ever bought for my husband. The loudness of our TV was becoming just too much for me. After much research, I purchased these earphones for him and have been totally pleased. He loves them and I love the quietness in our home. He says the sound is great and he loves the fact that he can walk from one room to the next while wearing them. His only complaint is that he says they can become a little warm on the head after wearing them awhile. The fit is comfortable and he is a fairly large man. The original setup was simple and he keeps them on the charger when not in use. Overall, we have been very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I can sleep!!!!!","review":"I bought these for my husband who is hard of hearing. Of course the tv was turned up VERY loud whether we were sitting and watching or when I was trying to go to sleep. This was the BEST investment I have made in years!!! Now I can hear the television without losing an eardrum and I can get to sleep at night with no problem. Every man or woman who lives with someone who is hard of hearing and too proud to get a hearing aid should invest in a set of these. My husband loves them too. The words are clearer and not all jumbled up like he normally hears things. A great investment in your sanity!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones","review":"I like the headphones. I replaced the on ear cushions with around ear cushions. they are much more comfortable for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones too large","review":"A great product, but the headphones are too large for someone without a large head.

They do not cancel out sound, but work as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wunderbar!","review":"For 8 months, I used the headphones by plugging into the TV headphones plug--not a good idea. The sound quality wasn't very good. I had to hold my head a certain way, and I lie on the couch. It didn't work very well. I still recommended them to my friends, who bought them. THEY plugged them into their TV audio out. SMARTER. I do that now, and they are EXCELLENT! I can move my head around, and the quality is vastly improved! I HIGHLY recommend them, now! My partner is MUCH happier, because I am willing to wear them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge mistake","review":"The headphones worked perfectly the first time I used them. Put them back on the cradle to charge. The next time I went to use them, all I got was hissssss. Called Sennheiser. The problem was everything under the sun ... but the headphones: I didn't have the volume turned up loud enough, I apparently was incompetent to scan through the dial from one end to the other, I didn't have them plugged in correctly, blah blah BS! BS! blah! Was told to return the product; would be 2 to 3 weeks turnaround for either repair or replace. I shipped them to Sennheiser. No word if they ever received them. No word if there's a prognosis. No word if there's going to be a fix. No word if and when I might get them back. No word, period! Communication sucks! I emailed them, got a generic reply stating that it would be 4 weeks turnaround. If you're thinking you're getting these at a good price, tack on an extra $9.35 cost to ship them back to Sennheiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I work in a machine shop and use these all day, excellent reception. Highly recommended. Also, uses regular nicad rechargeable batteries, so you can change them yourself when they lose their life. Great item for 59 bucks.Mike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds great for what it is; range is somewhat limited","review":"This is a great wireless headphone. I originally bought the 180 model from Amazon and found it to be absolutely no better than this unit...except for its range.The 120 has a very limited area in which it picks up sounds from its base. In my house (older home; plaster walls; well built), it begins to snap, crackle and pop 30 feet or less from its base (and my listening room). This works for me; for the MUCH better price than the 180, I can tolerate a bit less range.Well satisfied with this unit. While others may get 100-200 feet from the base station, I can't. However, overall I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like the Hissssss","review":"Just received my wireless headphones. Pretty easy to install however..........the background hisssss is pretty annoying. I will probably return and upgrade to a $150 set and hopefully get rid of the Hisssss.Update: Try turning your TV volume up (maybe 50%) then lowering the headphone volume. This significantly reduced the hisss. I'm going to change my rating to 3 stars. Maybe I will keep these headphones. Not bad for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited to purchase these well reviewed headphones. Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with them- static was a major problem and the range for tuning in the television station was small. Sadly, the static and background noise were too loud and rendered dialogue impossible to hear. We returned them immediately (I will say that Amazon customer service was excellent) as they did not perform as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable noise","review":"Save yourself lots of money and don't go for this product.* There is always a light background noise on the headphones. I have no idea why this isn't going through some noise gate. But it makes me feel like taking off the headphones when there is no music playing.* When nothing plays for a while, the transmitter turns off, emitting a loud noise from the headphones. Extremely frustrating. This \\"feature\\" is so stupid. I have to keep turning off the headphones when sound stops from the headphones, which happens a lot. And I have to remember to turn it back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good listening","review":"Pros: Great headphones for the price. Worked right out of the box. Good sound. Charges battery's very well.Cons: They fit a little loose on your head and slide off when bending over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay to Good for the Money","review":"Found the sound quality and reception okay to good, but was expecting somewhat better sound especially in the bass performance. Has a loose fit, but stays on for regular walking, standing, and sitting--not suitable for dance or exercise. Keep in mind the headphones ship uncharged so you can't try them out the day they arrives. Also, they mean it when they say it's subject to interference from nearby TVs. For economy, this is a decent choice, but otherwise I'd try a more upscale model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser RS120","review":"The wireless did not work for me. I had static coming through the headset. I tried the three different channels available with the system. I had to return the headphones.

Sound Quality, Comfort, Battery Life and Range are all superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, really dreadful","review":"This is my first ever review after a decade w/ Amazn, so I am needless to say *very* disappointed. I just need to second++ the previous complaints about needing to have the TV volume up. I am not an over the top audiophile, I just want something passable. When I read the reviews saying that the volume needed to be turned up, I had not imagined that the problem would be so dramatic; if my tv volume is not full 100%, the WAH-WAH-SCRATCH is unbearably bad. At that volume, if I ever unplug the headphone jack w/o turning the volume down I will probably blow my speakers. This is simply unacceptable, and I am returning them.That said, there may be hope for some of you; if your tv has a \\"line out\\" (for going to a computer or sound system) instead of a just headphone out, it *may* work OK there. My guess is that the people who are happy with the unit have a situation like this. Sadly I don't, I only have digital optical out (too high end) and headphone jack (too low tech)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leak a LOT of noise, uncomfortable.","review":"The reviews were kind of confusing so I decided to go for them. It was a bad choice. I sent them back the second day. The sound quality is not good. It leaks a LOT of noise. I was listening to music at work (moderate volume) and my colleague who was sitting 4 feet away from me could hear everything loud and clear. He complained about the disturbance. Also, they make your ears really warm and sweaty to the point when it becomes really uncomfortable around the ears. I would not recommend them to anybody. I just hope Amazon returns my money without any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, awesome wireless range, flat ear pads??","review":"Good sound, good bass. Love the stand/ charger. So simple and looks great. The wireless range is insane. I walked four rooms and two floors away and it still came in CLEAR. Just insane.My only problem is the ear pad design. Its completely flat.

The audio quality is better than the factory speakers that came with my television (which actually weren't too shabby). I've never had an issue with battery life, though I rarely use them for more than 5 hours or so without a recharge. Perfect for watching a late night movie while the spouse/kids are sleeping, or for playing loud video games without disturbing the rest of the household. Rarely I get a tiny bit of interference, but it's short duration (under a second) and not really distracting.The headphones are comfortable even for extended use. My only (very mild) complaint is sudden head movements can dislodge them fairly easily. For stationary use however you can't do much better than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I had realistic expectations of my new headphones. Big disappointment with the fit. I bought these for watching/listening to t.v., while I cleaned the house. They wouldn't stay on my head! The ear pads are flat and don't provide any grip on your ears. Everytime I bent over, they slid off. I don't have a small head, and a friend with a big head tried them, and the same thing happened to him. Adjustment options were minimal. Reception was also spotty through my walls, reaching a high pitch screech at times. I packed them up today and am expecting a replacement headphone from a different company.

Reception is generally very good. Overall, I am very pleased with the product.The one annoying thing...

Granted, the only reason I bought these, was they looked comfortable. Ugh. They just annoyed me to no end. Can someone recommend a decent set of headphones that don't hurt my inner ear, or my outer ear or fall off my head? I am not an audiophile, just a comfortphile.

I have frequently asked her about what the news, movie, or what a person said, and she tells me exactly what was said. She like the product so much that she tells all of the family and friends about the wonderful device she got for Christmas and how much it has really helped her hear what was going on.This product has really helped us both very much and we both are very pleased.

I had trouble hearing conversations in programs with the volume at a reasonable level for everyone else in my home. I tried the TV Ears as advertised on television. They were uncomfortable to me. These are very comfortable and work well for my purpose. I only have a couple of negative issues. First, while it is simple to set the headphones on the cradle, they have to be set just right on the cradle or they won't charge. Second, there is a sort of echo effect with the TV sound from the speakers coming through at a slightly different rate than through the headphones. I am willing to put up with that so I can hear other conversation and sounds from around me though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for TV, but don't expect classical listening","review":"There is a white noise hiss in the background that is easy to filter out if you're watching TV or something that the sound is not mission critical, but if you are listening to a classical CD it will drive you nuts.Also, if you have a large head (like me) it's difficult to leave the headphones adjusted AND fit easily on the charging rack. I have to finesse it a little bit every time.All in all, for my purposes these are great. I don't have to worry about the dog ripping the receiver off the shelf and my wife doesn't have to listen to my tv shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good to me.","review":"These did not change my marriage. However, they did improve my relationships with the three other engineers in my bay. They sound good to me. However, I must also add the qualifier that having been in the Field Artillery, I wear hearing aids (behind the ears)so my evaluation of the sound may or may not be accurate. They are very comfortable have good reception. I can not really evaluate the range due to the steel buildings on our site. They do, however, reach through one of the steel walls. They company shipped them very quickly and they arrived in good condition. I especially like the ease of replacing the rechargable batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones!","review":"My wife and daughter have been after me to buy some wireless headphones for quite awhile because I generally stay up later than then and they are tired of hearing the TV at night. I did some research and checked out all of my options..these seemed to be the best value for the money....Sennheiser well known for wired and wireless headphones....Well, I am QUITE happy with my purchase...it did take me a little bit to figure the tuning...to get it just right, but the sound is clear, the base is great and I can turn the volume on the TV all the way down and still listen...Highly recommend these!UPDATE 2008: I've now had these headphones for three years. I am still loving them. The sound is great and it has great range.

There was an almost constant static unless I sat or stood still. I couldn't walk and roam about the house unless I wanted to move slowly to minimize the reception static. I thought no way they would sell something of this poor quality for the price I paid but, sure enough.

However the thing that makes these impossible to use is if you are listening to nothing (playlist ends) for five minutes or so, the headphones don't switch off but instead switch to a mode where they deafeningly blast static into your ears. Makes this product practically unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky and was returned","review":"These headsets were way too bulky to be comfortable. The cradle was flimsy and headsets kept falling off. These may be good for certain people, but we definitely did not like them and returned them. Amazon was wonderful about handling the return.

He had high hopes and really liked the charging dock, but as he wore them doing chores around the house, he found that they didn't fit well and fell off easily due to the flatness of the headphone pads. The third time he wore them, the on/off button broke. Compared to the Radio Shack headphones that we had for 5 years, these were horrible. Their sound was superior and the only reason we replaced them was because the headphone cover would no longer stay on. I guess I'm going back to Radio Shack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like these, but have had better.","review":"I bought these to replace some RCA earphones that cupped over the ear. I read reviews which gave high marks for the sound quality of the Sennheiser. I am not disappointed, but I liked the RCA pair better. The Sennheiser is hard and flat against the ear. The sound leaks a litte more (don't want to bother my wife while I watch TV in the bedroom). The sound quality is not better than the RCA and (subjectively) a little less. I do prefer the stand and ease of recharging, however. I think I bought the RCA pair at Radio Shack years ago. I found them online somewhere, and the price was less; but the reviews were not as positive as the Sennheiser. I wish I had stayed with RCA."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work at all","review":"These are decent enough headphones. They sound good although I detect a slight hiss. I didn't find them uncomfortable at all although they can slip off when I tilt my head too far forward. However, I can't use them at work at all. There is a constant rhythmic clicking even when no audio signal is present. I have tried to track down the source of interference but to no avail. It is not my computer, monitor or telephone as I have tried powering all these down. I tried tuning on all three channels. The online FAQ is of no help. As work is where I intended to use them, they are useless to me. Bottom line: they work acceptably well some places but not everywhere. Be forewarned that they may not work at all where you need them. The Sony headphones, also 900 mHz, do not have this problem although the reception is not as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy these","review":"I ordered one set of these headphones, which broke within a few weeks.

Extremely sensitive to other nearby electronic objects and wireless devices(when they are operating. Examples: TV, Xbox, DVD Player, laptop with wireless Internet). The sound quality makes up for it though, and plus you can't expect perfection with wireless headphones. If you do not like sitting close to your TV and need a pair of affordable headphones, I would recommend these. Of course these are some of the lower priced headphones from Sennheiser. If you've got the extra money I'd suggest you increase your price range beyond these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for TV","review":"I got these as a gift 2 christmas ago and they still work great.

Over time they started to deteriorate. First, after three months, the cradle stopped charging. So I switched to regular batteries. I have to change the batteries almost once a week or once every two weeks. Lately, the volume is not working correctly. When I turn them on, the volume is fine, but after ten minutes I have to increase it, after an hour I have to increase it again. Basically these are not usable after a year. I'm very disappointed.

The only thing is that they fit your head kind of loosely, so I wear a baseball cap with them and the problem is solved. Getting them to charge on the cradle can be a little tricky but not a big deal.Overall they are very good for the price, and I plan on buying more matching headsets as I am using them to record music with a band.

While settling for ok/poor quality sound, the headsets dropped the signal and inserted a very loud static noise level in my ears. So loud it hurt. I then returned to headsets to try another brand. It may have been more than one issue but I don't have time to test and return. The set I have now are great. Try tma's."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVERALL EXCELLENT VALUE, A FEW MINOR ISSUES","review":"Overall, this is a great product. It is comfortable, has a great range, and very good sound. The reviews about losing signal in a few songs is true - about 1 of 100 songs the range of the song is too quiet and low and it simply goes to static. Also, the further you are from the source, the more likely you are to get a low hiss. But the value is incomparable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dynamic Volume Leveling has to go.","review":"I really only have one complaint about these headphones. The sound quality is good, the comfort is good - I wear them 8 hours each day, and the charge always lasts the entire day.My problem is that I listen to music with a lot of dynamic range, which wreaks havoc with the dynamic audio leveling. For example, during a quiet part of a song, there may be a sudden crescendo, which is immediately clamped down to the level of the quiet section, and continues so for several seconds while attenuating to the new level.While this might not matter for some music or listening habits, this is not for music with any dynamics.I should have researched the product a little more closely. Now, I'm on the quest of another set of headphones that sound good and will not get tangled under the legs of my chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones","review":"These headphones are amazing! I had been looking for lightweight, wireless headphones for years - I even bought a couple that were either very heavy or just didn't work.As other reviewers have mentioned, these headphones work best when you turn off your tv's speakers and adjust the volume on the tv and headphones; I encounter major static when I don't do this (this is the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars). Otherwise, they are perfect and, on my recommendation, my brother - who demands perfection - also bought them and also loves them.Good job, Sennheiser!Update:I have been using these headphones for more than two years now and they still work as good as new (and I use them almost every day). Love them!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better","review":"Pros - indeed a wireless headphone that is not heavy, nor difficult to useCons - disconnects after a while, making a very loud hissing noise when the signal is paused. Sound is not crystal clear, but good enough for movies and gaming. I have not tried it for music yet. The headphones are light (could be lighter and smaller though), but do not provide a firm fit at all, on the other hand, that allows me to use gaming phones as well, at the same time... I did not like the two in one jack, as it tends to slip when plugged to the TV and sometimes I get signal in just one of the sides, due to that.This is probably an \\"entry level\\" product and I bought it with very low expectations and maybe that is why I am not disappointed, nor unhappy with this purchase. I also use it in front of the TV and have not tested its range. It does however, pick up some interference and, a good thing you may switch reception channels. I recommend it for gamers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto On-Off Annoying","review":"If not for the automatic on-off, this would have been a good purchase.

My son can work right next to me and listen to his music as I preview music I'm considering adding to my music library, and he doesn't have to hear it. I'm very pleased with these headphones.The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that they're not as comfortable as I'd like. Kind of heavy on my little head!

These are the answer for me. The sound is fine for me and not having a wire to contend with is nice. Some people don't care for the fact that if there's no sound for a few minutes (like if you pause your program) they are going to shut off, but it doesn't bother me and I just wait for a few moments and it comes back on. You can pay a lot of money for ear phones and I'm sure that they are great but these were reasonable and they work just fine for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy - Have to use a clip to charge it to cradle","review":"When you put the headset on to charge it is lopsided and I need to use a clip to hold it.

The broad base didn't fit into the inset area on my Toshiba set and I had to order a 3.5mm to 3.5mm adapter with a narrow base to get the headphones to work.

Sound quality is probably not as good as a pair one could use for listening to a DVD, but for TV, they are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the 5 star reviews","review":"This was my first wireless headphone. And it last for 35 min, before packaging it back and requesting a refund from amazon.So, it does have a nice charging feature, but it stops there. The manual tuning is horrible. Remember the old radios from the 80's? That's how you are suppose to tune this thing. It's very sensitive, leaving no room for mistakes. I was playing xbox 360, and took me around 5 minutes to finally get a good enough sound. Forget about amazing stereo sound, it really sounds like an analogic radio at best. And then, I decided to change seats from the couch to the chair, a loud interference noise almost gave me a heart attack.Don't waste your money on this, save a little bit more and get a descent headphone. I regret buying this, hopefully amazon has an amazing customer support and post sales, and I'm sure I'll be able to get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, headphones slide around a little and they are big.","review":"I recently hooked them up and tried the headphones out and everything seems to be working fine. The only downside to the headphones is that if I move my head around a lot, the headphones slide around on my head. The headphones are also big, not any bigger than any of the competition, but I think it would be nice to have headphone options that are smaller, but I don't know if that is possible. Since they are big they push my hair down so I get headphone hair (similar to hat hair).Outside of that, everything works well. One bonus over other similar headphones that I have is that these came with their own rechargeable batteries, so no extra expenses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser Wireless Headphones","review":"The wife and I are very pleased with the headphones. She likes to listen to the TV a bit loud and when I am in the other room - it annoys me. Problem solved and the sound is so much better than my Flat Panel Screen TV. You want be sorry. Don't worry - it recharges itself. I did much research before buying. Amazon had the right price and free shipping. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK for TV","review":"Got these 3 years ago when I was caring for my elderly father because he liked to sit up all night in his recliner with the TV going full blast. Unfortunately this interfered with my sleep. So I convinced him to use these. He did use them for awhile, but there was something funny about the way you had to turn it on that made it easy for my dad to accidentally detune it. The knobs were too close together and not well labeled, as I recall. I don't have it anymore but I guess the simple solution would have been to remove the tuning knob and cover it up with electrical tape. Of course then you could never tune it again ...So while it seems like the perfect solution for this situation, it was only pretty good.I'd give it a 4 despite that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've decided I hate this product","review":"Besides having a very limited operating range -- perhaps 30 feet or so before either the left or right channel starts cutting out -- and, when at a distance from the transmitter, being sensitive to the spatial orientation of the headphones to the base unit, the *loud and jolting shock of white noise* produced about minute or so after the Sennheiser RS120's transmitter loses its audio feed motivates me to curse the designers who created this thing and the company that markets it. I've had the RS120 for more than a year and after my initial disappointment, figured I'd find a setting or tuning that would eliminate or at least reduce this problem or that I'd get in the habit of switching the headset off when the podcast I'm listening to ends. But no! Every day at least once I'm assaulted with the inconsiderate jarring design of this product. I recommend looking elsewhere for wireless headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really good headphones","review":"I've gone through a lot of different headphones for TV viewing, and these are the best yet! They are comfortable to wear, deliver excellent sound even at a long distance from the TV, and the batteries stay charged for a long time. I haven't used the charging cradle, I use a regular battery charger so I always have a spare set of batteries already charged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic solution for \\"loud TV\\" in our home!","review":"Sennheiser RS 120 is a super solution to the household that has a member with difficulty hearing the TV. The ear phones provide clear sound, are light weight, wireless, and cut out all other sounds. My husband even admits the stereo is better than our surround sound! And, he does not miss anything of his program when he has to leave the room for a short while...the sound keeps right on as he walks around the house, etc. Great product! Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revised after 18 mos","review":"These are just aweful. After about 4 mos, they won't hold onto your head. If you look down while wearing them, they will hit the floor. Also, if your audio signal goes quiet for more than about 30 seconds, you hear a little \\"click\\" then deafening static hiss. Was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like 'warm and fuzzy' on my ears","review":"I want wireless headphones because I prefer not having the cord dangling from my head at work. I took these out of the box, and was amazed at how bulky they are. I put them on my head, and felt these warm fuzzy cups engulf my ears. That was enough. I knew I could not wear these at work to listen to my Sensa portable music player - they make my ears too hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work.","review":"There are too many positive reviews to say they never work. However, the one I recieved would never transmit and was returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy - very useful","review":"Made the mistake of not reading the instructions carefully which caused me to waste quite a bit of time. Recommendation - read instructions carefully.The sound quality is very good. As previous folks have mentioned - to reduce the static/hiss - you need to increase the input power to the phones and then reduce the volume using the control on the headphones.Phones are comfortable and easy to use once setup correctly.I bought an extra set of phones and they both work well of the same RF transmitter.Wish I had bought these a long time ago. TV noise is now not a problem.I plan to also buy another RF transmitter plus headphones to run on my computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looks, crappy overall","review":"I don't understand all the 5-star reviews here. These headphones have a lot of problems.First off, there is a problem with connectivity to the audio jack. every 20-40 minutes (Haven't noticed a pattern yet) I lose signal and have to pull out audio cable out of the PC audio jack and put it back in to restore the signal. I know it's not a problem with my audio port because I have wired earbuds and have no such issues.Then, you have the headphones that are so heavy that if I tilt my head down they slip off my head and fall.Then, the signal quality is certainly just sub-prime. For some reason I can never get the two headphones to work at the same time so I get to hear the sound in my right ear only.Overall, these headphones are a disappointment. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SOUND - GOOD COMFORT","review":"My 10yr old Sony RF headphones finally bit the dust, and these looked like a good replacement. The sound is great and clear, though the bass may not be as defined as the Sony's were. However the sound is sharp and clear, and alleviates my hearing issues. MAINLY - the phones WORK so much better than the Sony's did. Rarely do I encounter any noticable noise or interferance from the RF transmission. If I do hear a bit of noise or interferance, I can move maybe 1 inch and it goes away. I've been able to listen to clear sound all around the house, even out front taking the trash to the curb. Very fine product. Terry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Fantastic reception, great range, batteries last quite a while. Wonderful headphones, I would recommend them to anyone.

On the other hand, they are fantastic if you like hiss and distortion. It's almost like torture to use them.

But i do have a couple complaints:1. The headphones are badly designed so much of the sound is lost because it doesn't flow well into the ear.2.

It is my dughter's bedroom, unfortunatelly, the volume of the TV travels very clearly up to it. It has been a blessing to have the headphones because she does not longer complains about the \\"loud volume\\" Also, when I watch movies from netflix, somewhat, the volume is very low and I have to raise it in order for me to listen clearly.

There does not appear that there is any way to make an adjustment.

After connecting these headphones, I found that sound continues to come from the TV AS WELL AS through the headphones. Customer Service from Sennheiser (after several futile tries to get a rep on the phone) told me that the headphones are not designed to cut off the sound from the TV; I wondered why anyone would want BOTH TV sound and headphone sound at the same time...to me, this makes no sense.So, for those of you who may be looking for wireless headphones to use while watching TV while your spouse/partner is in the same room/area and is trying to read or sleep, these are NOT for you. My 2 star rating is because the sound quality is quite good and the unit is comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price, but not perfect sound","review":"These are an excellent price, and the sound is \\"ok\\", but there is a hissing sound in the background that is difficult to minimize (even changing channels, moving the base like it says)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacking Bass","review":"Helpful hit:Turn off any other wireless devices in your house while useing the headphones.I had my baby monitor on and I got scratchy reception.However, when I turned it off, it was clear as a bell!! :DThe product has 'some' bass, but I usually listen to ambient - house music, and the headphones aren't cut out for it.Classical, country, rock, and TV would be great for these headphones.Overall, it's a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying hissing","review":"I have not been able to find a way to eliminate an annoying interference for the headphones (I have two) The transmitter is plugged into the headphone outlet of an Onkyo receiver.

The headset has excellend sound quality, the reception is good even as far as 50 feet away from the transmitter. I had this unit for about 2 months now and it has worked as advertised every time. Occasionally when I walk away from the source sound and place the tv on pause I get a low hiss in my ears but as soon as I turn the tv back on the recetion is again very good. Oh one added bunes and if you are nosy like me at times I can hear the phone conversation from my next door neighbor when they speak on a wireless phone. Overall a good product I would recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"These are great. Great sound, and picks up better sounds than my surround sound system. The only reason I would not give this 5 stars is that it falls off my head sometimes. There are just a bit wide and I have a conical aka egg shaped head. and the other reason is that you can't just turn off the base when not in use. Once it picks up an audio signal it will turn on, even if you are not using the headphones.For the price, it really can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sounding headphones when you can hear them","review":"Sennheiser products have always been synonomous with quality but I take exception to the cheap construction of these headphones. When you move your head the slightest little bit, the part that goes on top of your head creaks loudly. They even creak when I clench my jaw during suspensful scenes. The actual sound quality is good but the constant loud creaking is a pain in the neck. The batteries hold a charge well and the charger works well.They still work perfectly well after several years but they have been retired to my junk closet due to the intolerable creaking noises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on them - they are a piece of junk","review":"I usually do not take the time to write a review but in this case I had to.

Read reviews on Amazon and other places about the Sennheiser. The headphones work not only in the living room but i get perfect reception in all rooms on first floor of my house. I was not expecting that. Only problem I had was plugging into the audio jack on my TV. I plugged into wrong one initially. (There are two separate and distinct jacks on my TV for audio output.)

Walk outside as far as 300' from the TV and hear the audio clearly. Easy to install and use. The headphone ear pieces are comfortable. The headphone could use better padding on top of your head, although it is not a significant discomfort. Headphone has fallen off my head when I bent over. Great product I would recommend without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suddenly LOUD static noise for no reason....","review":"Even used with in 20ft from the base and tune to the right freq...then after a while, lost the audio signal and filled with a loud static noise.

By the time you wondering off, it will brings you with a loud...sahhhh...in your ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interference destroys the product","review":"This product suffers from some horrible interference, randomly blasting static at about double the volume of the source. Additionally, rather than having an intelligent power save functionality, the headphones will output the same static noise continuously if the base station goes into sleep mode while the headphones are on. Since this can happen after just a couple of minutes, one needs to be very careful when pausing the source that they are watching.Aside from the deafening static issues, the product has seemingly awesome battery life and sound quality (considering the price and the wireless connection), but the static blasts are a deal breaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the low end model","review":"Overall this model is pretty good being that it is at the lower end of the product line for Sennheiser. I really like the charging feature and the fact that it has rechargeable AAA batteries. For me, the only drawback was the way the headphones fit on my ears. Being that I wear hearing aids this model wouldn't work well for me as it would fit onto my ears and not over as some of the higher end models do. Being that it was a gift to someone else it was perfect. I highly recommend this brand over all of the others out there. I've had my RS110 for 6 years now and have replaced the rechargeable batteries 2x. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hisses, Clicks, and Auto Shut Off","review":"Unfortunately I'll be returning these headphones. They seem to work at my loft but when I brought them to the office there is a constant fast clicking that present on all channels and frequencies. Most noticeable during quiet songs or spoken word. The auto shut off is really annoying. If I pause a song for more than 5 or 10 minutes the headphones blast static into my ears. Then starting up a song takes them a 1 to 2 seconds to stop the static and start the music, clicking and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design -","review":"The RS120 has great sound but ear pieces are not parallel with each other and angle out towards the back of the head.

Even standing 2' away from the transmitter, there was a quiet but audible hiss at all times plus bursts of static like you'd hear on the radio anytime I moved my head.They did sound good, but the interference was just too much to bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transmitter times out too soon","review":"Great audio walking around the house. The signal is overall very good. Very comfortable.Bad: These headphones are designed so that after 2 minutes of no sound being transmitted, (for example, you paused your iTune track) the transmitter turns itself off and all you get a sudden earful of LOUD static through the headphones. Don't count on wearing these if you want to turn your computer speakers off and just wear headphones at your desk for the occasional song or sound. If there aren't any sounds playing, you'll be blasted abruptly with loud static after the 2 minute timeout period. I wish there was a way to set how long that is -- 2 minutes seems way too short and it always happens abruptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously sucks","review":"I thought a product with so many good reviews couldn't possibly be a horrible product but it happened. Similar to other bad reviews, it took forever for me to hook up the charging cradle because it would only fit and stay if you held it at a certain angle. Sent it back after numerous tries. I really wanted this to work but it just didn't.

I've had it for a litle over two months and the problems are now starting. The headphone cut off after approximately 10 minutes and it takes quite awhile to get the tuner to work again as well as getting rid of the noise associated with it. I thought it might have been my location and I used the less expensive RS110 which worked perfectly.I do not recommend the RS120 unless you have to have re-chargeable batteries. The RS110 is a better headset at a much lower price. The only difference is that the RS110 uses regular batteries so don't waste your money on the less reliable RS120."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I painstakingly searched every electronic store for quality and price. These Sennheiser HDR120 headphones have great sound, great range, great battery life, and are as comfortable as any wireless headphones that I have owned.

A couple very brief static interruptions very rarely as with any wireless headphone, nothing to effect my love of these headphones. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am VERY pleased with these headphones","review":"These are great wireless headphones, especially for the price. They were purchased so that I could watch TV without bothering my wife. They are great for that and for just listing to music. The sound quality is absolutely excellent. While they don't emulate surround sound, the richness of the sound and stereo separation is very good. I've been all over the house on all three levels and the sound quality remains consistently good. The sound quality of these headphones compares favorable with wired headphones but there is freedom to move around without the cord. On rare occasion, you will hear an electrostatic pop in the headphones, but it is not offensive. The headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods; however they do tend to slip off if you bend your head over when wearing them. Overall, these are great headphones and I am glad that I made the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"two times defective!","review":"Purchased as a gift for my husband.

I swapped them around and discovered each pair worked fine in the bedroom, but not in the living room. I bought a long cable extension to move the transmitter out of the living room, but that didn't help.I must be getting some kind of interference from somewhere. The bedroom pair started picking up static as well after a week, so I gave up on them.

The constant underlying hum is so bad that they are unusable. Before sending them back, I decided to give them a couple of days trial using them instead with my computer, listening to music as I worked, just to see if they were worth keeping even though my original intention was lost. The sound quality when used with the computer was very good. However, the power cord to the charging dock failed within two days and the headset stopped transmitting.

They have a fairly constant background hiss that I could probably learn to live with. It's the intermittent higher pitched interference/static/feedback that really got to me in the end. Tried all the suggestions like switching the transmitter channel/tuning or increasing the source sound on the TV but it made no difference. I'd be watching a scene and the interference would just randomly kick in and it was deafening at times -- literally would have to pull them off my head as quick as possible and then try again when my ears had recovered.

It is such an improvement in their listening experience - the frustration and irritation of volume wars are now a thing of the past.

With regrets I did research and based my purchase of the RS 120 on the Sennheiser brand name and purchaser's reviews.Pro - The range is great and far greater than my old headset. The volume control is really great for tuning down the commercials volume. The sound quality is really good. Amazon had the best price for this headset, Radio Shack wanted over $100 for them.Con - I agree with the reviewer who said the ear covers should be leather because this material is slightly irritating and I am going to cover mine with a soft material. I also dislike the fact that they fall off easily if you are not just sitting and listening. I like to cook and clean when wearing my headset and as soon as I put my head down the headset falls off.

At first I didn't get reception but changed the channel on the base and all is fine. Great sound, not a lot of bass, but suitable for my needs.

Good quality of sound i would say and sometimes i have statick noise but its fixible when u take jaks from tv (as im using it for) out and put them in right back.

There's no reason for this 'feature' and it is a complete deal breaker.Otherwise, the headphones work well. The sound quality and reception are better than I expected. The fit is a little floppy for my head size but not so much that it drives me wild.

I love that I can be upstairs and the sound from the TV is crystal clear. They don't cup around the ears, so when you look down or up, they sometimes slip or fall off.

All of the good reviews in my opinion are coming from people who have damaged their ears, and/or don't mind the obvious and annoying feeback, the instability of the connection, and the bursts of volume shooting into your ear because of that instability. The tuner/channels/volume are the only control's you have beside the range and other things causing interferance. And after an hour of trying to get the darn things to stay clear using the channel/tuner/volume, I had no success, and only much frustration and pain due to speaker shreiks as I call them.

Sounds is totally clear throughout my apartment without any static or fading (the transmitter location was very important, by the way -- too close to my computer speakers and the reception suffered).Frequency response of the unit could be a little better... bass is somewhat bad, actually, so those of you who want to feel your music had better go with another unit, but midrange is excellent, very clear, and high treble is pretty decent, too.Batteries have lasted over 12 hours now without recharging, and still I have great reception.The headphones are fairly comfortable. I haven't worn them 30+ minutes yet, but the time that I had them on, I didn't mind the feel at all. Earpads are soft, too.All in all, I'm happy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"My wife and I will use these to listen to books / TV shows through a Kindle fire while rocking our newborn to sleep. I was very excited to cut the cable, since it is tricky to manage with a little one snoozing in your arms. However, the base would only keep the input signal for an hour or so and then disconnect. The headphones still worked, the base charging light still went on, but the green signal light went out, and so did the audio.Because of all the great reviews I figured we must have got an odd error, so I exchanged them, but the next set had the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"Easy connect, okay sound but very uncomfortable.

I sit less than 3 feet from my receiver. Absolute waste of money!These are my first wireless headphones, so maybe I'm being too harsh or maybe I'm just and audiophile.

That was years ago, I was hoping these would be different, but they're not. They have good sound quality but theres a constant buzz/humming noise no matter where I place the base and no matter how I tune the frequency, that is completely unacceptable as I just wanted headphones to have on while in my office so I could just walk around from time to time, lay down on the couch, and still be isolated with my music.I just received the headphones today, tried them out for a couple hours, returning them. I will never try wireless again, the loss in audio quality is just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones","review":"This is my first set of wireless headphones so I don't have something to compare this set too. The headphones were easy to install. The sound quality is very good. I went outside the house and could still hear good quality sound. The headphones are comfortable to wear. A good tip I learned from previous reviews is to turn up the volumn on the tv set. This method prevents any background distortion. The only negative I can come up with is the fit. Again they are comfortable but not a snug fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate these headphones, returning to Amazon","review":"I've spent over two hours trying to find the right frequency setting so I don't get very noticeable interference while listening to music.

I'm returning and going back to wired."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first return to Amazon","review":"Unlike a few other reviewers, I had no problem with the fitting of the headphones or the charging cradle. And I really don't want to attribute the 2 star review to the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones. Although our TV is not ancient, it is an older model and although I tried every conceivable hook-up there was and let the headphones charge for more than the 24-hour period, I could never get rid of the constant static. Finally, after a fair amount of trial and error, I repackaged them in the original boxes and applied for an online refund with Amazon (my very first refund), printed out the labels and authorization and returned it to Amazon.Of course, I was disappointed because they seemed like good headphones but not compatible with our TV.

The headphones fit poorly; actually drop off my head if I bend over. There is no red light on the headphones to tell you that they are on. Neither the distance nor the quality is any better than my old, cheap Panasonic ones. If I go into another room ~30-40 feet away especially if there is a wall between the headphones and the transmitter I begin to get hiss and interference. UPDATE-Lowered Star rating-after time you find the tuner and volume control mechanism start to fail-still using them but it is a royal pain. If someone changes settings then you can spend half an hour trying to re-balance the tuner and volume wheels. The only positive note is that my off the shelf rechargeable batteries work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hissssssssssssssssssssssssssss","review":"These headphones have some good points: comfort, easy set-up out of the box, good directions, and they are attractive. Unfortunately, I hear a constant HISSS when wearing them. Not always a loud hiss, but always detectable, and sometimes quite annoying. This may be the nature of the FM signal. Also, I get about 20-30 feet from the base & I start getting annoying interference (I would estimate the range to be just shy of the distance from my sofa to my bathroom). Last, if the phones don't detect a signal, they go to LOUD WHITE NOISE!!!!!!!!! Don't try muting the commercials!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Those giving one star are correct, do not understand other ratings","review":"I had previously owned RS 45's and they were lost.

That's how completely disappointed I am in this unit. Hopefully this will save others from making the mistake of purchasing these.As the title says, the auto-off feature renders these headphones utterly useless. They work fine for awhile, then suddenly turn off, even though there is no break in the audio! When the unit shuts off, the resulting loud static through the headphones is jolting, to say the least.

After all the positive reviews these seemed like a bargain, but they were incredibly disappointing. My biggest complaint is that these are very uncomfortable. Unlike other large headphones which use a soft rubber ring around the earpieces, these are just flat with a scratchy soft material covering them. I cannot imagine wearing these through an entire movie. They are hot on your head and make your ears hurt after 10 minutes or so. The sound is mediocre at best with a fairly noticeable hiss. I really wouldn't recommend these to anyone. Save your money and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns off while in use. Flawed design","review":"I was very excited to order a pair of these headsets for viewing TV quietly. They were great at first and had good sound quality. On the first day, the base station (transmitter) turned off in the middle of a program. I thought the unit was defective so I tried the other one since we ordered a pair of them. The result was the same, within an hour the (new) base station shut itself off in the middle of viewing again. I gave it a few more days and several more tries with similar results.If you don't mind the sound cutting off and getting static in the ear suddenly while not being able to turn the base station back on for 1-10 minutes at a time, then this might be an acceptable product for you. I returned both of mine for a refund as it's just too annoying to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable--possibly because of the automatic shut-off","review":"Perhaps I've just been unlucky, but I have found the Sennheiser headphones extremely unreliable. I was very pleased when I first purchased the unit--after less than a week they went dead; i.e., the charger continued to work, but no transmission. I returned the unit and got a replacement. My only annoyance was that, occasionally, it would simply cut off. Gradually this became more common and annoying. I knew it had a 2 year warranty, but didn't realize I had owned it as long as I had. Finally last month, it became impossible to use because of the constant shut-offs. When I checked my warranty & sales slip, I realized I had owned it for two months beyond the warranty. When I prepared to order another one, I mentioned it to my son. Turned out, he had the same problem with his Sennheiser PS 120 and--though he didn't return it--he doesn't use it any more because of the sound cut-off.

Since I have both - I can easily switch either headset to either source transmitter. Currently 1 of my sources is linked to my receiver's zone 2 output - so I can listen to all my input hooked to it and in case either headset runs out of battery I can quickly switch over to the other one.I use it for listening to the news (radio or tv). I am extremely happy with my purchases, though the fit could be better it does make me think that perhaps if the fit was tighter I would not find them as comfortable.

It is very hard to keep your mouth dry while applying the gel and you'll find that it just runs off with the saliva. Once I had \\"invented\\" a way to keep my mouth dry (by putting tissue paper under my tongue) I still didn't notice any whitening.

The other thing that you should know is that many sellers SAY they have the 14 track version but you order it, you get the 11 track version.

Even for longtime DEVO fans/collectors, you'll be hard pressed to find ONE good track on this horrid CD - just lots of annoying, grating, hyperactive, tinny sounding late 80s/early 90s synth-pop masquerading as pop-art.

It appears that they reunited at the dawn of the '90s, only to recycle some of the worst cliches of the '80s. The production techniques were already dated when they made this CD, and are TERRIBLY dated now. The songs are pathetically weak, the vocals and lyrics are lame--just awful, even laughable (and not in a cool way like Duty Now for the Future).

NO","review":"This is so damn depressing, to even think about this album makes me sad. Devo were one of the great 70s bands (yes I'm counting their early college recordings as 72-80 was when Devo were at their prime), pioneers along with The Ramones. In the 80s they got worse with each album, each one being more dull than the last, yes I got it but I didn't really care and no one else did by the time this one came out. Devo were getting no respect from their record company being treated like garbage. The music channels threw their videos off this album back at them (Devo was the only \\"different\\" band that ever got constant airplay, more than the awesome Ween could ever hope for) and they got no airplay, the band must have been suicidal. Devo died with a tiny pathetic beep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brainy Bye-bye","review":"DEVO had one more album in them before Mark Mothersbaugh decided there was more to be done scoring \\"Rugrats\\" cartoons, Disney cable shows and movie soundtrack work. \\"Smooth Noodle Maps\\" (the title refers to the patterns on the surface of a human brain) plays to all the strengths of their \\"Freedom Of Choice\\" salad days. The guitars are back among the electronics, and the compositions are hooky and dance floor smart. The one-two punch of \\"Stuck In A Loop Again\\" and \\"Post Post Modern Man\\" reinvigorate the theory of de-evolution in a powerful fashion, with a great deal of zip. They even throw in a DEVO-esque cover of the ancient \\"Morning Dew\\" (probably best known as a Grateful Dead favorite) to prove they still have what it takes to twist an oldie. They may have lost most of their sense of societal irony, but with the nasty \\"Jimmy\\" and the burned out relationship blues of \\"Dawghaus,\\" DEVO at least could claim they closed up shop with a solid recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another post-Warner jewel","review":"More mellow than Total DEVO.A reflective period for the band?Suffered from poor label support and promotion.You are remiss if your collection does not include this."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"Bought this unit along with the Extreme gigabit wireless router.

They were friends before they became lovers and that was great. Of course I wish they would have made up quicker, but they were both stubborn people. I could tell they were really close even from the beginnng when they were children. Of course I love the epliogue! The love scenes were hot! And the novel was just great.

This albums just rips into \\"Redemption\\" which is by far one of the best tracks.. it just slays it's way through and I was eager to hear more after that. I think the best tracks are \\"Redemption\\", \\"A call to the faithful\\", \\"Your walls, my words\\" and \\"Rose among the ashes\\". These guys do metalcore well and although it's a genre starting to get very full and the songs structure gets a little predictable I can still find something fresh about these guys and something that doesn't make me want to shake my head and just turn off the stereo.

After reading some articles about it, I was interested to know more. Although this is well written, what I got was no more than what I could get through google. Some real world examples and anecdotes would have made this book great, but instead we get some general abstract theory about stupidity.One thing that I found interesting was the affirmation that any person can be stupid, whatever his or her other characteristics (race, gender, IQ, social status, etc.) are.

Originally, it seems, Joyce was exploring the Tristan-Isolde-Mark triangle, perhaps with the idea of basing his new book on that framework much as he had based Ulysses on the Odyssey. Hayman shows the emergence of HCE and ALP that took over the original idea, as well as the setting at a Wake.

I found this book to be insulting and perpetuating negative stereotypes. It wouldn't be so bad if it were actually accurate, but that's not even how real hip-hop musicians talk; this book is nothing more than some white girls' ignorant interpretation of what they think hip-hop music is like.

She talks about ghosts and probably old Malay traditions. The only useful information is that you need to bring your sweater because the offices are way over-cooled.As a matter of fact there is not much valid information about Malaysian living from an expat's point of view on the net.

The author describes in detail how one of the pups, through its instincts, tried to swim to shore when the rancher threw them in the river. Any self-respecting upland hunter who loves dogs would not have borrowed the \\"time-of-day\\" from this rancher--let alone a shotgun. My Instincts tell me never to pick-up this book up again!

I had previously heard people say that it was crackly sometimes.

I really wanted to get Sennheiser's as they seemed to be the best, but the price was usually pretty steep. So glad I found these puppies! My wife and I both find them to be very comfortable and the sound quality is just superb. Besides the TV, I also use them to listen to music while I'm surfing the web -- they work great with my PC.

It's also super annoying that you have to tune the knob on the right-hand side in order to get the right frequency that you want. Finally battery life is really horrible.

I expected the battery life to be a lot better than this - to be honest I had expected at least 3-4 weeks at 3 hours of average listening time per day. I am so disappointed in this.

From what I was told, most of the 900Mhz wireless headphones are like that. I decided to try the TV Ears since it's InfraRed based, and doesn't have the hissing/static sound issue. On the other hand, the TV Ears only work if you have line of sight between the headphones and the transmitter.-The RS-110 is pretty bulky - although quite comfortable. It just gets a bit warm after wearing it for a long time. The TV Ears I'm using now is much more lightweight and comfortable.

Guess what, it took a minute to figure out how to set the frequency at the base station and then fine tune the signal using the dial on the headphones. They sound great, no hum, comfortable, no wires! I prefer over-the-ear headphones because foam pressing against your ears can get tiresome, but these feel pretty darn nice. While these headphones don't use rechargeable batteries it still would have been convenient to build a cradle onto the base station, you have to find a place to lay the headphones when not in use. This is probably the one design flaw. Also, you have to turn off the headphones when you set them down for even a short time or a tremendous hum comes out of the phones due to lost signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT product ESPECIALLY at this price","review":"We bought TWO of these they were so good.

For my application I had to plug the RCA connectors into an adapter with a 1/8\\" jack on the end and plug that into another adapter to get it to 1/4\\".Second, the power connector was very difficult to seat. I couldn't do it with my fingers. I had to gently use a pair of needle-nose pliers to do it.Finally, their performance is poor. I couldn't get a decent volume even though I had my Yamaha Clavinova maxed on volume and the headphones maxed on volume. They were noisy.

I purchased 4 rechargeable batteries with charger & I am never at a loss for power to the earphones. Use 2 in the phones & 2 on the charger & after 10 hours of use or so, just make the switch. The sending unit is small enough that it sits on the shelving below the TV.

I was happy with it after connecting it to my home pc and listening to a few songs on it.Then I started discovering its flaws, and they far outweight the pros. While watching a movie, there was noticeable hissing noise that is very annoying. I tried to change channels and fine tune it, but even standing two feet away from the transmitter, you can't get rid of it.And then there's the transmitter. It has a \\"feature\\" that turns itself off after 5 minutes, and when this happens, the headphone will just throw a very loud static noise on your ears.

I use the headphones to watch HD TV and recordings after my wife does to bed (My sound system speakers are in the ceiling below the master bedroom!) With the headphones, it sounds like I'm in a 1-person movie theater! My only complaint - which has been documented by other reviewers - is that the volume and tuning wheel controls are hard to feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality remanufactured wireless headphones","review":"Only one inconvenience with this item. There is a dial on the back of the headphones that has to be tuned to the receiver. It is easy to tune to the right frequency, but just be careful that it doesn't get bumped. So far in over a month, I've only bumped it out of frequency once, so it's not that bad of a problem.Now for the positives. I've never listened to the music full blast because my ears are already bad, but the sound quality is really good to me. I use it at work and the range is better than I expected. I estimate 50 feet easily around corners and through a wall. The fit is comfortable around the ears and I only feel gentle pressure on the head, so it easy to relax with. If the thing ever stops working, I can use the earphones as ear muffs. It is easy to hook up to stereos or computers through ear phone jacks. Adapter is provided for different sizes.Would I recommend? Yes, Especially at the price I got them for (~$26 with shipping included)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reciever keeps losing connection","review":"Nice headphones but the receiver keeps losing the connection to the TV. At first I was unable to get any channel to tune in on the first TV I tried. Moved to a different TV and was able to tune in. After 3 minutes the receiver dropped the connection with the TV. I had to unplug and replug in the headphone jack to re-establish the connection. After 3 minutes, it happened again. After numerous attempts to move the receiver it kept losing the connection every 3 minutes or so. I have returned the set and will be ordering a set of headphones with a long wire instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms R","review":"Purchased this product from Circuit City. 2 weeks after purchase, the unit started turning off and creating whitenoise in the headphones.

Too much interference!","review":"These headphones are comfortable, they sound good, but whether it's the 900 Mhz frequency or just poor reception from the headphones, these don't work well where I live. I could not get rid of the interference that would come through in waves, like tuning into a weak station on an old A.M radio. I tried re-tuning, adjusting the transmitter around the room, staying still in a place with the least static, all to no avail. Can't recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last more than a month","review":"Sennheiser lasted for about a month, then the batteries wore out, I replaced the batteries, and then the lite on the wireless tower keep blinking, and I checked all connections, and finally it just went KAPUT......

No issue with the quality as far as I could hear, I used them practically three times a week. However, I just found out in the last week that they broke! The headphones work as far as I can tell, there's still a static sound that comes out of them, but the base doesn't light up when I plug it in, which means I think the base's power is shot for some reason. Of course the amazon return policy doesn't work anymore, so I'm stuck with a large pair of headphones which just breath out static. Great. Does anyone know how to get in touch with the manufacturer? This is clearly a manufacturer's defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money - very disappointed!","review":"These headphones work great - for about 15 minutes only! They sound fades and keeps getting lower and lower no matter how high the volume is and how much I try to re-tune the frequency. Eventually I have to take them off because I can't hear the TV at all. A giant waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I purchased this set of wireless headphones as replacement set for another Sennheiser set that was damaged during our move. The units will not stand up to even minor vibration or accidental jarring. When I received the new unit, and followed the set up instructions, the headphones would not tune to the base reciever and only register a faint static signal. My first set was made in Germany and worked great. This set was made in China and basically dead out of the box. Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and bulky","review":"I thought this might be a low-cost replacement for my current set, but was disappointed with the comfort of the headset. They are foam, but lay heavily on the ears. After 'bout half-an-hour they became warm and uncomfortable. Also, the headphones do not rest on the transmitter, which is inconvenient. I returned them and will look for something else.Also, they use 2 AAA batteries which must be replaced when they run down. I do not know how long this takes, but I assume that the low cost is the reason for this.Not too bad, unless you are used to something better. Don't but his just to save money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend this to anyone","review":"I purchased this mainly because it was on sale. I was in the market for some wireless headphones but didn't want to pay $100+ to but a pair. The sound quality is very poor. I can be right next to the transmitter and have \\"fuzzy\\" noises go in and out with very poor reception even within 10 feel of the signal transmitter. The headphones aren't very comfortable for my head and sit a little funny as well. One major thing that bugs me about these headphones is the fact that you have to keep tweaking the tuner and it doesn't automatically tune itself. Maybe I was asking too much for a pair of headphones but I honestly can't recommend this pair of headphones to anyone. It would be worth it to purchase a more expensive pair of headphones than to deal with the hassels of this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"The truth is that I thought I had made ''a good buy but I was disappointed when I started using it, my tv is 8 feet away and the signal is interrupted for 2 minutes each time, 2 minutes you hear very well and the signal drops for 2 minutes and even more, so it was like throwing the money in the garbage"},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones","review":"have had these for almost 3 yrs my kids bought them for me and they are great never have had on problem the range on them is amazing my wife was able to go almost a half a block before it started to fade"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do buy these headphones","review":"These headphones work very well now that I have removed the \\"Y\\" RCA connections. They would only for a few minutes then breeeeeeeeeeeeekkkkkkkkkkk the base shuts itself off and you get a loud screeeeech in your ears. Once I went straight through the TV output they work pretty well. The TV volume does have to be up to a certain level or they shut off. I have gone down to the basement and not lost the signal and took the garbage to the street once.Minor annoyance: the headphones make my ears warm ( bad when it is already muggy, nice in the winter).They seem to use the AAA batteries fairly quickly, but a pair of rechargeable AAA's will keep the cost down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable to wear, clunky to use","review":"Save your money. These headphones lack the single most important (IMHO) attribute any good headset has to possess - comfort! If you can't wear them, why buy them? Rigid plastic construction makes for a tight squeeze on my thin head - I'd hate to wear these if I had a fatter noggin. Seriously, I couldn't wear these for more than 15 minutes without suffering discomfort. I couldn't even focus on the sound quality because I was trying to find a position for these to rest where they didn't make my head feel it would pop. Never was able to find that sweet spot, either. All that, plus I hate how the controls are laid out on the cans themselves - the \\"on/off\\" button is badly placed and easy to forget. I've had other Sennheiser products which I've loved (including the PMX-70 sports headset), but this one is a turkey. Back it goes for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpliest and best Wireless Headphone","review":"This Wireless Headphone is easy to use and performs wonderfully. My husband is hard of hearing and this lets him hear the TV as loud as he needs it, while not disturbing the rest of us from hearing it the way we need it.

It was the best investment that we ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"A prototype?","review":"I was extremely disappointed with these headphones. The sound quality is horrible, and the material and the craftsmanship is very poor. I felt the loud static would damage my ears.

Cheap headphones, poor sound quality that you cannot tune in just right, so you get lots of hiss and interference. If you are watching a movie or playing a video game, and you pause for too long, the headphones blast your eardrums out with white noise which will make you sweat and grind your teeth with stress.

On the other hand, if you like good sound and expect that current wireless technologies could deliver decent quality, then look away. Sennheiser is a great brand. I have a pair of HD 280 Pros that easily compete with headphones 5x their price (don't just take my word for it). However, Sennheiser has completely failed this time. Horrible quality (I'm only 8 feet away) plus the static is TREMENDOUS. Unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless headset with a german name and a Chinese Manufaturer","review":"This wireless headset has very good stereo sound.

My 92 y/o dad lives in an apartment and needs the volume up, but does not want to disturb the neighbors. These are perfect. Simple design and uncomplicated operating procedure. We can set it up for him and need not worry about getting phone calls that it's not working. There is no need to place the headpiece in a cradle and when done, he can hang them on a hook next to his easy chair. Warning; they are not crush proof when stepped on. This is his second pair!

A bluetooth set may bit a more but it is definitely leagues better than this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for yourself or as a gift","review":"Purchased this item for a client who was hard of hearing and did not want to disturb his wife during evening viewing. He had another set in his office and the three channel slection worked great with the other pair being in range of the first pair, no cross talk. Good product for the price and no call backs from the client. Comfortable pads that keep out unwanted noise and keep in sound to not disturb others.

The ear cups are not cupped. They are very loose and definately don't block out any external noise. It's like they just rest on the side of your head, and can easily move off the ear. I wanted wireless, but in this price range the quality just wasn't there so I went back to Turtle Beach wired headset X12 (they are marketed for Xbox but I use them just to watch TV). In this price range I couldn't find wireless headsets that compared to the sound I get out of the X12s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Suitable for Music Listening","review":"Like others, I was somewhat bothered by background hiss, although it was barely audible. Even more annoying was the poor sound quality of the headphones themselves. The bass was muddy, even fuzzy. Mid range was acceptable, but sometimes was accompanied by buzzing, and the treble was thin and weak. And as for \\"sound stage\\", there was none. Stereo imaging was nonexistent despite noticeable left to right separation. The Sennheiser RS110s would probably be OK for television or talk radio, but few would want to listen to music with them. I was forced to return them due to the sonic defects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I bought these cordless headphones to replace my broken Radio Shack one's and to be honest with everyone, the sound is GREAT ..... when the batteries are fully charged. But the sound comes and goes and is constantly has a knocking sound. The first week or two they worked great, but since the batteries died and I recharged them the headphones have not worked as well.In all fairness to the heaphones, maybe I need to get some NEW rechargeable batteries.I one thing I DO LIKE it they have a control to adjust the reception received on them, which is a nice feature. OVERALL, I DO like the sound quality, I just have to see if it a battery issue I am currently having. For $39.99 and FREE S/H I would buy another set ( if the battery issue is resolved )."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad...","review":"With distance or too many obstacles in the way a little fuzzyness, bulky on your head, and hard to fine tune to get the best reception, but as with any other wireless device, the signal will vary from day to day from different circumstances. Too many steps just to turn on and listen, and no on/off switch on the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Sennheiser Headphones","review":"Excellent headphones. Great for watching TV without disturbing others and getting superior sound to boot! No more having to keep the volume too low and missing most of the dialogue. Comfortable even after using for a few hours at a time. No hiss, no static and very good range. Would get a rechargeable model if doing it all over, since I put in a lot of time using them and two little triple-a Energizers or Duracells can only last so long. I gave them 4 not 5 stars only since the volume and tune controls are a little difficult to adjust when wearing and the batteries go as mentioned. But overall, a fine headphone, well worth the price and serves it's purpose well."},{"rating":"1","title":"headphones","review":"purchased on 4-26-09, worked good for about a month, then kept switching off and all i would get is noise. would have to turn tv of then on so it would turn back on. what a piece of crap. demand replacement or money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product . . . in 1979!","review":"These wireless headphones are darn near the \\"junk\\" cateogry. They do work a little bit but not very well. Would have been great 30 years ago. These are possibly defective. The box looked great. The instructions were fine. The power supply plug was a bit difficult to insert and difficult to manipulate. I could tune in 1 channel just fine, but it it was impossible to get enough amplitude when I tuned in both ears. I will try a different brand next time.Luckily it's easy to return items to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, so bad I sent them immediately back","review":"I have used a couple other wireless Sennheiser models, these were the worst ever! I wouldn't expect them to perform as well as my $200 set, but I have used another cheaper model and it was still way better than these. The sound I got was so garbled and full of static that it was indecipherable. Whether I had some other wireless device causing the problem I don't know, what I do know is these were unusable. I sent them back and got a wired set instead, and just use a really long extension cord. Not quite the freedom of wireless but works well enough, without all the static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"The base unit for the wireless headphones will shut off in 3 to 5 minutes, unless the base source volume is turned up so loud, that even with the headphone volume turned down, is near the threshold of pain.Maybe other units work well, but mine does not work. If you look on their website, this question has been posted (why does my base shut off), and Sennheiser's answer is the volume is too low; therefore, I can only believe this problem is common.Mine even shut off, when I can hear music through the headsets across the room. The volume switch on the headset itself needs to be modified to allow for about 10% of the current sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - too many design flaws","review":"Where should I start? To many design flaws.1- Not suitable for office use since people around you can be disturbed. Yes, loud.2- The jack plugging into the audio port is too big, so I don't expect it to last. Very likely the cleaning person (or you) will hit it by accident and bend it. It happened to my co-worker sitting next to me, so it's not rare at all.3- MAJOR FLAW - the FM transmitter turns itself off if it detects that there's no music playing for 10min or so. After that, if the music is back on, it's not automatically on, and I had to unplug and re-plug the audio jack from my computer computer to turn it back on (!!!!). Even when the music is on for 30min, the FM transmitter malfunctions and turns itself off; as a result, all you hear in the headset is static, and the static is extremely loud like a radio that you can hear it from 200ft away (!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts Off Mysteriously: DON'T BUY THIS IS JUNK!!!","review":"Pretty good sound when it works if you don't mind a little humming sound now and then, but it often shuts off completely for no apparent reason. To get it to play after shut off, I have to unplug whatever device I had plugged into the base unit and re-plug in and then maybe it will work for a few minutes. Sometimes when it shuts off the sound from the device that I want to listen to, it plays the neighbor's TV station into the headset. Basically worthless junk because of unreliability. I wasted hard earned money on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these with all my heart","review":"I purchased these for use with my computer but they did not come with any computer hook-ups even though the description says they do.

After that you should be fine. When I brought it I thought I'll be able to walk with both my iTouch and the headphone. Not so. If I wanted to listen to music I'll have to connect my iTouch to the \\"station\\" and listen to it like that (without being able to walk).

First of all, they are huge. I'm a girl and they made me look like I was wearing an alien device on my head. They would fit a guy better but if you are female, be aware they are LARGE. Second, there isn't a hanging rack for them. It's a bummer since I had a tower unit previously that I could just hang the headphones on and that kept them together nice and neat. Lastly I like to listen to the music pretty low. I wear them at work and I want to hear the music but not be bombarded by it. You turn on the headphones but the base has an auto on/auto off function. Apparently with the volume turned down, it doesn't think it is in use and will literally cut itself (and you) off a minute or so into a song. Sigh.... All in all, they were really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"This was the worst piece of electronics I have ever seen.Remanufactured garbage it is not as represeneted.

But first of all, you cannot use them if someone else in the house is watching TV without cable, because it picks up the antenna signal even if it is not plugged into the TV! Secondly, they simply stop working for no reason. You'll be listening along, and all of a sudden you'll just get noise, and the base \\"on\\" light will go off.

That said, I use mine when I'm on my treadmill hoofing it, so they get plenty of bouncing. These are comfortable to wear, block out some of the noise of the treadmill and I can hear movies or workout videos playing on my computer even 25 feet away in the kitchen. they may work for greater distances, but that is all I've tested so far. I've had these about 6 months and use them 4-5 times a week for a couple of hours per use and they are still working. they don't require you keep any internal bands compressed to get a signal - they only have to be on your head. The band is comfortable but sturdy enough they seldom fall off unless I'm really snapping my head around.

It works, and it works well. Once hooked up to my TV audio out, I could listen anywhere in the house, in the garage, and in the yard. I don't experience the hissing and dropped reception that others are claiming, I guess it depends on each individual situation. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you can't mute the TV and listen, the TV must have some volume on for the headphone to work. Kind of defeats the purpose of not disturbing your significant other while she's sleeping and you're watching TV in the bedroom. I wish I could mute the TV and still listen over the headphone. I'll buy another set - but this time I'll get the RS120, with the rechargeable battery and cradle.

It uses an RF transmitter rather than infrared so I can move around the room without losing the signal. It uses regular batteries so I don't have to keep it on a charger and the battery life is very good.

And its few feet away from cable box or DVD. Tuning it is really hard (takes me at least 3 mins to find a audible frequency). The auto turn off its a bad idea, at least for me. I cant believe this was made by Sennheiser. The reason i did not return it was because the same day, my sister was clean the house so she also threw the receipt and original box."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need a big head.","review":"Excellent quality and sound.

Unfortunately, the device has no on or off switch - it is supposed to sense input and activate itself. However, either through the mini-jack or the RCA cables, that doesn't work reliably on our TV. The device often fails to activate itself (requiring a trip to the TV to pop the connector in and out) or, worse, turns itself off in mid-use, blasting your ears with static (since amplification is also weak, you need to have the volume way up on the headphones to get usable volume). It's also a pain to tune the signal with the dial - its extremely challenging to find the signal since it tunes for only the tiniest sliver of the dial's travel, and any twitch of your thumb loses it again.My wife has given up using it and is back to closed captions. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh","review":"I bought these to go with my new turntable, so I could listen anywhere in my room or my dorm common room, possibly even outside. There seems to be a lot of noise and hissing whenever i use them, however. I would be sitting in my desk or reading on my bed, both not even a yard away, and the hissing would still persist. The tuning is awkward, as you have to be pretty precise to get the sound. The perfect frequency gives off a nice and clear sound, but it's sadly muddled with the noise previously mentioned. I tried it out once in the common room, which is literally right outside of the door, and my tinnitus just enjoyed that white noise very much. The comfort is all right. They don't hurt my ears after extended play, so that's a major plus. They do slip off pretty easily, which gets annoying when lying down and reading a book. definitely do not fall asleep with these on, else you wake up to blasting white noise as mentioned in many of the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"Sound was great, but they don't fit the head well.

Each alchemist featured starts with a brief bio of him and then the images of his engravings. After that is translations of the latin on the engravins and an inerpretation.However, I must warn you that the translations from latin are very simple, they will say 'cook' when the word means 'cook by boiling down'. It is best to check any translations you wish to rely on. As for the authors interpretation's, that is strictly a matter of opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book.","review":"My book arrived quickly and in excellent condition.

I would not recommend these wiper blades if you want good looks and good performance.

YOU WILL NOT SEE ANY NUDITY here, which was one of the main reasons I bought it. The girls get interviewed and mostly like to talk about themselves, how they love to tease and howthey believe the world revolves around them.

They relied heavily on Analog synths such as Moogs, Fender Rhodes, slapping basslines, and unusual mixing on the drums. They switch to digitial synth on this CD with very, very bad results. The Fender Rhodes was what provided much of the signature Azymuth sound. The use of a sampled Rhodes voice on a digital keyboard is not only jarring, but is also cheesy, dated, and removes all semblance of feel from the keyboard lines. The soul is still there, but masked by a horrible tone. The bass does much less slapping and is turned down considerably in the mix, hiding the classic Azymuth sound further. Perhaps they were trying to be poppish, save money on recording, or the Fender Rhodes was just too damn heavy to carry anywhere. Azymuth music deserves better than this, and the group should have known it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A103 Close Up +3","review":"Close-up lenses are no substitute for macro accessories such as a bellows unit and extension ring, but they do allow you to take close-up shots covering a subject field with the area of half a postcard, taken at a range of down to around 25cm, with a standard lens.

Most of the books with large pint have stories about seven year old children, or even younger, this discourages and bores the older child. Today, one of my nine year boys read this book with very lettle help, but most important he really liked it and laughed in all the right places.

The characters in this storyline hadn't even met yet! It wasn't until volume 2 that this meeting even occurs (and we won't even get into how jumbled that plotless \\"story\\" was!).So, congrats to Peter Davids effort at a new storyline, but a disapointing \\"4\\" to this unusually flawed and plot hole filled result.

Incarceration is the way in which modern socities (humanely) protect themselves from criminal threats in their midst. There are specific companies which RUN prisons at a profit but taxpayers must still foot the bill. Incarceration rates for black males reflect crime rates for the same. Black males commit violent crime at a rate 8 to 12 times that of their white pears.

Without any expectations we wanted to expose her to the language early and we couldn't be more thrilled.

It is far superior to the first live album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I don't think I have to say much. To me, this felt like a continuation of Howl Howl, Gaff Gaff.

Although I don't think the band really matured, it just seems more grown up. I personally think there is a difference. Anyway, to me it sounds more cohesive. ANd I think the female back up vocals were a great attribution to the cd. I love this cd. There really is nothing to say. I honestly think if you like the last album, you'd like this one.

I would have given it 5 stars but I didn't really like all the teaching James does in the beginning of the book. I found myself getting impatient and wanting him to just dive right in with some of Sailor Bob's teachings or hear more details about his visit. But once we get past James' summary of what he thinks non duality (Truth) is all about, the book really flows well. Some of the dialogues at the end of the book are truly great. And it's fun to hear all the details of Bob's trip and tour of America. Also, James shares lots of personal details about his life and search which takes a lot of guts and makes the book very rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very user friendly, delicious pictures.","review":"I did enjoy this book.The pictures are lovely to begin with and I love the visual aspects.

There spells are varied and organised sensibly.My issues with the book are few. However I think some of the ingredients are a bit fiddly to find, not totally bizarre but a bit too much for day to day rituals.This book is not especially useful for the advanced practitioner, but then again it never claims to be.A good addition to any bookshelf to assist in your own spell working path if you are new to the Wiccan Way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very colorful and helpful.","review":"I loved this book because it was accompanied by photos, and it also told you when it would be best to do the spells inside the book. It was also not a Wiccan spell book per se, so you do not have to listen to a morality speech in the beginning of the book, or at least, not so much of one as many.Don't get me wrong, I am a good witch, but it is our nature to and my religion that I choose my own morality and decide for myself what is going to affect my karma. So I really get annoyed when I get a morality speech.The spells were good, and some were cute, I really enjoy the book.

So far, the new unit works fine, but since it comes with a one year warranty, I'm definitely retaining my receipt until that year is up, based on problems others have had with the ER411 and other models of various brands after as little as a month of use.Interestingly, you can buy a replacement blade assembly for this directly from Panasonic (www.panasonic.com/personalcare) as part# WER416H1058, though at $9.47 plus shipping, it might make more sense to just replace the whole unit once the warranty is up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Why is it so hard to find a good nose trimmer?? about ten years ago I bought an excellent Panasonic brand trimmer-- a model they apparently no longer make- -but lost it a few years back.

I did not appreciate the author's use of \\"slang\\" terms to describe female anatomy.The dialogue was awkward. No one talks like this. But more importantly, I didn't buy the \\"connection\\" between the main characters. They had absolutely no chemistry.Take my advice, skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"WOW!!! I love this story.. What I love most about it is that I was completely surprised by who the villian was. I loved the chemistry with Mark and Maya. Mark is the complete package when it comes to the alpha male. Yet he is written in a way that is very refreshing, a bit surprising, and completely SEXY! All of the supporting characters in this story were well written and developed. This story has the hot erotic, (not cheesy) love scenes with Maya and Mark. The great plot/story line, and although it was a short story, the story is very involved so it doesn't feel as though it's too rushed.

This book is a total waste of time and money! The storyline could have some real potential if it were carefully worked out. The dialogue it choppy and doesn't have a maturity to it. The characters' individuality isn't developed before they're tossed into a romance which is soap-opera (and not the good ones) like. There are certain expectations that readers have when presented with a cop-murder mystery novel and this novel by no means even comes close! It's pretty painful just trying to read a page of this novel and it will probably be disgraded very shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"This drive was not even accessible by my computer.

However, I was very disappointed that block measurements were NOT given. Block patterns were supposed to be transferred to fabric, but did not include the measurements of each section. This was frustrating if you are a careful piecer and want to make sure each block is the correct size and don't like to trace. Instead, the piecer is forced to trace every section, which isn't practical for larger-sized quilts.The lack of block dimensions made this book frustrating for me.

We tried three different hikes from the book, but we would have probably been better off leaving it at home. The hike descriptions lack some essential information like the estimated time of travel and how long and how far each section of the hike takes. Not only that, because the book was published in 1993, much of the information was outdated. For example, directions to the hikes had been changed because of things such as street reconfigurations and natural trail deterioration. The only good thing that this book offered was the name and approximate location of the hike.

Maybe you just start thinking a little more about the spiritual aspect of life.

Based on the information in the book we were extremely worried about what we would encounter in the work and social environment in Japan. We did not encounter the majority of the situations mentioned in the book although we were working very closely with a traditional Japanese company.As a female going to work in Japan, I only found 1 paragraph in the whole book which was relevant to this situation (the book focused on businessmen and their non-working wives traveling with them).The book does provide an interesting background but it is unlikely that you will encounter even half of the culture shocks mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panic-inducing!","review":"On the eve of moving to Japan for a year, I read Culture Shock!

It portrays Japan as a minefield of devastating cultural faux pas that will leave us either completely ostracized from society or deported.But, upon arrival, it was quickly evident that the culture gap isn't nearly as big as the book claimed. Nor were the social consequences of making a slip-up.It's true this book was probably written for American business men trying to close some big deal, and I guess it does contain a quite a bit of valuable information about Japan, but trust me: that info can be found elsewhere, and in a book that won't give you second thoughts about going.Steer clear of Culture Shock! Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better!","review":"The only reason this book gets one star is because there are some useful lists in the back of the book about food, vocabulary, etc. But that information does not make it worth it to buy this book. The same information can be found in MANY books out there, preferably something without the negative slant this author seems to take towards Japan.Instead of simply showing the readers the differences between American and Japanese cultures, he insists on adding his own close-minded two cents. Though not overt, the author seems to look down on the Japanese people and culture, mostly because it is different from what he is used to. While there are many people out there who choose to believe a culture is wrong simply because it is different from what they are used to, I would prefer to read cultural books written by those that take a less judgmental approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironic -- an unproductive book on productivity","review":"The book is divided into 52 chapters that repeat basically the same points over and over again.

I highly recommend this book as a great introduction to Marsh's wonderful world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice cozy - so glad to re-discover Ngaio!","review":"I am a long-time fan of the traditional cozy made so popular by the stellar writing of such authors as Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. Ngaio Marsh belongs in the same league, as does her main sleuth Roderick Alleyn. My recent re-discovery of her writing is awakening some fond memories, as it provides a wonderful escape into a different world and a different time. \\"A Man Lay Dead\\" is the first of her Roderick Alleyn series, and I would recommend it (especially on a rainy afternoon), with the caveat that younger readers may want to wait until they are a little older as some aspects of adulthood (sex and drugs) are intermingled in many of Ms. Marsh's plots. For those who love a good cozy, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New twists and turns from a 75 year old whodunnit","review":"I've become a fan of Ngaio Marsh's CDI Roderick Alleyn yarns and getting hold of this book was my first attempt at obtaining a copy of her first book in this series.The results have been very satisfying: firstly for the ease of finding a good second hand copy at a very reasonable price (well done, Amazon!)and secondly for the enjoyment of the book itself.Having read many of her later stories it was a pleasure to see where it all started and how her skills developed as the years unfolded. I'd recommend this book to any Agatha Christie fan and especially to those already fans of Ngaio Marsh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marsh's first novel","review":"This novel is an excellent starting place to the wonderful world of Alleyn and Ngaio Marsh. The murder takes place in an Enlgish country house, and the entertaining world of the country house murder is very skillfully portrayed. This novel also introduces us to Nigel Bathgate, a guest at the party who reappears in many early Marsh mysteries. This novel has a very light, playful tone compared to some of her later mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Debut","review":"A preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author's apprentice work, obviously to Sayers and Christie. The situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of \`The Murder Game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis. The murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues. It is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements. The facetiousness is embarrassing: Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme. The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant \\"Russian element,\\" which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst. The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even goat fodder.","review":"This series doesn't quite make a \\"1\\" rating (it's so bad it's good). Still, I stand in awe of it, because it is just plain awful. Would-be writers and editors can have a field day. Groan, as you correct the spelling and grammar. Yawn, as you eliminate redundancies, thus cutting the verbiage by about two-thirds. Grimace, as you wonder how the author could have missed so many opportunities. Evince no surprise as your pet goat refuses to eat it. Sigh with relief as you tune the tube to the more literate adventures of Hercules and Xena. Otherwise, have a nice day"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Ship...New Crew...New Possibilities","review":"Where the first volume of this series laid a good foundation, this book starts to flesh out additional members of the crew of the USS Excalibur, and gives the reader a whole new host of species to learn about. Commander Shelby, of Borg-collective-expertise fame, finally makes her appearance as first officer -- and we get to meet a Hermat engineer who is of dual sex. It makes for some gender bending interest that is humorous as well as enlightening. The short serial nature of these slim volumes leaves you hanging and waiting for more. A far cry from the usual novels that have to wrap up all the conflicts and resolve all the problems before you run out of pages"},{"rating":"2","title":"The void has never had so much substance","review":"Into the Void: Coming in at only 150 pages we read as our newly joined crew settles into their Galaxy Class starship the USS EXCALIBUR.

Not making things any easier for the crew they find a stowaway who may bring death to them all.If you are a fan of Star Trek: TNG then you'll be right at home with this series.

This CD spends a lot of time in my auto player."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Last - deja vu all over again","review":"The Jury/Plant series is becoming increasingly repetitious. Melrose under cover, the boy living alone with a dog, a precocious girl, Jury agonizing over the war - I have read it all before. The minor characters from previous books are inserted, seemingly at random, here - for no apparent reason. The plot is thin; I knew the identity of the killer and the motive by page 80. I have read all of the books in this series, and probably will continue to do so. I hope that the author puts more thought into the details of future plots and less into repetitious situations. If this book disappoints, I suggest reading Elizabeth George's Lynley books; they are consistently well-written and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blues Last","review":"There are too many \\"out of character\\" characters and situations in this book. The most implausible in my mind is Miss Heron, a woman who had headed up an unwed mothers' home since 1939. This woman who has seen countless babies born and given to grateful adoptive parents, actually says: \\"It's emotionally devastating.\\" (giving a child up for adoption) \\"Frankly, I favor abortion.\\" UNREAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why the complaints?","review":"I am flabbergasted at the hostile reviews from readers! The bookbordered on eruidite. EXCUSE Ms. Grimes for interjecting some history, some scenery that did not include the inside of a pub.Heaven forbid she should be allowed to be extravagant in sub-plots. This is a writer who is getting better with each book, and in The Blue Last has shown her abilitiy once more to see the world through the eyes of the old, the young, the rich, the poor, the dying, the vivacious and yes, even the eyes of a dog.(Of course, if RJ does not promptly rebound in the next book, I am with you all 100%)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue but not the last!","review":"Melancholy, soul searching, and the universal question: How much of events that we \\"remember\\" actually occurred? 'The Blue Last' meanders these gloomy labyrinths to great effect. Yet, I confess, I hate it when Richard Jury gets depressed -- Ms. Grimes's depiction of it is so penetrating that I get a bit down myself. The mystery of the child-swapping is perhaps less intriguing than the mystery of how our minds and emotions and perceptions work together to create memory and to blind us to reality, but it all overlaps as Richard plumbs this internal mystery only to find it continues to blind him to what is immediately around him: Danger (just as Diane Demorney predicted!). I'm curious to see what effect this will have on Jury's character in the future. Will he stop muddling around with all the wrong women and find the right one? Or has she been right in front of him all this time? I can't wait to see what happens to Richard next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unanswered questions...","review":"I am a great fan of the Richard Jury series but this one was very disappointing. There were too many unanswered questions, characters thrown in that were never explained, main characters suddenly acting out of character and an ambiguous ending (which I won't go into in case you want to read this) that was annoying. One last complaint - if this book is taking place in the present day, then Richard Jury and the other children born during WWII would be in their 60's. Is Richard Jury - the heart throb detective - sopposed to be 65? Is the middle-aged woman who is the baby in question 62. How old is her mother? Eighty? If you are a Richard Jury fan you will probably want to read this book but be prepared to be disappointed. Too much atmosphere - not enough plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Dismal Grimes book","review":"Where does one begin? The last few Grimes books have lacked style, wit and cohesivieness. She does appear to have tired of the characters and of creating an absorbing plot. The plot for The Blue Last is very thin and the book is actually boring in some spots. Too many unanswered questions and once again we have the stock-in-trade children, only this time Gemma is a real mystery. I stopped \\"buying\\" the hard cover books a few books ago and after reading some of the reviews decided that I would check it out from the library. I'm glad I did because this book is not worth the price. What happened to Martha Grimes? I loved her books and enjoyed the characters even though Melrose and Jury annoyed me by conducting their love lives and romances without benefit of brain. Much like Julia Roberts. I am not saying I won't ever read another Richard Jury book, but I won't pay for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the Editor?","review":"Perhaps a writer as popular as Martha Grimes feels that she does not need an editor but this book proves her wrong. Aside from the typos, which calls for a proofreader, there are many inconsistencies and mistakes. She describes the exterior of a war time pub in London as being decorated with Christmas lights, hardly possible in a city that had gone through the Blitz. A few pages later her character remaks on the problem of traveling at night in London in utter darkness. I quess they turned off the Christmas lights. Jury's cousin is described as being in her 60's and then asks him if he has seen the baby! Whose baby? Certainly not her's. These are just sloppy errors. I leave a discussion of the plot itself to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"Richard Jury does it again, in his 17th adventure. It's a case of switched identities, as Jury goes back to a 50-year old mystery in which Kitty Riordan's child and Maisie Tynedale may have been switched during the last bomb raid on London during WWII. Who is behind the switch? Then Simon Croft, an author was writing a book on London in WWII, is murdered, and the whole mystery changes. Melrose Plant enters in when Jury recruits him to do some investigative research. The ending is suspenseful, thrilling, and even I, a fan of Martha Grimes, wasn't aware of what was coming. Highly engaging and fun to read. A must for all fans of Richard Jury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart animals/dumb detectives/confused readers","review":"There's something to be said for authors' holding off from annual additions to their series when they can't come up with clear plots. Grimes relies on super-brained animals to get her off the hook. And the notion of the hero swooning and bleeding in the last chapter is one that tired authors use too often. On the other hand, if it allows Jury to get it on with his neighbor/popsy in the next edition, maybe it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The only Grimes books I really like are the Richard Jury books, and even they are becoming unreadable. It almost seems like Grimes has written a fantasy book instead of a mystery. I am forever trying to get the dates to match up with the ages of the people in this book! There were also too many different story lines which didn't seem to have anything to do with each other. There could almost have been more than one book being written here. I did not like the ending, not because I don't want it to end the way it seems too, but because it is a useless ending. I suppose it has made sure that at least someone will read the next Jury book, just to see what happens. Overall, after being excited to see a new Jury book, I was highly disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible ending","review":"The ending is totally unacceptable--what a terrible and senseless way to drop one of the most interesting characters in detective fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The usual cast of a Richard Jury tale are here... and they are delightful. Plant is dragged to Italy to authenticate a painting Marshall Trueblood has purchased. Unfortunately, this never really connects back to the main plot in any satisfying way. The characters of the children, Gemma and Benny, are well done, as one expects from this author. But again, there is no satisfying conclusion. The ending comes abruptly, almost as though the author simply got tired of the story and wanted to bring it to an end. This was 4 stars, up until the last couple of chapters. I hope we have not seen the end of Long Pidd...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the last chapter?","review":"Where is the last chapter to this book? What has happened to Martha Grimes? She hasn't told us the end of the story. Who is Gemma? Where did she come from? What happened to Melrose Plant?Is Jury dead? At this point do I, or any other reader who has followed this series for a good number of years, care? If this author has decided to become cutesy...did I hear the name Elizabeth George echo???...she should have told us/me before I paid Amazon's price for this hardcover edition. Oh, no...not again....What is the old saying, \\"Once burned....,\\" or perhaps \\"I haven't bought the Brooklyn Bridge in the last 10 years either.\\" No more Martha...Is Martha living??? Perhaps the publishing company could not pay for the final chapter of the book?\\" Whatever, I, the reader, feel cheated. And the customer is always right, Martha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Last","review":"The book instead of being a mystery is very lyrical and rather putting you to sleep instead of making you want to finish it so you can see the end. The end doesn't mean much because you cannot get into the characters. It's a shame because most of her books are so very well written. I think she has written too much poetry lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martha Grimes is clearly bored with her characters","review":"I'm glad she killed Jury in the end, because she clearly shouldn't write anymore books with him.

This title: big miss! A Chinese smorgasbord of a book (if there could be such a thing): take one from column A, six from column B, skip column C...The premise was intriguing--wartime London and something of Jury's past explained, but the book was thoroughly disjointed, with unnecessary subplots and unbelievable characters. When I turned the final page (at long last!), my only reaction was, \\"What was that?\\" Disappointed? Yes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Last","review":"I have never personally read a Martha Grimes novel before reading The Blue Last. It was an interesting mystery filled with details. For some that may be excellent but for me I did not enjoy this novel as much as I had hoped to. I felt that the author cluttered the point up with unrelated issues. On the other hand the author did well with keeping you guessing up to the end. I also enjoyed how Martha in this story takes us back to the past and the bombing of WWII. That was a terrible time in history and is filled with memories that the main character Jury wishes to forget. It is a great theme in the novel that you can not escape the past and that it often holds glues to the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long with totally unbelievable ending.","review":"I must try to remember NOT to buy Martha Grimes - Richard Jury novels.The novels get longer and longer -- filled with unnecessary and boring characters -- especially Melrose Plant.You end up reading 442 pages until Ms. Grimes tries to wrap everything up in an totally unbeliveable ending that takes up three pages.A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about Gemma and Ben?","review":"What a disappointment this was! I was getting tired of Melrose Plant and his bunch, and Richard Jury is wearing a little thin, but I really liked Jemma and Ben. What wonderful characters. I wanted to hear more about them and see some satisfying conclusion.The ending was just plain terrible, but I recognize the style; it's called the \\"1000 word short story syndrome.\\" When students are assigned a paper with a certain number of pages or words, they often make a good start, but as soon as they have enough words or pages, they wrap it all up in about two sentences and hand it in. Shame on you Martha Grimes; if you don't want to write any more, change professions, but don't leave rich characters like Gemma and Ben in limbo."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, horrible, horrible","review":"I greatly enjoy the British style mystery and have read a whole lot. Martha Grimes has never been one of my favorites but I have enjoyed some and enjoyed them enough to stay with them, but I will never read another one of hers. I am so bored with the whole gang of friends and neighbors (who are they and why are they in the book at all???). There are no answers to any of the mysteries posed and the ending was just stupid. Also the children in the book were terribly done. I don't think Ms. Grimes has ever been around children as she has no clue how children talk or think. I am so mad at myself for wasting time and money on this book. Someone else suggested Elizabeth George as a better alternative and I couldn't agree more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Last","review":"What a disappointment. I've enjoyed all the previous books about Jury; some more than others. I'd always found them to be good entertainment though. This one was probably the worst. The sideplot was just a distraction and did not add to or tie in with the main plot at all. But, ultimately the worst part of the book was the ending. Is Jury dead? What happened to the rest of the characters. There are so many loose ends it makes me mad. Throughout the book the characters are asked \\"can you live without knowing\\". As Richard Jury answered \\"no\\". But, we have no choice in the matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I have read all of Martha Grimes books, and will not be buying the next one. The plot wanders, the characters are one dimensional, the humour is missing, and I felt extremely angry at the ending because I felt cheated. I felt it was unfinished and was going to complain to the publisher. Perhaps this is a device of Martha Grimes to entice me to continue to buy her books. It is sad that she has to stoop to this, and her trick has had the opposite effect.Don't buy it, or the next one. Buy P.D.James, Ruth Rendell , Anne Perry and Stephanie Barron instead for satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"My judgement on Jury is a 10","review":"This was an absorbing novel full of intresting characters. The story moves along at a swift pace. I like how all the pieces dangle before you but you're not sure where to place them for a while.

I am only sure of the ending because I know that there is another Richard Jury book soon to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"I was truly looking forward to another Richard Jury story, apparently Ms. Grimes was not. This book seems to be missing the other half. For one thing there were too many story lines that went nowhere, whereas there were several story lines that seemed rather imcomplete. Both the editor and the author should be ashamed about the number of discrepancies and inconsistancies. Moreover, the book just merely ended leaving me to ask \\"what was she thinking?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The series quality is seriously deteriorating","review":"I've been reading (and until recently enjoying) Martha Grimes' Richard Jury series since shortly after \\"The Man with a Load of Mischief\\" came out. But the imagined scenes with philosophers debating and generally plodding writing--not to mention the innumerable typos--finally led me to skip the middle hundred or so pages of the book (I had gotten far enough in that I still wanted to know \\"whodunnit\\"). And you know what? The book didn't suffer at all from the omission. I was quickly able to figure out what I'd missed and saved myself a couple hours of agony. After this I'm not sure I will continue with the series. (And really, she MUST stop with the internal monologues of dogs!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a cliffhanger","review":"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers as Ms. Grimes left more than her usual quota of loose ends in this book. I have read six or seven in the \\"Jury\\" series and with each book I am left with the feeling that the denouement falls... well, rather flat. I can't even call it a \\"cliffhanger\\". More like a \\"Whaaaaat?\\" While I enjoy her characters, especially the Long Piddleton contingent, Jury's introspection is beginning to irritate me. And in this book, he must be 65 if a day - and Ms. Grimes is still holding him out as a \\"heart throb\\". Please, leave him in 1981 when the series started a la Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Last","review":"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I'm thinking that Ms. Grimes has become maniacally bored with her stock characters, as this one reads as though written under the influence of a controlled substance.Her descriptive writing can be incredibly, evocatively beautiful, and I will be looking for her poetry.As for mysteries, given a new set of characters, NOT to include too-too precious and supernaturally brilliant children, and adults who are constantly lighting up while imbibing fine wines, I would keep her on my favorite author list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I'm surprised at some of the other reviewers' opinions.

Her humor is, as always, brilliant! British humor sparkles once again! The ending might not be popular, but then again, sometimes life's like that too. Her twists and turns are classic mystery. For those who felt they were left dangling, you must read \\"The Grave Maurice\\". The story goes on.... I personally, have never been disappointed with her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"My third and probably last Richard Jury book. I have to say I like the characters and feel comfortable with them but as usual the plot starts out so interesting and ends so disappointingly.

Once finished, I immediately bought \\"The Blue Last.\\" It's still a fairly comfortable escape -- and topical too, dealing as it does with the London blitz -- but the motivations for Richard Jury's latest investigation, along with the Melrose Plant subplot, are such non-starters that one impatiently begins to wonder whether the principals simply have too much idle time on their hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a waste, I agree","review":"I wish I'd read the reviews before I waited so long for the library to have it available.

The reasoning is that the DVD is a video of a seminar that was held in a hotel conference room.

So you can't even log in on a mobile device, it just keeps asking you for the password over and over again. Even more frustrating was that I didn't even care about security! I have my own firewalls that protect from outside intruders. But the cyber power device doesn't let you disable that either. Shocking considering the high price tag...$230+. A mobile device is only a natural fit for this device and the fact it doesn't work is an epic fail in my opinion.

It seems to be the way to go, as Pascal Feos and Thomas Schumacher have also continuously mixed their artist album's this year.With Guido's quality repertoire of minimal tracks, it makes for one great mix, and while it may not be as exciting as the two other artist album's I just mentioned, it's a solid release for 2006 and any minimal fan can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great belt","review":"This belt is so much better than the standard issue because of the strap that goes on it to reduce the extra.

Very portable and not bulky. Great remote included. Great picture.Cons: Speakers are not loud enough so we had to make sure and buy external speakers and an amp to get the sound better for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average all-in-one projector","review":"I have had the projector for 6 months now.Pros:- All-in-one, Video, sound, DVD player.- Comes with bag to carry around- Perfect for small screens in DARK environment.Cons:- DVD that you burnt yourself for backup (with recompression) don't play well. Even movies with low re-compression have problems, which shows by broken portions of some frames.- The worst through is the sound problem with self-burnt DVDs. Sometimes, even on low recompression DVDs, the sound is 1 to 2 seconds early. Which makes it a nightmare to watch those movies.- Image quality is average. If you place the projector more than 10ft away from the screen, then the image is not as bright.- The projector generates quite some noise, which the sound of the movie may generally cover, but not always.- VGA input didn't work with my Powerbook G4, even though the powerbook actually recognized the projector as well as its native definition.In general, i'm on the average for this projector. 2.5/5 would be my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should last just long enough for the warranty to expire","review":"This projector worked well enough connected to a home theater system, but not good enough on it's own. Speaker sounds awful, and the DVD player is so-so. However, after owning one for just over 2 years, I made the mistake of unplugging it to dust the table it was placed on, and when I plugged it back in, the Lamp and Temp LED's began to flash and the unit won't power on. There were no symptoms leading up to this, we used it not 12 hours earlier with no indications of any issues. I called Optoma tech support, and they didn't even want to hear the problem, they wanted me to ship it to them for repair. I checked online sources, and the symptoms seem to indicate the Temperature Control Sensor has failed, and of course, you can't find the part anywhere to replace it yourself. Imagine that, a two-year-old electronic device that fails when you plug it back in. Absolutely disposable, I will never buy another Optoma product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete package","review":"I'm really impressed by this little projector ... which unlike most models in the market, has dvd player and speakers built in it. Optoma also included a nice 92\\" screen and a subwoofer after mail in rebate. The picture is good - warm DLP versus harsh LCD. The projector is quite versatile as it works for both NTSC and PAL as well as 220V and 110V - so works well if you take it outside US. That said, its tech specs are quite old now, with only 480p versus 1080p as the new standard. However, I'm really happy that the projector served its time well - allowing me to enjoy the big screen as the 1080p projectors dropped enough in prices for me to upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Reliable Product","review":"I bought this projector about three years ago and I got it shipped to me while in Iraq, we watched movies on it constantly and took it with me to a couple of places. I now have it currently with me in Afghanistan and the projector still works like it first did straight out of the box. Obviously some scratches here and there, and i haven't had to replace the lamp once yet. Being my first projector i think it was a great buy and i couldn't ask for anything better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable Machine!","review":"This is a great machine...there is just one problem. It is disposable!!!! We bought one and before long the discs would not load right away. Then some of the discs would not load at all. Then it would shut down after an hour and so forth until we sent it back and got another. The same thing happened to the second...and the third!!!! Don't waste your time with this one. The Epson Movie Mate 72 is superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UNRELIABLE don't buy, you will regret it","review":"The unit is very finicky. It plays OK the DVDs, but has hard time detecting the connection to the computer.It breaks down, I had to send for replacement 2 times. Now it is out of warranty and it broke down again. The want me to pay $110 just to look at it. They charge $100/hour for their labor and parts are not cheap (e.g. lamp cost over $300).My recommendation: Stay away from Optoma.I think a big screen TV / monitor, is much better. You don't need screen, you can watch it with ambient light, much more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE PROJECTOR - RIPPED ON PRICE","review":"The picture this projector makes is very good, it does suffer slightly from the rainbow effect common with single chip DLP projectors. I wish the sound would play a little louder.When I bought this projector it was priced at $1499.00, two weeks after I got it the price dropped to $1299.00. I thought well ok I guess I can live with that - prices do drop on electronic equipment all the time. Now the price is $999.00, come on OPTOMA, you really stuck it to early adopters.I'd recommend this projector to anyone once the price drops to $699.00, should be in the next several weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noxious odor ruins the viewing experience","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. Optoma should recall this projector and correct the the melting plastic smell problem. It'a especially worrisome because unlike other home theater projectors, the DV10 is designed to sit right in front of you, and it's impossible to avoid the fumes. If not for this serious flaw I would have rated it 5 stars.\\"Now if they would only get it RIGHT! The cooling fans throw hot air out both sides, and this air is POISONOUS. After a few minutes the whole room smells like melting plastic - really BAD. Come on folks, this can't be that hard to fix. I had one for a week and returned it because it was impossible to breathe. What a heartbreak - such a fine projector with such a dumb flaw. I wrote to Optoma (optoma.com) about it, but if you and others write as well, maybe they'll listen and fix an otherwise excellent projector.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is a joke...","review":"I bought this projector about a week ago. Two days into using it, the \\"lamp indicator light\\" comes on and the projector shuts off. It'll come back on a few minutes later...only to die again. I contacted Optoma about this situation and was informed that I need to ship the entire unit back to them at MY COST in order to receive a replacement lamp. That means I have to wait for it to get there, wait for them to replace the lamp, wait for it to arrive back. After spending $1500 on this thing I think I should receive a bit better service.Don't think you'll be spared the same treatment, either. Even if you receive one without a faulty lamp...the life of the bulb is only about 70 hours or something. When yours goes out, you'll have to ship it back in for replacement too. I definitely regret my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was looking forward to purchasing and owning the product, but after I completed the transaction I was told it was not available.

I was very disappointed indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're use to HD or looking for HD try something else","review":"-I bought the DV10 recently as a supplement to my current setup - Phillips 42 HDTV and the OPPO upconverting DVD player, The DV10 did not perform as well as I had anticipated and I quickly noticed the difference in image quality. Both the DVD and HDTV display performance for the DV10 paled in comparison to the Phillips and OPPO setup.-See the DV10 outputs at 480p whereas my Phillips is 720p/1080i ---huge difference! The HD content was a huge reduction in image quality to what I'm used to and the DVD video output was pathetic compared to the superior OPPO DVD player.-I guess it's ok as a niche product. However, if you're used to true HDTV and have experienced the visional joys of an upconverting DVD player, then I strongly recommend not buying this product. Luckily, I was able to return the product for a full refund. Also, be weary of the lamp replacement cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Rush","review":"Rocky running up the steps of city hall, the \\" picket fence \\" double back side screen in Hoosiers, the team building series of downs in Remember the Titans; in my mind, none of these memorable scenes of perseverence in sports can match the drafting scene in Breaking Away. The fusion of the semi-driver flashing mph finger signals to our hero as he pushes himself to the limit with heart pumping classical music in the background is the best visual definition of \\"personal best \\" ever seen in the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking Away","review":"Great movie and story, and one a young bike racer could really relate to. Back when this movie was being shown in small movie houses if often came to one in my area. Myself and a bunch of other bike racers never missed a showing...it turned into a cult movie for us and we probably went and saw it 10-15 times.. It was always fun to watch the reaction of the non-cycling movie goers to the scene when Dave was shaving his legs. Cracked us up! Cycling scenes were well done, and the one when he was drafting that big truck was great. The music score was really good and fit the movies plot. It was also cool for those of us who owned an Italian MASI racing bicycle like Dave rode! No matter if you are a bicycle racing fan or not do not miss this movie. My comments are based on the VHS issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking Away","review":"This is one I remember watching as a kid and never leaving the television untill it was over.

This movie seems to have been forgotten since its release, which is sad because it has so many great performances in it. Dennis Quaid is fantastic as the kid whose dreams are out of reach.

Still, the film quality is good. This film captures the cycling climate of the day and features many great training and racing scenes -love the tractor trailer drafting scene! This is more than a cycling movie though. The struggle of coming of age, finding your identity, family dynamics -love and support; father and son, competition, love story, and campy comedy -it's all there. This is a film you will love, and feel comfortable sharing with your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back home in Indiana","review":"Having attended IU my Freshman year ('69/'70), I can attest that Breaking Away was certaingly not filmed on a Hollywood sound stage, but entirely in Bloomington, Indiana as the film's end credits proclaim. It is a delightful movie the whole family can enjoy. It is a relatively short movie with many funny moments (Paul Dooley is fantastic) and for me, reminiscent of my days at IU (the warm waters of the abandoned stone quarries, the beautiful IU library and the Little 500 race to name a few).Wonderful characters make the story extremely enjoyable. It's one of my favorite movies. ...LAP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking Away - great fun for everyone","review":"An excellent film with really funny scenes of growing up in the 70's. For a Brit of 31 years I grew up on films like this so this is my view of the U.S., probably a little rose tinted, but I don't care.If you liked American Grafitti, E.T., Stand By Me, The Goonies, Etc you'll love this, and if you like cycling you'll really love it as it has some great stuff, a nice Masi bike and the 70's Cinzano team riding. Plus drafting behind the team lorry!Even my wife loved it and her eyes usually glaze over within 5 minutes of cycling films."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is why god invented humans...","review":"Simply put...

Aw hell, Canada too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic movie and a great story","review":"This one is well worth owning -- the cycling is absorbing, and while not always realistic, it comes closer than films like American Flyer. I'm a grad student at IU Bloomington, and before I came here this movie was my intro to Bloomington. The Little 500 still is a great spectacle, and this movie captures it well, along with the town-gown tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking Away - in the peloton of cycling movies","review":"When four \\"cutters\\" run afoul of college boys over a girl, they soon find themselves careening toward the ultimate face off--a prestigious cycling competition called the Little 500 on the campus of Indiana University. Though they've made a pact to waste the rest of their lives together, their struggle to prove themselves to a few frat boys soon has them breaking away toward a different kind of victory--growing up.

I then rushed out to buy her CD and it doesn't disappoint. The standouts are 'Perfect', 'Sarah', and 'All I Want'. There's some lugubrious material here but overall it's a very satisfying disc. She sounds like a less-edgy version of Alanis Morrissette."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wait Is Over","review":"Finally! After 3 or 4 years, Maren has an album out. I was a fan of hers when I heard her sing at Lilith Fair. U know there's something special when the supposed \\"new acts\\" tent garnered more audience then some of the \\"headliners\\". And the album doesn't disappoint. Standouts in this album includes \\"Sarah\\", \\"Perfect\\" and \\"All I Want\\". It's a shame \\"Eternity\\" is not listed on this album.

I have listened to the CD over and over and I'm still not sick of it. I always tire of listening to the same music quickly, so this CD has been a great surprise. There is a nice variety so you won't get bogged down in syrupy gunk. Maren has a nice light style that contrasts with her powerful voice (it's amazing). I could go on, but I really think you should be buying the CD instead of reading about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Hearted at Best","review":"Maybe it's just me, but this book seems put together in a hasty and half-hearted attempt. Maybe the author had little time or something, I don't know. It just seems tossed together with little to really say in any real depth.The topics are far too brief and don't contain much real information (plus there are a lot of contradictions throughout the book). The biographies are very limited and it seems like the author only included a handful of people (friends only?).There are other and better Encyclopedias out there. Try Rosemary Guiley or Raven Grimassi if you want your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY RATING 4 STARS","review":"The Witch Book by Raymond Buckland is truly awesome.

A MUST have encyclopedia to add to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't really recommend","review":"I generally like Buckland's work but I don't really care for this one and was actually pretty disappointed.

There is an index at the end for those seeking certain entries or topics of interest. Also most useful is the list of resources for further research. I'm not a practitioner but have always had an interest in the occult and supernatural, and found the entries well-defined. This is not really a primer for those hoping to gain insights into how to go about practising witchcraft but more of an informative text on the different aspects found in witchcraft, wicca and neo-paganism. It provides historical background, covers the major players in the occult world and provides lots of insight into this world. I found it an interesting and enlightening read and would recommend it to all those who are interested in the subject, as well as for research purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new classic","review":"Authoritative, expansive, insightful and entertaining, Raymond Buckland has done it again. I expect that this volume will sit alongside \\"Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft\\" as an essential tome for those with serious interest in the subject.

Be prepared to get some washers and fiddle - it will eventually work. Mine's teamed up with the companion external battery pack and makes a neat installation...with some effort. BTW, the external battery pack is a true rack mount and takes about two seconds to install. So only 4 stars due to (lack of) ease of installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a useful anthology of writings on God. In 225 pages you get 23 contributors, so all the selections are of a reasonable length. The best part of the book is the nature of the contributors.

I think it helps anybody who is interested in quantitative modeling fixed income securities and who is interested in trading such securities.It first gives the basic background, the relative pricing of fixed income securities and fixed cash flows. It then explains the price sensitivity and hedging. The author has given a good explanation for term structure models.

Now if we can only get someone at Mercury to release the Kendall's 80's material on CD. \\"Movin' Train\\" , \\"Four Wheelin'\\", \\"Two-Heart Harmony\\"... these songs are too good to be forgotten.Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"strong remake of a Patrick Swayze hit......","review":"When most people hear the name \\"Patrick Swayze,\\" they think DIRTY DANCING, right? Well, during Swayze's era as a 1980s heartthrob, he also penned a beautiful song, \\"She's Like the Wind,\\" that had considerable airplay on the radio and became a hit [his only hit]. The melody is gorgeous, the lyrics are stirring and when Patrick Swayze recorded it himself, it sounded quite sensual and seductive. How does this rehash, for 2007, compare to the first recording? I would say it sounds pretty good. Though, I don't really like Lumidee or her rapping, it actually sounds pretty good, here, and is well-complimented by Tony Sunshine's smooth vocals. Sunshine is better known for his collaborations with the Terror Squad. Personally, I think the guy could sing the phone book and I would love him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but very delicate","review":"The carafe set is simply exquisite however beware of the edge of the drinking cup because any little tap will crack the edge (which is what happened to me only after the second day of receiving my product.)In the meantime, I'm trying to find out how to get a replacement cup to have my set complete again. I also wish the carafe was slightly larger as I do drink a lot of water. On the plus side, I highly recommend this set to anyone who wants to pamper themselves because thats how I honestly feel like when I pick-up the carafe to pour water into the glass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful love story","review":"I completely disagree with the review below expressing disappointment with this film. I loved it. The female lead undergoes a complete transformation from a shallow, money-hungry manipulator to a loving and caring person. She starts out being uninterested in the advances of the male lead, but after realizing her life is empty, she seeks him out. Meanwhile, he has been badly injured and forced to retire to a life of dependency. She goes to extraordinary lengths to find him, and proves her love by caring for him in his time of need. They end up having a beautiful relationship. I liked the film so much that I watched it twice, which I rarely do. She really gives a tremendous performance, and he's very good as well. If you want to watch a heart-warming love story and are willing to let the plot evolve, you shouldn't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Plot and Characters You Have Seen Before","review":"This is a very disappointing book. The plot was formulaic and the characters were under developed and unbelievable. Some of the decisions made by police officers, fbi agents, and museum directors would not have been made by a three year old. It's hard to take the plot seriously when it's driven by gross negligence and ignorance. It's just a disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relic (Pendergast, Book 1)","review":"Love the Agent Pendergast novels. The order was received quickly and the price was amazing.

It was ridiculous, slow and lacked any common sense. After a single murder, the museum should have been shut down."},{"rating":"2","title":"true masterpiece","review":"This is the first novel by authors Preston & Child. Also the first novel to feature the enigmatic Special Agent Pendergast. I rate this novel extremely highly, quite possibly the best story I have ever read. The story centres around mysterious disappearances (murders) at NY Museum of History. NYPD investigates, however the case also catches the eye of the gifted Agent Pendergast who commences his own unofficial investigation.This novel quite literaly is a page turner. I simply could not put it down until I finished it. Certain parts of the story will leave you terrified especially the scene where assistant curator Margo is stalked in the museum after hours and various chases through the sprawling museum tunnels.I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good thriller with paranormal themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taut, gripping horror suspenser","review":"Horror from the depths of the Amazon jungle turns up in the cellars of the American Museum of Natural History - perhaps linked to certain artifacts being prepared for a big exhibit opening"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Entertaining - Highly Recommended","review":"The authors have written a great book - keeps you on theedge of your seat from the first chapter to the last page.It won't disappoint those looking for a thriller.

A great book thatkeeps you on the edge of your seat. You're just dying to find out what is is, where is came from and what it wants. Strong character development that makes youroot for the heroes, boo at the bad guys and feel sorry for the victims, and in the end, for the creature itself. The ending leaves you wanting more and hopefullythe authors will oblige us by writing a sequel. In the meantime, I highly recommend reading their other book Mount Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money on this one","review":"I had read some of the reviews about this book and wish I had paid more attention to the one star reviews. This is one of those books that one can continue to read to see how much more predictable a book can become. It's not that the book is badly written; it's that the characters are flat, the plot ridiculous; and the ending becomes evident by the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS NOVEL'S A KEEPER...","review":"This is an excellent read. My four-star rating is due to a slight confusion with so many characters in similar jobs at the museum (at least to me) and a bit of a heavy hand with the technical stuff. It also could have used a tad more romance.I was drawn the main characters - particularly Pendergast, Margo, Brock and Smithback. Though I relished the movie's version of D'Agusta. Penelope Ann Miller was perfect as Margo. Stronger in the movie, I felt. Having seen the movie many times and loved it, IMHO, comparing the book and movie enhanced the read - though there is a vast difference in the roles the characters play, and of course, the ending.I'll wait a few months and then read this book again. It's a keeper. And I will certainly search out more novels by Preston and Child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and Wonderful Vendor!","review":"For some reason, I am not being allowed to leave feedback on the seller, but I want to say that my experience with Tori's Treasure was absolutely satisfactory.

Boy was I wrong about the book.I simply could not put the book down. This is one of those books that makes you want to sleep with the light on :-) Almost from the beginning you are on the edge of your seat. You are first introduced to Pendergast in this novel and you will quickly come to love him.I loved the atmosphere of the museum and the mystery that seemed to lurk around every corner. You really felt like you were right there watching it all unfold!This is an excellent read and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is absolutely amazing!!!","review":"I've read the book and found it really enjoyable.

Mysterious murders start to take place at the NY Museum of Natural History. And it looks like no human is involved, but something that has no explanation.

A classic gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't let the movie sway you","review":"how they could make the movie and leave out Pendergast is beyond me...This is a great book. Fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful, it has elements of sci-fi, mystery as well as adventure... and best of all, it introduces a truly great character, Agent Pendergast. He's here in more or less seminal form, merely the promise of the Agent Pendergast we see in Cabinet of Curiosities, but still very good.Great book, mediocre movie. Read the book, skip the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"PREPARE TO BE SCARED!!!!!!!!","review":"This is not the kind of book you want to read if you scare easily.

Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book With NO Flaws","review":"The Relic was a wonderful book full of surprises. In no way did I ever feel confused or wishing I knew what was happening in the story. A mix of Congo and Jurrasic Park, a Chrighton Fan's dream. A great story full of archeology, science, technology, and pure imagination and fun leave the reader spell bound and frightened Mubwn ( the monster from this tale ) will jump from the shadows. A great read. I HIGHLY reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A number one in Horror and action","review":"The Relic is one of the most suspensful books evr. A heart pounding ride through terror in a museum stalked by a terrible creature. You won't be able to put this book down. Read it and love it. I don't recomend the sequal for everyone but you should definetly pick up Mount Dragon. It may not surpass The Relic, but its a blockbuster ride none the less"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Climax!","review":"This was a pretty good book, but could've been better. Not much better, though. The plot is a creature is looose in a museum and is killing people. The last 80 pages (the climax) are amazing. These pages are so action-packed and suspenseful, its worthy of Jurassic Park. But the rest of the book is a little on the slow side. But I would recommend it to anyone who liked Jurassic Park and/or similar books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Relic is an awesome book. The characters are well created, the enviroment is neat, and the monster is SO cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beastology","review":"The most I think about the story I am to review, the most I am out of words to express its brilliance. First, I have to say that this is one of the most captivating and absorbing stories I have ever read. Each page makes you submerge into the story with such a passion that it makes this book the more fluid and entertaining to read. Gifted with an amazing start, as well as a solid plot the book leads the path to an unpredictable ending which certainly took me by surprise. Despite almost the entire story is narrated from inside a museum the experience is far from boring (it'd be the same that saying that Stephen King's \\"Misery\\" was a piece of trash because it all happened inside a house). If you're into this kind of story, or you liked Jaws and Jurassic Park, then you have a valuable reason to buy and read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite different than the movie","review":"OK, this here's the beginning of the Pendergast series, and was the basis of a movie by the same name in the 90s. I wanted to check out this series but had seen the movie a couple of times, and was tempted to start with the sequel. I'm glad I started here. The books is much different than the film. Pendergast doesn't appear in the movie. A very enjoyable read, and the sequel, Reliquary is even louder, more exciting and more threatening than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, Well Written, 1000 Times Better Than the Movie","review":"My friend Steve will read anything. On vacation, he picks up and reads cereal boxes over breakfast. So when he recommended this book, I was skeptical. It sat on my shelf for months and then one day I grabbed it and started reading in the, er, library... Wow! This is a great read. From the exciting opening right through to the wild finish in NYC, I was hooked. Toward the end, I actually wanted to read slower so the fun wouldn't end. I anxiously waited for the movie but when I saw it, I was really disappointed by the junk they sold as this wonderful, excapist book. If you like being scared, if you like good writing, if you love page turners, grab a copy and a comfortable chair. You will be there for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced","review":"I liked the fast pace of this novel. This is a lot of fascinating information presented about the history of the New York Museum of Natural History. A strange crate brought to the museum seems to have unleashed a mysterious monster.Some of the story is predictable as there are a lot of people that take a long time to convince that there is something wrong. Also, the first confrontation with the creature and the military turns out to be a total disaster for the soldiers.Some parts make your heart skip a beat. Not for the weak-stomached reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great thriller!!!!","review":"I'm 13 and this is the first book I have read in years that actually keeps me interested. Far better than any other horror I've ever read.

Im 13 and I loved every moment of it. Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child work you up for the best in the end, and it is GREAT. This is a MUST read. I don't know what those people who are giving it a 3 and 1 star(s) are talking about it was the best book ive ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Sure it's kind of gross in parts, but I could overlook that because everything else was what I enjoy in a book! Superb writing, easy to read, kept me in suspense from the first chapter. The setting in the museum was perfect! I thought the monster was very scary. The movie totally stunk compared to the book, but I must say I liked the way the monster looked in the movie. It was better than what I imagined from the book! If you loved \\"Jurassic Park\\" as much as I did, you would probably love this one, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Great Book with a lot of action","review":"I'm only 13 and this is already one of my favorite books.

It was very exciting and it did remind me of \\"Jurassic Park\\". I guess I enjoyed it enough to buy four more of their books(buy 4 for the price of 3). I liked the characters and the way it was written,, switching from one location to another. The ending was well done. How do two authors write a book? However they do it,, I like their style."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"The Relic is a classic novel for thrill seekers that want a \\"can't put down\\" experience. The story is fantastic in every way and includes a great twist ending. This story also marks the debut of a host of characters which appear in other Preston/Child novels.If you've never read Preston/Child before this is as good a place to start as any. Curl up on the couch and get ready because you won't be doing much else until you finish the last page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you saw the movie, read the book anyway","review":"We all know \\"Relic\\" was a less-than great movie. Actually, I hated it. I read \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" by Perston-Child out of sequence, and so enjoyed the adventures of Special Agent Pendergast, I wanted to read more. My search lead me back to \\"Relic,\\" and despite my skepticism, I bought the book. I was not disappointed, and knowing the plot from the movie did not spoil the book at all. As usual, the best parts of the book are lost before it hits the big screen. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"forced myself to finish","review":"this book started off ok and seemed interesting, half way in it slowed and three quarters it died.

It was too far out and impossible to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most thrilling, captivating, and daunting book!!!!","review":"This was one of the only books that I couldn't put down! The Relic was able to twist details into mystifying riddles. I thought I had the whole book figured out at the very beginning, but then I turned the page and there was a new riddle to be answered. Needless to say I never would have figured out the ending! This was one of my favorite books and I would definately recommend it to anyone who needs a good scare. It was better than any movie could ever be!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Very Chrichton-esque! I enjoyed the scientific tilt to this murder mystery. The author does a good job of developing characters and isn't afraid to kill his characters off either. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Fun","review":"This book is scary fun. It really makes me want to see the movie. I especially enjoyed reading the first appearance of Agent Pendergast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, but somewhat entertaining","review":"This book has a curious jeckle-hyde complex. The first half is great, being both thoughtful and creative. The second half turns the story into a run of the mill butcher-fest. Unfortunate. The authors did a great job setting the mood, then let all the suspense slip away in a highly predictable blood bath. Not hard to read and fun in parts. It could have been a meaningful work, but saddly ends up being the same old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a movie...a bad one","review":"Relic is a simple, mindless story that probably appeals to those who like those books that are written after a successful movie. The dialogue is unsophisticated and the plot distasteful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just not my genre...","review":"I read this all the way through even though the ending was pretty apparent at the half way point. I read it at the recommendation of a good friend, but it doesn't make me want to read any more of their books. Maybe it's just the genre. I enjoy Jeffrey Deaver and John Sandford, e.g., but this one left me scratching my head. It was simply too unbelievable to even generate any fear. Perhaps if you really enjoyed Jurassic Park you might get into this. Character development was also seriously lacking - we never got to know any of the protagonists very well, other than some obvious traits like the power hunger in some of the administrators and the dictatorial, overbearing agent the FBI brought in to take charge. All cliche and not worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relic got me hooked on Preston & Child","review":"I've read all of their books with the exception of The Ice Limit, and Relic is thus far their best. The authors' settings always seem to be in the bowels of some location, and, in the case of Relic, in the sub-basement of a natural history museum with its dark corridors and cramped spaces. It's a read that in many instances frightened, chilled, and thrilled me. As monstrous as the creature was, I could not help but feel a degree of empathy for it, particularly toward the end of the book. Forget the movie; it did absolutely no justice to this very well-written and carefully crafted story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was a great horror/suspense book.

It was a mixture of a mystery and a thriller, which makes for a very interesting, fun, cool book"},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, get it, read it, enjoy it","review":"Great read. (or listen as was the case.) Wanted more so I got Reliquary which follows on the heels of Relic, and the story was complete. Yes, it can stand alone but you'll want to read Reliquary as much of the unfinished business in Relic is concluded in the next book.Not a Science Fiction per se but definitely some imagination will be needed to fully engage in the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Superb! This had just the right mix of chills and the setting - the Musuem of Natural History - couldn't have been spookier or more fitting.

You will not be able to put this one down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"The Relic is amazing! The book is very well written. I would recommend it to anybody. My copy is already almost worn out! The story of a creature created through eating leaves from a South American rainforest, the creature then arrives in NYC, following a shipment of the last of the leaves in existence, to one of the scariest places around anyway: the Natural History Museum. The leaves contain a hormone that is only found two places: the leaves, and the human hypothalamus. When the creature can't get the leaves--well you can imagine what happens next. Scary, gory, extremely creative, an experiment in what would happen if a creature evolved that could kill off the human race, this novel keeps you guessing until the very end--and even farther. I can't wait for the sequel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent, couldn't put the book down!!","review":"Was very intense and inteligently writen.

The development of characters is superb, and the plot made it impossiblefor me to put down. A must for anyone that even remotely likedJurrasic Park. I can't say enough about Preston and Child, other thenI am counting the days until the sequal, Reliquary, is to be released.If you can't bring yourself to read the book, I would recommend at least seeingthe movie. If it is as half as good as the book, no movie goer will bedisappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Relic the cliche drools all over itself","review":"This book has no redeeming value. The characters do not even rise to the level of stereotypes; they are poor copies of stereotypes. The science comes straight out of Merlin's medieval alchemy class.

I now realize I should have done so much sooner. In Relic, Preston and Child craft a intriguing science horror novel set in the mysterious New York Museum of Natural History. The building itself plays such a huge role in the book I now want to visit. The theme of the book is right inline with some of Michael Crichton's work and is on par with that. The villains in the book, both human and not, are great and the unexpected epilogue was fantastic. My one pet peeve was too many of the characters were very one note throughout. Overall, a really good book that will lead me to check out more by these accomplished authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Thriller","review":"This is one of the best novels I have ever read. It combines non-stop, believable action with superb writing, meticulous research, and witty dialogue. The twists and turns never stop; I kept thinking I had the mystery solved only to be even more shocked by the next revelation.The theme/subject compares in style to Michael Crichton novels, but I found this book more satisfying than his because the characters were really well drawn and engaging (and often hilarious). I cared about what happened to the characters, which I have a hard time doing with those of Chrichton.You don't have to be a fan of fantasy, sci-fi, or gore to love this book. It's so enjoyable it transcends all genres of commercial novel.One last note: don't read Reliquary (the other book) without reading this first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut title for author duo...

Super-duper super-sophisticated FBI agent carrying a gun (a full metal jacket .45 five-shot REVOLVER?) that is unloaded - he waits until he is on a public walkway to load it (.45's are automatics); another goofy cop spinning his gun around on the table (sounds like a friend of the doopy cops in Ed Wood's \\"Plan 9\\" who used their guns to scratch their heads.All the cops, except of course for super-duper, sound like Ed Norton or something.Hey, if these guys don't even know what street the Museum of Natural History is on, how much can they really know about it? It's between 77th street and 81st streets. It's not on 72nd street.About that bit in the flooded tunnel - why didn't someone just boost someone else up to the ladder?It was a silly story.

Unfortunently, I was wrong. The book is filled with boring characters, overused cliches, and ridiculuos dialouge. The plot is far fetched and unrealistic.

It might give you a thrill if you're unfamiliar with manipulative cliches. The pacing is relentless, of course; it's a good device to keep readers from noticing the poorly-thought-out plot. The characters seem to come from a standard list for horror/disaster flicks, modified somewhat for political correctness. And there are so many characters, none are developed beyond that first stereotype. My only pleasure was guessing which of these cardboard cutouts would be dead before the end of the book..

The plot is non-existent, the characters completely unbelievable, either mind-boggingly stupid, or geniuses of the first order. The science is so weak as to be embarassing. More than embarassing, absolute garbage, even taking into account poetic license. To anyone who believes that you can sequence an entire genome overnight, I can recommend a few good books on biology. The authors could also benefit from reading these books.

Apparently, the collabrative authors have done quite well with their series of....I don't know. I could only finish this book because I am compelled to finish any book that I begin to read.I am having great difficulty understanding how this could ever be a NY Times bestseller let alone Amazon reviews of over 200 rating this as 5 star.I would not take the time to write this review for something trivial, but I'm very annoyed that I wasted my time to read a sub-par B movie. All cookie cutter characters and dialogue from old movies of the 1930's or a bit later. This was written in 1995. C'mon.I was actually angry to read this to the end.Anyone who enjoyed this stupid and laughable novel is welcome to defend. How could you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disservice ...","review":"Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: \\"Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It...","review":"I never could get into this book. This was my first attempt at Preston/Child, and I have to say I didn't much enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's physically impossible to put this book down.","review":"This is the scariest book I have EVER read. The suspense was brilliant, especially the part where Margo is being followed through the Superstition Exhibition by the unseen creature. We've all had nightmares like that! Outstanding book; don't be put off by the stupid movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced and Chilling","review":"I never read books twice but I picked this one up after having read it some time ago and got caught up in it again. The excellent character development is just enough to fill you in without slowing down the plot. The creature is absolutely terrifying as it hides in the bowells of the Mueseum only coming out to meet its special needs. The movie was a piece of garbage not following the book and portrayed in Chicago instead of New York. Several key characters are left out. Forget the movie and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Absorbing!","review":"This book was an experiment for me.I mostly read thrillers and spy novels. I think The Relic was actually suggested from looking at the reviews for Map of Bones by James Rollins (excellent book).I couldn't put it down. Very good story with a satisfying ending. I can't wait to read the follow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"This book got my attention from the very beginning and I could not put this book down until I finished. It was action-packed, spooky, and a very amazing read. Everything is written in such great detail so the scenes appear vividly in my mind. There isn't a spot in this book that drags. There were parts in the book that completely creeped me out! I wanted something to read during my winter vacation and this was it. I went through a ton of mysteries, thrillers, fantasies, and romance novels, but none of them wowed me like this book. This book is definitely worth the hype and the high rating. If you want gore and a bit of horror with your thrillers, this book is down right your alley. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, Disgusting, Crazy Story","review":".... and yet, I liked it. I could have done with a few hundred less curse words, but you sort of understand that these guys are having an all around bad few weeks here. Sure, the characters are a bit flat. The monster in the basement is kinda cool. Characters that grown and change are always a plus, but if you've got enough action to distract you, overlooking that sort of thing becomes easier.Definitely not a children's story, though I suppose parts of it were too ridiculous to be anything but a story. This is my first experience with Preston and Child. Pendergast's a typical detective type, but he still ends up winning most people over by the end.Speaking of the end, it's predictable but believable. (See what happens when you don't pay scientists well enough:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well thought out story. Hard to put down!","review":"Please do not watch the movie version of this novel first if you plan on reading this novel. The film is simply awful! Besides the title, characters names and location, it really dosen't follow the book well at all.The novel on the other hand is simply superb! This is the best of the lot from Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Truly a fun book to read. I've given my copy to many friends to read and some say they were truly frightened by the story. It's very well written and has a fantastic plot. You'll be making time to read this one.I'm a big Preston/Child fan, but I've found they've never matched the level of this book. The sequel (Reliquery) isn't bad though, but it's dosen't come close to the original. If you like reading this novel, I would recommend \\"Mount Dragon, Rip Tide and Cabinet of the Curiosities.\\" Along with \\"Codex\\" by Preston and \\"Utopia\\" by Child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD-R","review":"I prefer these to those huge spindles of 50 because I like to have the jewel cases and the extra 50 megs (these hold 700 while most others hold 650). If you want to give a CD to a friend it makes it a whole lot easier to give a case as well. When you do the math the spindle of 50 plus the jewel cases works out to about 72 cents a CD while these are about 80. I will gladly pay the 8 cents for the added 50 megs which you will be thankful for when you just have to have that last song on there."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book tought me about life style & hard shipin ruraltwon.","review":"it teaches me a lot how difficult it is to try to live along with a back ward society.

I admire the author /nicole/ for his courage& consistency to reach his goal,teach people about the use and beuty of siemen mountain who had no idea to their share of distruction of forest & natural habitat.I learned a great deal about my country's natural beauty.

I've read more in depth analysis of Pompeii by Mary Beard. The let down for this book is that the photographs are terrible. The photographs look underexposed and many lack decent composition. The photographs truly let the book down. The reason I am giving it only 2 stars is that in spite of the writing, the book is presented as a (fairly pricey) image oriented hardcover. It fails as being a book that presents the imagery well and feels far less expensive than the price for what is in it. If it were a less expensive book presented more for the informational content, I would rate it higher. There are better books if you are interested in images of Pompeii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly immersive and informative","review":"Collaboratively written and presented by Colin Amery (Directory of the World Monuments Fund in Britain) and Brian Curran, Jr. (West Coast Consultant for the World Monuments Fund), and enhanced by the photography of Chris Caldicott, The Lost World Of Pompeii is a lavishly illustrated history, filled from cover to cover with full-color photographs, showcasing what history and archaeology can tell us of the ancient Roman seaside community and culture of Pompeii that suffered sudden oblivion from the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius. An erudite text combines with revealing artworks and the results of archaeological excavation to make The Lost World Of Pompeii a truly immersive, informative, and enthusiastically recommended reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 of My Worst Book Purchases","review":"I run an internet company and was looking for a book on some good guerilla marketing, i.e, cheap, ways of getting our name out there. I was excited about getting this book, but quickly realized within the 1st 5 pages that this book is terrible. He spends more than half the time trying to convince me that the internet is important. What a joke. I learned nothing. It is much more valuable and cheaper to read something online. Now I'll have to do that or look deeper for a good PR book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So outdated, don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this book because I'm looking for new insight into online PR and since this was recently published, thought I might find some good information. Wrong! These concepts were old five years ago. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure how he stretched 3 basic concepts into a whole book. If you know anything about PR and the web (like how to send an email!), you are way beyond this book. In fact, let me summarize the whole thing: 1. Create a website. 2. Use the web to find contact info for the media. 3. Use email to contact the media. Earthshattering. You must live under a rock if you don't already know this. In addition, the book includes interviews and mentions of companies and publications now defunct, like Industry Standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What book are you people reading?","review":"How is anyone in their right mind going to give this book 5 stars?!? I was annoyed i spent money on it at all halfway through, but i kept an open mind and finished it till the end. The whole book can be summarized by these 2 words - COMMON SENSE. If you have any, you won't need to read this stuff. All he did was take his old book Guerrilla PR and repackaged it for profit. His recommendations and insights about the online community are way too optimistic. Don't waste your money on this one. If you want to read a good PR book, read Full Frontal Pr by Richard Laermer and apply those principles online. Just do not waste your time with Levine."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS NOT VERY GOOD","review":"The ideas presented in this book are things a high school student would know and the writing is poor. Buy this book if you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about PR. If you know even a little bit then you know what this book is going to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Basic","review":"With all due respect to this author and the other reviewers, this book is VERY basic. Either I know a lot more about Internet marketing than I thought I did or there are A LOT of people out there who know very little about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond belief","review":"I finished this book last night, and still can't get over the fact that a PR \\"expert\\" produced such a cheesy, repetitive, enervating read. In my opinion, \\"Guerilla PR Wired\\" reads like it was bashed out in two days and not edited. It is full of strained metaphors (the guerilla metaphor being the worst offender), glib turns of phrase and mind-numbing obviousness. Basically, the book's content boils down to five or so mundane observations, including \\"it's not a good idea to annoy media contacts\\", \\"you should update your website periodically\\" and \\"you can use events to promote your business\\". Throughout the book Levine uses the Blair Witch Project website as an example of powerful viral marketing. I concede that this was a great marketing story, but I really don't see how most small businesses could apply any lessons learned from it. In summary, a major disappointment - and, judging from some of the reviews I've read on this site - something of a PR disaster for Levine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book is certainly not for everybody. The author admits to being a relative neophyte to the Internet and it shows. If you have any familiarity with the Internet or maintain a web site, reading the summation at the end of the chapters will be more than sufficient. Suggestions such as \\"Value is necessary to a website. Offer visitors something they can use.\\" is common sense. Who would think of creating a web site having no value and is useless to their visitors? There are books available which do a much better job of addressing web site construction and a majority of the information provided on how to launch a web-based P.R. campaign is intuitive. This book was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feo Y Estúpido: El Cuento de Michael Levine.","review":"Sus características de extranjero aparte, este hombre es feo a causa de sus ojos pequeños pequeños y brillantes que acaban de deslumbrar directo.

Maybe that's why I am getting a B+ in our class and doofus boy below is getting a C. Ha ha!I doubt very much that the author of this book could even pass a college course with as little as he knows about the business side of PR. I don't think this book was written with any target audience in mind because it just kind of jumps all over the place. Maybe its good reading for schizos. Or people with ADD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhelpful For Students","review":"Wow, if this book is better than the textbooks they use in Boston then thank God I don't go to school there. I'll admit I haven't read this book, but based on the simplicity of Guerrilla PR I feel skipping this one is a good choice. I'm not sure I can think of anybody that would benefit from Levine's books. If you don't already have all the basic knowledge of PR that Levine covers in his books, then you have no interest in PR and this would bore you to death. The only amusement you can get from this book is noticing all the times it completely contradicts what all the professors are now teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than my textbook!","review":"i recently took a course in this at school and let me tell you - this is WAY better! everything i paid to learn in school i could have learned faster and cheaper from Mr. Michael Levine in this book - a MUST read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good historical background, but a hazy view of quantum.","review":"Gribbin's book is strong in introduction, but seems tofall short in properly addressing theissues of the quantum theory itself. The introduction is extremely good: one is drawn into important historical advances in theoretical physics, particularly in the study of light. Unfortunately, the transition to quantum theory is quite abrupt, and the author does not make good use of this material. It seems that the historical study of light was written almost independently of the section addressed to quantum mechanics. One is left with a hazy conception of Quantum Theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction for non-believers into the realm of QM","review":"I refute Hemmick's evaluation as being incomplete. Except for the subtitle which would be more accurate with a question mark on the end, I would recommend this, as well as The God Particle, to anyone who is interested in looking into the mysteries of the Universe, and not be overwhelmed by the deep math of Shrodinger's equation, Gribbon is a great teacher which shows in the restraint he uses, and the exciting tone he gives to the tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad......","review":"We were so excited to get this for Christmas.

I found the first couple of CDs promising, if a tad long winded. Unfortunately, I felt the book lost steam. I also had a problem with the narration. Overall, I thought the reader did a great job with just about everyone but the main character. Unfortunately, I found her narration of the main character to be very stilted, and nearly expressionless, sounding very prim almost. Maybe that's actually the author's fault rather than the reader's--I don't know. Having only heard the CDs, I can just tell you how the main character comes across when one listens. I found the book to have fairly banal conclusions and insights about middle age and mid life crisis, and many of the speeches of the characters in the last cds seemed a little too convenient and obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed","review":"I said I wasn't going to do it this year, but I did it anyway: I read, cover to cover, a seriously flawed book. Every plot point, every character, every setting, screamed cliche, cliche, cliche. Yet I kept reading. Why? I never do this. All I can figure is it was the main character's midlife struggles and the family's African American-ness that kept me tuned in to the last page. The truth is that the whole book was really a bad fictionalized version of Dr. Phil-like advice about menopause and male midlife crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Terry I know","review":"This novel took me forever to read. I just couldn't get into it like her other books that only took me a couple of days. Finally, after about 70 pages, the pace picked up. Thank Goodness. I did get to a place where I couln't wait to see what happened next...BUT...NEVER...to a place where I just couldn't put it down. I hope her next novel is back to the old Terry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly Boring","review":"I am a Terry fan and have read all of her books with the exception of Stella, of which I saw the movie version. I have to agree with the previous writer that this is not our girl's best work. In fact, it's my least favorite of the 5 books I've read. I kept waiting for the climax and it never came, no pun intended. I suffered though this novel chapter after chapter, waiting for something big and surprising to happen to make it worth my while and that something never happened. I also agree that the friends of the main character, Marilyn Grimes, brought nothing to the table whatsoever. Terry put too much on her plate with this one and should have focused on one or two of the issues she explored in this work rather than a multitude. The story was flat and left me wishing I'd invested my time elsewhere. If you want a real good read, try her earlier novels, Disappearing Acts and Mama, my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Terry Terry .....","review":"What was Ms.McMillian thinkin'? I don't know, it must be the stress from her divorce because this was talent wasted! I want my money back!!! Yeah its nice to see a author go in another direction but only if its to give fans a good read, this was sooo boring a slow read with a who cares ending. Do yourself a favor and borrow this one or re-read one of her classics and smile because this one will make you frown!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"I have been trying to get through this book for at least three weeks and still have 100 pages to go. The book has no plot, climax, nothing. It's nothing more than a book about a middle aged woman and her boring life. If there is any action I wouldn't know because I can't even bring myself to finish the book. As long as it took for Ms. McMillan to write another book she could've done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first thought....","review":"upon receiving this book and realizing it was written by a black woman about black people was that maybe I would have nothing in common with the main character because of our ethnic differences although the theme really interested me. Terry McMillan soon put my mind at ease as I lost myself in her pages and her writing style. It's easy and flows and the pages fly by. The plight of Marilyn, the main character, is universal to just about every woman on this planet. I found my life paralleling hers in more ways than one. Ms. McMillan really 'gets it' when it comes to husband, kids, parents and the role of today's woman in our society. I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and comforting and would highly recommend it to any woman who is feeling a bit lost in today's busy and overwhelming world. Thank you Terry, we truly are all 'sisters' on the inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I expected!!!","review":"I thought long and hard about how I would review this book. Which has never been the case when I've read all of Terry's other books. I found the book to be boring, hard to keep up with who's saying what, loose ends and I had to make myself keep reading because I just knew it would get better, but it never did. I also feel like I read the book for nothing. Sorry Terry, but this is definitely not your usual style.I hope you're maybe going through a midlife crisis and will come back to us .... but this is not exactly what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle Age Drama","review":"The Interruption of Everything was real and funny. I could totally relate to this novel, although I love all of Terry Macmillian Novels, I thought it could have had a tad bit more drama. But her friends were definitely off the hook! So funny!

A must read if you are a mother or a caretaker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Women Finally Wakes Up and Realizes She's POed at Her Family","review":"This book was fun to read, I started in on a Friday evening and had finished it by Sunday. I am a middle aged women who has her own spoiled family, it was so easy to identify with the main character, who has finally had it, and is angry. Terry McMillan has a great skill for writing dialog and the flow of reading this translated well to imaginging what I was reading from the words on the page to picturing each scenario in my mine, actually hearing how the characters were speaking and the emphasis they would use in their sentences as Ms. McMillan wrote them. Its a pleasure to find a novel you can identify with and that is so relaxing and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Interruption of Everything","review":"Too much dialect in this book and not enough substance.

Yes, Marilyn (the book's main character) is going through her own personal drama but that was OK because a) we all do and b) it is, after a story.The story sets up nicely introducing characters and situations that seem unexpected and thought-provoking. However, not one of those situations is resolved. Not one of the characters finds a resolution. The book almost finished mid-conversation-like Ms. McMillan was way past deadline and just needed to finish or she is writing a sequel and we should patiently wait. I mean, I didn't expect every loose end to be tied, but it was really a dissappointing finish.Remember the last episode of the Soprano's?

Yes, because everyone deserves one big flop. She'll bounce back.

Buy it now before it goes up in price!!!\\"Interruption\\" is fast-paced, wittily-written and incredibly entertaining. The only drawback I would say is that although for the most part the dialogue is pretty realistic, there are quite a few parts that sound really awkward when you read it, and then when you try to say it out loud to see if you're just crazy, it actually DOES sound kind of forced and awkward in real life too.Also, the first-person narrative by Marilyn Grimes - she has GREAT insight and observations about a lot of day-to-day and other extraordinary events, but then, there are moments when she goes on a crazy rambling off-tangent thing that reminds me too much of \\"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\\" (which had a great storyline but was really badly written in my opinion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I want the old Terry back.

This book reads like the personal diary of the main character Marilyn, which is completely boring unless you personally relate to this character's stage of life. There are no univeral themes or interesting plots to engage those of us who are not middle aged women going through menopause. Basically, this book may as well be about menopause since the author keeps harping on the same theme over and over again. I am usually a big fan of Ms. McMillan, but I am struggling just to finish this book. I would put this one in the same category of How Stella Got Her Groove Back, skip them both. Try A Day Later and A Dollar Short, Mama, or Disappearing Acts instead. Your time would be better spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSPIRATIONAL!","review":"I agree with whole-heartedly with RATMAMMY and disagree just as strongly with Sumra. This book was WONDERFUL! If you can not relate (or if you lack the imagination to be able to put yourself in Marilyn's shoes), then you might find it just another fiction. But this is very much someone's non-fiction everyday! The chapter of when Marilyn goes to get her hair braided has got to be the FUNNIEST and the best! I need this to be a movie... NOW!!

I want to read her stuff immediately. I was pissed when I finished this book! I felt ripped-off.

Oprah's announcement piqued my interest and I decided to read the book. I listened to the audiobook from the library. This book was so boring and hard to get into that it was a chore for me to continue to listen. I finally did finish the book. This book was very predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tennessee \\"Y2K\\" Williams!","review":"Following closely upon the heels of NOT ABOUT NIGHTINGALES and SPRING STORM, this latest New Directions release is refreshingly optimistic for Williams. In this early play, he didn't feel confined to three acts, but instead wrote nearly twenty vignettes, some only a few lines long, to tell the story of Benjamin Murphy, employed at the Continental Branch of Consolidated Shirtmakers. Very impressionistic, this play opens with mechanistic technae in the background as Murphy's supervisors wonder where in the world Murphy is. He's literally found stairs to the roof! A place to smoke, but also a place to dream and to breathe fresh air. As the scenes proceed, the story becomes more and more fantastical and wild, with obsession and foxes and carnivals and millenial magic. Great fun--I'm teaching it to my high school freshman English students this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyin' Heart","review":"First off, let me say that I'm a big Saxon fan. Have been since the \\"Castle Donnington\\" days. People seem surprised that a bunch of middle-aged guys could still be playing heavy metal and releasing records (no Spinal Tap jokes, please)? Why not? After all, their fan base, people like me are still there and have aged along with them. This really is not a superior Saxon recording and I suspect the band members know it. If there is any doubt as to why Saxon is no Iron Maiden, this new album answers it. The CD sounds annoyingly pedestrian and repetitive. No great hooks, melodies, sing-alongs, solos, or time signature changes to be found here. Twenty-first century Saxon? Try 21st century Maiden, Brave New World, for real listening enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to call it a day lads","review":"What is this? A joke? Don't get me wrong I LOVE saxon.I grew up listening to albums such was wheels of steel,Strong Arm of the Law,and denim and leather (all worth checking out)So when I first listened to this album I was really disappointed,the singing to be quite honest is poor,the musicianship amatuerish.If you want to see how a bunch olf \\"old timers\\" can still produce good music check out Judas Priest's angel of retribution.This album sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their best album?","review":"This is great!

When we will get a Saxon album that we can at least remember one song after a few listenings... Since Unleash the Beast, I did not hear anything from Saxon that strikes me as being original, a** kicking and worth listening.Lionheart is repetitive, uninspired by any Saxon standards. Not a single song strikes me with a WOW, they all seem the same, just like that Black Sabbath's album Forbidden. Ok, I agree it's better than albums from many overrated Euro-bands, but when you think this band released albums like Crusader and Solid Ball of Rock, Lionheart is BAD.That does not mean Saxon is dead. They still rock live and they have enough songs to do an awesome live set. But my impression is that Saxon is becoming like Deep Purple: always an excuse for the band to release new live dics and compilations, and for us to take the dust out of our old classic masterpieces and pray together for the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"I am not a big fan of reading but I saw this book and it caught my eye.

I wouldn't even call it CD. It's more like a demo tape. Hearing the Seed 2.0 on the Roots record and listening to the orginal version on Cody's record is like night and day. I think this man has talent, but he's gotta come with some production next time or else I won't support him the next time around. When I was listening to this record, all I could think of was the fat brotha who owned the club in the movie Purple Rain when he told Prince \\" Nobody understands your music but yourself \\". I just dusted of my guitar and my CASIO keyboard. Y'all music heads better make way cause I'm coming out with the Utility Room Extravanganza .

He was simply amazing live, and after I rushed out to buy this CD. After popping it my cd player, I was completely disappointed. With a live band backing him, Cody has an engery that plays very well live, but this CD could not capture this. The production is horrible, so the whole CD ends up sounding like someone trying (poorly at times) to play guitar in his bedroom while making up lyrics, which it probably was. I would love to see this entire CD re-recorded either in a professional studio, or as a live CD.If you have the opportunity to see Cody live, don't miss it, but I would pass on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and Pathetic","review":"What album were you all listening to? I bought this CD after hearing all the buzz about Mr. chesnuTT. Boy was I disappointed. I was expecting to hear some music, and all I heard was the mindless ramblings of an idiot. There were some saving graces (2) on the entire set. Serve this Royalty was a decent track. But, the shining star on the album was by far on Disc 2, Daddy's Baby!!!! I was driving when I heard this for the first time, and I almost wrecked my car I was laughing so hard!!!! That one was a definite winner in my book. I would suggest that you bootleg this album just for that one song.

Derivative as hell?...Definately!! If Lenny Kravitz ever gets around to releasing an album of outtakes it'll probably sound a lot like this. Thats not to say there aren't some decent songs on here, it's just that they are all done in the style of another artist.His influences are clearly Stevie Wonder,Curtis Mayfield, Prince,Beatles and some rap thrown in too. Some of these songs aren't even completed, just half baked ideas.Cody should take a tip from The Roots who greatly improved on \\"The Seed\\" with their more fleshed out cover version. His overweening arrogance seems insecure and is greatly off putting. Cody does posess real talent as a songwriter but is a rather flat singer prone to going off-key here and there. Next time hopefully he will get a good producer and band and take his time finishing his songs and not release demo quality crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality, lots of quantity though","review":"i have to agree with some of the other reviewers with the fact that the 4track definitely wasn't the way to go on this. after listening for about 20minutes your head/ears/eyes start to hurt from straining to understand the man. what you can understand though comes through as very original. this guy has alot to say and tried to say it all at once. i'm gonna go out on a limb and say 1-hit wonder, eventhough no 1 song really stands out. mediocre album at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"my two cents: I saw this album listed as one of Spin's top 40 albums of the year. Usually I find Spin's opinion to be pretty good so I figured I'd pick this one up. Also, there is a fantastic version of Seed on the Roots new Phrenology album (highly recommended). So needless to say, I was hoping for a good album...and what I got was not. I'm not sure what all the five-star album hype is about. One glaring problem is that there is a whole lot of filler on the two discs. I can see why record companies would not have wanted to put this out as-is on their labels. Here and there, every four tracks, you do find a good promising song complete with verses and choruses, however that is very few and far between. On the positive side though, I will say that Cody definitely shows promise. Had this been pared down into say 40 minutes of tracks, it might be better. Overall I'd say don't believe the hype on this one. But watch out when his next album drops..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has talent, but it does not reflect on this release","review":"Cody Chesnutt has talent, but this double CD is only worth 2 stars (IMHO), unless you are a hardcore fan. Besides the gutter mouth on most songs (parents should not play this in range of children), the CD is difficult to listen to because of the lo-fi approach. Cody has talent and it will be shown in future releases, but this CD suffers from 1), being too long and 2) lack of production and a thought out musical approach. Broken down this CD has about 5-6 songs that are worthy of listening to more than once, but none that are favorites. Bottom line: Gutter mouth master, not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can get past the horrific production...","review":"...you may enjoy this. But I couldn't get past it. In fact, it was enraging, simply because hidden behind the pathetic quality of the recordings are great songs performed by a true talent. For a debut album, I find it to be absolutely arrogant of him to have not taken the time to properly record the tracks. This album would work much better in the future as a odds and ends collection of 'early Cody' material that would serve as a historical document more than a proper album.Cody obviously has a great deal of talent, so it pains me to not recommend this record. Listen at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Quite possibly the most over-hyped album of 2002. Lo-Fi productions are often more endearing for their more \\"true/real\\" artistic expression. Yet, there is nothing really inspiring musically or lyrically (unless you enjoy the very tired genre of guys talking about their members and multiple relationships/orgasms) to be found on this 'masterpiece'. From 2 CD's worth of tracks, only a handful have memorable hooks. Simply put, this album stinks -- Cody, please stay at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you remember Sexual Choclate from \\"coming to America\\"?","review":"having heard this over talked about set I had too chekc it out&hear for myself what the hype was about&well I'm still trying too figure that one out?

To fail to hold the reader's interest in a sports book, particuliarly a baseball book, is almost impossible. Sports have a built-in dramatic shape. Plus you are usually singing to the choir.

There are many basic flaws in his description of the game's play-by-play. From a batter sharply pulling an outside fastball to a runner only advancing from second to third on a double, the fundamentals of baseball are repeatedly broken. Many times, his descriptions of the game's action will confuse you.Of course, that confusion is nothing compared to the disbelief the last third of this novel instills in you.

The Seawolves were obviously a fanatsy. In just about every game they one in the ninth inning and came back from a ten-run deficit. The language also detracted from the book and make you feel like these people were being paid to swear at each other. The author obviously knew nothing about baseball and made everyone in the story magically rich to solve all the problems. It was rather condusing considering they covered two season's worth of rosters plus many additional players on other teams. I had to backtrack so I would know who everyone was.

At this point it told me that my cartridge was running low on toner (it wasn't) and shut itself down. Technical support said that maybe it was a defective cartridge and that the only way to get it running again was go out buy a new cartridge (difficult for me to do since I live on Maui, which has little such supplies). Why the machine couldn't have just warned me, and NOT shut itself down is beyond me. Imagine running an office and in the middle of the day the Fax machine says I quit!Of course those advanced users are saying, \\"All you have to do is put a tape over the hole that the sensor reads to check toner level.\\" Well I did this and it worked for awhile, but it still knew it wasn't a new cartridge because I still got low toner warnings.

Called for assistance and after a grueling 30mins and no solution, I was given a local number to contact. When I called the number it was a service center that told me to return the machine since it was brand new. Called back brothers and after they asked me to let the machine go into sleep mode again and call them back - I am still on hold and have been informed that i will be for the next 15 minutes. Basically this sucks - we can't receive faxes when the machine is on sleep mode even though the manual emphatically states that it can! - we will be returning this machine and getting an HP.

After three weeks of this, I went to Staples, bought another Brother fax machine (not the 2820 model), and hooked it up. It works fine and all faxes now go through.

Perhaps it sounds and reads a bit heavy not just because it's written at least somewhat to an academic office but also because it's reflecting Stalin's bureaucratic personality in that way.One of the best parts of this book was the chapters covering the period between the purges and Stalingrad, where we see just how paralyzed, thinned out and more the post-purge Red Army was.That said, I do agree with many reviewers that this book was a bit heavy, and more designed for professional use. And that said, I've got books far more footnoted, and one on the history of the Goths that has at least as many names unpronounceable by many modern American lips.It would be interesting to have a revised edition based on 20 more years of looks at the Soviet archives, and with better editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical text, not a popular read","review":"The book is the detailed biography of Stalin. Not an easy read, it is probably more suited to be a dry academic reference text, rather than bedtime reading. But I enjoyed it.Starting and finishing it is tedious, the book is just too big. But each chapter may be read separately, depending on what topic interests you most. Assasination of Kirov, Stalin's disposal of colleagues on his way to power, his policies during war, Stalin's last years - these and other topics may be read separately.No historical book can be absolutely objective, and this one carries opinions and impressions of the author. There is very little personal input, though. And there is no hype that often accompanies bokks on tyrants.As I said, I like the book. I learned a lot and actually re-read a few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"one fine book","review":"Firstly, it is hard to call this book a biography (not being one is fine with me). Stalin's life before the revolution is described in no detail at all in a few pages. The first forty years of his life are basically left out. Rather than chronicling Stalin's life, the author chooses to discuss certain aspects of his personality with a loose flow of time in the background.A list of functionaries of the Soviet system under Stalin in the back of the book might be considered for future editions of the book. And being a first-time reader of Soviet history, the names of state institutions and the titles of their leaders were totally new to me. That turned it into tough reading at times. The book seems to be intended for a Soviet audience or one that is familiar with the Soviet system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book about a very interesting time","review":"I lived in the Soviet Union for 10 years right after Stalin's death. The personality of this man fascinates me and I have read almost every book about him. Sorry to say that this one is the worst among them. The author hated Stalin which is quite understandable.

It's NOT 'nutritionally complete' or anything like it, and most of the ingredients they use are things rabbits shouldn't be eating at all... They might like it, but only in the way a child would like being fed a 'nutritionally complete' diet of oreos and snickers bars.

Mine knocked most of it out of her food bowl, and I ended up throwing it away. She always pushes the food aside that she does not like, and only eats what she does like. So, I would say that 3/4 of this food went to the trash, which means this is a waste of money for our Guinea Pig. While she eats the compressed alfalfa pieces, that is about the only thing she liked in the mix. The bag only lasted us two weeks, because I ended up throwing most of it in the trash. A typical bag of Guinea Pig food, in this same volume weight, lasts us about six weeks. You do the math. I generously gave you 2 stars for the alfalfa. But, I certainly find NOTHING 'gourmet' about this food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guinea Pigs loved it!","review":"I bought this for my two guinea pigs because it has more variety than just pellets alone and it was a big hit with them!

This is lame stuff...all the same songs, but re-worked with doom & gloom-sounding minor chords that really do nothing to pay homage or to enhance the original songs. Like most cover songs/albums, you end up really respecting the original that much more. This would be considered garbage if you heard it before the original album. This sounds like the Residents just sat down and decided to record the 'Let It Be' album after returning home from a funeral. Maybe these are the Residents in disguise?

What could they do to document the changes that they foresaw? What else, re-make the Beatles' \\"Let it Be\\" album. The result was part Political Science lesson and part Performance Art. A stadium full of fans chants \\"I've gut ah Feehlink\\"; One After 909 is transformed into a Techno monster; we're treated to a beautiful version of Across the Universe then our eardrums are assaulted with Dig it. I was never a fan of the Beatles, but I love this CD. This is more art than music and, once you've heard it, you'll never be the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"the real let it be naked.","review":"As you've probably gathered, this is german industrial group Laibach putting their own darkly humorous mock-fascist take on the Beatles' classic album of the same name. The result is sometimes disturbing (witness \\"I Me Mine\\" turned into a Wagnerian anthem fit for a fascist rally and a chorus of creepily sedate-sounding young girls chanting a downright cult-ish \\"across the universe\\"), sometimes hillarious (the ridiculously noodly heavy metal guitar solo of \\"One After 909\\" which quotes both \\"Eruption\\" by Van Halen and \\"Smoke On The Water\\" by Deep Purple), but always interesting. If you're a Beatles purist of some kind you'd probably find this album completely insulting, but as someone with a healthy respect for The Beatles who still has a sense of humor about them, I find it a much more intriguing reinvention of the album than Let It Be... Naked was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Fulfilled Potential","review":"I wanted to like this movie.

It's not bad but the story line is not what I expected. The characters are drawn with a hand that is heavy on the ridiculous. One character literally has the mentality of a 10 year old (mentioned on the DVD case), one is a self-published author of a unknown book \\"The Zen of Acting\\", etc. The central character is actually violating house arrest to go to the game and she has never role-played before in her life.I will say some of the things that happen I've had happen in my own game, including the GM taking someone aside to get feedback on the game, so it's not all bad just overall not what I was expecting.

I have to say that this DVD was really pretty disappointing. The fact that it pokes fun at gamers isn't what bothers me. This was just a collection of horrible stereotypes. It would've been something at least, if they were 'insider' jokes or stereotypes but this was one long train wreck of outsider stereotypes, poor sound quality & poor humor. Not really even about gaming so much as just a collection of terrible characterizations. I usually can find something positive to find to say about most movies. . .but not this one. I really don't like to give bad reviews because I'd like to encourage the makers because I think it would be great to see more movies about gamers and gaming and think there's a lot of material for great humor there. . .but it's just not here.

The author, using original source material, did extraordinary detective work to draw conclusions from limited sources about how the mutineers ended up slaughtering one another, as well as a few sympathetic natives who escaped with them to the miniscule island of Pitcairn--not even on the map at that time. Only one of the original white men survived (having killed or watched the killing of all the others).It's a sordid story of swapping \\"wives,\\" drunkenness on home brew, murder, rape and the survival of the fittest--here the most devious and cunning.

If I had a complaint at all, it would be that the data cable that comes with the hub, used to connect the hub to the USB port on the PC, is less than 18 inches long. In my case, I took the new 6' cable I had purchased with my printer and used it to connect the hub, placing the hub next to the printer so that I could then use the short cable between the hub and the printer.

Fine by me, since most hardware isn't, but works just fine.Everything was going fine until I tried plugging in USB peripherals. None of them worked, including my Logitech Quickcam, Epson C80 printer, and Handspring Visor cradle.Later that night, it was driver conflict hell.

The installation was a breeze, my computer recognized it right away after I plugged in the AC adapter and connected to the available USB hub. But like some of the reviews I read, there is not enough power of this hub to work with my Cannon scanner which is not self powered, nor the Thurstmaster gamepad I just got. It does work well with my webcam, mouse, smartmedia card reader and digital camera. Still it is a pain to have to get around to the back of the case to unplug the scanner if I want to use the gamepad, or vice versa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for low power users","review":"I rated this a 2 star. It worked find for my camera at first. But then I got on the USB band wagon and started replacing my worn out serial port devices with USB and BAMM! The hub did not work. In fact I finished looking all over the Belkin site for some assistance. No drivers to help. I did learn reading the reviews that others were having the same problem. I \\"tried\\" to keep my scanner, printer, APC and CDRW drive working but it just hung up and stopped. Worked for a while. Might keep it for the kids computer. Look past this one, go for a better product if you want to connect items I listed above."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you only need for self-powered devices","review":"Works fine as a hub but beware, it only delivers 100MA to each port, and many USB devices need more power from the hub to \\"see\\" the connection, ie: my card reader for Compact Flash and Smart Media needs 500ma but my PDA needs nothing. So I had to go out and buy a more expensive hub that delivers more power and threw this one away, a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for self-powered use","review":"I bought two of these Belkin USB hubs due to the number of peripherals I bought with my new computer.

Unfortunately, I don't have an alternative to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked, until it almost burned my house down...","review":"Unlike most of the other reviewers here, the Belkin hub actually worked for me. True, I'd get an annoying popup from Windows whenever I turned on the printer or scanner that ran through it, telling me that the peripheral in question would run faster if I plugged it directly into the computer, but the speed didn't bother me. I got a good 5 years out of it, easily.Until I came home today and caught the unmistakable scent of melting plastic. Checking around, I felt the AC adapter for the hub, and it was insanely hot. The ventilation grille had started to melt.

Extreemly simplistic drawings of subjects such as how to mount a relay on a track, how to strip wire, and how to tie knots, very unsubstantial text.

Kerouac's own words and thoughts and his own mad sad times in the prime of his life (25-32yo). One page he decribes going into NYC to see D. Gillespie at Bopcity then crosses the street to Birdland to see Miles Davis and Stan Getz all in the same night , other times he is hanging out with friends and late night breakfasts in the city (ham and eggs figures alot). Alot of writing on his favorite writers Twain , Balzac and especially his most favorite \\"old Dusty \\" (Doestevesky). The first part deals with his completion of Town and City and progresses to his beginning On The Road with anecdotes galore. Kerouac writes like an angel and this is the best book on or by Kerouac since the mid 1960s when he penned his last books. Buy it and keep on a special shelf.

With University of New Orleans professor Brinkley's background in history, Windblown World comes alive, providing a gathering of materials synthesizing works entered by Kerouac in ten notebooks and providing two fine sections centering around his early efforts to publish his first works and the events which led to his finest \\"On The Road\\" novel.

The pneaumatics work well to slow the door to within about 4 or 5 inches of closing, and then it lets go entirely, allowing the door to slam into the frame. And there is no way to adjust the final closing speed. I have it on a storm door, and it does not matter if it is holding the heavier window, or the lighter screen. Both close HARD, and I can't seem to do anything about it.

The strength of closing is adjustable with a simple screwdriver and I now have the strength set so that the door doesn't slam at all, it closes fast until the end, the slows down rapidly and closes with a whisper.

I like that most of the songs here are originals, but CGT is also known for some refreshing covers, and \\"Ghost Riders on the Storm\\" is an excellent example - a clever idea I haven't gotten tired of yet after a couple hundred listenings.

In this story Jack is coming to terms with his near 2nd death experience and the impact it has had on dealing with a trauma so brutal and serious, that a normal person would not have lived through. The book starts off on a high point and keeps building from there; it will hold you on your seat till the very last page.

Gothic 3 literally appears not to have been tested prior to being released. If it was tested, then the company did not care that the game was not playable when they released it. This is the buggiest game I have ever played; the bugs are major and are very noticeable. My PC runs Oblivion flawlessly, but Gothic 3 (which has worse graphics from what I can see) runs so poorly I've given up on trying to play the game.

This game requires you to have moderately advanced computer knowledge even to start the game, which I have yet to experience. If you enjoy becoming frustrated, then this is the game for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Game by too hungry on system resources","review":"Great graphics and a good story line following on from Gothic 2. Lots of ways to develop you character and follow the story line through BUT wouldn't suggest it for anyone that doesn't have a top spec machine. My machine meets all the requirements and easily plays similar games (e.g. Elder Scrolls Oblivion) but struggles a lot with Gothic 3. So my experince is of a slow loading and very laggy game on 3.2GHz, 1Gb Ram, 256 Graphics... even when I've set some of the detail of the Graphics lower). It's prone to crash every so often as well. So I'll put the game into storage and play it again when my technology has caught up."},{"rating":"1","title":"So buggy you can't finish the missions.

I like this one too, except I can't complete the game because people important to the main missions can drop right off the map and you can't find them anymore. Once I was looking for some runes and the orc who had what i was looking for just disappeared and was nowhere to be found, thus I could not comlete the mission.I would recommend playing this game anyway because it is so much fun, but be prepared to get buggy because all the bugs will drive you crazy.It could have been a great game. Instead it is just a colossal failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Better than any other games on market","review":"Eventhough the game has very minor issues, I still believe it is better than Oblivion. At least for me I got bored with Oblivion and stopped playing after closing the 5th gate. With Gothic series as well as with this latest game, the storyline is very strong and you feel you want to keep on playing. The world is very much alive almost everywhere you go.The game is running fine on my system. The game stalled only once or twice for me.

It was racy but not too racy, it was hard but not to hard... It left some things to peoples imaginations which does not seem to be alive today in today's TV shows. I will be watching it again when ever I feel that need to relive the 80's. If there is an award for best 80's Comedy out there Alan Spencer and the Cast of Sledge Hammer deserve it!

I felt like they tried to pack a lot of different exercises in and didn't spend enough time doing each one.Overall I was disappointed. I too was bugged by having to restart the player each segment...but you don't really move around too much so just keep the remote nearby and that solves that problem.I think the individual exercises are great but I'd rather do them on my own so I can do more reps with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great FIRM exercise video!","review":"I am a huge FIRM fan and workout for 40-45 minutes 6-7 mornings a week.

I don't love all of the FIRM videos, though. Some are too fast or too slow. I am a woman who is 5' 9\\" and 180 lbs. My heart rate for weight loss/weight maintenance is 120 to 135 beats per minute during the main workout time -- so I try to pick videos that work at that level.

I liked them enough that I decided to get what was at the time Rhapsody's latest offering. I knew full well what I was getting into: cheesy dialogue, over-the-top vocals, and fast guiter wankery.Well, when I was able to give this album a listen, I was disappointed.My main gripe with SoEL II is the amount of dialogue, which I guess isn't so bad, but I grew bored of it by my third listen to the album. I ended up ripping each track and creating my own CD with select songs from this album.The music itself is enjoyable, especially if you're already a fan of Rhapsody. However, this album was just not to my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unholy Cry","review":"I can't believe I wasted 16 quid on this. My friends and myself, who are massive fans of symphonic metal, think that Rhapsody are seriously begining to rust. I prefere Luca's \\"Prophet Of The Last Eclipse\\" to this.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of Christopher Lee's appearance here, it's just hilarious. Also the only song I like is \\"Unholy Warcry\\", it is faster and less boring than the rest of the album, and \\"Elgard's Green Valleys\\" is simply a breath of fresh air.I brought my copy with me when I went to France and just wasn't bothered to bring it back.

All the reviews made it quite tempting so I went for it. NOT the type of attitude or raw power that Manowar has. This reminds me of maybe Helloween meets Rush.

The bag looks brand new, and I use it every day to haul text books, my macbook, swimming gear, lunch, and more. My favorite features are the dual bottle holders (huge mesh pockets on either side of the bag), top handle grip (great for getting the bag in/out of the car), and the two-way access to the main compartment (via hidden zipper or the velcro/buckle closure).I recommend this for anyone that needs great organization in a durable, fashionable bag.

This book is a great survey of churches who approach their communities as mission fields. It covers the practices of over 6 growing and vigorous churches.

Because it is about many churches and not just one, the reader gets to see many approaches to Bible teaching, small groups, pastoring, ministry involvement, etc. making it easier to both see the bigger picture as well as find approaches that can be adapted in your own local church. An extensive list of resources is included as an appendix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodboomboom never read the book!!!","review":"As a professor of Religion, I have used this book to teach many classes.

It's at least an hour too long. The film ultimately reflects nothing. You keep watching, thinking SOMETHING meaningful is going to happen -- it never does. You feel like slapping the entire cast while telling them all to get a life. I can't recall when I've seen such a tired excuse for a movie.

Unfortunately, this is mostly due to the even poorer quality of its competitors. While the discussion of features that already existed in 6.5 is quite exhaustive, the coverage of 7.0 improvements and innovations (believe me, there are many) is superficial and leaves you with too many unanswered questions.If you are completely new to SQL Server, this book may be the most adequate choice, but its claim to be for intermediate to advanced users is overstated.MCSE/MCDBA candidates: I know you are desperately waiting for study materials to pass the 7.0 exams, but this isn't it, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing which is worse than this book is SQL Server 7","review":"Having some previous SQL knowledge (Oracle) I find this book annoying, insulting and worthless.

This book is missing A LOT of things. The plot was INCREDIBLY weak. It had potential but didn't come close to making it. The main characters are able to fall in love with each other after only meeting 2 MAYBE 3 times. And each other those times was about 15 minutes max. The story was incredibly hard to believe. I don't know about you but friendship can only be pushed so far. And the secondary character Lavinia pushes it way to far mistreating our \\"heroine\\" of the story. But Freddie (heroine) keeps coming back for more. And in the end when it is proved that Freddie was right all along there's not even a big apology scene. So overall this really isn't that great of a book. I don't recommend it at all unless you are Really desparate for something to read. But do read some of this authors other books.

It is easily the best gardening accessory I have ever purchased. I have a fairly small lawn and after reading about lawn care realized how essential dethatching and aeration are and decided to purchase this set. Installation of both units was truly easy and operation very easy. The dethatcher grabbed literally wheelbarrow-loads of thatch from my small lawn. The aerator worked well but I gather that this type of aeration is significantly less effective than core aeration, which unfortunately requires a dedicated machine to rent, own, or hire someone to do for you. I have to say that my lawn is significantly happier and healthier after using this system just once and I will do it again in the spring. So not perfect, but pretty darn good--particularly if you already own the Mantis."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mantis Tiller is a \\" work horse\\"","review":"My wife bought me a mantis tiller when we first built our new home 13 yrs. ago.

It's very satisfying for a younger reader to follow the plot and the development of the story. Vocabulary is at a good level. Siblings cooperate and problem solve.

I hope that when you buy this CD somewhere that you will realize that this is nothing but just another cookie-cutter indie punk band. Try some of the older indie punk by Saves The Day, Thursday, Jimmy Eat World (the old stuff), Cursive, Sense Field, Texas Is The Reason and Sunny Day Real Estate.Besides, these guys are really young.

These guys dont have one thing in common with them besides the screaming, I would say the lead singer has more of a Midtown/ Pop punk edge with screamin, which I would of never thought could sound this good.

The program didn't mention the cost of the books and I assumed they would be way out of my price range judging by the intricate detail of the pages and the quality look of the books. I was delightfully surprised to find the books very reasonably priced. I bought two of Mr. Sabuda's Christmas books for my mother last year and she was very impressed with the books.

The text is the lyrics to a spectacular song, America the Beautiful. And the seven pop-ups are of pretty cool U.S. landmarks: the Golden Gate Bridge (partly orange), a farmhouse in the Great Plains (the silver coated fan atop the barn really spins), Mount Rushmore (my least favorite of them all as the faces aren't really 3-D-ish), Mesa Verde, a riverboat on the Mississippi (silver ribbons on the wheel rods spin when the page is opened), the Capitol (Washington Monument forever bent), and the Statue of Liberty (this last page has a mini-book containing four smaller popups and the words to other verses). In summary, monochromatic monuments lack eye-appeal.

A prophetic vision where Rick got to meet great Godly characters of the past after having experienced the love of being in God's judgement seat and then learning from those who have gone before and Jesus Himself what his role on this earth is which also gives the reader a far more understandable scope of our role in the war between light and dark of these last days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Deception in vivid color!","review":"This spectacular book is simply that-\\"spectacular\\" Doesn't matter if it is in truth, but it sure is spectacular! Several questions for those who read the book. What is the quest? What is the mountain? What is the battle for? Who is fighting? When is this battle? There are a myriad of questions I could ask, but a Bible scholar ought to have hackles on their necks with this one. But, so much of the church is \\"feeling\\" the spectacular instead of plowing the truth. My description of this book is the same as found in the book when the \\"quester\\" finds himself walking with faith hope and love but not walking with wisdom any longer. Those who read the book should be alarmed at this prospect. If this book is placed beside the Bible, you can't read both in agreement.

Not only is the entire story fully inspired by God, but it is written through the hands of a man who is fully submitted to the Holy Spirit. The story paints an exciting picture of the final battle when Jesus Christ will come back to claim His bride, yet at the same time applies to many issues faced by Christians on an every day basis. It is extremely metaphorical, which allows the reader to seek the Lord on the implications of each thing the main character has to face.

A true prophet will always point to Christ, through the Bible and not to themselves. As much as I liked Rick's writings in the past I'm afraid he's fallen into deception of the worst kind - he believes he's a prophet. John the Baptist was the 'last' prophet, \\"for all the prophets and the law prophesied until (up to) John.\\" (parentheses mine - Matt. 11:13) Christians must remember that anyone who claims to speak for God will point to the Bible as the 'final authority' - not dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book came highly recommended to me by a good friend but I regret to report that it is poorly written and more akin to fantasy than Christian fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"This book is a sad commentary on the state of the Christian church today.

We have not had issues with white dust which plagues other humidifiers. My only minor complaint is the power and fan speed control are the same button; when you hold down the button to turn it off, the fan turns down one speed and you have to cycle through to get the original speed when turning it back on.

Hackworth still comes across a little bitter from his career in the US Army it seems like a resonable response to the events. This bitterness also shades his opinions of current military movers and shakers. Of course, I think he's right. The leaders of today aren't leaders of men, but career managers.

Hackworth is from that wartime brand. A pain in the ass in peace but vital in conflict. He clearly identifies the issues and yet is lambasted as a poor staff leader, funnily enough so was Patton, and what a fighting general he was! No one believed him about the Russians at the end of WW2. As an ex-soldier from a recon background i'd really have liked to have met and even served under Col. Hackworth.

Why is this the case? Well it is not hard to understand when you note the company makes great profit on its hardcopy planner page sales.

Frankly I've gotten better results in the past from a $20 Walmart universal remote than this supposedly high-end home theater controller.

Our kids can simply click on buttons such as 'watch DVD', 'Watch Movie', 'Watch TV', and all equipment turns on and off and settings are completed automatically.

The buttons are very small and not intuitively placed. The different functions just feel \\"out of place\\" (logically) while trying to use it. And it's not like this is the only universal remote I've ever used either.Also, the little transistor or diode or whatever it is that makes the display light go on and off, has worn out. So the remote just shines the light all the time and the batteries wear out quickly. Additionally, the Logitech software that comes with it is not very intuitive either. How about a GUI that actually shows PICTURES instead of words? Do you expect this remote to only be bought and used by programmers and coders? I had such high hopes considering the name Logitech was on it, but unfortunately it was not to be. My review: proceed with caution. Note: since I bought this elsewhere, my review in no way reflects on Amazon at all.

Picked up the remote at the local Wal-Mart, and I generally satisfied with it. Bad things first - the Website is sluggish and the Java software that comes with the remote makes things worse - I've had to relog numerous times and wait a lot in between screens. An advice here - don't use the software installed, go straight to the web site, it will make the setup experience better.But, the idea is great - using the huge interned database greatly increases your chances of finding appropriate devices/codes. Customization capabilities are excellent, looks like you can do anything with this remote.Now, when it is working, it's a blast!

Time after time, I received nothing but session time outs and ASP errors. After diving into their user support forums, it turns out these errors aren't that uncommon. There seems to be a problem with the way the Logitech webservers handle proxies. Some people have overcome this by switching proxies or connecting through a different ISP. I've had no such luck after toying with dozens of different proxy servers and my dialup backup.Why Logitech doesn't let their software configure the remote, or heck, offer the option of manually inputting remote codes is beyond me.

I was debating between this and the 550 remote and can say that I am very happy that I bought the 520. They are nearly identical, the 550 has 6 more buttons I think and I have no need for the extra buttons. I got this for $30 less than the 550. So far I have had no real problems with the programming of this remote. The software, I feel, is really nice. Very quick until you personalize buttons, it takes a little practice but once I got used to things it went extremely quick. This remote worked with all of my components seamlessly. No problems what so ever, I have a LG Receiver, Panasonic TV, PS3 and Xbox. It worked with everything. The only negative is that the remote seems a bit flimsy but not a problem. I will be careful with it. I highly recommend the Harmony 520 to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasts","review":"I used this remote for about a year and a half. It was useful in ridding me of a multiple remote entertainment center, but it was far from perfect. The signal was unreliable especially when activating multiple components. What really got me was that after such a short time, two of the buttons stopped working entirely. Only my wife and I use the remote and we have no kids to break things, so I found this malfunction to be inexcusable. The skip forward button and one of the buttons that border the screen slowly stopped working. A shame I can't find a more reliable company that makes remotes with the same functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen Nearly Unreadable - Consider the 550 Instead","review":"I already owned a Harmony 720 for my main AV system. I LOVE that remote, but I couldn't justify the cost of another 720 for my bedroom system, so I bought the 520. I really wanted to like it, but couldn't. There's nothing wrong with the functionality, but the font on the screen is too small and too dim to read easily. The backlight doesn't help it any - in fact it makes it worse. I finally took it back and purchased a Harmony 550 for only about $10 more. The Harmony 550 remote is a great compromise between the 520 and 720. Although I love Harmony remotes, I do NOT recommend the 520."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I can do it, anyone can!","review":"This remote was much easier to program than I ever expected.

It took me about 2 hours total using the latest MacBook (Intel-based), and I wasn't even breaking a sweat.My only complaint is that scrolling through the \\"button\\" display is tiresome, but still better than juggling 5 remotes.N.B. The home entertainment guys I was working with wanted to charge me $700 for something like this...but I don't need a color screen or all the fancy bells and whistles.

It works perfectly with both my new as well as some of my older components that I couldn't get other remotes to work with quite properly. It has macros and sensitivity controls that were previously only in remotes out of my price range but that I love - with a push of a button I turn on everything, lower my tv volume, set the receiver up properly, start a dvd and am off to the races (or movies).I also ended up buying one for my parents, who have a pretty backwards setup, but the remote was able to handle the setup flawlessly, and they are finally able to use a single remote.It is definitely true that the software is slow, and during Xmas kept timing out (I guess a lot of people received it and decided to configure it right away) but I have starting using the website instead of the software, and it is good enough.

The buttons on the 520 are small and hard to press, they also frequently don't contact for the command to be sent. One other problem is that the screen is difficult so read in almost any light.

I tried to fix it with Elmer's glue but I couldn't get it into all the little curves and I'm not sure I'm helping. Very poor construction for a toddler toy. I have one other Melissa & Doug product, the \\"talking\\" animal puzzle, which I don't like because the sounds are not linked to the pictures(wave the horse over the bird photo and you'll hear it chirp - how confusing.)

She also liked to chew on them (which we tried to discourage), but didn't wear off the paint very much. This puzzle helped her learn/recognize colors and animals.

The 400 is actually two Western Digital 200gb drives--I know this, because when I tried desperately to retrieve its data, the person who opened the case said that with two drives (at RAID 0)there would be no way to retrieve the data, as it was scattered over the two drives. I recognize that drives fail, but it would be nice if a company stepped up to the plate and backed its product in some way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This lovely, cozy book is the perfect read for any day, but particularly for a day when a child is feeling sad or gloomy. The book goes through the steps used by an aunt and her neice to overcome homesickness, but these remedies could be used any time a child just needs a little extra attention and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"This -- unfortunately -- is a terrible book. It is badly in need of editing. It is obvious from the authors' introductory chapter that their command of the English language is marginal at best. It would have helped to have a native English speaker review the manuscript before publication.Even worse, the level of the contributed papers varies so widely that this book cannot serve as either an introduction or as a survey for knowledgable readers. I was hoping that at least one paper would explain the basics of conjoint analysis. But most of the authors either avoided technicalities, or else assumed that readers were already familiar with the model and its variants. Not one of them bother to explain the terminology, to write down a model clearly and succinctly, and to explain how the analysis works.Overall, this was quite a disappointing book"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],H={key:0},C={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",R,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-adb37da7"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/46.md","filePath":"quotes/46.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/46.md"},q=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{P as __pageData,q as default};
