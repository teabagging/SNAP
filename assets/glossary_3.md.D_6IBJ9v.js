There's even space to put your own notes in there which is really good for later reference - no more post-it notes!

I was expecting something more in debth. I have an MCSE, and I can say that the dumbed-down course materials I used to study for my exams back in 2000 put this worthless book to shame. If this is all it takes to be an administrator nowadays I might as well quit my job and let the secretary take over, Im sure that she can click the \\"next\\" button just as well as I can. Maybe its just me, but I was hoping for an in debth coverage of SBS as a solution, and how it differs from a traditional domain structure, and maybe an analysis of how the properties of SBS can best be implemented in some environments and interlopability with other products. Instead I get some cowboy comparing Information technology to a ranch with cows and such.

This book is well edited and Harry comes across as the smart and informed business man I'm sure he is. This is a 5 star book. What a difference an editor makes!\\"Apparently, Harry fell out with SAMS and went to Brelsford with this book; I can't help wonering if it was something to do with editorial policy ? If so, go back to SAMS, Harry, your technical knowledge is superb but you really do need a good editor to get your writing better focusedMartin Harran"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I completely agree with Gary's comment below. This book is of little value except for those who have very limited knowledge of small business networking. This is to say, this book may be useful for those who are NOT in the IT consulting business.You won't get any warm and fuzzy feeling, if you are looking for valuable insights of running MS Small Business Server 2000 as the title of this book implies. In most cases, the author tip toes around the most basic concepts, congurations and setups without any appreciable new insights in very verbose albeit walm and friendly fashion.This book really should have been part of the \\"Dummies\\" series, as it serves inexperienced business persons or very incompetant consultant types but not technical persons with hands-on experiences in NT and 2000.Notice how so many glorious reveiws are from Washington State. My suspision is that authors' buddies have helped him out on this.

However, if you are experienced with Windows NT/2000 Server, you will be disappointed, as this book covers some of the most basic features and functions and it does NOT show the best practices in real life small business networking situations.In short, this book is for beginners only and it doesn't deserve similar rating as Mark Minasi's outstanding Windows NT/2000 Server books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the technology consultant!!","review":"Harry has done a great job of presenting the nooks and crannies of SBS 2000. Before reading \\"Best Practices\\" I knew very little about SBS 2000... and now I have completed my first SBS 2000 installation and will be starting my next within a week. Thanks to Harry's insights and years of SBS experience I am growing my SBS consulting business!Harry's writing style appeals to us techies as well as non-technical business owners who want to admin their own installations. I highly recommend this book to all who work with SBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must have for SBS administrators & consultants","review":"For the first time user, this contains a by the numbers installation that will let you get an actual site up and running, as well as sneaking in the technical reasons for doing things. The language is simple and the real life stories make it easy to remember when you set up your own organization.For the experienced user, this provides plenty of detail of the pesky quirks that normally require hours of researching. Harry does a great job of alerting you to possible unintended consequences of various settings and interactions of the many powerful servers included in SBS.He has done an excellent job of providing the \\"must know\\" of SQL Server, Exchange and ISA to operate SBS and leaving the hard details to other references. This keeps this book manageable and on track.Readable, complete and well done, your return on investment is immediate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent hands on details","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I'm well versed on Windows 2000, but haven't had much exposure to SBS. I really enjoyed the writing style and learned a few tips and tricks along the way.

I would recommend it to anyone and have done so. It appeals on so many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Estate sales, murder and romance!","review":"I picked up this book because of the Savannah and antiques aspects of the plot. When Weezie was arrested the night before the big estate sale at a Southern plantation house, I was more upset she might miss the estate sale than that she might be charged with murder!It seemed to me the romance took backseat to the murder mystery and finding treasures at estate sales, but that was definitely OK in the context of the book. Weezie's family, her best friend BeBe & assorted others added to the character of the book.I just realized there are two more books about BeBe and Weezie. I'm definitely going to read them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I loved all the info about Savannah, plantations and of course, the food. The characters with unique and they all had their own funny quirks. BeBe's attitude and way of getting things done was admirable. The only problem I had was with Weezie's attitude with Daniel. It was obviously the guy was in love with her and she didn't treat him very well.Other than that I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern charm!","review":"Eloise Foley is in a bad place in her life. Recently divorced from Tal Evans, she now lives in the carriage house, behind her former home where Tal lives with his new girlfriend, Caroline. Her finances are shaky and she earns a meager living from being a \\"picker\\" who finds antiques for dealers. As if this isn't bad enough, she discovers a dead body and immediately she is a suspect in the murder. This book is set in the beautiful city of Savannah, and it involves antiques, old houses, and crooked men who are cheating their clients. Eloise, or \\"Wheezy\\" as she is called, is a spunky, delightful heroine who makes a lot of mistakes in a new relationship, but who manages to land on her feet. This is recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan","review":"This is the 3rd book by this author that I have read. All are wonderful. The author puts you right there in the story and all are so real. I feel like that this is my other life. LOVE IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"Don't waste your time with this one. If you're craving a Southern fried version of Nancy Drew and her pals, then carry on. But if you have any desire for well-drawn characters with a real mystery plot then pass this one by. Such silliness I haven't read in a long time. And don't even get me started on the shallow Daniel character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Savannah Snooze","review":"I can't believe so many people actually liked this book. After about 50 pages I couldn't stand all the errors. Who edited this book? I want to send it back to the publisher and demand my money back! This book had me so frustrated that after a while I couldn't concentrate on anything but the errors and really didn't care what happened to the two dementional, unbelievable characters. The premise of the book was good - it could have been a great read if someone else had written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cloying Southern \\"charm\\"","review":"Take your first warning from the fact that the main protagonist calls herself \\"Weezie.\\" Everyone has a cutsie Southern nickname and some endearing personality quirk. Then there's the whole Uncle James subplot, told from his point of view, which is might have been interesting but ends up seeming like just another gimmick thrown into the mish-mash of contrivances that make up this novel. The book tries WAY too hard, in my opinion. Usually I like this sort of thing (Edgerton, Pearson, Welty, Dufresne) but this just goes over the top and leaves no real meat behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The characters in this book were made out to be nothing more than dumb broads as the old saying goes. I was disappointed to the highest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun summer read!","review":"My book club picked this book for our July read. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The characters are fun and well developed. The story is easy to follow, although some chapters are written in the first person and others in the third. Nevertheless, it was very entertaining and enjoyable. I found myself laughing outloud several times and very intrigued at others. I can't wait to read the other books of Mary Kay Andrews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as the Callahan Garrity Series","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this series and I really wanted to like it. I preferred the author when she wrote under her real name \\"Katy Hogan Trochek\\" as I really enjoyed the characters in the Callahan Garrity series. Its funny; I actually didn't like Callahan and I didn't like Weezer in this series. The family and friends they surround themselves with are more fleshed-out and interesting than the main characters. Both heroines are annoying, petty, rude and not very likeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"a light, entertaining book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is a light,entertaining book. As I'm not from Savannah, the \\"inaccuracies\\" another posted mentioned didn't bother me as I didn't know they were inaccurate.

I am sorry to say I did not like this book and struggled to finish it. I found all the details about antiquing b-o-r-i-n-g. Weezie and BeBe were annoying. Weezie's relationship (if you want to call it that) with Daniel was eh. I did not think they had chemistry at all. The book was too far fetched and the humor was too exaggerated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches, cheesy, hated it","review":"I suppose a lot of reviewers loved the book, but personally I hated it. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I felt the plot was flimsy, there were far too many silly details and very little in terms of character depth. As a Southerner far from home, I love reading books about the South. I'm actually from Beaufort, only an hour away from Savannah. However, I really don't feel the author portrayed the South in an accurate light (a 30 year old heroine who wears a yellow linen short set after 1985 is embarrassing). Also there was a silly plug for \\"shag\\" music and the romance scenes were ridiculous. I feel these examples show the author should have stuck with characters in her own age range. I guess as a beach read it's OK, but I would personally rather put my time to better use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This was a nice light summer beach read.

The Career counselor is not all it cracks up to be...very hokey and somewhat cheesy. Inputting into the program (once I get it running and \\"debugged\\") is fairly easy but the formats aren't very attractive.

Evans and Keith Skinner, is exactly what it purports to be in the subtitle. It is a discussion of all the letters sent by people purporting to be Jack the Ripper to the newspapers, police and assorted individuals followed by a section printing all of the letters in the police files (there is little variety in the letters themselves showing the lack of imagination shown by most of the copy cat letter writers and this could prove a little dry for some). In addition, this volume is generously filled with photos of the letters themselves. This book is not for the beginner in the Ripper mythology as it focuses strictly on the letters and will be of most interest to those who have a basic understanding of the case already. This volume is a worthy addition to the Ripper books and will keep the legend alive for the next generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"GNR","review":"Love the book. the pictures are so vivid. love seeing the whole band in the book both on and off stage. very much enjoyed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning technique, needs much work","review":"This performer deserves all the latitude necessary, as she may yet develop into a relevant, insightful, and original interpreter of the music she offers. I truly hope she does not choose to compete with Eliot Fisk in the Indy-500 or the 24-Hours of Le Mans. Based on the samples, I won't be buying this CD as I can program my computer to play just as fast or even faster, and just as clear. Instead, I recommend the Frank Bungarten recording (also available on Amazon). But Ana Vidovic does show a lot of promise, and deserves encouragement."},{"rating":"1","title":"rushed","review":"Ana Vidovic sounds like a technically proficient player, but her tempos are unnecessarily rushed and so she sacrifices all the drama and beauty of the music in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent technique","review":"Ana is going to be someone to watch out for for years to come. Seeing her live is simply a rare treat in life. A true master, at least in my eyes. The only reason I rated this a 4/5 is because of her incredible speed. It's absolutely mind bogling how fast and accurate she can play, yet is speed the right thing in all situations? Example. The first track. Ana stuns you with 'how fast she can move through the piece.' I sat and listened to this track, comparing it to another master, Julian Bream. Ana moves through the piece with computer percission. Julian flows through the piece at over a minute slower. He seems to be in complete control of speed, accuracy, and emotion. Ana was quite young when this was recorded, and I have been impressed with her later work. I enjoy this recording for what it is. A young master that has perfected the technical aspect to her playing. I'm not going to say slow down, or copy Bream. Continue to grow, and develope. I'll keep listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continues","review":"I love this author. Found her books by accident and have been reading my way thru them. This is the story of the youngest Faucon brother. The interaction between these two strong people is wonderful. Neither one is a downtrodden victim and yet they show a deep love and concern for each other. Denise Lynn has a way of creating fun dialogue within the strong romance and at the same time painting a descriptive background. I recommend reading all four books in this series as they are all wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Detailed, but Grossly Inaccurate","review":"Quite obviously Ms. Bruck did her homework on this book because there is much detail. However, her continual usage of the word \\"junk\\" to always refer to any type of high-yield security shows that she has passed sentence before the trial.Most of the book is a very detailed account of what happened, but clearly she does not understand the economics or the legal aspects of any of the deals therein. She portrays Michael Milken as a devious crook, yet reality characterizes him much differently. Ms. Bruck attacks the deals but has no idea what makes them good or bad, so she assumes wealth-making to be evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album of the year!","review":"I just love this record. Clearly this band is persuing their own course through the well chartered waters of pop music. Along they way they leave gems like 'Seven' and 'Words' as sign posts to mark their path.Blending Sunday's airy pop with Fleetwood Mac guitar work makes for delightful listening over and over again. Clearly the bi-continental influences (vocalist Saskia Kidd is from Holland)serve them well. This record should be a hit every where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and comprehensive","review":"This is a comprehensive and thorough guide in the land of acid base and electrolites.

So much for high end service with your high end chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this chair","review":"The seat of this chair cuts off the circulation to the back of your legs - the hamstrings. The way the frame is designed, it presents a solid edge, just under the seat mesh, that you can feel across the front area of the seat, a few inches in from the edge.Another problem is that the front tilt feature is missing from this chair, although it is supposed to be a \\"loaded\\" model, and the instructions provided do mention this feature.I am so disappointed with this chair.

There are a lot of blends and great guitar riffs that keep you intuned into listening to it. Overall i love every song on the cd except Call it Karma, that one could use some work.

I don't like the way this ensemble sings this music, but you will find little choice if you want to hear these profound compositions by Pierre de la Rue, one of the most brilliant contemporaries of Josquin. The price is low enough; perhaps you'll find the vocal technique less of an obstacle to your listening pleasure.Months later: I'd forgotten what I wrote about this disaster until I tried to listen to it again. It's worse than I first thought. The amazing thing is that the Ars Antiqua de Paris is a venerable ensemble, founded in 1965. It's a disservice to Pierre da la Rue, a very great composer, to keep this beast in circulation. If you really want to hear Pierre de la Rue, and you should want to, I can recommend three 5-star CDs:The Clerks' Group: de la Rue & Brumel RequiemsThe Clerks' Group: de la Rue Missa de Sancta CruceGothic Voices: de la Rue Missa de Feria & Missa Sancta Dei genitrix"},{"rating":"2","title":"A joyful and mildly educational program, enthusiastically recommended as a gift for families with young children","review":"Arthur Season 11 collects the latest season of the Parents' Choice award-winning public television series based on the popular children's books by Marc Brown.

Some of the songs were very spiritual but when I could make out every forth word or so - even though it was sung in English- it got frustrating straining to listen song after song. Again, I think I would have enjoyed the CD more if everything was in Latin so I could just enjoy the beautiful music. I gave the CD to a music friend and she had the same problem.

Now don't get me wrong, I agree that this movie is great for kids, it provides a great alternative to all the terrible movies out there but it does a terrible job of capturing what it is to be a \\"aggressive skater\\" (which is a term that no one uses anymore). I've been in the in-line industry for over 9 years and I've never, ever run into a \\"soul skater\\", I've never run into any one that dresses like Brink or his friends that actually skate and so forth. Now I realize that they had to \\"mainstream\\" skating to make it reachable to the general audience but \\"Airborne\\" does ten times better then this movie, and that was done almost 8 years ago when skating was still in it's infancy. Sorry, but I'd rather go pick up something like Malibu,CA or Saved By the Bell then this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This movie has not much of a plot but a good message and an even better cast.

Anyway as in the title I really need the songs so could someone PLEASE send me the names and who they're made by?

House of the Devil was slow but had loads of charisma and did a great job of capturing the 80's feel and slowly building to a worthy climax. Babysitter Wanted had several flaws the worst of which was predictability with the \\"killer\\" but the acting was pretty bad too. A couple of decent gore scenes but it really fell short of what I expected based on the reviews. The BD was pretty weak, DD 2.0 (on a 2008 release seriously?), no pop-up menu, and upconverted DVD PQ.. I even ejected it to make sure blockbuster didn't send me a dvd by mistake.My recommendation is skip, even for a rental.

There are some plot twists and Sarah Thompson does a decent job but really there's nothing really interesting or worth seeing here.The film seems to exist in its own world where college students don't own cell phones (but stalkers do), community colleges have dorms and people travel across the country to go to a community college. And there's no internet, if you want to buy a second-hand bed or a job you look at hand-written notes on a bulletin board. I can't figure out if the producers wanted this to be set in the 70s or if they just don't quite know how the world works.There are few thrills, the cover is much gorier than anything you'll see in the film.Save your time and money, you don't want this babysitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Region 1 Wanted.","review":"The standard sitter-in-jeopardy stalker yarn is given a wicked twist in this tense, gruesome, suprisingly funny and very clever tale.A highly recommended, underseen gem with a great 80's horror vibe that begs for a Region 1 release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another Anime fan","review":"Kiddy Grade is one of the best anime I've seen in awhile.

I feel like this should have been the first one in the series, because her writing seemed to digress so much. All that and a bag of chips was damn near perfect. The following two books were just as good, but after reading this I am beyond hesitant about reading anything else she writes. It took me almost three months to read it. I felt that the characters were at times overly dramatic, and even her writing style seemed to be that of a novice rather than a published author with a couple of published books under her belt. The story line itself was good. Man, likes woman. Woman's in danger, hesitant to reveal why.... etc. It was good, but the way that Miss Lee presented it was just horrible. At one point she was almost at the top of my Authors to watch\\" list, now, she's not even on it. Not saying that she can't redeem herself, it's obvious that she has the talent.

Beating Bobby Riggs in table tennis with a frying pan, beating Minnesota Fats in pool with a broom handle, fixing baseball games for big money, fleecing Willie Nelson at dominos...As a semi-professional gambler, I was intrigued to find out how old Slim got the best of so many of the greats... His philosophy, \\"Find a champion and make a sucker out of him,\\" makes sense. Ego has separated more than one man from his pocket book.

It was very hard to put down in spots. There were times that I got a little confused (their prior relationship, the ending), but I think that's due to my not reading the series in order.

Songs get boring until we get to \\"Losin' My Mind\\". Too bad Snoop doesn't really rap on it. \\"BK to LA\\" is one of my favorie tracks on the CD.

It almost sounds like a collection of tracks that were cut from the last album - Xzibit's rhymes are almost as flat as the beats. Xzibit's voice is actually somewhat timid, certainly not the growl from before. It's just such an average release from an assembly of above-average talent, that the overall feeling is one of frustration - why isn't this better? The only bright spots on the album are when Eminem and Snoop pick up the mic on guest spots.Bottom line: skip this one and pick up Snoop's \\"Paid tha Cost\\" instead. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work","review":"This album is not his best but is not his worst. Xzibit is one of the most rugged MC's out there.

There's no aggressiveness in his delivery, the beats are awful, xzibit doesn't have any quotables in the album, and hard to believe...this album is worst than Restless. To start he already lost 'cool points' for teaming with Eminem and Dre and dissing the defenseless Jermaine Dupri. It would be different if JD had some MC's to strike back but he had Bow Wow and Jagged Edge. Damn, that was real gangsta dissing him. ( even though it was comical) Why doesn't Xzibit take that aggresiveness and insert it into the album? Nobody knows...and sadly the airwaves have been forced to force his garbage songs into rotation ( the horrendous Symphony In X Major ). His first single, Multiply, wasn't any better and I'd be hardpressed to find a person who liked the song. His album has too many rock influences...I mean the album is just a mess. Xzibit is no more and it's sad...Skip this album for your own health."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Best Of\\" isn't the best, but...","review":"As a long-time fan of Mary Black I was looking forward to this volume.

The actors were always excellent (w/the exception of Robert Picardo and Megan Gallagher....I don't know, but I just didn't like them very much). The show could not have been made w/out Dana Delaney. If it had it wouldn't be half as good. She is Colleen McMurphy...McMurphy is China Beach...Dana Delaney is the key. Her performance both comic and drmatic are so true to life. Her emotions of the war are so real it scares you into thinking that this is too real. She has such a wonderful gift. I hope we see more of her real soon.WHY IS THIS SERIES NOT ON DVD?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? I find this a serieous omission. If anyone hears about it coming to DVD, please let me know by email! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable China Beach","review":"I keep checking to see if this has been released. I was late teens/early twenties during the original airdates and can honestly say that no show has ever induced such powerful emotions from me as China Beach did. I would schedule my college classes around the airing time so I wouldn't miss it. My mom, sister and I would surround the TV and the tears and laughter flowed. I WISH I had taped on the VCR all the episodes as it appears we will never see this on DVD.... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Get This Show onto DVD ASAP","review":"I cannot believe this show is still not out on DVD. I would buy the seasons without a second thought. So few television shows leave such an impact on it's viewers as China Beach did. It's definitley one of the best shows ever made and deserves a chance to live again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a unique show","review":"Bring on the DVDs!!!!There has never been another show quite like this on tv. The concept was unique, the acting was great and the storylines quite affecting. A decade and a half later I still recall certain scenes and storylines.Why is this not on DVD yet when so many lesser shows are available? I'd buy every episode. I wish I'd had the foresight to tape it so I could rewatch it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV War Drama Ever","review":"This show was an amazing example of what television can be. The acting was unbelievable and the casting perfect. At a time when the Vietnam War period is just ancient history to younger people and while war is still being promoted, this drama shows how war affects not only the military personnel, but also the citizens of the country where the fighting is happening. Dana Delaney, Marg Helgenberger, Conchetta Tomei and Robert Picardo are stellar as is the sublime Chloe Webb. This show should be released so that people can remember it and it can be viewed by people who have never seen it before. This was the Vietnam War, but it could be any war. And, there is a killer soundtrack behind the drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"when TV was excellent","review":"i recently came across some old VCR tapes on which i had recorded some episodes of China Beach. what a GREAT show!!!! can't figure out why shows like this just sit on a shelf somewhere gathering dust when so many folks would love to see them again? i remember the year that the show got cancelled was the same year a lot of quality shows like thirtysomething and northern exposure to name a few also got the ax. TV has for the most part gone down hill since in my opinion. hope if they bring the show to DVD or download they treat it the same as the re release of Freaks and Geeks and thirtysomething. they did a nice job unlike some other series i could name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good not to release","review":"This show was one of the best on TV at the time. My son started watching it when he was 10 and he was blown away by the music and the characters. He heard his first Hendrix, Stones and Doors, among others during the series and has been a lover of that great music and military service ever since. Now that he is a Marine serving in Irag, I know he would love to see the series again. The music was an integral link with the times and the series, so it must be kept in the original format."},{"rating":"2","title":"China Beach watched religiously","review":"No review really.

When I have asked in specialized video stores why it is not made it to DVD I was told the problem was the music. The soundtrack to the show used a lot of music from the time and the expense of gaining rights to all those songs make the process of putting the series on DVD prohibitive. Or so I have been told."},{"rating":"2","title":"HBO should think about bringing it back","review":"This was definitely a fab series that was doing great until they stopped.

The characters and stories were amazing(and based on real events from what I have read). As the daughter of a Vietnam Vet it was good to see something that showed what it was like there and not just for the GI's (as we see in most movies) but also for those who cared and tried to help them feel better about life.

This series was one of the best,and I totally agree that it is much better than the new programs that come out as soon as their first season is over.China beach needs to be seen by our kids,so they can understand better the craziness we went through during the Vietnam War years.Please,please,please release this SOON!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can remember......","review":"Hello!I can remember watch China Beach every time it was on.

The first disc locks up midway through the first episode and will not play the remainder. Disc two is full of some ?90's bang bang shoot 'em up blow 'em up detectictive tv series that I never heard of. There is no series finale. Wait for an AMERICAN production. DON'T BUY CHINESE CRAP. The episodes are mis-titled. Several episodes are repeated and therefore several are missing. The final disc, labeled number 13, has about 10 minutes worth of the next-to-last episode and then NOTHING. A great DISERVICE to a Class A tv series has been done here. I knoww my review is full of mispellings but I'm a,xious to let you know--Save your money. Don't waste money on a bootleg shoddy fly-by-night piece of you-know-what. -Robert Rowland"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SERIES!!!","review":"This was a very special show, one of television's finest moments. It saddens me that in an era of reality TV, we no longer have shows of integrity like this one. As with \\"Homicide: Life on the Streets,\\" this show had more in common with film than it did with television. That may have been both shows' undoings, because plots require attention, etc. I'm puzzled that with \\"China Beach's\\" fan base that we haven't seen this show released on DVD. Emmy-winning performances, beautiful writing, and cinematography to match -- PLEASE GIVE US \\"CHINA BEACH\\" ON DVD!!! It would be an honor to add this one to my collection, and would give those who didn't have the pleasure of seeing it when it was new the chance to enjoy it. Please put the series out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"No DVD because of problems with music rights...naturally.","review":"Why is it always the musicians and record companies holding back new technologies?

Yes, I'll pay extra to get it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish they would release this already!!!","review":"I have been hunting for years for this set, and was so grateful to see the info about scammers selling it. I was all set to buy it from a company in England when I found out it was phony. I cannot wait for them to really let this out. It is my favorite series of all time, and it has something for everyone, plus the best soundtrack around. I hear that is what is holding it up, the music rights.... but someone should recognize the money to be made when it gets released and cough up the production costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please make a DVD of all 56 episodes available soon.","review":"I enjoyed China Beach but never recorded it. I remember it was well done, and I loved Dana Delaney's acting especially. Also it would be nice if Resurrection, the TV movie with Dana Delaney was made into a DVD for sale.

Their reactions to frightening experiences are very human; something we all can connect with and understand. Zak, Nick, and Aaron are likable,real people unlike some investigators from other paranormal shows. Zak displays a true desire and passion to expose the public to a subject that has been ridiculed and dismissed for a long time by a majority of people.

I would give it four or five stars if it lasted more than one and a half seasons (I need a humidifier for 2-3 winter months where I live). It started leaking out of the base somewhere so I would find puddles on top of my dresser where I kept the unit. Completely unacceptable at this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a day then dumped water on the floor","review":"We've been going through humidifiers trying to find a good one. I was attracted to this one because Costco sells it and we could return it for a refund if it stopped functioning at any time.Well, on day 3 it went back to costco.

This would be a great unit - if it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design","review":"I had the same problem as someone else did on here.

After just a few uses the red light started blinking, indicating the need to refill. At that point, nothing else would happen - full or empty.

This isn't your average American teen flick, but an insightfully humorous look at the young Desi (South Asian) community in America. The story centers around a Fresh off the Boat (FOB) Indian, Hari Patel, who moves to America to attend college while living with his Uncle's family. Before his journey, a local guru predicts Hari will meet his destined wife in America whose name begins with \\"P\\" and will fall upon him in a fever during a full moon. Hari is thrilled about his trip to America and can't wait for his cousin, played by \\"Van Wilder's\\" Kal Penn, to introduce him to his hip American friends.Kal Penn's character does everything in his power to avoid Hari because FOBs like him represent all the un-cool things about his Indian heritage.

What you need is skill in applying the black letter to particular facts. Get your hands on every practice question you can find. Finals is always a hit. I was totally lost in civ pro. I ended up getting a B+. An A would have been nice but a B+ was good enough considering I was confused most of the time. If you get Finals, don't get Siegel's. I've found that MC questions in Finals are identical to the ones in Siegel's.

We have had similar problems with the software crashing the computer almost every time we attempt to use it. The sound works only occasionally and not at all for languages like Icelandic and Czech. Switching from one language to another almost always crashed the computer and most times we were unable to even get one language to switch from one activity to another. We bought the program because we have young children who are gifted in languages and naturally curious about and this seemed to be the perfect resource for them to explore many different languages on a superficial level until they found one they were interested in studying.

Included in the box are the 3 cds and a large softbound book with vintage photographs and informative text.As I stated in the previous review I wrote about part 1 of this series, I don't know much about the genre of Jazz, but to me, these collections are so much more than the sum of their parts.

The recipes were easy to follow and well written. There were lots of pictures of the different dishes, as well as stories behind some of the dishes and how/where they originated. Contrary to what one might think, when imagining the combination of cowboys and cooking, this cookbook offers more than just the predictable, standard steak and ribs type of dishes. There are lots of different kinds of entrees, salads, desserts, cocktails, appetizers, etc. Each dish has its own distinctive flavor.

Maybe they pay royalties by the minute?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the Warning","review":"I too am a big fan of this series and want to thank the reviewers who have alerted us to the fact that the US version has been chopped up to fit the 90 minute \\"Mystery\\" time slot. My low rating is for selling us an edited version of \\"Lewis\\", not for the progam itself which I love. I was planning to buy the US version of the series until I read these reviews. Another reviewer recommended that \\"Lewis\\" fans email \\"PBS feedback\\" at[...] about this issue and I did. They responded immediately and indicated the situation was out of their control. Apparently they are hearing from other fans who are displeased with PBS for airing edited programming.Series 1-3, including the pilot, is available at AmazonUK for approximately $44.00. I too will be buying it there. The savings will almost cover the cost of a region free dvd player. I would encourage other fans to submit their input to PBS too.

John Thaw and Kevin Whately made a series believable and never made an character mistake! It was not seen to be acting, they had become the people you knew and trusted.Now Kevin Whately (DI Lewis)picking up his life after such personal tragedy, and Laurence Fox (DS Hathaway)giving his own stamp on this charming and very likable, though sensitive character, are just right to carry Thames Valley Police and Oxford into this series for a long and gripping run.An older Lewis is a humble, dedicated man with intense sympathy for the victim. Hathaway has respect for Lewis; though you cannot (see) all of this young man's character at once, you realize that he will support Lewis no matter what!I am now looking forward to the next releases of \\"Inspector Lewis\\" and I will continue to collect this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspector lewis series 1","review":"i started watching this show on PBS and enjoyed it so much that i decided to get the first of the series. i was not disappointed. this is really an interesting series, with the added advantage of being able to understand what the characters are saying. i entend to purchase the second year when it is available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspector Lewis: Pilot & Series 1","review":"Was so excited when I found out it was on DVD.

There's an incident room coordinator, various sergeants, criminologists, and many other police personnel.

It has a round bottom on the inside and a flat bottom on the outside so it fits on a flattop stove with no problems. It's the closest your gonna get to a traditional thin-steel wok on this kind of stove. HOWEVER, the fist time I heated this thing up it emitted some seriously noxious fumes. A the *least* you need to throughly wash the thing (with soap) before you use it. A better option would be to totally re-season it. The factory seasoning can be removed by running it through your oven's self-cleaning cycle. This will turn the existing seasoning to ash which you can easily wash off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality Chinese cast iron - cracked","review":"Two large cracks even before use. Check carefully while washing up for the first time as the shipping coating hides the cracks. The cracks may or may not run. Cast iron is brittle. Cracking of cast iron is not that uncommon but in general it indicates poor quality materials and/or poor production procedures during the cooling and mold removal process. The Chinese cast iron can be excellent but when the importer takes bids for the absolute lowest price ( ie the Walmart syndrome ) this is what you get.

This is actually the second cast iron object that UPS managed to shatter into pieces on me, the first being a subwoofer with a cast iron basket.

Well, these woks seem to have been packaged by a kid.. the wok is thrown into a box barely big enough for it, atop of some crumpled paper. I dont get it.Second wok arrived packed the same way, but not broken. Seasoned well, cooked well. Only used it once but it seems really nice. Bottom is flat for stability but curved inside so holds heat nicely. You will definitely want a big flame for this, I am using the Bayou Classic propane burner I bought on Amazon a year ago. So for the money, this is a really great wok, just dont be surprised if it arrives broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived coated with unremoveable, noxious machine oil","review":"This cast-iron wok arrived looking already cured.

My hands are stained with black oil, and there are some silvery spots on the inside of the wok. At this rate, I will never be able to get enough of the cure off of it to make it fit to cook with.This product is completely useless and I am considering filling out a form to report it as unsafe.

It arrived without any padding but it did not crack like other reviewers mentioned. I use it frequently and it gives a great flavor to food. It's the closest to getting that Chinese restaurant taste at home. You season, clean and take care of it like any other cast iron cookware. Using the stainless wok chuan with it seemed to make it smoother inside also. It's pretty non stick when well seasoned. I scrub it with a stainless steel scrubber and rinse with very hot water then dry and place back on stove to heat with a little bit of oil. Occasionally I may use a little soap to clean it if it seems really greasy since I don't want it to go rancid before I use it next. I just reheat and oil it on the stove top for a while. It stays nice and seasoned without have to put it in the oven for an hour. It is heavy but not as heavy as the Lodge one so it's much easier for me to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one with a crack","review":"Arrived w/ a crack in the side.

I'm returning this and getting the lodge cast iron wok.Ohh, and the oil they treat it with so it doesn't rust before purchase is really hard to scrub off. Get one that's pre-seasoned. You still need to scrub off the wax they use to pre-season then season it yourself in the oven but its not toxic. The oil on this wok is a nasty black/grey color and smells like a gas pump when you season it even after scrubbing it out multiple times before hand.At least amazon is picking up the tab for shipping this defective item back(reason for 2 stars.

Then I washed it thoroughly, and boiled water in it to really clean it up. Now it's on it's way to being well-seasoned.This thing is a really big chunk of cast iron and it gets HOT, which is great for stir-frying.

The final confrontation was somewhat predictable and slightly anticlimatic. I feel that Gansky could have gone into a bit more detail with the ending, however this in no way lessened my enjoyment of the book. Very few books seem to translate well to film.Peretti's This Present Darkness was a good book, however it would be extremely difficult to do it justice on the big screen. As I read The Prodigy I could very easily imagine seeing it on the big screen. The book is filled with well rounded characters and their actions and motivations were clearly presented. Along with Bill Myer's Blood of Heaven, Frank Peretti's The Visitation and Randall Arthur's Wisdom Hunter, I would highly recommend The Prodigy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"There is just no two ways about it -- Maura O'Connell is one of the handful of the very best singers around in ANY genre, and she proves it once again in the solid, nearly flawless recording of first rate songsWith a slightly rootsier feel than some previous albums by O'Connell (she was inspired by Lucinda Williams' Americana classic \\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\\") it might be tempting to approach this album with a bit a caution, but there is no need for that. What we have here is a set of one dozen excellent songs and all of them are beautifully sung and tastefully produced -- in short another typically excellent Maura O'Connell album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Maura needs to get away from Nashville.

I don't hear the things that have made Maura stand out for me: her roots, unique styling, song selection and backup. For those who've loved the Irish influence in her \\"bluegrass,\\" I think it's hard to find either here. This just sounds like anybody's studio album with a huge amount of instrumentation; in fact I sometimes can't even tell it's her unique voice. Well, I still love her though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Musical Voice","review":"I love Maura O'Connell's voice. When I like one of her songs I love listening to it.

Sleepy Eye'd BoyTrack 3, Walls, is a beautiful song. Has been redone by other artists but Maura's version is by far the best. A lot of emotion comes through. Poor Man's House is beautiful, sad, great song. Long Ride Home is pretty, never been a real favorite but I always like listening to it. I'm not crazy about her version of Clapton's I Get Lost. Blessing is excellent.If you are looking for something folk, something country, something Irish, something pretty, I recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I love Maura's voice and so it's a great disappointment to hear that glorious instrument wasted on the bland songs and rote arrangements of \\"Walls and Windows.\\" Especially since I was prepared by Maura herself to expect great things -- she said she had been inspired by Lucinda Williams's \\"Car Wheels\\" album and wanted to capture that sound. Well, she certainly did not capture the rootsy sound of \\"Car Wheels.\\" But I wouldn't have minded, because it's her wonderful way with a song, and her great taste in selecting them that's always been her strongest suit. But the songs here are all unmemorable, some of them just plain bad, except for a 35-year-old tune by Van Morrison, and even here she's not allowed to really stretch out. I can't imagine where she sees the \\"edge\\" in these songs. There isn't any edge here.

Be careful when tossing the outer cellophane wrap, since it lists the song titles of the four discs. You're lost without it! After my fiasco with opening this sharp-edged cube, I no longer had an interest in listening to the contents. The box is designed to accommodate at least 10-12 jewel cases, but instead you get grooved slots for 4 naked CDs, and the booklet! Design-overkill, and it doesn't even fit in my wall unit cases!

Although the design may attract curious kids, I wouldn't allow them to play with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great music, stupid packaging","review":"what \\"genius\\" decided to come up with this box? It literally took me a half hour to figure out how to open this up, and then the discs went flying. Fortunately, my reflexes are good so nothing was damaged, but I'm sort of afraid to mess with it. JazzTimes magazine gave it a \\"thumbs down\\" award, and said the box came with instructions for opening (mine had no instructions). Did Herbie himself have anything to do with this, or was it just Columbia? Isn't it enough of a problem having the money to buy this music (great as it is) without having to deal with these incredible packaging issues. A \\"digi-pack\\" would be far superior, and I wouldn't have to worry about disc safety, or where to put the damn thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Count me in re: consumer backlash...","review":"As with other reviewers, I've wondered what the record label has been thinking when it comes to these jazz boxed sets. The Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Charlie Christian sets...all issued in \\"deluxe,\\" \\"creative\\" packaging that comes up short, shorter, or shortest in the two areas most important to me when I purchase these collections (not counting the music itself, of course): safe storage of the discs and readable, organized liner notes. Well, this latest fiasco is the last straw. I have a long-running interest in Herbie Hancock's music and was interested in this boxed set...but I will not purchase it unless/until it gets reconfigured in a user-friendly package (hint: start with jewel boxes and leave the \\"innovations\\" to the musicians)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another no vote for the box","review":"This packaging is the worst I've seen. It took me ten minutes to get the thing open; and I couldn't stop the disks from rolling around inside and scratching.

No imagination!!! Every single sweater has a round neckline whether for the pullovers or for the two plain cardigans. Not a single v-neck, shawl collar, or square neckline at all. The shapes of every single sweater appears to be the same - square and boxy. All have the same plain, straight sleeve. The differences are in the yarn and nearly half are a rib stitch. The others are basic stockinette. If I could be so bold... please save your money and go to an on-line free pattern website for much cuter and infinitely more creative designs with instructions that are equally as clear. I give two stars because the basic shape is ok despite the fact that it is used throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!! What about those 4 stitches?!","review":"I love this book! As a fairly new knitter, I like the simple designs. However, I'm making my first project from this book, and found what I believe is a mistake. In the garter stitch side-to-side solid jacket, when dividing each side for front and back, it says to place 4 sts on a holder, then place the rest on another holder. It never does say what to do with those 4 stitches. If anyone knows, please do tell!! (BTW, I did check extensively on the pattern corrections page of the publisher, to no avail.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect instructions","review":"The instructions for the green sweater on the cover are WRONG! Row 1 says knit the whole row - it should say purl. My 80-year-old mother couldn't figure out why her sweater didn't look like the picture. Guess not if she knit a row that should have been purled.

This book is surely something I would recommend to any kid in the world for its combination of sadness and hard times with joyful and happy times. A hard and sad time is when a trumpeter swan named Louis finds out he has no voice. A joyful and happy time is when Serena, another trumpeter swan, falls deeply in love with Louis, and they get married. How E. B. White created a smooth transition from sad times to happy times made this book a definite masterpiece in my mind. A lesson I learned in this book was that if you keep at it, you can overcome practically anything. I think everyone should read this book because it is so good, don't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CAPTIVATING STORY!","review":"E.B White is indeed a remarkable children story writer. Trumpet Of The Swan tells the story of a swan borned mute. Though he was handicapped, he was hardworking in learning different skills such as writing to communicate with the others and especially playing the trumpet to pursue his love.

However, the exercises and routines are primarily for a person who has a trainer or knows someone with alot of time to kill. The majority of the exercises involve a second person assisting you.Maybe I just expected something much different, but the book is more for someone who is really training for MMA or BJJ competitions. People who compete at a higher level are probably much more likely to have \\"people\\" to help train them. I'm just a regular guy trying to get an edge.I did learn one thing from this book...

Diet, simple excercies, strethcing etc are what seperate the competitors from the champions.The book was general in most cases, but had some interesting comments on \\"bringing it all together\\".

I also found that this book was an excellent way to introduce the historical significance of the movement in India to do away with the caste system. A perfect book to read in a high school classroom.

I would question whether or not Monster truly changed his ways in the end. Or is he a Crip for life? Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I got lost somewhere around page 80. He tries too hard to sound intelligent. The writer dropped out of school and thinks he needs to prove his intellect with painfully large words and overuse of \\"forthcoming, whereas, per se, thus\\" and the use of \\"overstand\\" in place of understand and \\"for\\" in place of because. The writing wasn't interesting enough to keep me struggling through the language flow of the book. I had high hopes :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting portrayal of life as a gang member","review":"I found this book captivating with its portrayal of the violent life of an LA gang member. The author does an excellent job of illustrating the hardships youth must face when growing up in this corrupt environment. The main problem I had with this book was the fact that the author never seems to comprehend how his violent actions deeply affect the people he associates with and also society as a whole. For example during one of his many stays in prison he wonders why the guards treat him with such fear and resentment. Could it possibly be because he has shot and killed so many people. I was glad to read that his life of gang banging has finally come to an end, but I also feel that he should be punished for the numerous criminal activities he has been involved in. It is hard to applaud an author who has lead such a destructive and misguided life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never knew the harsh reality of gangs...","review":"This book was chosen for our book club this month.

Its sad Sanyika had to be born from a Monster in order to be transformed into something greater. No longer a criminal mind. Having read this book, and subsequently getting to know the author I am honored, and beyond impressed with what can take place in a mind, in a being. For the human spirit is ever enduring, and shall prevail in the face of adversity, strife and opposition. This is a HEAVY book. The faint of heart should not proceed and expect to see things the same old way you did before. I caution and encourage you to read this with an open mind and heart. You won't regret it, this is raw, and real. Things I've seen for myself having spent time in L.A. It doesn't get more honest than this.

Monster was awesome i loved it, its dark, rough, hardcore, no frills, brutal, gangsta, and a great read. If you don't overstand what its like to gang bang in South Central in the 80's this book will give you a glimpse in to the lifestyle of the people your parents told you were up to no good. This story takes you on a journey from the street of south central los Angeles through the eyes of Cody \\"Monster\\" Scott, to Calif. Youth Authority, to the streets again then to Fulsome Prison. This cat starts bangin at age 11, and does some crazy things through out his career. dont get it twisted hes no role model but is an inperation to change for the better.

Hopefully many will learn and choose a better life. Life without daily shooting and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster: what a character!","review":"This book is a quick read and is very interesting. The book shows the very violent life of an LA gang member and how and why he does things. This book is somewhat disturbing at times due to the violence and graphic scenes portrayed. It is easy to forget that this book is based on a true story. I wish it were a fiction story, then it would be less troublesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange reality","review":"I had to read Monster for one of my college courses. While reluctant to do so at first, I pretty much glided through the pages. The movies you've seen on the ghetto, the rap lyrics you've heard about the projects... well, they just don't compare to this! Brutality doesn't even begin to describe the lifestyles of these young gang members. Human nature at its worst. This book basically writes about an ongoing war within the concrete jungle that is being fought by teens, young adults and even pre-teens! It's a scary insight into the tragedy that is the American nightmare. Sometimes the book jumps from one section to another in a rather strange fashion, but it's still relatively easy to follow, unlike the alliances of the inner city gangs. A shocking book on a subject not many are willing to discuss. This is as close as one can get into the L.A. gang activity without being in harm's way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, no-apologies account of a gangster","review":"This book was quite good. For most chapters, I literally couldn't put it down. I was facinated by the straight-forwardness of it all. The author makes few apologies for his actions and I think it made the book a better read (after all, how do you apologize for causing so much misery to so many people). The only part that became tiresome was the \\"kill whitey\\" theme in the latter chapters. I certainly respect his opinion and his perspective, but this theme was a little overdone (in my opinion). It took away from quality of the story. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I always think that you can measure the quality of a book by how much you think about it when you are done. I think about this book quite a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares","review":"This book is all about some gang member who polluted LA.There is nothing REAL about this and everything he does is stupid.Smart people keep their noses clean and live in tough HOODS and have hard lives to live also.They grow up and don't spend time in prison and bragg about how tough they are because they carry a gun.Growing up in the HOOD don't mean you need to be a monster.Nothing but excuses and all they did was make living in America a worse place.All the dummys follow in there path.Put them in jail and keep them there, the world needs no more phony gangbangers...thats for sure.Hard luck...bull....Your just weak to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL NIGHT ALL DAY CRIPPIN IS THE ONLY WAY","review":"MONSTER KODY IS A LEGENDTHIS IS THE ENCYCLOPEDIA FOR CRIPS WORLDWIDEFIND OUT HOW HE BECAME KNOWN AS \\"MONSTA\\"IT DOESN'T GET ANY REALLA THAN THISTHE LIFETHE LEGENDMONSTA KODY"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good book","review":"the book was about a guy who was framed for merder. he had nuthin to do with the crime. his loyer thinks he is gilty and he is not. he is not guilty and he knows it. he is provn gilty not .i did not like it but if you like cort dramas then you will like it. it was kinda slow but it was ok. i would not recomend it to anyone who doesnt like skoo. i would not read it agin. read a different book"},{"rating":"2","title":"a story that should make you think","review":"This is an excellent memoir about a Crips gang member.

What you get with this book is not just an understanding of gang life but you can feel what the victims are feeling and what the offenders go through. You are in his shoes now, and he is blasting slugs at enemy gangsters from 5 feet away with a sawed off shotgun. It's so realistic it's almost as if you can feel the kickback of the shotgun. Those feelings will stay with you throughout the entire book. Monster is definitely for anyone who has never been around gang violence or wants to understand gang life without really experiencing it. This book did a tremendous job showing gang life and their battles. It will make you want to turn into a gangster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and insiteful","review":"This book opened my eyes to a world that I'd never imagined.

His committment and dedication to his set is equal to being a \\"squared away\\" soldier in an elite division of the armed forces. He chronicles the infancy of the LA street bloods and explains how young african-american boys are lured into the gang subculture. He explains the torturous initiation down to the \\"day to day\\" responsibility of being a gang member. After a number of years of \\"putting in work\\" and finally achieving \\"og\\" status, \\"Monster\\" Kody Scott evolves into Sanyika Shakur after spending time in the toughest penal institutions California has to offer. This book goes into great detail on how comitted Scott was to his gang. His dedication is admirable, but unfortunately his efforts were for the wrong cause. Gangs, in my humble opinion are for followers, and I also question the validity of Shakur's writing skills"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I have had an interest in gangs and their life style for a couples years. I had to write a 25 page paper for a class and I chose gangs as my topic. A friend had referred me to this book. I found it to be very educational. I seldom read for entertainment purposes. When I read this book, I could hardly put it down. It was so interesting. It gave me a different view of the gang world. It is a complete different world for them. It's all a survival game. This book does an excellent job in describing the life of a gang member. The process of joining, the activities during, and the lengths members go to gain respect and make a name for themselves. I would recommend to this book to anyone that has any curiousities or interest in gangs. I will read it over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Account of Gang Life","review":"I started this memoir with very high hopes. It started off good, but quickly dwindled after that. After watching several Kody Scott interviews, I found it extremely difficult to believe he actually wrote this book. I also felt he spent far too much time blaming society for his own flaws instead of taking responsibility for his heinous actions. It's easy to point the finger at parents, authorities and the LA Police Department, but what about HIMSELF? The memoir then becomes a pretentious account of gang life in LA. I didn't feel sorry for Kody Scott at any point, which is what I'm sure he wanted from the reader. Not buying it. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid","review":"This book (I use this loosely) is a vapid, self-serving waste of paper. Monster should have considered the destruction of the Amazon rain forest before putting this on paper. The childish use of \\"overstand\\" instead of understand is obnoxious. His division of America into three basic people groups springs from his self-contempt. His degredation of the police by using the outdated \\"pigs\\" evinces his hatred for the country that allows him to pay so little of a price for murder is beyond overstanding. According to his own words, he chose to be a thug, but he does not want to be held responsible for his evil behavior. It seems abundantly clear that his choice of religion failed to impress him; change of mind and heart is proof of one's beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is possiblew to turn yur life around","review":"Monster spent most of his life being stereotyped by others for being associated with a gang at a young age.

I enjoyed this book because it alerts people about gang violoence.

I just feel so sad that someone who had so much energy should direct all of it towards violence towards other people.What is it about the west side that turns kids into killers? Silly boys who think the answer to everything is violence. Where did it get young Mr Scott? A life sentence in prison, that's where.Scotts attempts to explain away his gang membership by stating that he was doing it to protect his 'hood. What absolute rubbish. He, like so many other impressionable young black men, like the perceived glory and excitement of the gang. Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best gang book","review":"This book is about a gang member who joiend the crips. His name is Monster, Kody Scoot. He kills alot of people, and goes to jail for killing some people. Monster did not kill these people because he was at another place killing people. Thats when things start getting really messed up. Some of the people from the gang start grtting killed by many of the differnt gangs. These are some of the reasons that this book is real good. I recomnd this book to anyone who likes action books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total BS","review":"I tried reading this book about a year and a half ago.

With that said, I wanted to say how deeply enthralled I was in this book and the incredible story of this man's life. Though I can't identify with the people in this book because I'm a middle class white guy, it gives an intimate look into what the inner-city black youth go through everyday. The strengh and loyalty of the people described in the book is remarkable. This is one aspect of American culture that has not recieved its share of exposure because the people best suited to tell it are so often in jail or dead. The events described may be violent and tragic, but they are as much a part of American history as the era of prohibition or the mafia of the 50's. The story needs to be told and so far, this is the best place to get that story."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book depicting real life in the 'hood of South Central","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Sanyika's narrative of his life growing up with the Eight Tray Gangters.He also sheds real life about the reality of prison gangs(BGF, AB, EME...) in our \\"correctional system\\". As one of his cell mates failed to realize (in the book), life in prison is very harsh, you not only do time, you enter a whole new subculture that harvests the criminal mentality.You simply cannot go to the pen and do your time and go home. Prisoners find new ways to hustle once back out on the street. Definitely an eye opening, riveting and honest look at the reality today.A must read for any one who's willing to open their eyes and look at the other side of the law, from a gansta's point of view. Props to Sanyika for being real and honest, even to the point of including his homies real names and criminal activities..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster Ego","review":"The introduction makes it seem like the book will be a self-aware portrait of a reformed gangbanger, but he's only really aware of his swagger and his ability to intimidate others.

In short, he ain't no Malcolm X."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"I had this book years ago and loaned it to somone. I was replacing it.

While not focusing on the dynamics of home until much later in the book, it is apparent that alittle more attention could have made a world of difference in Kody's life but...In terms of the book it is a very well written, edited and organized. Having read more than a few prison authored books, this one stands out due to the personality of the author. Unlike the titles which have followed Monster wasn't written with financial consideration as the driving force. Kody actually downplays his exploits and resists turning himself into a violent anti-hero in this book. It seems unconceiveable that his actual reputation and deeds could exceed what is contained on the pages but it is true. The book itself is the truth and nothing attests to this fact more than Kody's continuous legal and social struggles since the release of the book in 1992."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Insights","review":"Sanyika Shakur's remarkable text vividly reveals the author to be an articulate apologist for self-actualization without the embarrassing self-egoization recognizable in cinema actors, hit parade screamers, catwalk cretins, stammering sports stars and mumbling reality television mouthpieces. 'Monster' is the embellishment of that acclaimed LA Times article in 1998, in which Shakur briefly recounted the genesis of his gangland activities. 'I didn't know what I was gonna do after I left school in the third grade. First I tried the law but them bums always found me guilty, then I tried medicine but them tablets made me constipated. So I figured the gang stuff was my bag. The travel was good, I got to interact a lot and the Drive-By Committee gave me a free ghetto blaster'.'Monster' is the sort of book you read till you stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Required Reading","review":"I had to read this for my Juvenile Justice Class and it was one of the few required readings that I enjoyed.

I'm sure Sanyika has had a strong impact on many youth out there.I had to give it 4/5 only because I felt some parts of the book were written with a little bit too much ego and sounded too self serving. However, I would strongly recommend this book to parents, teens and young adults.I felt it was an important story and one that never gets told from the inside perspective!

He doesn't make it up. People need to know the risks, especially since the abortion industry is unregulated in comparison to other medical procedures, thanks to politics.I found the information in Lime 5 shocking and depressing. Women fought for the right to abort, and now that same obsession with that right has led to an unregulated industry with serious health consequences.Crutcher outlines these risks in this book extremely well, from the risk of death, sterility, breast cancer, even rape and sexual assault. It isn't a book to be read for pleasure, but it is necessary to be well informed. It is a must read on the issue of abortion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying and Thought provoking","review":"This book will make an impact on you. You will either love it or hate it. Those who hate it, tend to scream about the lack of solid evidence, but the fact is that the evidence is sufficient to point to Crusher's conclusions. The conspiracy I am sure is not organized. Rather, it is clear by this book that facts are being hidden, by a government which has neglected to adequately protect patients. The conspiracy is simply embarrassment.The abortion industry is, and has been an embarrassment to healthcare professionals for years, and the evidence in this book points to reasons why.This book is a unique perspective of the abortion issue. Women's health is a matter of concern, and it is clear, that some of the most incompetent health professionals work in this field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"This book lays out, plainly and factually, the enormously detrimental effects widespread abortion has on our country. Crutcher relies primarily on the statements of abortion providers themselves to give \\"inside\\" views of the abortion industry, and reveals shocking revelations about ethical lapses in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Above all, he lays bare the fact that the abortion industry is more about power and money than it is about any imagined \\"dignity\\" of American women which that very industry routinely disregards in abhorrent fashion. If you're \\"pro-choice\\" and \\"intellectually honest\\", don't hesitate to read this book: it's an illuminating factual story without preaching or pretense. If you don't want to know the facts, I suggest picking up some Planned Parenthood press release instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much","review":"I've never had much of an opinion on abortion either way. I bought this book because of a college term paper on the pros and cons of abortion. Crutcher is undoubtedly anti-abortion, there is no doubt about that. Some of the sources are good. Others, however, are second-hand editorials that are highly questionable. He dug very deep to find about 120 or so deaths from abortion during the last thirty years, not mentioning that 40 million women have had abortions during that time--and have not died from it--and not to mention that nine times more women have died from an appendectomy. There is therefore no attempt to document all sides of the equation here--this is hardly an objective account. Sure, it makes for sensationilist reading. But if anything, Lime 5 is a ironic testimony on the safety of abortion during the last thirty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innacurate statistics lead to innacurate science.","review":"Although the medical odds of dying from a legal abortion are 1 in 123,333, Crutcher has us believe that this is the only medical procedure where things go wrong.Conviently ignored is the higher mortality rate of childbirth or getting your wisdom teeth incised before they break the surface.Both procedures also entail some amount of surgery, although they are presumed completely safe for every woman.Of course, he makes no reference to the millions of women who have risked their life pre-Roe to obtain an aboution from those who were not doctors, but this is typical of so many exposes of \\"legal abortion gone wrong\\" In reality the complication rate from a legal abortion is comparable to other medical procedures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous claims from a would be ambulance chaser","review":"Crutcher goes back to 1968 to make his claims about PAS.

They seemed a wonderful gift idea, and I bought one for each of my pets and as gifts for a friend. The problem is that they are very poorly made. I have purchased 4 of these in the \\"natural\\" color. Every single one of the frames has fallen apart. Hang them on the wall and the cheap wood and poor construction can't handle the weight of the glass - the four pieces of wood that make the frame will begin to seperate from one another after less than a month and send the whole thing crashing to the floor. As soon as it hits the floor, the frame breaks off into four seperate pieces and you will be left with a mess. Wood glue and reinforcing with brackets doesn't work as the cheap wood just splits.If they were about half the price, I'd recommend buying them for the paw print kit, matting, etc, and purchasing a box frame seperately. But for $30 + shipping, these things are an incredible rip-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice gift for a dog lover.","review":"I gave this to my brother for his birthaday and he loved it.

It even had the mass in latin on the left hand pages! I expected this missal to be the same just updated with the changes. Boy was I wrong! No latin and the mass isn't as easy to follow as in the older missal. It would have bee nicer if it were leather bound and more compact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Edition","review":"I purchased this for my husband and we are now getting one for his father. It is a handsome edition and has lots of great features already listed in the previous review. My husband and I appreciate the short writings telling us what the readings are about each week...kind of a mini-homiliy. It is very easy to read and understand and helps you to participate in the Mass more fully. This book is good for a number of years as it lists the three-year cycle and you look up where we are in the liturgical calendar rather than only getting the Missal for one year at a time. I highly recommend this Saint Joseph edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This missal is incorrect","review":"The description says the missal contains the text that will go into effect the first Sunday of Advent 2011.

Just imagine my surprise upon picking this up and finding a spectacular classic. Kuprin does indeed tread that fine line between cheese and morality (both being boorish methods of storytelling) to create a truly human picture of Russian society. If you are interested in the glorification of vice and youthful indiscretions, please reread Burroughs, Miller or Selby. Likewise, if you are interested in moral high ground, stick to Tolstoy. Here, Kuprin deftly defies the clich��s to create not only a wonderful illustration of Russian life but a great story as well.

Rachmaninoff, while writing with typical brilliance, avoided repeating himself and offering another \\"Symphony No. 2\\" by choosing daring orchestration, especially the breathtaking use of the alto sax as the solo instrument in the first dance and the piano as tuned percussion. The effect is dazzling. This is a top-notch recording and makes one wonder why Eiji Oue didn't hit the big time at one of America's major orchestras instead of returning to Japan. A beautiful program expertly recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Audio Quality","review":"I enjoy symphonic music and I found it to be a passionate and precise Rachmaninoff piece, but I purchased this because several audiophiles raved about the exceptional fidelity of this recording.Robert Harley discussed this as an exemplary recording.

Those songs are not even what most people would consider \\"real freestyle\\". The irony is that those two songs are the worst songs I ever heard and I love freestyle. Most of the rest of the album sounds like some wannabe pop music. The only positive aspect is the dj production on the house tracks. It sounds almost as if TKA sabatoged their own music--like they're not even trying. TKA is capable of much more. It may not be completely their fault.

I don't mean to knock them but its not what it use to be. I actually won tickets to see a Freestyle concert in the Tommy Hilfiger stadium in Long Island in 8/03 and everyone sounded wonderful but I felt sorry for Kayel, His voice was raspy and not great. He might have had a cold or something that day but it was a sad evening because the magic is gone. This cd was ok.

Also the battery life for the useless flashlights included in this package is very small compared to LED lights (which are brighter than these.) Also, these flashlights require expensive batteries to power up. This is very costly... I find myself confused by the amount of powerful batteries needed in order for these flashlights to shine their very dim light.Save yourself in the future and some money right now by not purchasing these.

The reason why you should try to purchase this book online (because it's out of print in english as you can see) is because it is genuinely a beautiful book.

If that's the kind of character you were expecting, you will be immensely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie was not a comedy, nor did it provide a compelling story line nor insights into the characters nor the human condition. And many of the characters were not likeable.

This it does by further perpetuating the cultural meme of successful, savvy, sensible, or principled women versus their imbecilic, directionless male counterparts. The residual memetic \\"implant\\" of this film, and scores of others like it, is the notion that women have evolved into creatures vastly superior to men, the latter of whom are still mired is their vestigial, knuckle-dragging ways. This is also reflected in the manner in which men are often portrayed as feckless dullards in commercials and TV shows whenever a couple or family are involved. This is clownish entertainment for the feeble-minded and those of you who find this sort of film amusing do nothing more than celebrate your own enslavement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, but at least it is annoying.","review":"I will review the first 45 minutes of this drab film because after 45 minutes I gave up on finding any entertainment value. Every character managed to turn my stomach. There's more than one disgusting idiot and they are not the least bit funny. If that is entertaining to you, spend your money.You may ask, Lee since this movie sucked so bad why did you give it two stars instead of one? Well, there were some nice bare tits in the film and that always merits an extra two stars. Now you may ask, but Lee! That would mean a total of three stars not two. Why oh why was a star deducted? That's easy, graphic male homosexual action always results in at least a two star deduction. In this movie, the graphic girl on girl action added back a star resulting in my two star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time is to precious to spend it watching this nonsense!","review":"Time is to precious to spend it watching this nonsense!

That being said, this video was not what I expected. In the beginning it was a little sad. I was ready to laugh and I immediately felt sorry for Mr. Rudd's character and was ready to feel that way throughout the movie. Thank goodness this wasn't the case. The movie is about family. We don't choose them, we don't always like them. But in the end we cannot deny our love for them. And, no matter how deeply that love is buried it's there and will quickly make its way to the surface when that love is all that's left. That's what this movie is about. It is very funny, very moving and will remind you of how precious family really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant couple of hours","review":"Although this probably deserved 3 stars, I gave it 4 because there is just something about Paul Rudd that makes me want to like it. Paul Rudd brings any movie into your living room and relates it to all the average minutes we spend with friends that aren't over the top.Then to add in Zooey and Liz? Forgetaboutit!Will make you go to bed with a smile. What more do you want for a few bucks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming comedy","review":"This is a really charming comedy. Everything is good about this film. An excellent cast delivers all solid performance. Paul Rudd is very good in the lead role. And, all the female stars are fun to watch. The script is good. Directing is good. It makes for an entertaining hour and a half. However, there is nothing memorable or Oscar worthy about this movie.

Combining that with a cast that I enjoy watching (Paul Rudd, Zooey Deschanel, Elizabeth Banks & Adam Scott), left me with some very high hopes. Unfortunately the movie didn't live up to those expectations.To me there's a difference between a movie and a film. Typically, I prefer movies to films as I don't have a vote for the Oscars so generally I enjoy being entertained. This movie, while certainly funny at times, felt more like a film to me.

When the trailers were shown long ago, I figured it would be one of these popcorn, Saturday afternoon with nothing to do kinda movies to watch, nothing special but nothing to criticize. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy a single scene of this movie. Not one laugh. Rudd was OK in the role of his innocently naive character, but his clumsiness that seemed to get him and his family in trouble with every mistake -- which would usually be a funny setup -- didn't elicit any laughter. Pass on this one if you are looking for something to kick back and watch for humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zen and the Art of Underachievement","review":"I'm still waiting for this one to go somewhere. With a loaded cast and a simple, engaging direction, it's got the right pieces in place to build a sleepy, optimistic comedy about the nice guy (a very dude-like Paul Rudd) who almost always finishes last. Instead, it wastes most of its time egging on the self-centered, spoiled women around him, basking in the glow of their vapid, hollow lives while they carelessly take advantage of his somber situation. It's humorous at heart, if not particularly funny, and often steps away just as things seem to be about to turn the corner and erupt into wild chaos. The only thing more depressing than watching Rudd's poor, well-intentioned, passive hippie get repeatedly stomped into the mud is seeing how insufferably predictable the plot can become. A total paint-by-numbers watercolor job that doesn't seem to mean the happy message it throws up on-screen before the credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much more than you think","review":"The previews really play up the comedic aspects of this movie, but it is so much more.

Very philosophical about family values."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I cannot believe that there are so many good reviews on this movie! Paul Rudd does not even play the character that well. I mean is he supposed to be just a dumb pot head or a seriously mentally challenged person with a low IQ? He seems too articulate to be either, but what do I know. It isn't even funny one bit and I was shocked that a few good actors were in this and were not that good. Zoey being a die-hard lesbo was a shock and let down too but I guess I will get over it...lol. Seriously though, you could not pay me to own this idiotic movie. Wish I could have back those 90 or so minutes of my life. I would rather watch Warren Beatty's worst movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain & simple: boring","review":"Nope. Didn't do anything for hubby & me. We were hoping for a little bit of sunshine from this movie. However, unlike other reviews that wanted 90 minutes of their life back, we both fell fast asleep.

Nighty, night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zooey Deschanel Has No Class","review":"The opening scene with Zooey trying to be a comedian is so lame. One of the worst below-the-belt performances of all time. I liked her in Elf and Bridge too.In fact all the performances are clueless, animialistic with no morals or values. I reject the lack of intelligence and promiscuous conditioning.

Compared to other Indie movies like it, it was about a 2.5 stars. There is humor but it wasn't funny. The movie was about the sisters lives and not the brother. He was used as a catalyst to: expose a bad marriage, reflect on career choices and reflect on relationship choices. The innocent brother could have been replaced with: the spunky kid, the grumpy grandfather, the in your face dog, and so on. We like Paul Rudd and that's why we ordered the movie. It wasn't his best work. He was cute and innocent but that doesn't carry a movie. All in all, we were disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny As I thought It Would Be!","review":"I honestly thought this movie was going to be alot funnier!

After changing the seat (usual crap - just like most outdoor bikes) to something that actually fits human sit bones, I was off. Great adjustability, the handlebars provide many positions, both aero-style & roadie/mountain, and the clip/no clip pedals saved me from having to buy more SPDs.Great workouts, sturdy build, enough chrome & paint so sweat doesn't tarnish/rust every surface after 10 minutes.good stuff.

I agree with the previous writer who states that this CD should have been released early last year to be considered a hit. Sorry Louie, maybe next time you should wait until the music executives give the \\"go ahead\\" to mix new songs.

I was content with it for quite some time... but then I started buying their albums. To be honest, I would suggest buying \\"Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness\\" instead. It's one of the most complete albums I've ever heard and it seems like more of a greatest hits collection than this. Of course, with that you wouldn't hear songs like \\"Today,\\" \\"Disarm\\" and \\"Cherub Rock,\\" which is a reason to buy this, I suppose. And one of the bonus unreleased songs \\"Real Love\\" is a good enough reason by itself. All in all, it's a decent collection of songs.

For one thing, where are 'Rocket', 'Thirty-Three' and 'TEITBITE'? Also, I think they could have chosen a better contribution from Pisces Iscariot. Yes, I know it was a collection of b-sides, but it did have original material on it too. 'Frail and Bedazzled' would have been great on this compilation - classic Pumpkins - instead of 'Landslide', which was a b-side and a cover.Anyway, that's my little gripe.

The Smashing Pumpkins are a great band. Many of there albums are packed with amazing songs, and in this CD the best ones are all included and jampacked in an hour or so (don't know how long it runs). I mean, it is just instant classic after instant classic. There isn't a single bad song. I always feel weird if I have the greatest hits album of a band and then want to buy more. But, with The Smashing Pumpkins, I really felt like I had to, and I have discovered many more great Pumpkins songs. So, not only will you be buying an incredible CD, you will (hopefully), be launched into the entire Pumpkin Legacy or at least buy \\"Siamese Dream\\" and \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\".

It spans from the early works of Gish up until the very end. You even get a little nugget called \\"Eye\\", which is a great tune taken from the Lost Highway soundtrack (Adore outtake). Either way, all of the hits are there and then some. The second disc entitled \\"Judas O\\" is a little gem in its own. Much like Pices Iscariot, you have outtakes and B-sides on the entire disc. Judas O spans the Mellon Collie era up to the \\"un-officially\\" released Machina 2. If you are looking for a worthy sampler that spans the pumpkins career, check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva le Pumpkins","review":"This is an excellent album (the two disc) for any fan of the Pumpkins. Billy C and company in my humble opinion was the best the 90's had to offer by far. Musically speaking I can not think of another mainstream band that were as talented as they were. Compared to today's garbage (trapt, cold, nickelback, etc) it far exceeds todays so called \\"rock\\". Billy's voice is an acquired taste, but he does have very good control, and if you give it a chance, you can see the talent and flexibility of the entire band. Very versatile,excellent band. Pumpkins please come back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherub Rock...need I say more?","review":"This cd of their greatest is wonderful! Billy Corgan's voice can go from soothing and sweet like in songs like \\"Landslide\\" and \\"1979\\", or hard and powerful like in \\" Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" and \\"Zero\\". This band has made the sound of grunge music evolve into something pure. Something with out a name, it just is. The Smashing Pumpkins will always be a magnificiant band in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation, but here's what should have been:","review":"1. I Am One2. Siva3. Drown4.

I burn CDs with \\"Disarm\\" on it as a \\"soundtrack\\" to my favorite book. But I'm not a hardcore fan. I wasn't about to go out, buy all the albums, buy the singles, buy the bootlegs...That's why this collection is great. It's all their hit stuff that you crank up on your drive home, but it's also a lot of unreleased goodies that give you something new and spectacular to listen to.I would highly recommend this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially Enjoy Listening to \\"1979\\"","review":"I recently heard \\"1979\\" on the radio. I discovered it was recorded by this particular group. I bought the CD specifically for that song. The other pieces are not within my music genre. I plan to give the CD to a family member for his 90's music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top ten desert island disc","review":"Let me preface this glowing review by saying that I have never been much of a Smashing Pumpkins fan. Before buying this, the only disc I owned was the brilliant Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. I was luke warm to the rest of their productions, but this collection of hits, b-sides, and rarities has made me a believer. Every track on both cds has that rare quality of being artistic, edifying, powerful, and listenable all at the same time. There are few bands who can be so original and radio-friendly as the Pumpkins. True, there are some great songs absent on this--thirty-three, ordinary, bodies, spaceboy--but there is more good material here than we're entitled for such an inexpensive price. There are some great new or rare songs--untitled, set the ray to jerry, because you are, and waiting--that make this a very comprehensive, diverse, qualitative compilation. It will be among the best discs in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go for 'Siamese Dream' instead","review":"It's a matter of personal taste with the Pumpkins, because all their albums have a distinct sound, but if you ask me they set an impossibly high standard with Siamese Dream, and the rest of this collection just sounds weak compared to Cherub Rock. A lot of it has to do with the strange turn for the alternative/goth/ antirock that defined Adore, that I find completely unappealing. I also think a few of the best songs from Dream, like Geek USA and Mayonaise, should definitely have been included here. What if Green Day only put one song from Dookie on their greatest hits? What if Pearl Jam's didn't have Jeremy or Alive? Would you still buy them?'Rotten Apples' still provides a good anthology of the Pumpkins from all their eras, but it's debatable whether any of the songs from Mellon Collie forward are as good as the weakest song on Siamese Dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one thing wrong with this...","review":"Yes. This masterpiece of a collection is everything you could expect and more, what with all of the greatest S-P songs put together on one disk, plus a bonus of other rare gemities. Just one problem though. Does anyone remember the soundtrack from the movie 'Singles'? That's where you can find the original version of 'Drown' and it's much, much, much better there. On 'Rotten Apples' they have cut off several minutes of jamming, wailing and droning instrumentals from this song. I found that to be very disappointing. Maybe I'm being a little too harsh. Maybe not. For that mis-step, 4 stars instead of five. Otherwise, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Saget-","review":"I am a long time smashing pumpkins fan. However, I'd like to aim this review more towards a response to Bob Saget's ill-conceived comments. Well we'll start here - \\"who augments a 3 chord?\\" Anybody playing in diatonic harmony to a melodic or harmonic minor scale - that's who. Your suggested substitutes are completley worthless - they share virtually no harmony, with the excetion of the 5 chord - (if you are using the five from the relative major - it would be the 7 in a minor key). As for the meter, frankly it's their song. Regardless, note that the most complex chord in the song is a sus4, there seems to exist no augmented 3. \\"Sounds like you're in preschool theory\\"...you mean the one you slept through?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairly Complete Hits Compilation","review":"This hits collection covers the huge hits the Pumpkins had, but leaves out the little hits and some of their best songs (Thirty-Three, I Am One, Rocket, Try Try Try, Mayonaise, The End Is The Beginning Is The End). I could've lived without Eye, Real Love, and Landslide, too. The 2-disc version is out of print now, which really blows. Another complaint: they edited Rhinocerous and Drown. But overall, it's pretty good for a greatest hits disc (and for the price)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest","review":"Now mind you... this is the greatest hits cd. The Smashing Pumpkins require a certain taste. You must aquire the liking for them...it just doesn't come naturally. So you must have been a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins from the beginning...so have your opinion but I believe that Rotten Apples is an awesome Smashing Pumpkins cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the bonus disk","review":"This CD is nothing compared to the bonus cd that came with it, called \\"Judas O\\". They are like A sides and B sides. It features a shorter version of Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right) which doesn't include the high pitched noise ending. I don't think of it as a greatest hits album because it doesn't have \\"Ugly\\" or \\"Mouths Of Babes\\" from \\"The Aeroplane Flies High\\" Boxed set, or tracks like \\"The End Is The Beginning Is The End\\". You may want to get this one just to update the sound quality of the tracks you already have. For instance, this set was produced in 2001 and the track called \\"Eye\\" was produced back in 1996."},{"rating":"1","title":"EDITED???","review":"Is anyone elses Rotten Apples cd edited?I was visiting my local Walmart and saw this album there. I was about to buy it when I noticed that it said (EDITED) on the top of the cd case. So I ended up not buying it there, and decided to check here on Amazon. I found it and was excited because it didn't say anything about being edited. So I bought it, but when it arrived in the mail...it was...EDITED!!!The Pumpkins are great and this album deserves a 5 star rating, but not in an edited form. I hope that Amazon will return my item or let me exchange it for an unedited one or a different album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ko..//","review":"Another pointless compilation. I like the Pumpkins early stuff like \\"Gish\\" or \\"Siamese Dream\\", but after \\"Mellon Collie..\\" they didnt make anything special. \\"Adore\\" wasnt a bad album but it wasnt a very good album either, and \\"Machina...\\" I wish they had never released. This compilation only includes two songs from Gish, which is a shame. The songs \\"Rhinoceros\\" and \\"Drown\\" has been shortened which I dont like. \\"Disarm\\" which is, in my opinion, the most aweful song on \\"Siamese Dream\\" is included while other great songs from that album are absent. There are no songs from \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" either. I dont see what \\"Eye\\" and that \\"previously unreleased\\" song are doing on a best of compilation, none of them is exactly \\"best of\\" material."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the love?","review":"Where is 33? I'm actually pretty satisfied with thier compelation of songs,but it can't be called a greatest hits if it does't have all the hits! There are 2 songs off of the Batman & Robin soundtrack that should've made it to this cd. However, they were not there. All in all this cd is a must buy, but without all the hits, it can only have one star from this critic."},{"rating":"2","title":"You wont regret it. Buy it now!","review":"Every song is amazing.

A diminished 2nd would have worked much better, or at least a 5th. I feel like i'm in preschool music theory class when i listen to the CD. They weren't even advanced enough to use a compound meter. This makes \\"Chopsticks\\" look like a masterpiece. They grow like a malignant vegetable in the darkness. Just as a child must eat its vegetables, one must forcefully listen to this CD. Consequently, a child is punished while they wait for the sun to go down with only vegetables remaining on their platter. Scars.

Just beware of the stink to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Album!","review":"If you've ever found yourself wondering about Smashing Pumpkins and don't own any of their stuff, you MUST get this double release. The first disc contains many of their hits and more popular fare, most of which you'll recognize from the radio/MTV. It's the second disc that makes this worth the money. Here is your oppurtunity to own some of the greatest music Billy Corgan has written. If you do not already regard him as one of the greatest rock songwriters of our time, these songs WILL forever change that. \\"Lucky 13\\" and \\"Marquis in Spades\\" showcase the raw power and intensity that made Smashing Pumpkins famous, as does \\"Mouths of Babes\\". Corgan's love of melody and beauty is evident in songs like \\"Set the Ray for Jerry\\" and \\"the Last Song\\". But the centerpiece of this recording is the epic \\"Aeroplane Flies High\\". My God. If you're familiar with Pumpkin's tracks like \\"Starla\\" or \\"Drown\\", you are in for a real treat. Painful, in that lovely way only Smashing Pumpkins do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most popular pumpkins","review":"The smashing pumpkins have always produced varied styles of music, from the most Screching and heavy metal to pretty little ballads. This is an album of their greatest hits, which unsurprizingly are the most radiofreindly and feel good tunes. None of which however are middle of the road, all have that quality which ensures they mantain their freshness over the years. This album does not attempt to chronicle the pumpkins progression in musical styles (Which in fact takes them away from the mainstream). This album is perfect for somebody unfamiliar to the pumpkins to ease themselves into a whole other world of music which the pumpkins have produced over ten years.How do we judge how good a record is? Is it how it makes us feel? no, rather how much it makes us feel. This album will make you feel alive, a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMASHING CD!","review":"THIS is a great cd and if you got the limmited edition you will love this cd!I didnt but it has all the hits from them!

Best about the book? It shows that depression, which we all go through to some extent or other, is not to be suppressed, or feared--but rather grappled with and, even, embraced. And so Mr. Shenk ably shows how Lincoln's well-documented but largely forgotten experiences with depression became the source of his great reservoirs of strength over the course of the War Between the States. His experiences with depression also became the source of his empathy, his humor, his ability to feel and experience life fully. And so Mr. Shenk's novel approach knocks other historical biographies out of the park--he goes way beyond, or beneath, dates and names and places...to what it's all about: our human experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"just wonderful","review":"such a good book ,I think it gives us a glimpse at his life that was fill with a lot of sadness .Its a must to read for anyone ..its not dry but a eye opener and you will see the human that Lincoln was ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Approach: More Psychology than Politics","review":"While Lincoln is the focal point in this book, the work also looks at his friends, family members, and other creative writers: Herman Melville, to name one.

I have since seen this standard droped but this one is an absolute disaster. I wish I could have my money back because this is not worth paying a penny for. There were 2 or 3 songs in there that are manageable, I 'll say who ever compiled the videos has bad taste. This is the 1st WOW DVD that I know of and one would expect it to be an absolute hit rather it is the opposite. It feels like the whole compilation was made in a haste without considering the different audience that it attract. Most of the songs are rock like artist, surely 2 would be Ok but not to the tune of 5 or 6.

Another great song is \\"Existence\\" by Kevin Max. There is no DC Talk or Jars of Clay this year, but they are well-represented. Dan Haseltine is heard in a song from City on a Hill and all three members of DC Talk are here with their solo projects. It's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Severe disappointment","review":"WoW has always catered towards the more popular groups, but this time was too much. I love all three dc Talk solo albums, but why put one song by each member? Then other groups get overlooked.I also had many of the songs already, so I didn't think it was worth it to get the remaining tunes.I would say this is a good sampler of the popular Christian market. However, some of the song choices are strange and aren't the artist/band's greatest hit.I wouldn't give this CD much for creativity and surprise (other than a few strange choices that are supposedly last years \\"hit songs\\"); musically it represents the most popular in Christian music. And that is what WoW has always done in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a way to bring Christian Music up to speed!","review":"This CD is a ministry to all of those who buy it. MTV said that Pop Christian music is the fastest rising genre of music in the industry, and WOW proves it! I got this for my birthday, and love it. I read some reviews about it, some people complained about it being too pop oriented and not diverse enough. But arn't you sick of the funeral durdge songs that you sing in church? I guess those people expect Christian music to not keep up with the times and the popular trends...and I guess that's fine, this CD isn't for them. But if you're sick of hymes, get this, it's great to listen to in the car, or at home. Afterall, God didn't say that we couldn't praise and dance at the same time!

From the first moment, late in the pregnancy, that they suspect something might not be perfect about their unborn baby, the Stinsons agonize about being deprived of what they want. There is no sense at all, at any point, that they recognize Andrew as a person. It's all about them -- about being in control, about being deferred to, about wanting *their* lives to be as they planned them to be. Andrew, by virtue of his prematurity, throws a monkey wrench into their plans and as such is an obstacle to be overcome, not a child to be loved.Yes, it's frightening and confusing and bewildering to have a baby in a NICU. Only sacrificial love for the child can make the ordeal bearable for a parent. Lacking that capacity, all the author can do is feel sorry for herself. And pity parties make poor reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disapointment","review":"This was a great disapointment. I have used learn spanish in your car and found it very useful.

The book has some interesting recounts of some of the methods deployed by former narcotic syndicates and how they attempted to launder their many millions of illict proceeds. (Beware; most of the examples of former schemes deployed (ie the Andonian Brothers-La Mina) are well dated, pre-FINCEN and internet self-banking). In sum, the book discusses everything from a broad overview of the bank secrecy act, other revelant U.S.C. statutory provisions with respect to money laundering, specific form documents (ie CTRs,), and the use of foreign exchanges(legal and black market) to launder illict narco proceeds.

It picks up light dust, but does not do well with large particles or hair.

Stand-out songs include: You're Not The Only One, Laugh To Keep From Cryin', Tore Down Flat In Jackson, and, for those quieter moods, A Matter Of Time. The band sometimes still performs \\"Jackson\\" in shows. I, for one, would like to hear Laugh to Keep From Cryin' played more - it's still one of the great early examples of Bret Alexander's lyric-writing prowess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!

I'm a professional mom who has relied too many years on eating out and convenience foods due to lack of time and picky eaters.

Most everything in THIS book, my family WILL eat and I CAN cook, plus there is the money saving feature. There are plenty of good ideas to answer that nagging question of what to cook. I made a shopping checklist on my computer based on the pantry item list in the introduction of the book. The shopping list helps me insure that I will most likely have on hand whatever I need for last minute cooking needs.Since the book covers everything the authors feed their family, a few extremely basic recipes are properly included; but this is not the rule and definitely not a reason to discredit the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you're searching for a place to start....","review":"I have had this book for a long time, and while it is no longer useful to me (I've learned a lot since then) I think it would be good for someone just starting to learn to save money, cook healthy, etc. I have learned to be frugal, shop wisely and cook almost everything from scratch. BUT -- for 12 years I was a single working mother with absolutey no idea how simple it was to shop, cook and eat this way. I would have loved for someone to give me an alternative to fast food and convenience foods way back then. Not everyone knows all of the 'simple' recipes or even how to cook - especially when you are overloaded with work, kids, etc. If you don't know better, cooking from scratch can seem overwhelming and time consuming.

I found the Tightwad Gazette books and especially Miserly Moms to be better values. I was disappointed to see recipes for baked potatoes, oatmeal and french toast. These recipes are so fundamental, I couldn't believe that they were included (you can always read the directions on the oatmeal container).In addition, if the type on the introduction wasn't so large, the intro probably would have taken up only 10 pages. It seemed as though they were trying to take up space to generate more pages.I use many of the recipes in this book and they are very good. If this book cost closer to $10, I would give it 3 or 4 stars, I simply think it is overpriced for the info you get.

And no lessons on Grammar. Since that is all there is to the method, I find it quite repetetive.There are no excersizes, no tests, nothing other than listen and repeat.This CD-ROM might be useful if you have already learnt French formally a while ago, and you want to freshen up your skills.

I've tried many other brands and I was bored. I enjoy studying now. It has real French conversations as opposed to actors playing roles who sound too rehersed. The conversations are also written down and you can see and practice the difference between what is on the paper and what you hear! They make you understand what you hear by using colors, which is very convenient. The method, which makes you repeat the dialog, has already improved my ability to understand and speak French, in no time. It's clear and efficient. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully misleading.","review":"Not bad if you're just working on accent, but there is no attempt at grammar or even the meaning of what you are saying. It provides you with (awfully low quality) videos of people being interviewed in French. Then it plays it back slowly for you. You also see the text in French and English. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it would be a valuable tool for honing accent and speaking French, but that's all it seems good for.

This ones is enjoyable, but not quite as good as her last two novels - The Hellion and Lord of Scoundrels.The characters in Miss Wonderful are fun, though. The dialogue is whitty and quick and you do feel attached to them, but for some reason the spark is not as bright as her previous books.It is definitely worth taking a look at, so please give it a try. If you do, read her other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining.","review":"This book is not as good as Lord of Scoundrels or Mr. Impossible, but it is still a good read. Both leads are very likeable. Alastair Carsington is sympathetic as a troubled Waterloo veteran. He is trying to regain his confidence by helping a friend to pursuade a small town to let a canal run through it. It will connect to the friend's mine in which Alastair has invested all of his remaining funds. Mirabel Oldridge is the daughter of the largest and most influential property owner in the area and she has a troubled past of her own. She is vehemently against the building of the canal and the unwanted changes it would bring. Mirabel is refreshingly direct and Alastair is amazingly sweet as they fall in love despite their opposing positions on the canal project. The book is a little slow in the middle, and there is too much discussion of the project. However, the ending is quite good and so is the humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I tried to like this book, but it was just so boring. There was no...life in it. No passion.

I laughed out loud several times and it was just perfect with dialog and reaction in so many areas. I know that romances have sex (usually) and I was grateful that the scenes were brief and not overly explicit. I was just thinking that I wouldn't have to worry about it when it popped up (later pages around 190 or so I think). I could always do without these but then where would the market for them be. I really liked that our heroine was so smart and dressed dowdy on purpose. I really enjoyed how she got our hero out of his shell and helped him with the challenges of his disability and depressed episodes. I even enjoyed seeing how her father realizes he's got a depression issue and that has been what's been holding him back since the death of her mother. The conflict with a former employee lead to some pretty intense situations but of course there is resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loretta Chase is always a winner!","review":"Classic Loretta Chase humor, a flawed but honorable hero, and a proud, lively heroine.

The signature poetry of Cave has been flourishing in recent efforts toward more mature and consciously intense musical effect of \\"The Boat Man's Call\\" and \\"No More Shall We Part\\". \\"Nocturama\\" is a bit of an anti-climax in Nick Cave's late career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babe, the song is too long!","review":"\\"Babe I'm On Fire\\" goes on and on for fifteen minutes. Good Lord, how many times does he repeat the chorus? He could've and should've smashed it out in three minutes letting all the avant garde elements roar the whole time. It really ruins the record. I have nothing against a long song but a long song that stays in one place like that is just torture. It brings to mind 'Cream Live'. Babe, the fire went out twelve minutes ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed bag","review":"I have to agree with an earlier review here. I've been listening to Nick Cave for many years, since Let Love In really. The first four songs are fabulous, from soft emotive ballads he is famous for to the wonderfully raucous \\"feel good\\" Bring It On (somewhat uncharted teritory for Nick I'd say).The rest of the album however, is a dissapointment to me, not terribly accessible (hey, I'm all for artist evolution, not autistic convolution).This album came out pretty soon after NMSWP, come on Nick, don't drop the standards just to get the albums out quicker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Collection of heartfelt music","review":"This is an awesome album.

He always strikes an overall balance between mysteriously dark and brooding WHILE beautiful and hopeful.That unmistakable rich baritone matches such deep lyrical content. I'm perplexed by the genius of one who moves so smoothly between tales of ultimate love and the romance of death and even murder. It's like a vicarious trip into a variety of delectable and despicable vices with an often safe return.Though his stance of drunkenness and obsession with murder fantasies make me want to push him over, I'll still be listening as he falls...He's still such a force to be reckoned with; that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce Springsteen releases album under the alias Nick Cave!!","review":"Nick, old boy, you're not on fire, you're burnt. 1 star for old times sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!","review":"Nick Cave had some of the greatest albums of the last ten years. Then this. Wonderful Life is quite good and He Wants You is fine. However, my problems come with the \\"rock\\" songs. Bring It On is completely uninspired as is Right Out of Your Hand. My biggest qualm is with the (and I can't believe I'm saying this for any Nick Cave song) truly horrible \\"Babe, I'm on Fire\\". 17 minutes of the same verses. This is the only 17 minute song that probably took 17 minutes to write. My feeling on this CD is that someone told him to try and mix the new sound of his prior, truly wonderful recordings with his old sound. This mixture leads to a bunch of poorly written songs that seem quite forced. However, every artist has a bad album here and there.

I was so hesitant that I didn't listen to this effort until my husband strongly urged me to do so a few weeks after its purchase. And I am so glad I did! I love the tender beauty of Cave's musical talent, backed up by the ever-supportive Bad Seeds. I love how their music continues to evolve, and how they sound as though they are a band that not only enjoys making music together, but also love the continued opportunity to work together.From the beginning to the end, each track reflects a genuine talent and the individuality of each band member. I believe there is something for everyone on this offering.

I also use them when I teach about conflict in my Interpersonal Communication 101 class. He goes beyond the standard advice, which most of my students already know (things like \\"don't loose your temper\\") and helps couples deal with the situations we actually find ourselves in (things like we do loose our tempers, its actually normal, and so now what?)I found his use of examples very helpful, his approach heartening, and his suggestions practical, and though it takes willingness and commitment, they have really paid off.

The build quality and material looks just as good and it fits perfectly. I wonder if this Denso product could actually be the OE.

However, this movie is now at the top of my favourite movie list. What I love about this movie is the young man's resilience, determination and his ability to form a relationship with all he encountered. I love that he was humble enough to ask for help and brave enough to stand by his beliefs - and never falter. I am twice this young man's age and his perception of life and how to live it puts my own perception to shame.

I realize now that I made a bad decision. Pyne jumps all over the place in his writing, there is no clear linear track to the chapters while discussions jump from prehistoric people to European colonization.

The CD is, as the title implies, an hour-long talk from the \\"Garbage and Goddess\\" period in the spring of 1974, when the Adi Da put his followers through some amazing spiritual and psychosexual experiences. This talk deals in plain and simple language with many of the highlights of the Adi Da's early career, such as his \\"divine emergence\\" at the Vedanta Temple in Hollywood, and the lessons Rudi taught Beloved Adi Da about throwing garbage away.This text of this discourse is included in the recent book \\"He-and-She Is Me\\" as well as in an older (and hard-to-find) book entitled \\"Garbage and the Goddess.\\" If you are relatively unfamiliar with the Adi Da's work, this CD might be a better place to start than \\"He-and-She Is Me\\" (a brilliant but largely impenetrable book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality and rather loud","review":"Referred by a friend, we bought and custom built a WhisperKool into our wine cellar.

Lori Wick does a tremendous job of character development. This book somewhat models A Place Called Home in the plot line, but she does a much better job of suspense writing in this book. This story has everything in it, suspense, romance, heartbreak, death, sadness, forgiveness, and is rich in cultural knowledge. The beginning and ending were pageturners, the middle of the book moved a little slowly but was important for development of the story. Overall, a very strong writing job by Lori Wick."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: softly","review":"I am in the middle of this book, and am genuinely surprised by the good reviews. There is nothing spectacular about this book. Wick has an unoriginal plot with unoriginal characters. Her sentence structures are boring and often confusing. Or, her sentences simply make no sense. I quote, \\"Her eyes were so blue they were purple...\\" What does that even MEAN? She also uses the word \\"softly\\" over 50 times. Yes, I was counting, and as I said, I haven't yet finished this book. Her lack of vocabulary is just another crime to this already distressing novel. Brandon himself is very unlikeable. Any man who pinches a woman to make her cry because he thinks it will help her release emotional stress does NOT know how to treat women. I will most likely finish the novel simply to count how many times this woman uses the word \\"softly\\", but I honestly see no other reason to do so. I appreciate the effort to put out a good Christian romance, but folks, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"This book expresses how well Lori Wick writes.

I don't recommend using it as a both land and water camera as it's not the best quality (I have a separate camera for \\"regular\\" use), but the picture quality is really great for the price. Another little bonus is the case floats haha. I dropped it from a boat into the ocean but there it was bobbing along until I grabbed it again.My only issue is that the AA batteries drain really quickly but batteries are easy to find anywhere so not a big deal.All in all, easy to use and fun camera to have, and a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money, and an excellent snapshot camera","review":"I actually just got this camera today, and have already taken some decent pics with it. I agree with everyone else in that you need to read the instruction manual thoroughly to make sure you are getting the most out of your camera. However, it is capable of taking great snapshots. The only drawback I have found is that it is hard to hold the camera still enough that the pictures won't come out blurry. Sharpness is kind of an issue in general with this camera (it's not unacceptable, but of course it's not going to look like a Nikon). But considering you can get an underwater camera for under $100, I would say this camera is a great deal! I'm planning on taking it on some shallow water scuba dives/snorkeling trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underwater Camera","review":"Great little camera! I've used it to take underwater video and photos. For the most part, it takes good pictures. One drawback is that this camera eats up batteries somewhat fierce so be sure to have a lot of AAA batteries around. Another drawback is that the camera is not self setting You have to set the date on it every time you use it (that's if you want a time stamp on it). Kinda hard to see the pics after you've taken them but for the most part, it takes a good picture/video. The casing seems to work great. It keeps the water off of the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I bought this camera for a trip to Cancun. I wanted to do Scuba Diving and I brought this along.

Actually, any cell phone currently in the market can take better pictures than this VuPoint. I returned it before I had a chance test the waterproof case, but the case looked flimsy and the locking mechanism does not have a secure lock, it may open accidentally underwater.

These are absolutely NOT ribbons. This book is useless to me. It would have been OK if titled in a different way, not mentioning ribbons.Also the book photography if dreadful, un-professional, in bad lighting, cropped incorrectly and too small.

It could have been called \\"Latham Comedy Presents : The Extras\\". The main reason why I didn't give this the full 5 stars is because they didn't sell the 4th disc by itself and inThe Queens of Comedy, Comedienne Adele Givens makes a joke towards the late Lisa \\"Left Eye\\" Lopes of TLC.

I think this was one of Kentons best bands and there is some wonderful playing on here. All of the arrangements were done by Bill Holman, who was arguably Kenton's best arranger/composer. There are two reasons why I did not give this album 5 stars. The first is that it is a live recording and the recording quality is decent but slips in some spots.

The reactions seem to even vary story by story. A recent New York Times Sunday book review used rather strong language in essentially panning several of the first stories in the book, and then turned around and praised the last story, I think that the only explanation is the stories touch on dark and hidden emotions buried within all of us, and that some readers can not deal with what it awakens within themselves. To me, that is evidence of the power of this book, that with spare dialogue and in the limited span of eight or fifteen pages of a short story, Cavell not only keep us more than interested.

I will start off the school year with it in the fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't work with all kids.","review":"This is an excellent book and it's highly effective.

I was looking for a book that would give me a \\"magic trick\\" to work for my 3-5 boys in each class that cause me so much frustration. I am not a grumpy person so I find that children tend to take my kindness for weakness. They don't seem to care much about punishment and I am tired of bribing with treats on my own dime like other teachers. My school doesn't use \\"time outs,\\" so it would be hard to implement this plan if I wanted to.I will stick with my \\"Give me Five\\" from Wong and tiles/rewards system for this year. I guess what I am looking for has to fit my own style and my school policies this particular system is a bad fit for me.

Hard as it may be this book shows in a simple and powerful way that the only way to true freedom is through forgiveness. While bitterness seems the roads to take and hatred towards those who have hurts us the excepted emotion, Arnold dares to tells us the true stories of people who choose the road less travel and in the end found the freedom to let go and change their world by forgiving. He also gives us a look into the lives of those who choose to be angry, only to destroy themselves. This book is moving and powerful, it is a striking lesson of something most people and talkshows refuse to speak about. I only pray that people out their struggling with bitterness and revenge read this book and know there is another way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Forgive?","review":"Once you read Arnold's book you will know and feel why forgiving is so crucial. The stories Arnold includes speak for themselves. Forgiveness is a process, but it is also a gift. This book is a healing balm for any soul that has been hurt--even for the soul that is \\"beyond repair\\". No matter how horrendous one's pain might be, the way of forgiveness is the only hope. Arnold's wisdom extends far beyond the issue of \\"closure;\\" it offers the only key to true and lasting peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth your time","review":"Being newly introduced to this inspirational author, I was pleased to receive an advance copy of this book.

Thanks to those nuns who r giving this out for free in the streets at Harlem NYC.

Many of the problems I've experienced in life - anger, frustration, fear of making mistakes or apearing foolish in front of others are caused by unforgiveness. This book says unforgiveness is like cancer and I agree. The personal stories make it readable - not a lecture by any means. The author has 'been there too' and doesn't talk down or instruct. A good book to keep on the shelf for future reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, Exciting, Romance, Action ...","review":"Contact is a superb Sci Fi romance - I LOVED this book!

Fresh, unique, with great world-building and fully-realized characters, this book was a joy to read! It's about an airplane that is hijacked by aliens -- a silly, unrealistic-sounding premise that somehow turned into a gripping, absorbing, completely realistic-feeling book. Not silly at all. In fact, it's a real page-turner.Very good read. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci Fi Story - Lot of Action, Light on Romance","review":"This is a great science fiction story. The universe beyond earth as described by the author is imaginative and fascinating. The characters in the book are mature adults (no lame empaths or mystical healing heroines in this sci fi story)to whom you can relate. The heroine is intelligent, thoughtful, and can rescue herself. This book seemingly has everything most sci fi romances do not - the only problem is that it is very light on the romance. It is more a story of a group of earthlings escaping from bad aliens. I loved the story and greatly admire the author for her imagination and excellent writing skills. I could have easily rated this book 5 stars if there had been more focus on the relationship. As it is, this is a great story. If you like sci fi with a lot of action, I highly recommend this book. If you are looking for a sci fi with a heavy emphasis on romance, this might not be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure enjoyment from beginning to end","review":"The first two reveiws give you all a wonderful insight as to what the book is about.

They have catchy tunes and interesting vocals.. The punk culture needed this: Blink 182 and Green Day can't carry the pop-punk world.. Allister has the tools to be that third band we've been looking for if they can put together another good album or two..

Much to my disappointment I could not locate another copy of the tape. :(The music on this disk is clear and vibrant. The images the songs invokes are strong and powerful. If you understand what filk music is, this is one of the finest examples ever produced (if you don't, it is just plain good music that tells stories). Usually filk music is a lone singer with a guitar. This music, on the other hand, is fully orchestrated and very professionally produced.The CD was a labor of love and determination and it shows.

I was so wrong. The season finale was just bad. I won't spoil it for you, but there is no build-up like the first season, no event that closes the season--or, at least, not one that you saw building up in earlier episodes. The finale is just another episode. Bad, bad, season.

Also, the iron doesn't remain hot. It seems to turn itself off from time to time, which (I believe) is what's causing the spewing of water.

Then, just yesterday, it quit working right in the middle of my ironing marathon. I believe this iron has a MANUFACTURING DEFECT and that it should be recalled. We took it apart to see if we could figure out what the problem was and discovered the connections had burned out and melded to each other!!

No fan should be without this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"For students of twentieth century American music history","review":"Now in an updated and expanded edition, Aretha Franklin: The Queen Of Soul is the compelling and inspiring biography of one of the most amazing, remarkable singers with a five-octave voice. The many challenges Aretha Franklin has faced in her life, from parental abandonment to the illness of her sister, are candidly recounted, along with her will to survive and prosper, which can clearly be heard in her soul-stirring music. Highly recommended reading for students of twentieth century American music history, as well as a \\"must\\" for all Aretha Franklin fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am of Russian descent, but this is extremely difficult listening.","review":"The order in which the songs are put together takes too much concentration.

Included are sections on critical feminism, queer issues, intergroup relations, the black-white binary, and crime issues. The top writers in the field are all included, such as Derrick Bell and Richard Delgado. While the book is easy to use, none of the texts are easy but rather are challenging of deeply-held ideas and ideals.As critical race and gender studies continue to proliferate in undergraduate colleges and law schools, I am sure that this text will recieve a great deal more attention.

It had a few charming scenes and some legitimately funny bits (especially the old man recounting his experiences with lightning) but give any film nearly three hours and a huge budget; the law of averages says it's bound to stumble across a few of those by sheer chance. Many of the character moments were forced and stiff, and there was almost zero chemistry between Blanchett and Pitt to back up their supposed lifelong passion for one another. Wrapping the whole story up into Hurricane Katrina just felt cheap and needless.

Why don't Guiness/Ripley or the media stop by when what you've got here is the ultimate freak story ?. The only fun I had throughout this movie was making a list of the similarities with Forrest Gump which run in the several dozens. The Katrina back-story could have been of interest but at the end, all they used it for is as an excuse to flood a room !

Brad Pitt's character wasn't as distinguished as I would've thought. Benjamin serves as a much more passive character, but I think Pitt expresses well with his face and eyes. Cate Blanchett was amazing as Daisy--her character was lively, vivacious, and stole the presence of the movie more so than anyone else. It can be a heavy movie to digest because it revolves around the theme of life and death, the phases of life, and time.

It's not surprising or unexpected. It's a short story that is stretched unimaginably into an unengrossoing overlength movie. They could have easily dispatched with a whole segment where Cate Blanchett simply fails to look both ways before crossing an intersection.

Really, young screenwriters should be assigned the not unenviable task of watching \\"Casablanca\\" each and every day until creating memorable dialogue and characters becomes second nature.

Kindly suspend your disbelief so that the script may arrive at its insights.\\"But what insights would those be? Nobody has anything in common with Benjamin's problems, and mediating on his reveals no deep or abiding truths about life, death, or the human condition.

The storyline is about a man being born as an old man who ages backwards as people around him get older. I did see a few similarities with Gump, like when Benjamin goes off adventuring and major events are happening around him. There is a good cast of characters and Pitt delivers his normal better than average performance, but what kills this movie is the female lead actress. She comes across as cold, selfish, and unloving and she wasn't the best thing to look at either which might of made her tolerable. Since this movie is, at the bottom of it all, a love story, it's hard to like it if you don't like the girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I enjoy Brad Pitt Movies and I LOVE Cate but this movie just doesn't say Academy Award to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE MOVIE","review":"For a character study to be successful, one needs to LIKE the characters. Not possible here. Benjamin is cold, unfeeling, and abandons his wife when she needs him most. Benjamin practically never speaks during the entire movie and is void of any emotion throughout. And the wife...a loose, amoral person who sleeps with anyone and is always gloomy and depressed. All in all, this movie is simply an exercise in special effects and make-up, period. For anything else, Benjamin Button SUCKS. Steer clear of this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"I watched this movie thinking it was going to be good, however it was a waste of time and energy.

And they are definitely worth watching in this movie - very compelling performances. As the movie progresses, and you begin to realize what's going to happen, you feel the sadness and frustration that would be expected in this sort of relationship.

Scott Fitzgerald."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fitzgerald, twisted","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald made \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" a poignant but whimsical and often funny tale of a man born old who grows young. Hollywood twists this short story beyond recognition.In Fitzgerald's version, the father is discombobulated but takes his gray-haired, withered newborn home and has him dye his hair and otherwise try to masquerade as a young 'un. The film father tries to drown and then abandons his son. Fitzgerald's Benjamin woos and marries the belle of the ball; as she ages, he uses his burgeoning energy to attend parties and master the latest dance steps. In the big screen version, romance ends in tragedy.Thus does the film convey Hollywood's idea of a serious message, to wit, \\"Life sucks, then you die.\\" Some reviewers have noted the similarity to 1994's FORREST GUMP. Was that the last time a Hollywood movie with a happy ending won Best Picture?This reviewer is happy the Jazz Age master isn't around to see what they did to his odd little yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"This was a great value and the movie is one you will want to watch over and over.

Throughout the years some movies which he starred in I liked, others I did not!.However, this particular movie he was brilliant!! I love a narrative, so right from the start the movie had an advantage. The story was just fantastic. They took a short story, and turned it into a great movie.

This movie-rendering got bogged down in the uninteresting and unemotional love story between Button and what's her name. Made no sense and dragged horribly.

This movie is flat out terrible.The movie looked odd to me from the beginning. But I started reading a recap of it on IMDb and it intrigued me. I got about two paragraphs into a full recap (barely getting into any anything about Benjamin) before deciding that the movie looked really interesting and that I wanted to see it.So I rented the movie Friday night.It's nearly a three hour movie. With a movie that long, a slow start can't be afforded, but I got an hour into the movie before becoming so bored that I had to give up. The movie was just so dull and boring, going nowhere, which is a shame, because it was such an interesting premise for a movie (aging backwards) yet the movie fails so miserably by never going anywhere.Why this movie is so hyped, I'll never understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual thought-provoking movie - you just have to \\"listen\\"","review":"For all reviewers who bashed this movie, I say you just didn't \\"get it\\". Sure, it's a fantasy so you have to take that as intended. But there are some real messages here. It should get you to thinking about how we look (and deal with) acceptance of one another, relationships, death, our parents, love and the many people we meet in life who help shape who we are. Too many movies nowadays are over the top in action. This is a quiet movie - so sit back, open your mind to the underlying tone and enjoy - it's one of the better movies out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe For A Hokey Hybrid","review":"Mix several parts \\"Titanic\\" with \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"The Jerk\\"; fold in elements of \\"Back to the Future\\" along with the atmosphere and diction from a Tennessee Williams play. Stir at length until mixture becomes stiff and heavy before baking for two hours and forty-six minutes, preferably while a CAT 5 hurricane is bearing down on you.I didn't recognize anything remotely reminiscent of F.

Not being a fan of movie theaters, I much prefer to just wait and have the home theater experience. This one was well worth waiting for!Many of the scenes looked great on the big screen in high def. The sound was also high quality, however, I had trouble understanding some of the very low level, slightly mumbled dialog from the woman as she laid in her hospital bed.Since I have only seen this on Blu-Ray, I can compare it with a standard DVD. What I can say is that I am quite sure that the picture quality must be superior since I know what upscaled standard DVDs look like and this is definately better - and worth the extra cost in my opinion.In short, I thought this was a great movie - a real keeper that I'm sure I'll want to watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie!","review":"I think this movie was AWESOME!Great acting by Brad Pitt.Visual effects were great and story may be kind of long but it makes you appreciate these kinds of movies which some don't anymore.Long story short.Buy the movie you'll love it,cause I sure did.

This is the guy who had directed 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', two movies that are totally mind-bending and truly amazing. This movie is as confused as it can be. It tries to be a romance, a biography, a drama and perhaps a science fiction too, but sadly, succeeds at none. Many people are complaining that it's slow and long. That's still OK with me if the movie has something interesting or new to tell. It's really annoying to see it to be so 'Forrest Gump'-style and so pure sugary syrup. The idea of reverse aging could have been interesting if treated differently, but now when I think about the movie, it just makes me chuckle.I stopped watching a hour and a half into the movie.

Not the case here- there were very few moments in the film that made it shine- Some of the camera angles used were good but the direction in general just really lacked. The opening part of the movie was cool but then it just slowly started to go downhill. It was very repetitive in many parts especially during the torture scenes. The clown outfit was cool but this movie was missing something for me- there needed to be a lot more suspense. The best kill scene is when the girl opens the shower curtain and the clown is right there in her face- it gives you no time to think about it. This is what the movie needed more of and less random conversations. I love a good clown scare movie but this one didn't do it for me at all. 1.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinner Party, Anyone?","review":"Very pleased with this purchase.

There really is no point in his examples, they do the same thing you could do with just a printf() function(Ex. To demonstrate the use of a variable, he prints something that could be printed by using the printf() command) 3. There are plenty of other books.

If you've ever wanted to read forty pages all about \\"Hello World\\", but three paragraphs on how to code across multiple files, this is your book.

For a distributor that has brought us great titles as The Booth, the vengeance trilogy and else, this is scary at its lowest. The legend of the ghost is explained in other reviews, and it is quite interesting, to say the least. But this pseudo movie is not even that. Directed by a long-time contributor of B-movies (check his filmography), The Ghost of Mae Nak fails to be scary, is not stylish, and not even interesting. But it certainly is predictable, boring, lame, has the worst dialogues you'll hear in a long time, and it is plainly mediocre. Perhaps it is the style of the westerner director, he has shown that he likes/loves Thailand (Butterfly Man), but his skills as a director are not enough to create anything interesting.Watch Shutter, that one is truly creepy and is told by Thais who really understand Thai and know how to film.

I watched this movie last summer on DVD and really enjoyed it. For many people this will probably be their first Thai movie they've seen. I've seen a few as I've travelled to Thailand on a few occasions. I've certainly seen scarier Thai horror movies than this one, but I don't think it was the director's intent to make this a \\"scary\\" movie. As others have pointed out, this is a folk tale, and the movie feels like a folk tale being told to us. It's not supposed to be Jason v. Freddy with special effects and 12 different camera angles showing someone's head coming off. And I think it is more of a love story than it is a ghost story. If you are expecting blockbuster effects you will be disappointed. If you like seeing a folk tale or a good ghost story you might tell around a camp fire come to life, then you'll likely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH LOVE, IT'S SICKENING!","review":"I watched this movie just to see what it was about and I felt that it took too long to get to the point. There are many other JHorror filmz that out beat this trilogy, like wise. The beginning of it took 30 mins or so to pin point the wedded couple's relationship. I mean, they were so lovie dovie that it made me want to vomit...which is sad! It's sad because usually a viewer would want to puke after watching a grousome/blood slashing scene. Indeed it has only one spellbounding-death scene that caught my eye (The part where the con-man gets chopped in half by a falling sheet of window glass for a newly constructed office building w/in the city) and that's it.

This version, which has been called the gay version of Swan Lake, with all male swans, and strong Oedipus complex overtones should not be allowed to use the name of the original, classic, and beautiful ballet. I have no problem with the homosexual element to this production, but why not just create a whole new work, rather than radically change a classic?As a ballet dancer myself, I felt the choreography was very medicore, the music was altered in many places to become almost unrecognizable, in short, this production took away everything that I love about Swan Lake.Don't waste your time or money on this one.

Few productions, with the exception of the act 1 pas de trois, the second act, and the Black Swan pas de deux, use the original choreography. However, there has never been such a vulgar, tasteless prodcution as this. Not only is the score and libretto butchered into a pretentious quasi-homoerotic, quasi-Oedipal fantasia but the choreography is boring, ugly, and cold.

Bourne's version is by far the worst rendition of Swan Lake I have ever seen. It is a perverted parody and any resemblance to Swan Lake is purely coincidental. It must be shocking to any true lovers of ballet.Unlike performances by the Royal Ballet or the Bolshoi or Kirov which fit the music like a glove, the music in this ballet is only incidental. There is no grace or precision in this performance. Just a bunch of unsynchronized apes prancing and at times just stumbling around. The filming is a disaster. The camera does not stay focused on the \\"dancing.\\" Perhaps that is because the \\"dancing\\" is so bad that Bourne wants to divert the viewers attention away from it..People have a good taste in music and particularly in ballet should avoid watching this sickening and disgusting version.

There are some critical points but, in the main, the dramatic power of Matthew Bourne's chorography coupled with the performance of Adam Cooper and his corp of male swans it is a frightening depiction of what could have been if Pepita had dispensed with his tutu's and shocked the world with a production which would,I am sure, have met with Tchaikovsky's approval. I found some of the movement a little ghose particularly the assemble work in the early scenes but the par de dur between Cooper and Scott Ambler must be seen to be believed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunning","review":"I picked this up idly one afternoon at my school library, having once heard vague rumors about the all-male swan corps.

Instead, he bases his entire thesis on his interpretation of Gen Lee's \\"the plan remained the same\\" verbiage in his official report, and does so without any other evidence, or considering that Lee might be referring to something else when he wrote those words.

Unfortunately the last few have been heavy on the description and unnecessary detail and very short on plot and action.

Griffin does it again, with a page-turner book that ranks with all of his other stellar endeavors, including his Corps, Army, OSS and police series. In some ways, this book does have a different feel, with the terrorist plot foiled in this one novel; Griffin's other works typically continue missions from one book to another. Of course, one can expect elements of \\"By Order of the President\\" to be carried into other, future books.It also feels something like a Tom Clancy novel. But Clancy's novels have become less believable, with Jack Ryan assuming the presidency. Griffin doesn't have that problem. And although I at first expected the terrorist attack to grow in scale from what was originally uncovered, I believe that something of this scale might indeed be the next avenue for terrorists, as bigger targets are more protected.I eagerly await the next novel in what I hope becomes a series.

Not so with this one- the numerous flashbacks laboriously detailing the hero's childhood just wear you out. Griffin supposedly is plugged in to the military community; I work with military folks every day and they just don't talk like these characters.

The reader never feels like he's \\"there,\\" in the action.Plus the characters are boring and one-dimensional.Let's see... Major Castillo is in Special Ops, the Secret Service, and a Special Assistant to the Director of Homeland Security... He speaks five languages...

Griffin's latest offering, By Order of the President, but Major Kevin Rice (see below) saved me the trouble.Griffin is, sadly, an over-the-hill flack who must have blackmailed his publishers into paying him by the word. Case in point the entire page taken up with meaningless dialog between the Lear's pilot and FAA ground controllers.And as far as the use of wierd phonetic alphabets go how about \\"Papa-Zero-One-Zero-Three-Four\\" for PZ-1034.My pet peeve with Griffin has always been that, as Major Kev mentioned, his lead characters all seem to be wealthy - some born to it (BOW's Craig Lowell) or others marry into it (The Corps Ken \\"Killer\\" McCoy).Just my additional two-cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another new series!","review":"I was so excited to begin this new W.E.B.

We have a wonderful bunch of new characters that I can't wait to get to read more about. As usual Griffin can write a story! He does go into a lot of detail about the military, and about some of the military gadgets that are out there, but I didn't find this upsetting because it is all told as part of the story. The suspense throughout the book kept me turning pages, and I can't wait to read other books in this series. I love W.E.B.

I'm looking forward to the next one of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Military Adventure","review":"By Order of the President is a great start to another military adventure series by WEB Griffin. Already the master of military fiction, Griffin continues to add to his credentials as a great storyteller.Unlike his other military tales, this one is set in current times, in fact just slightly (a few months) into the future. It has some great new characters taking on terrorists who have stolen a 727 with intent to cause mayhem. The lead player is Maj. Charley Castillo, who is as unconventional as other Griffin creations such as Killer McCoy.For anyone who has read Griffin before and likes him, this is one that you won't want to miss. If you haven't read him before, you don't know what you're missing and should definitely start. You will find the journey a great pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Order of the President","review":"I ordered 4 of this series and they all were in like new condition.

It drags on way too long, has too much \\"John Wayne\\" imagery in it, and some terrible grammar errors in the dialog.

It failed to hold my attention. I donated the book to the hospital I was staying in at the time. Stick with Tom Clancy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuously Offensive Dialogue","review":"It was very difficult to enjoy because of the offensive dialogue. Don't get me wrong...I'm an adult man who hears plenty of vulgarities.But Mr. Griffin has an obsession with having virtually every character repeatedly say \\"Jesus!\\", or \\"Jesus Christ!\\", or \\"God damn..\\". And he tries to make a preemptive attack at anyone who objects to this by having one character respond to such an outburst with an effeminate lispy \\"are you going to stand there blaspheming...\\". Mr. Griffin tries to paint anyone who may take offense and complain as weak or weak wristed.Mr. Griffin clearly knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is grossly offensive to Christians, but he deliberately repeats such dialogue over and over and over and over. Every character does it repeatedly (probably over 100 times in the book), to the point where it is obvious Mr. Griffin isn't using it for individual characterization. It is clear he wants it to be \\"in your face\\" to any Christian who may read his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Book Order printed by Amazon","review":"Obviously Amazon is not very well set up. I ordered one book but another book was placed on the order form by Amazon. The wrong book. Not the book I ordered at all. I wish to have the book I ordered and I will not return the book I am receiving because I did not order that book, I will just the toss the wrong book. Amazon will not be getting any more business from me or my household. I would not even give Amazon one star. Well since I have to give a star before this will be sent. I give Amazon 1 star. That is the lowest rating I was able to give -5 stars would be more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I found this very dull.The main issues I had were that the plot is weak and the characters are not compelling enough to let you forgive this.We are told how impressive the hero, Charley Castillo, is, but we don't see any evidence.He is supposed to be a Special Forces/ Delta Force major in his mid-30's, in the top 5% of officers but seems to act like an immature 20 year old, with no nous whatsoever.He doesn't seem very tough or bright and demonstates extremely poor judgment (getting drunk repeatedly, including when he knows he is about to enter a very dangerous situation. Not drinking from angst, just stupidity)The plot meanders through various petty bureaucratic encounters, with no excitement until the end. It just had no visceral appeal at all.I guess I was spoiled by shows like \\"The Unit\\" in which the characters are impressive, but this left me cold. One would be better off reading \\"Point of Impact\\" by Stephen Hunter which has a much better plot and hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"\\"By Order of the President\\" is one of the worst novels I have tried to read. I say \\"tried,\\" because, in two attempts, I have been unable to complete it. Long-time Griffin fans, of which I am one, will find many familiar features, such as the wealthy hero, the authentic military detail, the stalwart Pennsylvania Dutchman, and even the liberal doses of mangled German. One will search in vain, however, for a point to the story. It is long-winded, meandering, poorly-edited, and has only the barest trace of a plot, which is so absurd it hardly merits that designation. One can but wonder why this book was ever published."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first WEB Griffin book! Hard to put down!","review":"Okay, I admit it. I was going to just glance at this book at the bookstore. I had never read any of W. E. B. Griffin's books, I was waiting for somebody, and I picked it up. I do like Tom Clancy novels, and it seemed of that ilk. By Order of the President grabbed me in the first couple of chapters, and I had to buy the darn thing to get home and continue reading it. Are all Griffin's novels like this?Pluses: interesting story, showing the connections in the military and the intelligence communities. Scary given that it was written after, and inspired by, 9-11.Minuses: too much \\"rag-head\\" stereotyping, and the Philadelphia sections drag the pace down.My first W. E. B. Griffin book!

I'm a great fan of his exciting, well written, concise Philadelphia police novels and some others, but this one is a real clunker. It is verbose to the point where 200 pages could be eliminated and still preserve the plot, such as it is.The story line is very confusing, and I don't see what Castillo's background adds to the story. Couldn't he just be an American and leave it at that?Also, Griffin's German is atrocious! Can't spell simple words and apparently is not aware that German nouns are capitalized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wast your time","review":"Once you take away the constant wrong details in this book you are left with juvenile writing.

While I kind of enjoyed the book I was very disappointed. I was hoping for something new what I found was a story that was pasted together from all his other books. This is kind of a Badge of Honor meets Honor bound meets etc.... He should write one more Badge of honor and for Gods sake let Matt live happily ever after instead of running off or killing his girlfriend. Also do the same thing for Lowel. I guess Griffin has run dry. It's a shame. This is my last Griffin book and I was a big fan. I read all his others to date.

A plot is supposed to progress, but Griffin throws in too many impediments, such as flashbacks that contribute very little, if anything. Further, even present time in the story is dragged down by a plethora of inane details that do nothing to advance the plot. I finished reading the novel (skipping a few paragraphs here and there--but not enough), but it was maybe because I'm a bit of a masochist. And the characters were B-movie cardboard cutouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slower Than Molasses","review":"Too long, too slow and too boring.

It's a solid background on what will become another of Griffin's series of books. The next two are much better and I'm on the 4th book now. This book is really a necessary read to get the full background on the characters and their interactions.As with most political thrillers, the plot is a bit wild but you really never know what terrorists are up to - do you? The main character makes for a great story and a good hero.

Please let me assist you in your purchase decision... DO NOT BUY this company's products. The Whisperkool units are not reliable, the design of the product requires that any servicing of the unit necessitates completely removing the unit from the wall that it has been installed in.There is no easy access for repair, ultimately requiring your contractor to come and remove it prior to a technician being able to work on it.Further, the company's customer support is non existent. \\"Leave a message and we'll call you back\\"! Do yourself a favor, buy something else. When I had a serious problem with this product, the company passed the buck and said it wasn't their concern.

We were able to repair it but not before you had to have it pulled out of the wall and repaired at a shop.

I thought, at best, this film would give me some neat pictures and videos assembled in ways I'd never seen before.I was amazed.There were interviews with people and astronauts I'd never seen before, talking about things I'd only read news releases about. For a real space nerd like me, I was absolutely blown away at how detailed and comprehensive this film was.Sure, they overlooked Apollo missions 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 16 - and I'm sure a lot of people will gripe about that. But the point of this film was to explain the Apollo program in its entirety, which it did, and as such is a fantastic introduction to American space history for everyone, and is a fantastic film even for us know-it-all-space nerds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate - but not inspired.","review":"This is a decent telling as a documentary with substandard music and production values but great research. It is telling that almost no special interviews for this DVD are provided by the Apollo 11 astronauts...the feuds rage on. Most of the other missions have interviews with the participants.From the Earth to the Moon and For All Mankind are far, far superior. This DVD confirms the accuracy of the research for From the Earth to the Moon, one the the most brilliant examples of television.The DVD also has no booklet or extras. The chapter list has no numbers, is on the disc (no printed list), and therefore worthless.This could have been great...and is mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one I always go back to ...","review":"I am an avid collector of dvds and books on the early space program thru the Apollo program.

Basicallythe story is about a day & a half in the Life of Harry Stonerowner of a garment manufactuing company who's going through amidlife crisis is in debt considers arson to his warehouse as a way of his troubles and manages to commit adultry. Jack Lemmon'samazing performce which earned him a well deserved oscar playswith sheer brillance and belivablity that he is pratcally in every scene of this film. One great scene was when Harry litterlybreaks emotinally thinking back to his army days seeing his friends wounded & killed when giving a speech at a fashion show.No Matter how dated or strange this film may be today it's stilla great film it's defintely not a film for visual & specialeffcts nuts but a film with certain amount of intelligenceand should be held as a clasic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemmon Makes the Movie","review":"Jack Lemmon gives a performance that more than justifies his Oscar. Although difficult at first to sympathize with a Lincoln Continental-driving, Beverly Hills CEO, (this was 1973, and pre-Lexus), one cannot help but finding a purity and honesty in Lemmon's performance. Although far from a commercial hit (Lemmon agreed to do the film for scale wages),it's success lies as being a triumph in acting, interpretation, and honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta see this on, it will change the way u look at dresses","review":"Not a movie for the average person seeking visual trills. This is a cult clasic, with real life situations. Drama, tension, stress in the business worls all are superbly portrayed by stller performances by Lemmon and Guilford. Jack's best role since Days of Wine and Roses. His dramic acting skills are great, and once this movie is seen, you will either say, forget it, or think about it for the rest of your days. It exemplifies small businesses run on a shoestring. What is it he wanted? Just another season. The movie contains real life characters and situations. It will reach your inner most feelings. Critics poo poo ed this movie, but do not let it stop you from at least seeing it once. If I am right you willnever look at a dress in the same way. Enjoy the deep drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much adventure,too little romance","review":"i never was able to get into this one. i bought it after i read the first chapter on my kindle and it started really witty,good,funny. i had such high hopes for this book and i was throughly let down.the attraction between the h/h was not very convincing and there was not enough chemistry. i skimmed through the whole book and didn't even bother with the ending. the lord of scoundrels was pretty good. waste of money.if you are looking for a ROMANCE book, this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical","review":"Daphne Pembroke's name may sound fluffy, but she's the brains of this book, in a time when women were thought to be flutter witted. When her brother is abducted by men who think he is the one with the brains to translate hieroglyphics, she needs more than her mind to rescue him, she needs muscle. That's where Rupert Carrington comes in after she bails him out of jail. Together, the winsom widow and the rogue set off to save her brother from thieves, but find adventure and romance getting in their way. However, what could have been a fascinating book seems rather bogged down with cumbersomely delivered details that only slow the pace rather than adding depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER KEEPER!!","review":"If it is a book by Loretta Chase then you can bet it's a keeper. I was so happy to find her second book about the Carsington family. Thank goodness it's a large family! To make it even better, Ms. Chase actually has the story take place in Egypt. So many authors start a book in Egypt but by the second chapter ther're back in England. Why? You would think they would know their characters could get into more exciting and dangerous adventures in Egypt. Maybe that's what separates Ms. Chase from the writing herd. She's smart and knows her subject. This is a funny, sexy, can't put it down book. I'm not going to go into the plot since that's been done in other reviews, but if you like smart characters and adventure, this one's for you. If you need something to read until Ms. Chase writes her next book, try Leslie LaFoy's trilogy. Excellent, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!","review":"Oh, that Rupert Carsington! I could just eat him up with a spoon. He is by no means the all brawn/no brain brother that the rest of his family deems him. He's big-hearted and fun-loving and a perfect match for the heroine, Daphne, who is cerebral and serious (without being one of those shrill and preachy bluestocking characters). They really complement eachother. I would have loved to have seen more of their romance, too, as another reviewer noted. But what we did see was very well-done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a better head.","review":"Definitely not the smoothest panning or tilting available (important for video), but for what it is it gets the job done and supports heavier setups.It has been working great for everything else but like the other reviewer, I ran into a similar problem with a piece breaking: the panning screw plastic knob broke off so now I can't adjust how tight or loose I want the panning motion to be. Pretty disappointed, currently looking for a nice fluid head replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item broke after little use","review":"I just tried to tighten up one of the tilt adjustments and the handle came out.

Flashy, sexy, zippy, it will grab the most jaded viewer. It is not as useful in the classroom as some vids because it blends together stories throughout the four sections (so if, for instance, you want to focus on the environment or on the rich-poor disparity, or urban life, there is a) less meaty stuff than some vids and b) less continuous coverage -- you have to jump around, which is difficult). For the classroom I recommend PBS's China From the Inside. It even interviews the same environmental lawyer, and Pan Yue, the deputy minister of SEPA, but the quotes aren't as outrageous as in China Rises. I'd recommend all Americans to watch China Rises. It captures China!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning","review":"The product is great! I love the packaging and the contents. The six shoes enclosed are perfect for teaching shoe tying.

Don't be taken in, the recipes are not from middle earth -- there are barely half a dozen that even have connection to the books. The rest are created fan fiction supplements made by someone who thinks of themselves as a hobbit.

For those of us that choose not to believe, or prefer rationality in the treatment of addictions, rather than \\"surrendering to a power greater than yourself\\", it is a godsend (pun intended). While AA fits many and is a great program, the needs of free-thinking people need to be addressed as well.The book provides clear steps to be taken, and sets clear priorities to address. There were a few noticiable typos that should be cleaned up, but the book is definitely a \\"5 star\\" text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recovery?","review":"I did not find anything helpful in this book regarding recovery.It seemed to me he was more intersted in promoting secularism then helping the alcoholic deal with an alternative to the 12 Step program.\\"Making Sobriety a Priority Everyday\\" is what I think most alcoholics who want sobriety hope for until their addicted brain tells them otherwise. Those words are simply not enough to help one cope with the stuggle of sobriety.The author tells the reader what they need to do but does not give any helpful strategies on how to do it.Again, it seems that the author was more interested in hyping his secular philosophy.Also,the last 50 pages are a waste of paper. They were the reiteration of a journal entry for you to fill in each day. I think it was added to make the book look like it was longer and had substance.I hope this book can help someone but it most certainly did not help me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting!","review":"This show was recomened by a friend.

What a relief from having to watch movies on N*E*T*F*L*I*X, which I have cancelled. TV may just be going back to good programming, speaking for myself, and I don't mind paying the price. 1.89 for each episode, once a week, if you buy the whole season, yet are charged only for each episode that has aired. Not too bad at all, because you OWN this and most of them are worth watching over twice. I get much more out of them, this way.

I am doing some research and was looking to see some of the animals from these islands in action -- I was quite dismayed that there were no blue-footed booby birds! There were some nice shots of some Galapagos tortoises, though. R.D. spends too much time talking for the sake of talking than to actually say anything worthwhile. I also cannot recommend this for viewing by children as R.D also makes too many references to the animals having sex and joking about a lack of cigarettes on the ground to prove it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, honest book","review":"I bought this book for my mother on her birthday, and she thoroughly enjoyed it.

When I take my first enameling class in a month or so, I will have enough of a foundation that I won't be too lost. The book is from the 50's and it shows; it had a more scholarly tone to it, which was fine. One complaint is that the images used to illustrate principles were so badly reproduced that they are absolutely useless. Since this isn't a step-by-step instruction book that isn't necessarily deadly, but it would have been nice to see images in detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks systematic exploration of traditional anaylsis","review":"Carl Hodge's Trammels of Tradition reads more as an expose of subjective democratic interlude. Nowhere, does the book challenge the drastic changes in industrial technique, economy and social structure that have occurred in Europe between the nineteenth and the middle of the twentieth Centuries. The book fails to identify any feudel traits during these times. Hodge's view of democracy can only be certain under a Utopian guise without acknowledging its characterological changes of quantification and abstractification. In short, this reads extremely alienated and is ill-researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mysteries??","review":"Opening with a beautiful Ave Maria, I was hopeful about this cd.

Angelic I might add, some of the best Ive heard.After the 5 decades are prayed, other Marian hymns and prayers are sung. And yes they are beautiful. But is this the rosary? I think not.It is soothing and beautiful but..... the \\"Prayer of the Church\\"??.....absolutely not.Fr McGinnitys rosary (Medjugoria)is my very favorite.

I should have returned the whole thing to Amazon but I initially thought they would balk at replacing a bulb. My feeling is it is a bad deal when it costs nearly as much to replace the bulb as buying new. I have PIAA 2000's on another vehicle which use H3 bulbs. The PIAA H3 bulbs are expensive at $20 a piece but there are at least cheaper options. PIAAs are usually nice but these are just no good when you have to pay $40 when the bulb blows out.

From his early works to today, his works speak to this part of the human experience. I would suggest you take a look at his piece 'The Prodigal Son\\" to see this. This piece is about spiritual struggle with god, with love and with yourself. It can have two meanings with this theme, but I'll let you figure them out.His retrospective \\"Reconciliation\\" is an excellent book to give you a grasp of the works and thoughts of this great artist. His prose in descriptions of his works is almost poetic and the book includes a large selection of his works that well represent his life's work.If you haven't, you should get aquainted with this artist's work and \\"Reconciliation\\" is an excellent way to do this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"see how far behind your kids are","review":"we keep this book around the kitchen and discuss some of the subjects during dinner...it's easy to read and well organized...my 13 year old daughter peruses the content on her own"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource!","review":"We have this one and the regular version.

Compared to Madden 2000 (which I would rate a 5)this is a 0.111 rated game but because Madden is such a great game I would rate this a one. And it deserves such a low rating too. the graphics are old school, the gameplay is boring, and the features are just nothing. Beware of this game!

It's much lighter. However, there are some gems on this CD. For example, the only song where Vorphalack sings in a melodious voice is just awesome. That song is Voyage. Sound of Galaxies is very good too. The second CD of all instrumentals is somewhat uninteresting. This album is lighter than Reign of Light. Also, Vorphalack never sings in his usual coarse voice, he sings in the deep yet clean voice which he used on Static Journey (the version with the vocals). Also, it's the same voice used at the beginning of On Earth from Reign in Light. That's the voice he uses on 99% of this album.For some reason, only Vorphalack and Xytras are credited on this album. Masmiseim and Makro aren't mentioned in the sleeve. I guess only Vorphalack and Xytras worked on this one.If you're looking for a heavy album, then this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good approach!","review":"Stewart Gordon comes across a lecture given to an audience in a theater. He analize various themes like for example motor memory, visual memory, aural memory, analytical memory, spatial memory, memory exercises. When I viewed it the first time, I said to myself, okay I'll just sit back and relax and have that first impression of the dvd, so I did and there are a lot of tips Mr, Gordon emphazises. So the next time, I will get my notebook,write down those specific points and start working on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictorial Overview of the Afrikakorps","review":"Excellent book of the equipment and weapons used in the war fought in North Africa. This book is pack from front to back with photos. Photos include not only German equipment, but Italian and captured british as well. You will love the action shots. Gives you good insight on how the war was fought and the equipment used."},{"rating":"2","title":"AfrikaKorps Uniforms and Equipment","review":"This In Action book gives a very short, concise, accurate summary of the desert warfare fought by the Germans, Italians and British. I thought the emphasis was going to be on the uniforms and personal gear of Rommel's troops, but the photos are about largely about the equipment they used, almost all with soldiers in the photo. That's why I gave it four stars. Good for what it is, misleading cover.Still, it does give you a good flavor on what the conditions were and how the equipment was used. The B&W; photos here are very crisp, clear and many I've not seen elsewhere. The two pages of color drawings are of the uniforms only.If you're looking for a book just about German uniforms, this is not it. But the photos really have a lot of detail of interest to armor buffs and especially good for anyone building a diorama. I enjoyed this book, worth getting if you're just getting into the history of the Afrikakorps, or perhaps find it on discount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea: Poorly Done","review":"I'm sorry to say the greatest merit of this book is that it is one of only a very few English Language books available on this topic. I Cannot fault the research, but I must give it only 1 star because the presentation is abominable. The interior text is obviously just a direct reprint of a single column MS Word .doc. The outline is difficult to follow and jumps around almost incoherently. It reads like it was never edited or finished. The images are poor scans from other books, some resemble bad photocopies. I was terribly disappointed by this book. As a member of the publishing industry I must say, I would never have allowed something this unfinished past my office.

Her ability to learn to deal with a disease that could have ended her fascinating career is an inspiration to all. Diane was not afraid to deal in therapy with the traumas she had as a child. She has became a stronger person and so much surer of herself, which shows in her interviews. She is a very capable and sympatico talk show host."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I think Diane Rehm is a talented radio host. I appreciate that she has had a long and interesting career, however, being a radio host and being an author are definitely not one and the same. Ms. Rehm's revelations of insecurity, marital discord, marital sex, and the rest, felt just too embarassing. Her perspective is whiny and immature and completely uninspiring. I kept wishing I could have been a wise and dear friend that stopped her from writing this book.I shudder each time I think of her (literary) indiscretion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Out of human compassion, I urge people who do not want to squander hours of their life to avoid this tedious, me-me-me book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"Diane Rehm is full of herself. During her long career at WAMU, she managed to amass so much power that she raised the money to make her own show national then she was able to hire her own boss, the former president of WAMU who turned out to be a disaster for the station and was forced to resign in disgrace. Now that we are celebrating her 30 year anniversary on the air, it would be a good time for her to resign. The station refers to her medical condition and wretched voice as a \\"disability\\". A radio host with Spasmodic Dysphonia is like a blind taxi driver."},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL seeking her voice","review":"I positively anticipated the insights that Diane Rehm might have for me regarding the speech disorder, Spasmodic Dysphonia, one I share with her and which frustrates me every day.The beginning of her life's story is mildly engaging; only \\"mildly\\" because her telling of it lacks the insight and perspective necessary to create a truly compelling memoir. I continued reading, hoping that all this set-up may be leading to something enlightening.As her life progresses on the pages, it becomes less and less intriguing, and I began to wonder when she was going to address Spasmodic Dysphonia (the apparent \\"hook\\" of the book, according to the dust jacket). Well, all you get is a skimpy relating of her condition near the end of the book, with a startling lack of examination from the author as to how the events leading up to this climax are related to the disorder itself.Very disappointing. Little more than celebrity autobiography, and not outstanding in that context, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Big Comfy Couch Video","review":"My 3 year old daughter loves the Big Comfy Couch, but does not care for this particular video at all. I hate to say anything negative about the Big Comfy Couch, but for some reason they stuck an annoying \\"hard rock\\" style song into the middle of this otherwise cute video. Even Barney songs all have melodies that will eventually grow on you, but this rock song about interrupting is unbearable! Without this song, the video would be a 3 star video.I recommend sticking to all of the other great Big Comfy Couch videos that follow a variety format more like the TV show. The \\"Are you Ready for School\\" one is my daughter's favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the Sesame Street video!","review":"The review already listed on the page describes the *Sesame Street* 1-2-3 Count with Me video.

The author tries to combine stuffy academic writing with popular non-fiction, with decidedly mixed results. For example, Wallace seems obsessed with footnotes (several of his footnotes have footnotes!) which disrupts the narrative flow on nearly every page of some stories. He also comes across as a whiny outsider; his stories about the state fair and life aboard a cruise ship reveal more about the author than about the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only aliens would find this book funny.","review":"Quite possibly the most gruelingly verbose book I have ever attempted to read in my life.

He said it was great but when i got it home i couldn't belive how bad it was. how bad? as bad as bad can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This author couldn't write himself out of a paper bag. David Foster Wallace has absolutely no sense of humor about the trivial subjects he writes about and actually takes himself seriously. Sometimes it's ok David to take a step back and laugh a little at the absurdities of life. Too critical, TOO MANY FOOTNOTES, and downright boring. It's more entertaining to read the back of a box of cereal. Stay away from this book if you know what is good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"words, words, WORDS","review":"David Foster Wallace's essays read like his novels: big, boisterous, smart and exuberant. The title essay is a very long, very detailed, very funny travelogue of a \`\`pleasure'' cruise. It reads like an extended journal entry by a very bright yet admirably down-to-earth guy.DFW's shotgun approach is not for everyone--he writes about everything he sees and everyone he meets, so at times it sounds like he's rambling. But even when he rambles, it tends to be incisive rambling. I advise patience. It will pay off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"The title essay is one of the greatest of all time -- poignant, hilarious, brilliant. The rest are not as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stories but difficult to read","review":"I found this writing extremely difficult to read and understand. The sentences were long and confusing and by the time I got to the end of a paragraph I struggled to follow the point. The stories were generally interesting but in the end I gave up because I found it too much work to carry on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing I have read in a while","review":"Wordy and drawn out are two terms to describe this overbearing work by Wallace. It wasn't enertaining as much as it was tedious to get through. Footnotes, Lynch essay from hell, \\"banal\\", and \\"w/r/t\\" all overdone. The only redeaming essays are about the state fair and the cruise, where we the reader gain insight into the author's way of perceiving mundane aspects of life. But I suppose we could all be watching Seinfeld reruns instead. I will admit I skipped quite a few paragraphs in this book because the inane prattle was driving me insane. My advice, leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious twaddle aka Hipster bible","review":"A real hipster bibleI was told well suggested to buy this book by a ex black metal guitarist turned pretentious foodie Via a liberal arts school. This book is a tedious mess .This was one of the worst books I have ever read I barely made it through before trading it in for credit at a used book store . The essay on David Lynch was rough I wonder if he has even seen a David Lynch film? Did he put it in there to seem smart? and why does name dropping make one seem hip anyway?I really agree with Bret easton Ellis , it seems makes people feel they are some kind of faux intellectual if you suggest it to people to read.My question is how did he write this book with his head up his rear end? Thats the real feat in this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"David Foster Wallace's short essays can be amusing at times, but the descriptions can get tedious (see 500 footnotes for examples) and he rarely seems to connect with the people he's describing.I haven't read the DFW novels, but for hilarious and cringe-inducing non-fiction commentary, Sedaris is THE master, with Dave Eggers, Sloane Crossley and others far ahead of DFW.Sorry, I wanted to like the book more, especially with his untimely death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"More brief than his novels, just as inviting, conversational, thought-provoking, and funny. The addition of a self-effacing first person is really charming. After having read the novels, which are so cool they're practically untouchable, this book is absolutely sparkling. I'd say David Foster Wallace is even better at nonfiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this man","review":"This was the first DFW work I ever read, and it still sticks in my mind as a brilliant, beautiful collection. Even those who have tried Infinite Jest and hated it (and you are legion) should give this a try. You will be blissfully surprised. A friend of mine was recently on the cruise ship that is the subject of the title piece. She said that everything she saw reminded her of a specific line, that he had left nothing out. DFW is one of the greatest writers of our (or possibly any) time. Forgive him his excesses, and you will be amply rewarded.I suppose I should make a token effort to say what the book is about. Okay, then: cruise ships, state fairs, tennis, David Lynch, agorophobia, preformance anxiety, etc. There. Now read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"mostly superb","review":"Mr. Wallace isn't just funny (and he can be wickedly funny), he has a superb command of language, isn't afraid to use words, is beautifully observant, and has a great sense of character. All of those gifts have converged in a couple of these essays to make them, or parts of them, utterly memorable. Unfortunately, there are some long dead moments within each essay that make me stop and think, Now here's an example of really bad judgment. What's unfortunate is that Wallace's mistakes tarnish the lustre of his finer moments. Without the extreme bad here, though, we might not also have the extreme good. And in the end it's worth it. There are a few writers who always get grouped together with Wallace in literary commentary, but not a single one of can hold a candle to this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely enjoyable and funny","review":"David Foster Wallace has a great way with words. His philosophical mindset and ironic attitude combine to present us with a deep, unexpected view of items we might not have thought had such meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"Wallace's rather off beat description of his personal life, from playing amateur tennis to dating modern American women is an enthrallingly different, humourously critical way of looking at the world. While I found the stories entertaining and easy-reading I do have one little hint for the author: Dave, try to cut down on those annoying footnotes a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doggedly trudged through the whole thing for a just reward","review":"This book was recommended by a highly regarded friend. Little did she know that I am truly an ignoramus and had in fact never even heard of Mr Wallace. I do have to say, as difficult as it was for me to read each painfully heavy page, I did come away with several observations: Tennis is way cool. David Lynch movies should at least be rented and watched. State Fairs, thank goodness, come around only once a year and last, but not least: I want very badly to go on a sea kayak tour of British Columbia with Mr. Wallace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read.....but....","review":"I enjoyed most of this authors stuff..he has a tendency to go on and on.and actually gets boring at times. But I really liked his essay on David Lynch and the Cruise ship story..and the cover is hilarious.."},{"rating":"2","title":"didn't even read the whole thing but BUY IT!","review":"It's true, there are two essays in this book that I have not finished (especially the essay on television). However, cruise ship holidays, pro-tennis tournaments, David Lynch and state fairs. Amazing writing, very funny indeed. He manages to observe the social mores of the that special tribe that takes 7NightCruises, gives advice on why not to date girls whose mothers look like Lynchian characters and gives us an insight of tennis players and their whimsical, yet understandable behaviour. Very funny stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A supposedly good book I won't recommend.","review":"Every page of this book includes about one sentence of lucid, vibrant observation. The rest is decidedly repetitious (he often re-uses/repeats quirky, distinctive thoughts and words within a few pages to little effect) and seems to make the author a candidate for a long lesson on 'sometimes less is more.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"like Jackie Gleason in Drag","review":"Critics of DFW tend to fall into one of two categories:1. Too stupid/impatient to get what's going on/being attempted;or2. Smart, but ideologically encumbered/terminally insecure, and thus predisposed towards rejection.Both sets of critics appear to have missed the point.The joy of DFW is that he doesn't attempt to answer his own questions. This is the literary equivalent of socratic method. He presents his argument to the reader, and then asks (as in Chapter 1 of Infinite Jest), \\"what's _your_ story?\\" Like any other educational experience, what the reader elicits is directly proportional to what the reader invests. Challenging? Yes. Pedantic? Often. But also by turns hilarious, insightful, and deeply moving. Consider anything he's written as one half of a dialogue. It's left to the reader to respond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung SyncMaster","review":"Very nice monitor and comes with VGA & VDI cables (one of each) so you can use the one you need.

Yes, the rest of the CD is great jazz. Eric only plays on a few numbers, but I immediately heard something special-a sax player who plays in the tradition of the great tenor players such as Dexter Gordon, Hank Mobley, etc. and so young! Since then, I have collected several of Eric's CD's and seen him in person. Take my word for it-Eric is the past, present and future of jazz.Pardon me, did I mention that all the other players on this CD are great?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Entrepreneurship & Inspirational Stewardship","review":"Clearly written, extremely well thought out and inspiringly honest, Bo Pilgrim doesn't not hide his beliefs, when it comes to his consumers, his partners, his employees or his faith.While some may say that much of the book is common sense, that's not its weakness, but its strength. After all, while other business authors seems determined dazzled their readers with questionable statistics and bold, controversial pronouncements, One Pilgrim's Progress illustrates the power and promise of simple truths, clear virtues and strength of character.Honest and straight forward, One Pilgrim's Progress is a clear reminder that, before you can add market value to your products, you've got to have personal values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riffer's Madness","review":"This is a must buy for a Dimebag Darrell fan. This guy knew what he was talking about when it came to guitars.Everything is transcribed perfectly.My only beef with this book is that Darrell doesn't play on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good content","review":"I found the content to be pretty good. I am a big Dime fan so to just have his entire column in one book was great. I did notice that there is some bad tab but it's enough to get you going in the right places. Additionally I expected Dime to be playing on the CD instead of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Product","review":"The product arrived outdated by a month or so.

Purchase price was refunded without any question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early reader","review":"I'm a third-generation American, so I used this book to help my kids understand the immigration of their great-grandmother, especially relevant since we just spent Christmas with her. The time frame is earlier than Gramma's trip, but the desperation and the determination were right-on.I thought this book did a great job describing some scary things without totally freaking children out. And yet, my kids clearly understood how out-of-control the parents in this story felt all through their journey.The reading level is just right for this book -- excellent level 3 reader.ps -- it's so nice to read an early reader that isn't about Thomas the Train, Tinkerbell, or Star Wars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this was a gift","review":"I can't really rate this since it was a gift to my grand daughter. will have to check with her when we talk next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed By New Release","review":"After listening to Tracys new album, I was no where near as impressed with this as I was with all of the other albums. Tracy has always been my favorite male country artist, but I feel this is a step down in quality from the other albums released over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for Top 40","review":"A Music City dude who sticks pretty closely to a hard country vibe -- which is to say, a Nashviller whose whole album I can listen to without having my blood pressure rise too high. He's poppy and claculated, but Lawrence mainly follows in the traditionalist path laid down by John Anderson and Randy Travis. He also traffics in the broadest, most archetypal knee-jerk sentiments -- small town memories, good hearted women who save ne'er-do-well boyfriends, outlaw wanderlust, etc. The most shameless song on here is \\"What A Memory,\\" in which Mama's dying wish is that her boy should get a guitar, so he can follow his dreams as a musician... well, you see where this is headed... Still, slick as he is, Tracy Lawrence is a pretty listenable Top 40 artist... Worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately bad","review":"I was looking forward to an engaging critique of postmodernism. Aside from pointing out the most absurd examples of French Theory, this book does little else. Let me stress, I'm no fan of post structuralism, but the propagandistic quality of this work is too crude to convince anyone already sympathetic to French theory, and one is left wondering what Sokal's motives real are.Lastly, it might interest readers to know that two French brothers have recently (2001) pulled off a similar stunt, but this time the target seems to be theoretical physics. Not only have these brothers been able to publish several nonsense articles in scientific publications, they were also awarded a PHD! Poetic justice perhaps?"},{"rating":"1","title":"fashionable scientific nonsense","review":"Neither Sokal nor those he criticizes are radical, and both of them are wrong at times, and right at other times. It is ridiculous to suggest that anything is more fashionable in the modern day than sporting the scientific attitude. This perhaps is the greatest danger of the day. Sokal could have chosen to talk about that, but there's not much fame in that. There is the other issue of uncertainty in science and many better lights of science than Sokal indeed have written about that. Perhaps Sokal's small-minded book serves the purpose of exposing obscure obscurantists but let us not kid ourselves into believing that he is defending rationality or some such construct."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief review of a good book","review":"This is a very good book, well-written and delivering a coherent argument. If you want to know what it is about, read the synopsis and the other reviews. If you want to know whether it is worth reading, here is my opinion: yes, but...The best part of the book, and the most profound, is the epilogue. You have to read the rest of the book to graso the argument in the epilogue. The rest of the book is enjoyable, but it's too bad they saved the punch line for the afterword.This book is of variable quality, throughout its body. In several places, the authors felt the quotations of the post-modernists stood on their own merits as evidence that there is no there (in the PM attacks on science). When the authors engage in thoughtful analysis, they are very strong. And the epilogue pulls it all together beautifully. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"polemically one sided approach to science.","review":"While I myself had not actually read the book, the problems I see with this work is tautologically apparent. PIAS works on an objective, logical truth that far exceeds mankinds framed reference of what can be epistemically available. Recent works have started to combine the gap between current science, and the emerging postmodernist methodologies to create a holistically balanced approach (I refer the reader to Sokal 1996). Our job as subjective viewers is to wait in the sidelines until the field codifies itself, but until then, reserve judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the postmodernism critics fail to see is that ...","review":"... in the end, my friend, postmodernism worships the god of the free market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Periodic Kingdom by Atkins","review":"This work covers the fine nuances of the Periodic Table ofelements from the East or p-block to the West s-block.It describes how classic metals evolved. For instance, theuse of Cu. came out of the Stone Age. Iron, cobalt,manganese and other metals were utilized to shape steel.Dolomite is found in Italy and titanium in the West Desert.This book would be very helpful in understanding how thevarious metals and non-metals evolved. In addition, the permanentposition on the Table of Elements is explained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I Expected","review":"This book was assigned as a summer project for my honors chemistry class, so I obviously had low expectations for it. I was pleasantly surprised. The book was actually quite enjoyable to read which, in turn, helped greatly in understanding periodicity. The title makes the book sound lame, but the author conveys a great and abstract knowledge of the periodic table through a metaphor - without making the reader feel like a small child. Albeit, I may be biased by my fondness for creative vocabulary which this book contains in abundance, so do not be surprised if it has you reaching for the dictionary a few times. All in all, this book is only among a few educational books I am not ashamed to recommend to people: I see that as a definition for success."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb book","review":"Analogy and explanation are Dr. Atkin's watchwords.

Difficulties are turned to enlightenment. More please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for a good popular chemistry book","review":"I love chemistry, particularly the periodic table. However this book was a huge letdown. Whoever suggested it should have been written like a travel guide should be sacked. Instead of being an illuminating analogy it just obscured and annoyed. Phrases such as the 'shoreline of the noble gases was a lost world' just get in the way of very interesting science. Other reviewers have suggested it's a good children's book, but the science master series isn't designed as a childrens series. Others in the series (Diamond's and Margulis's come to mind) have been erudite, clear and interesting even if you have a good working knowledge of the subject. This isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guide that helps to get lost!","review":"A very confusion guide though the \\"period kingdom\\". We easily get lost.

It's range of emotion and depth takes the listener on a very reflective, inspiring, and comforting journey. It is very different from the standard instrumental music that is on the market today.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this topic, from what I've read thus far it's an excellent read.

Either the character was not developed enough or she just wasn't into it. She seemed to play one note, and that was whiney baby dyke. Theron, however, did not let those less capable prevent her from blowing other Oscar competition out of the water.Thank you Patty Jenkins for doing this film, and thank you Charlize for your passion and talent and having the guts to let us see what you can do.

NOBODY forced her to take the road she took in life; it's a cryin' shame what happened to her, but that's not an excuse to do all the terrible things she did. This movie is DISGUSTING and it shows all kinds of crap that shouldn't be seen by the human eye. Theron can act, but big frickin' deal!

This is a horrible movie that no one should choose to view. There is nothing good that can come from you watching this! It seems that movie writers want the audience to feel sorry for this woman, which is a twisted view of life. She made her own choices in life, and it's awful the consequences she suffered as result of her choices. This movie is DISGUSTING and it features a lot of garbage that doesn't need to be repeated and watched. Definitely DO NOT let your kids watch it. Make a good choice yourself-- DO NOT WATCH THIS.

What was amazing is how Charlize Theron, who is such a beautiful woman, could transform into Aileen (not only physically) but you could see a look of hate and sadness at the same time in her eyes, and could get so much into the character without feeling disgusted for herself, and portraying such a disturbed woman. Some parts are disgusting and shocking, but it is still a good movie, and Charlize Theron really diserved all the Awards she won. Christina Ricci also gives a good supporting-actress role as Selby, Aileen's lesbian love-partner.I wouldn't watch it again, one time is enough, but I would recommend you to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, eerie but disturbing...","review":"I can see why Charlize Theron won the Best Actress Oscar at the Academy Awards this year. She gives a superb, eerie but VERY disturbing performance as Aileen Warmos. It definitely gives you insight as to how this woman \\"ticked.\\" She was a time bomb just waiting to explode. On the other hand, I found Christina Ricci's character to be very immature, annoying and co-dependent. It is a film that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple. great acting + powerful story = good movie","review":"To be honest, I didn't think much of Theron (she always seemed to be just a pretty face in Italian Job etc), but this performance completely blew me away. Her transformation into Wuornos (both physically, the makeup is crazy, and emotionally) is completely believable without seeming like over acting or fake.But be warned, this movie does not hold back. Admittedly, the violence is appropriate, and the movie would not have the powerful effect it does without it, but if this sort of thing makes you uncomfortable then you'd be best to avoid it.If a good story interests you more though, then by all means buy/rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster","review":"I was disappointed in the movie.

It's less of a reality based story and more of a dark love story.You have Aileen Wuornos, FL's female serial killer, of course.Then, you have Selby Wall. For all purposes of the movie, a main ingredient, but truthfully non-existant.The whole gist of the story is to give you a mind past the monster that Aileen was.

Extremely disturbing movie. I stoped twice the player, one to read again the name of the actress and second to read the synopsis, this actress its amazing, I can't belive how she transformed in to the monster. This is a real life story that the next day I confirmed at google, its not a lesbian story, its not a simpaty story its real life, and people didn't like to acept it.

You see through someone else's eyes what it is like to be mistreated and tormented throughout life. The movie makes you think twice about judging people.

I can't add to the reviews here...they've pretty much covered everything about the movie.THe only thing I will add is that in my estimation, this is the kind of film that gives Hollywood a bad name and promotes unhealthy morals and values. A film where every other word is the \\"F\\" word or \\"G...D...\\"....and there is explicit homosexual sex..(graphic hetero sex is bad enough)and...look, I'm gay myself, but I don't like to have it crammed down my throat.It is a disturbing film....NOT FOR CHILDREN>>>OR ADOLESCENTS.....the acting by Theron is good...she does scare the fire out of you with her performance but the profanity was unnecessary.

And this movie lets us see the different point of view, which is a key to understanding, what Aileen wanted most..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theron 's acting..only good thing","review":"I found this movie to be one of the most awful films I've ever seen. It's vile, crude, and profane. Aileen Wuornos starting \\"hooking\\" by the time she was 13...I've seen many doumentaries and read many to attest to this. How Patty Jenkins can turn someone like that into a victim, is beyond me. Charlize Theron's preformance is brillant, it's the one saving point of the film. If you're going to tell the world about someone's life...be objective...don't put your own personal thoughts and feelings into the mix. Don't base the storytelling on your personal thoughts and feelings. Patty Jenkins should have been more objective...she shouldn't have tried to get the audience to feel sorry for Aileen. She should have portrayed the Aileen for what she was..a sick twisted, human being who refused to be accountable for her actions and tried to paint herself as a victim in a pathetic attempt not to have to pay for her crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING This film should have been rated at least NC -17","review":"I saw this movie in the movie theater and felt assaulted. The language was vulgar and unending in its relentless onslaught. The rape scene was very intense. Charlize Theron's character is naked tied up across the front seat of a car while her attacker pours alcohol over what appears to be burns while she screams and then he gets a metal pipe to rape her with from behind. Not to mention the lesbian sex scenes. When I saw Matrix I wondered why the film got an R rating? What? you get an R for the 1 billionth slow-motion karate chop? I do not consider myself a prude. I watch my share of porn, and usually \\"enjoy\\" an occasional intense dramatic movie. This movie was too much for me. If you are a person with abuse issues or if you have teenagers, this is NOT the movie for you.

Well, despite my lack of literary talent when it somes to writing reviews, THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL! It had sooo much potential and could have been sooo good, but it fell so short that youd need a ladder to climb up to the status of errible. I think that I was expecting something akin to Executioners Song and what I got was something akin to a DVD coma.The one star that I gave was for that Charlize persons performance, which despite the boring ,slow ,awful, horrible, terrible, dull, flat ,missed opportunity of a movie,she did a great job.and her make up job was fabulous.so thats my $.02"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlize Is Brilliant","review":"I had seen the TV documentary on the serial killer upon whom this film was based, and the documentary included film of her in court and in interviews (she has since been executed for her crimes).When I say that Charlize Theron picked up the look, the mannerisms, the speech patterns, and even the walk of this woman, that's an understatement. Charlize IS the murderer--a loser hooker who's had a horrible life, but who has a heart, albeit twisted and sick.Theron's transformation into this horrific murder is so much more than makeup. Even as we see her commit her unspeakable crimes, she somehow makes us sense that beneath it all, there is some humanity...morphed into a sick sense that what she is doing is right.\\"Monster\\" is not an easy movie to watch, but it is completely fascinating. This review is being written before the Oscars, and I can see Theron winning Best Actress--and deserving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the great performances","review":"I suggest watching Charlize Theron in, say, \\"The Italian Job\\" and then watch \\"Monster\\" to highlight the amazing quality of her performance in the latter.

For one thing, it shows just how degrading lesbianism is. More importantly, it goes against the feminist position that women should only be portrayed as being victims, not criminals in their own right. In feminist movies, there are no such things as femme fatales. All women are depicted as being helpless victims at the hands of evil males.Monster reminds us that there are evil women, such as Aileen Wuornos, who are capable of the most fiendish things, including violence against men. For this reason alone, Monster is a most remarkable movie that completely goes against the feminist grain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back?","review":"I rented this movie thinking it would be a great suspense film as I had heard.

What a disappointment! The acting was, as everyone's saying, \\"top notch\\", but when it comes to the script - wtf? The movie's boring, not to mention the fact that I personally had a hard time feeling much of anything for either of the main characters. If I want to watch white trash, I'll watch Gummo. If I want rape, I'll watch Irreversible. This merely dabbled in both. Again, this is an art film for non film appreciating AmeriKa... Pretty sad.

We are made to feel sorry for a woman who, in cold blood, murdered several men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Between The Lines","review":"Both Christina Ricci amd Charlize Theron offer an incredible performance in this film. It shows us that we are all human. First off we will do anything for love. Second, We do what we feel is right in our own lives. If any of us had lived her life, we would certainly look at this world in a different perspective. All she was trying to do was find a way to live the American Dream. I have to have compassion for the people who REALLY lived this story, and also the actresses and actors who had to put them selves in the place of true to life characters.

The general video quality is virtually the same as the standard def version...non of the qualities you associate with HD show up on this disc. The dark scenes are just horrid. The audio is poor and severely out of sync with the picture...in some cases about one second off. If you own the standard def version, do not think the Blu-ray is an upgrade, it is not.

While she had a horrible childhood and mental illnesses ran in her family, she was not the emotional wreck portrayed by Charlize Theron in the movie. Wuornos never showed remorse for any of her killings, more than one of the victims was not a \\"john\\" looking for a prostitute.

I'm someone who saw the the first qatsi film in 1985 and was completely changed. I looked forward for years to the completion of this trilogy. The third film may disappoint you because it is so different visually. However, the soundtrack is a fitting end to the set. Yo-Yo Ma's cello is brilliant. When I replayed the soundtrack I instantly recallled images from the film. How much more can you ask? I can't rank this any higher or lower than the rest of the qatsi soundtracks.

After seeing this film, my college suitemate and I went around imitating this woman for most of our freshman year. And I can still hear her saying something about \\"tying a string ... around [her] fin-ger\\".The campers' deaths are pretty hilarious and as has been said before, the shocking conclusion is nothing short of bizarre. Could this film have been directed by the ghost of Ed Wood? It's a toss-up, but my vote is 'yes.'If you're looking for a scare, I'm not sure i'd turn to this film. But if you're looking for someting well within the realm of truly terrible horror movies, give \\"Sleepaway Camp\\" a look. Rent before buying, though.

If you want bad acting, bad sets, bad special effects and ages between things happening, then watch SLEEPAWAY CAMP. This is in my top 5 of the worst horror films of all time. People here will rave about the shock ending. They obviously haven't seen decent films like \\"Crying Game\\". I wondered why I had never heard of this movie because I thought I knew alot of about the genre. So you can imagine how I felt when I finally got to see it the other day. It is that bad!

With that aside Sleepaway Camp still is pretty decent to watch,it uses some interesting twists and has nostagic feeling to it. Also the [end of life] scenes are far-fetched(flesh-eating bees)but clever at the same time. Many people talk about the ending,I thought it was ok but had similarities to Pyscho and Friday The 13th. It was unpredictable though...,plus with to many ... undertones ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleepaway Camp is excellent!","review":"I saw this movie a while back and the ending scared the hell out of me! It starts off pretty good and ends that way.. The death scenes are somewhat enjoyable, very similar to the ones found on Friday The 13th. The acting fits the movie. Well, to put this short, if you are a horror-head like me and enjoy the old Friday The 13th flicks, plus some Slumber Party Massacres, then you will definitely eat this up, plus the ending is SO spooky, and shocking!

Because, budgets aside, I think there still needs to be an acceptable level of execution, directing, acting, writing, etc. This film simply doesn't have any. Now again, I can certainly respect those who enjoy that about the film. I'm certainly not out to criticize anyone's tastes in the genre.

Soon after, the kids, the director, and the pedophile cook fall victim to a young killer. Despite the tepid story, slasher fans should be pleased by the grisly deaths and surprise ending.

This movie is just plain cheesy, boring, and not scary at all. Okay, I've got to admit, the film kept me wondering what was going to happen and who the killer was, but the ending to this movie was one of the hokiest I have ever seen. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the film yet, but oh brother was the ending stupid. That ending was not worth the 90 minute wait, especially since the first 90 minutes weren't very interesting. It's pretty typical \\"b\\" movie acting and sound/picture quality, without the frightening effect of some other \\"b\\" slasher flicks.

I agree, but thats what makes this movie interesting, the poor acting and badly assembled scenes (in my opinion) make this movie just that much more interesting. I'm a fan of cheesy films, and this one takes the cake. The acting is bad, the dialog isn't much better, and the special effects are awful, but that makes this movie rule.The ending, as the previous guy called silly and stupid, would have been original and shocking had i not seen the sequel first where the ending of the first is blurted out in the first scene. Even with the ending spoiled for me, i was still pleasantly surprized with how they pull it off( I just dont understand the odd grunting noises). The transfer had to be straight from VHS becaue it is just completely awful which adds to the appeal somewhat but is mostly just a bother. in summation, buy this movie, rent it, whatever, JUST SEE IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"I'll save you all the pain of reading the novels for reviews you see down below:This movie is great, an 80's must-see and must-have essential in your horror collection.

Yeah, I know it's the blah-blah-blah-teens-at-summer-camp-stalked-by-a-maniac cliche, but how many horror films touch the homosexual nerve and show 2 guys in bed for god's sake??? Genius! Genius!

This movie had a chance to be a huge horror success. It has all the characteristics of the genre except one, it really wasn't scary. The killings were not the type you talk about with your friends. They could've been more gorey a la Friday the 13th as it takes place in the same time frame.The movie itself, However is tolerable in that the story is interesting enough to get you to THE ENDING!! You may have seen some weird endings before but nothing can prepare you for this. As everyone else has said I'm not giving it away. If I could give 2 1/2 stars I would.

It also came as a surprise to the director that his film was still popular in this regard.If you like laughing at bad acting, bad 80's costumes, bad language, this is your flick. It has enough of the horror genre covered to redeem it and Angela's performance is spellbinding in its own way. Taken all together, it is a hoot! I immediately watched it again with the commentary from the director and \\"Angela\\" and loved to hear their take on the movie. He sounds just like Jerry Seinfeld, with the same sense of humor, and she is sexy and charming.Yeah the ending is \\"shocking\\" but it's not as if they didn't give you some hints throughout the movie.Buy it for a party on Halloween, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flop.","review":"This is Bush's worst album without a doubt.It has its moments, but overall it just sounds way to sqeaky clean and polished.Best moments are \\"Inflatable\\" AND \\"Out of This World\\", the rest is just throw away material and really is'nt very interesting.For the real BUSH check out the raw and less focussed sound of \\"Razorblade Suitcase\\" or the alternative sound of \\"The Science of Things.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album from start to finish!","review":"I love this Album. It's a real rock record. With only one suB par offering-my engine is with you. Everything else is deep and powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Treat!","review":"With the release of Bush's latest album Golden State, Bush has pulled themselves out of the hole they dug with releasing The Science of Things.The new CD contains instant hits like Headful of Ghost, Solutions and The People That We Love. When I first picked up the CD, I couldn't get enough of Headful of Ghosts and I still can't. It's one of those songs that you can easily repeat twenty times and not get bored with it. This is one of those CDs that you can play on a dreary, rainy day to lift your spirits; it's that good.I was happy to see that Bush is beginning to return to the days of Sixteen Stone's hits like Everything Zen and Machine Head. I would definately recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half of a masterpiece","review":"\\"Golden State\\" has a lot going for it. In particular, the first four tracks and closer \\"Float\\" are some of the very best songs in the Bush catalogue; I might even nominate \\"Superman\\" for best song Gavin Rossdale's written. So far so good...Unfortunately, the rest of the album doesn't quite rise to the same level. \\"Out of This World\\" is a good song taken on its own, but held up next to \\"Letting the Cables Sleep\\" it can't help but feel like a somewhat pale retread. Likewise, songs like \\"Fugitive\\" and \\"Land of the Living\\" are solid, but too formulaic to really get excited about. (Also, \\"Fugitive\\" and \\"Hurricane\\" are so similar sounding, it's unbelievable that they're sequenced one after another-- you might not even notice the transition.)I would still definitely recommend picking up \\"Golden State\\" on the strength of five absolutely amazing songs and several good ones. It's just not the front-to-back triumph that the first three Bush albums are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive","review":"Although there has been hype for Golden State, there's little that's very great about it. It's not as bad as some of the fourth-generation grunge and so-called punk that's been overplayed, but it still has no edge Bush once had. Filled in the album, the Bush-we-all-knew tunes, and there are only three okay tracks. There's the strong \\"The People That We Love\\", which is best for its quality guitar sound. Also, there's \\"Headful of Ghosts\\" which is average at best, with \\"Cold Contagious\\" resemblance. Other than that, \\"Inflatible\\" is the only decent track, with the great melody from Rossdale. Rather than buy this, buy the first three STUDIO albums, Sixteen Stone, Razorblade Suitcase, and The Science of Things, before you're let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush goes back to Sixteen Stone style","review":"Bush is back! And in origonal form. You won't find the electronica influence on Golden State that was ever so present on Bush's most recent albums. It's back to the basics for Bush. You can tell by the energy and harmony that their just rockin out and having a good time, which is what Bush is best at. I have to say that this album is dangerously close to being Bush's best album (Sixteen Stone winning by a hair). There's not one weak track. Although my favorates are the catchy \\"Headful of Ghosts\\" and exploding \\"Reasons\\". So if you want a good rock album with a band just rockin out and having a great time, Golden State is for you. (By the way, the video for \\"The People That We Love\\" is awesome)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best","review":"\\"Golden State\\" is a good album, but it's not great.

Sometimes if you follow a band for a long time, whether or not you think you'll like the CD, you feel obligated to buy it. Well I did, and I was really looking forward to it on the drive there. When I got home though, my enthusiasm faded. I was wanting to hear something new, but deep down i wanted to hear their Brit-grunge all over. The first few songs are good, and about two more throughout the CD. The rest, while not being BAD songs, have nothing special. They sound complacite, cliched, and predictable: exactly what I don't want in a new CD. When a breakdown was coming (a very nice Bush signature move) you could tell way before time, and a big crescendo/build-up was coming you could tell. And, something that i really don't like, the single \\"The People That We Love,\\" is the best song on the CD. So in short, this CD is good for a Bush fan, but if you're borederline pick up \\"Razorblade Suitcase\\" or \\"Sixteen Stone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever!!","review":"I have been a Bush fan since Sixteen Stone.

I was kinda disappointed by the album for the most part, though, there are some high points on the album. The highlights of the album are \\"Superman\\" and \\"Inflatable\\", the first being a really excellent song, the second a great, slow ballad. The biggest surprise of the album was the punk on the song \\"My Engine is with You\\", and Bush does do a good job of pulling it off. The rest of the album is the standard Bush fare ranging from crunchy-guitar driven songs to other acoustic ballads. The rest of the album is decent, not excellent, but above average. Recommended for all those die-hard Bush fans that never want to see them change. For some, though, a little change would not hurt and Bush could use a little revamping in my opinion. Anyway not a bad album, but not even close to the quality of 16 Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst sales, Best tales","review":"This album was thrown under the bus when no one was looking, but it is simply their best album since 'Sixteen Stone.' Whereas 'Razorblade Suitcase' was status quo and 'The Science of Things' lacked a defined album musical direction, 'Golden State' surfaces as a great comeback with hanuting yet beautiful melodies. Lyrically, it is superior to the last two records and Gavin's vocals are of course gorgeous.Listen to these three tracks and you'll marry this album: 'Solutions,' 'Inflatable,' and Bush's best song ever - 'Float.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush: Golden State","review":"AWESOME!

Their first album was terrific, the second album was not quite as good but still was well worth getting, the third album had a few great songs, a bunch of okay songs, and some that sucked. Now with Golden State, Bush has created an all-time low for themselves without one single good song on the album. It's amazing, even the singles they picked for this album suck. Every minute of this CD is boring and uninspired. It's like Gavin used up every good idea he ever had.

Trust me, I've had this since mid-September, and it will take some time to sink in. I took me around 3 weeks to really appreciate what Bush has done. To me, the single is the worst song on here. But it isn't a bad song. This CD really reminds you of 16-stone after awhile. And there is such a diversty presented on this album, although track 10 sounds like it's for a Tony Hawk game. Anyone who doesn't like this album will have all of the melodic chorus's in their head soon enough. Defintely better than the tidalwave of disappoinments this year.

Amazon does not seem to want to outrightly state where products are made. When I got the product (from a company called Vermont AMERICAN no less), the package was marked Made in China. It shows too. This is a poorly made product. Jaws are difficult to tighten due to threads that bind and once you get it tight enough with a wrench, they eventually loose tension, especially with smaller taps.

This is not a travel book one would get to learn about hotel rooms and restaurants and tourist sites, but what a wonderful insight into the fascinating culture of Mexico. And by really good writers! The material dates from 1888 to 1978, but time is not so much the issue as insight and perspective. Top notch armchair travel book, and a good book to read before going there for background on a different culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful compilation","review":"Ryan did his homework before putting this book together. Although the stories aren't current, they open a door to the real Mexico. And you have to appreciate the authors. Most of them are good travelers,inquisitive and patient.

Conrad, an experienced studio engineer, recorded the show for Bullfrog at the Justice League on April 6, 2001, yet his name does not appear on the album. This important omission ruins the integrity of Bullfrog and their album and should be the deciding factor of whether or not a person should purchase their music. The music industry doesn't need more dishonest people who participate in this sort of activity. It is time for music lovers to support musicians who are principled and give credit to those who deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired Grooves","review":"There are moments of brilliance on this CD, and in the group's live shows, most of which involve the interaction of the group with their world-class DJ, Kid Koala. What fills up the majority of their time however, is some rather flat, uninspired, generic \\"old school\\" funk. Blurum on the mic has a great voice and rhythm to spare, but his rhymes are dispassionate and forgettable. Tired jams and retread grooves lead you to wonder if this is just a colossal mismatch of talent, or if it's actually a host of good talent with nothing much to say. If you're searching for something really special to spend your money on, my advice is to keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the time and money","review":"The picture quality is ok at most, but has a big lag with the sound.

The signal strength of the cable is cut so substantially that I see more static than it is worth unless I disconnect my internet connection since they share the same cable line. Additionally when you use the remote to turn off the TV tuner it shuts down your whole computer without the opportunity to save anything so I lost a document I was working on but hadn't backed up yet (I know, should back up often but still an unexpected hastle). I would have been better off just doing a quick internet search for tv access online as there are several that you can use for little or no cost.

This was a GREAT book!!! You could really feel the love between Rowdy and Kelly. I couldn't put the book down. I read it in just a few hours. YOU MUST read this book before Nauti Nights!! The sex scenes were very erotic. Rowdy is a very experienced guy and has loved Emily since her Mom married his Dad. He knows he can't have her until she becomes of age, so he joins the marines along with his cousins. He thinks the distance will help because he can't keep himself from touching her. When his tour ends he comes home to find out that something bad has happened to Kelly(she is still a virgin). He helps her through some tough times. That's all I'm going to say for now, but this is a very romantic,erotic book! I liked the second book Nauti Nights too, but this one was so much better!!!

It's completely predictable and not very well written. The sex is okay but the characters are so shallow and the writing is not above 5th grade level. I was bored after 30 pages, started skimming, then jumping, then read the end, and then thought, well that was a waste of 30 minutes. It wasn't bad or offensive or a wall banger; it was just kind of bland and not engaging. I'm not even engaged enough to hate it.

By the time I got through the 2nd chapter, I didn't want to read anymore. Who in their right mind would think it's \\"romantic\\" and \\"sexy\\" to have a guy coming on to you like that after a near rape? Come on! And then to have him tell her he wants to share her with his buddies??? If you want romance, especially military based romance, read Stephanie Tyler I loved her books--not so much erotica but great sex and romance. This was the first book I read by Lora Leigh and I'm not sure I want to try another if this is the demented way her characters act.One more beef with this book--it is TOTALLY unbelievable. I like fantasy as much as the next girl, but really, if the bad guy was just about to take her \\"in the rear\\" do you really think that her scream would have stopped him long enough to wait for the neighbor to come running and break down the door?Sorry--not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Our grandmother's were raised during this era, and you get to see how some of them struggled and how they lived their lives back in the day. There are 3-4 stories that are so interesting.

California Cooper...I love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love J California Cooper","review":"I have all of her short story books and this one doesn't disappoint. I get so much energy and enthusiasm from reading about her downtrodden characters finding strength and purpose through loss and love (in that order).

And it goes without saying that I was not disappointed when it came to reading The Future Has A Past.I loved all four stories. However, A Filet of Soul and The Lost and the Found were my favorites. Ms. Cooper has a way of holding your hand as she introduces you to the people in her stories. She has the ability to pinch just the right nerve at just the right time to let you know that you could have lived the life that the character is living.I just hope that we don't have to wait very long for the next book. But then again...stories by J. California Cooper are like fine wine. Nothing before it's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ex-Ce-LLent........","review":"J California Cooper writes with the songs of yesterday and her words are very clear.This book has 3 stories from the heart in them, my personal favorite was The Eagles Flies...

Louella's mother was abused sexually and mentally while at her school prom. The abuse she suffered she tries to protect Louella from, by degrading her and making her only interest in life be to make money. When we are not used to anything we believe everything is wonderful.

In today's world of fluffed up fairy tales, Henny Penny should probably be rewritten to have received some other consequence other than being barbequed.I was not impressed with Paul Galdone's illustrations.

We bought 12 in each size (14 and 17 ounce) and in three different colors: plum, slate blue, and sage green. The combination is striking; we've received several complements from friends who would typically not notice that type of thing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing Red","review":"While seeing red may not mean something good, in this case it is. The color red in glass is hard to find and when you do it isn't cheap. These glasses are thick and heavy and beautiful too. My wife wanted them for her corner hutch and with the light shining on them from above, wow!Looking for some really nice red glasses? Look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not functional","review":"I've been shopping on Amazon regularly for years and haven't bothered to review a product, but I felt it was important to warn folks away from these glasses.I'll start with the Good:They are heavy, and appear to be high quality - they look fantastic and will impress your guests.The Bad:They crack easily and react poorly to temperature changes. I poured some chilled vodka and ice into one of these glasses last week and when I picked the glass up, it split apart. I've never quite seen anything like it, it looked as if someone had taken a samurai sword and sliced the thing in half! The bottom crashed down unto my foot while I stood there soaked in vodka staring dumbly at the top half of the glass.If you're looking for purple glasses that look nice on your table, these are winners. If you plan on using them and don't want your guests soaked, move along friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"The first set I had bought awhile back had thicker glass...the latest set I bought had much thinner glass...not happy with that~"},{"rating":"1","title":"These glasses are for looks not use.","review":"I have had two sets for 6 mos. and most of the glasses have cracked from usage. They are not small cracks either, they are big and can be dangerous if they crack and break whild holding/drinking from them. These glasses should not be used for drinking, only decoration. I placed these in the dishwasher (mistake) but even if you wash by hand they still don't hold up.DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lovely mess","review":"I loved the look and feel of these glasses. They got many compliments from visitors. I've had mine for about a month now, and one of them cracked tonight when I poured cold water into it. Fortunately, the glass didn't shatter, but it is completely unusable. Something about the way these glasses are made causes them to crack and break for no reason. Of course, now I see the other reviews bringing up this problem, too, but it's too late for me. It's not too late for you! You're better off buying a sturdier glass elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peferfecto!","review":"My kitchen was just remodeled and this glassware added to the Tuscan Flair I was trying to achieve.

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL COLOR!!","review":"These glasses are such a beautiful shade of purple. If you're looking for glasses with an unusual color...this is it!! Large and just a little on the heavy side...so not great for elderly individuals. Would definitely recommend this item!! LOVE THESE GLASSES!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy duty","review":"I was so tired of glasses braking that I decided to try this style. These are great! No more falling over in the sink or opening the dishwasher to find a broken glass. The color is more slate than cobalt which I desired. They were correctly listed so I can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Even Better Price","review":"Already have a set of 8 highballs - love the individual handblown details and weight of the glasses. Each glass holds a whole can of soda. The set of 4 I just bought are 'extras' for breakage. BEST PRICE AROUND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but...","review":"I love the look of these glasses. The color is beautiful, and is accurately represented in the photo. The only drawback to these lovely glasses is the weight! They are VERY heavy, thus making them difficult to hold once they are filled with liquid. Had I realized how heavy they would be when filled, I probably wouldn't have ordered them. I like how they look, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prettier than the picture","review":"Love these glasses...they were exactly what I was looking for...and I didn't have to leave my kitchen to find them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking glasses","review":"I really liked these glasses, I just think they were a little pricey, but I really needed them. We a hit at Thanksgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....glasses don't look like picture","review":"I ordered the light green. They look like the green glasses from Mexico that have matching pitchers, which is fine, however not what I expected nor had hoped for. They are nothing like the picture, with the nice light and dark green contrast. The glasses I received are solid green. The website picture looks more artsy/classy. They seem to be nicely made. Although a made in China sticker is on the bottom of each glass. I prefer to buy USA products, so that too was disappointing. Wonder if the other pretty plum and turquoise glasses look like their pics? Maybe I'd like them better. Not going to chance it, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful heavy duty glasses","review":"These are very nice glasses! They are made of very thick glass and the color is really ruby red.

However, I ordered green, the invoice says green, but the sticker on the bottom says \\"sage\\" -- a much lighter less vibrant color. Too much trouble to make the switch. When I told Amazon, they gave me a small refund. It all turned out okay, and the sage color is really growing on me.

Another great one, lesser known, is All through the Night. I've been addicted to cheesecake since I watched it though, so be careful. It is more the typical pre-Bacall Bogart movie with a lot of twists and turns.From what I have read Bogart was like his Joe character, a really good down to earth guy, but a hero when he needed to be. What a shame he wasn't around longer, but we have the great Casablanca, the Maltese Falcon, the African Queen, Tokyo Joe and others to watch, thanks to his all too short career."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN LOVE!!!","review":"Because of my bra size (36 DD) I've always had problems finding good bra's...I discovered wonderbra 7234 while I was in holidays in the US, and I can't live without them since!it's the perfect combination between push-up (having an ample bosom doesn't mean you don't need a little push), comfort, sexy design, good quality and affordable price!I just bought 8 of them! i just hope wonderbra will continue to make this WONDERFUL model!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never ever leave you !!","review":"I feel so sexy and natural with this bra I wear a 34D and this bra lifts my breast and makes them look perfect!Plump and Round.

I buy one in every color every 2 months. The average lifespan of a bra is 2 months.

I'm a 34B and I had the straps as long as they could get and it was still a struggle to even get it on. They were digging into my shoulders after only a few hours, making it very uncomfortable. I've never had this problem with a bra before-I have other wonderbra's (that are also pushups) that don't do this so I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not right to size..","review":"My husband bought this bra for me... and I'm a 34B... and it just didn't fit.. and not only that the strap broke within days... the center part in the picture.. is not there.. this is not a correct picture of the product...

I'm having my husband get a refund.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fit is way off (in my size, at least)","review":"I purchased this bra based on the rave reviews I found on other websites. Now, this could be a fine bra in other sizes, and perhaps for those in my size with a lot of fullness on top (or augmented). But for me the fit was way off (34D). Too much padding for that cup size. Also, the shape of the bra was not as pictured. It cut across horizontally like a balconette, not a plunge bra as pictured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much smaller than my current bra (exactly same model)","review":"My cat chewed up the strap of my black Wonderbra that I loved, so I went online to hunt for another one. I found it on Amazon, and happily ordered it. However, the one I received (same size and model as my old one) is a lot smaller. I have to adjust the straps out to the maximum length...and it's still almost not long enough. ?? Rather than go through the hassle of returning it I decided to give it a try, but I'm sorry I did. Now I cannot use my contraption that turns it into a crossback bra because the straps are not long enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Bra...Runs Small in Size!","review":"Purchased this bra along with a pair of gel inserts for a little extra lift. Very pleased with the price of the bra and the quality (considering the cost) but found the size to be extremely small.

Other reviewers write about how the straps and cups runs a bit small. The bra fit me just right. I love this bra. This is a Wonderbra it's sopose to create cleavage and make you look bigger. The band size is just right (my bra size). I can fit two fingers in the back of the bra useing the first row of hooks. The cup size fits like a glove. For the straps, I adjust'ed the straps, great fit. I bought this in (frost). It is very pretty and sexy and it does add a size or more. I love wearing my Wonderbra.

Michael is my most favorite radio personality and had been listening for years until i moved out of the area.I thought this book started off slow in the introduction and in the first chapter, but after that, it really took off. To me, most of the stuff Michael says is just plain common sense. I have a few disagreements with his opinions, but I think he is saying what is needed to be said on a lot of issues.The warning at the beginning says it all, this book is NOT for the easily offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this would be interesting ...","review":"but what a boring book!! I found the stories to be about issues that seemed trite and uninteresting, and about very little I could personally relate to. I saw the author on a television talk show, and he seemed to be a good story teller, but I didn't find the book itself to reflect that. I thought he was a bit of blowhard and I just got irritated at his perspective. I read through about half the book before I decided it wasn't going to get any better for me.

Sure, we all wish these examples of the world-gone-overly-PC weren't true, but in today's environment each of these stories ended up exactly as one would expect.If that weren't all, the book is poorly written, taking stories that should be a page or two long and making them five or more pages by adding an unnecessary amount of pontification and parenthesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, horrid, total waste of money.","review":"Don't buy this book.

I normally get a french manicure (gel) on my nails with OPI products once every 4 or 5 weeks. Just recently I started painting my own nails in between my manicures and have been getting amazing results with the Start-to-Finish.Using it as a base coat assures that the color doesn't bleed into the edges of my manicure (for when I want to go back to just the white tips) and also helps the color adhere well. My technician did tell me that this base coat does adhere better to gel nails than bare ones, if that helps. She also highly recommended that I do just three swipes (center, and each edge) with each coat. Over-painting with each coat can cause some of the problems people have with chipping.Once I have my nails painted, top coated, and completely dry, I can get at least a week without chipping.

His reign of terror was from 1990-1995, and I could never figure out why he dissappeared for so long. But alas, the master is back with the ill beats and... hey, where are the rhymes? The Mad Scientist has some pretty good hooks in his tracks, but the lyrics are lacking. Then again, I didn't buy this album for the lyrics! It's all about the crazy ill beats; the hooks were a total bonus. This CD is totally worth having in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This can't be wack ya'll it's a good hip-hop album","review":"I don't understand why a lot of people would be dissin' on this album.

Nas), 'Bout That Time, Ultimate, just a few others I can name.Mos definitely I hope that he'll collaborate on a record with Kanye one day and help produce the record or something.Yeah this would be tight, you know what I'm sayin?Just call it \\"pure hip-hop\\" or \\"clean hip-hop\\" which I say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably one of the most slept on albums in past few years","review":"His beats are progressive(very street and a grimey edge) with a little of old school feel.

Emily Browning plays a young woman with a history of mental problems who, upon meeting her father's new fiance, is immediately suspicious; creepy goings-on ensue. The Uninvited is moody and well acted, but it also contains plenty of haunted house conventions and telegraphed plot twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful remake of a great movie","review":"This movie probably wouldn't seem so dreadful if you hadn't already seen Tale of Two Sisters, the Korean film from which it was adapted, and a excellent film. The plots are quite similar, some scenes even stolen completely from the original in staging, acting, and mood. But the Guard boys missed the point of the original movie, and as a result have made a boring, unscary and pointless film out of a terrifying, bittersweet one. The basic problem is the stepmother--the stepmother in Two Sisters is insane; she has to be insane in order to make the plot work. They seem not to have realized that. Add uninspired acting, a bunch of pawns playing out a logic puzzle as the girls try to figure out who their father's girlfriend really is, and none of the symbolism that the Korean film had. It's just a mediocre remake of a movie that shouldn't have been touched."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Uninvited","review":"Anna returns home after spending time in the hospital following the tragic death of her mother. Her recovery suffers a setback when she discovers her father has become engaged to her mother's former nurse. That night, Anna is visited by her mother's ghost, who warns her of Rachel's intentions. Together, Anna and her sister try to convince their father that his current fiancee is not who she pretends to be, and what should have been a happy family reunion becomes a lethal battle of wills between stepdaughters and stepmother. This is a good movie, the twists and turns in this movie came to a unpredictable ending which is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoyed it!","review":"The movie is well done, and frankly, it has a good twist. There is sufficient enough re-direction in the plot that it kept my 'willing suspension of disbelief' going until the end. I think the movie is well worth seeing. A lot better than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge downer","review":"I almost gave this movie two stars for its professional acting and cinematography, however, the subject matter is so depressing and is too similar to other creepy thrillers, it also has the same \\"surprise\\" ending as High Tension, which was a much superior horror movie.I didn't feel entertained nor did I like the selfish characters. The subject matter was a major downer and the ending was just lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly interesting, but not particularly \\"thrilling\\"","review":"Horror movie fans aren't likely to find it anything particularly out of the ordinary. The last fifteen minutes of the movie are okay, but you have to stick with it for a long time to get that far.It's really a difficult movie to review, because I can't find anything overtly good or bad about it. I was in \\"ho hum\\" mode for most of it, and kept telling my husband, \\"Maybe we should just shut it off and find another one to watch.\\" The acting wasn't bad, the film wasn't bad, nothing was acutally \\"bad.\\" It was just boring to the nth degree up to the end. The ending is the only reason I give it two stars. That being said, the ending has been done much better in several other movies, so I couldn't give it three."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend even renting this","review":"Definitely suspenseful and a bit scary and creepy, but the plot was predictable and so were all the twists in it. The girl who played Anna had distracting lips. I felt like I was watching an Angelina Jolie wannabe. There are holes in the story, and I didn't really enjoy it excluding the few frightening jumps it gave me. Get it as a freebie with a coupon or at a redbox on Mondays with a promo code like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifetime Movie With That Is A Better Than Average Thriller","review":"T he Uninvited is a rather pleasent surprise. The movie starts off as a ghost story; where a girl returns to her home after being put into a psychiatric hospital. She became unglued after witnessing her mother's death in a fire. She finds another woman living with her father and the girl's negative reaction to Step-Mom leads to a series of events including murder.What I liked most about this movie is its reaonably intelligent screenplay. The ending was pretty clever and a big surprise to anyone NOT paying attention to what was on the screen.A decent rental or purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that!!! Hollywood's unoriginal version....","review":"Well Hollywood does it once again by attempting to take a foreign film and adapting it to the mainstream market. Without going into detail, (don't want to spoil the movie) if you have already seen the original Korean version \\"A Tale of Two Sisters\\" this remake will feel like a let down, and will not \\"thrill\\" you since you already know the plot before the movie even begins. Hollywood followed the original Korean version almost to the letter, and I assume they bought the rights in order to do so.The original version is far superior to this remake in my opinion, but if you simply cannot tolerate movies with subtitles or have no interest in Asian cinema, then this version maybe worth a peek. I would recommend waiting for the DVD release. 2 stars for its lack of originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"We SHOULD NOT have INVITED this movie into our Friday night at the theatre","review":"My friend treated me to this movie on a Friday night.There are no suspenseful or scary scenes here.There are a couple of twists.

I was in fact a little confused after watching the movie. Is she dead or alive? What's going on here? Is she a ghost or what? So I watched the second time. Then I realized one thing about this new style of ghost movie: the ghost is not a ghost anymore, the ghost is a \\"human\\", just like anybody else in the movie. It's intriguing, mysterious, and makes you say out loud: \\"WTF, she is already dead!\\" This new trend in ghost movie has becoming more & more common. Another similar style to this one is \\"Passagers\\" (starring Anne Hathaway). In the end of the movie, your immediate expression (in a good way): \\"What?\\", \\"WTF!\\", \\"Oh..\\", \\"Wow..\\".

Same trite story of girl leaves mental hospital because of tragedy in family comes home to a dysfunctional household. The twist, copied from another movie, that I forget at the moment (must also have been bad) is the presence of a another person as seen though the eyes of ex-mental hospital girl except this other person doesn't exist and you aren't suppose to learn that until the end. Everything is boringly cliched and predictable to that point. Conclusion - one star for copy cat film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uninvited","review":"I thought this movie was really good.

Then I bought this movie, and I wish I hadn't. The problem may have been that I expected Shivers to be an extremely high quality movie like the two aforementioned movies, but it is not. It is, in my opinion, a run of the mill B horror movie. It is bloody, and has Cronenberg's characteristic sexual content but after watching it once I knew that I wasn't going to be watching it again for a LONG time. I found myself laughing at it more than anything. If you are one who finds these movies amusing for comic relief, you'll probably like this movie more than I did.

With it's theme of \\"sexual-revolution-gone-mad\\", and David Cronenberg's unflinching use of deviation and violence, this film is guaranteed to get someone really worked up! Some of the disturbing images forever burned into my cranium include rape, incest, and two half-naked kids crawling around on leashes! Yikes! Aside from all of the unsettling imagery, and also because of it, SHIVERS remains one of the best of Cronenberg's early works. His genius lies in taking the insanely ridiculous, and making it terribly believable. As in his bizarre follow-up RABID, we get a parasitic threat that takes control of human hosts. Let's just say that SHIVERS takes the \\"free love\\" of the 60s, and hits it straight between the eyes w/ the STDs and numbness of the 70s! A twisted, horror masterpiece...

Another downside to the movie are the characters- they are pretty creepy looking for a Christmas children movie, especially the main character and that constant, annoying grin he keeps on his face.I remember reading the book every year in elementary school- they would turn a section of the library into a train and we would read the book aloud- a great, imaginative story but a stupid, unimaginative movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross-eyed Characters = 1 Star","review":"The fact that every character was cross-eyed totally ruined this movie for me. I can't comment on any other aspect of the film because I was constantly distracted by those eyes. At first I thought it was my imagination, but after looking closely (and constantly), I confirmed that one pupil was not aligned like the other. I can't believe that someone like Robert Zemeckis could allow such inferior animation to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"In A Nutshell... Creepy","review":"Well, to start with let me say that I have the highest regard for both Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis. In fact, I will go out of my way to see movies that these two are involved. So when I started hearing bad press about this movie I ignored it and went and saw this with an open mind.Here's my verdict in a nutshell... creepy.The animation is a huge let down. The characters look like fuzzy zombies from a video game intro (many have even referred to this movie as the Resident Evil of Christmas cartoons).I can't believe the studios (and theres a heck of a lot of them) decided to put their money on the line and release this highly disturbing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy for true 3D television set up","review":"I was excited to get this movie, as we had not seen it before. Opened it to enjoy with our new 3D setup, and was disappointed to find that it did not work with out setup. It looks like maybe you could use the red and blue (old 3D) glasses that came with it, but I can only see out of one eye, so that was never an option for me. I will try to return to Amazon, hopefully they will take it back :(On the plus side, I now know what to look for in the descriptions to make sure that I get \\"TRUE\\" 3D for my 3D-tv. If it does not say \\"To watch this movie in Blu-ray 3D, you will need a 3D-capable television and active-shutter or passive-shutter glasses as well as a 3D-capable Blu-ray player.

I purchased this because I have a Samsung 3D TV (7000). I just assumed this would work on my TV, but it doesn't. I tried the paper glasses to see if they work, and they do to some degree. However, I have no idea how you could sit through the entire film with those paper glasses. Regardless, the 3D didn't work on my 3D TV, so I'll just keep it and watch it in 2D instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polar Express 3D","review":"The film is 1950's 3D vintage.

We tried watching it with the 3D glasses it came with. It was horrible, not clear, lots of \\"double\\" vision going on. The same day I purchased some other 3D glasses that had good reviews and were not made of paper or scratched.Here we are watching it in the new glasses...still no go. Still have double vision and an unclear awful picture. Watch the regular version and turn up the sound. It's a better experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie but horrible 3-D","review":"The first time that I ever saw The Polar Express it was in the IMAX 3-D format and we found it absolutely enthralling. I eagerly purchased the DVD when it was released, and we still loved it even though it was not in 3-D. When I learned that it was being re-released on DVD in a 3-D version I automatically ordered a copy even though I already owned it on DVD. I was very disappointed. The 3-D technology on the home version is not nearly as compelling as the process used in the theatrical version. I don't know all of the ins and outs of theatrical 3-D effects, but I remember it being far superior than what I just started to watch tonight. I saved the glasses from the IMAX 3-D presentation of this film, and both lenses are a light grey tint, while the home 3-D version uses the old red & blue lens technology resulting in a blurry double image. If you already own this movie don't waste your money expecting a true 3-D experience- you won't get it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is Fabulous, 3-D is HORRIBLE!!","review":"Do not bother purchasing this in 3D version, the quality is horrible. We were so excited about the possibility of this movie being in 3D because we absolutely LOVE this movie. But the picture was just as bad with the glasses on as they are without the glasses. Just very poorly done and EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. . . But please purchase this in 2D version!

The book was better. I mean the book was only 12 or 32 pages. But the movie has like 85 or less minutes. Come on, a book thats short shouldn't have a really long movie. I think who made this movie is just plain stupid. It's only about a kid going to the North Pole to meet Santa. But in the movie, it has action. It shouldn't. So I would give this a -150 stars but can only give it a 1 star.Eddie Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This should have been made with live action characters like the Wizard of Oz, Willie Wonka etc. with a smidgen of computer graphics when needed. The characters looked stiff and unnatural and it was just plain boring to watch. This was way overhyped. Save your money and if you're really curious, rent it. Don't get me wrong, I like computer graphics and love almost anything Pixar does, but this was just lacking.

This version has very little of the color of the original HD or Blu-Ray versions, and the double or ghost images of the 3D effect are very noticeable and distracting. The 3D effect is quite nice in some scenes but the quality of the 3D images themselves is very inferior to theatrical 3D releases.In short, I'll keep this one for the novelty of some of the 3D scenes, but I wouldn't recommend it over the regular HD or Blu-Ray version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario C","review":"The story and animation was great.

Reading the reviews it sounds as tho many rec'd a disc that is true 3-d. Mine has a 2-d disc and a 3-d disc that uses some cheasy kid cardboard glasses. I have a true HD 3-d I just purchased a few months ago and was really looking forward to watching this in true 3-d. I notice the casing does not say blu-ray. Can anyone expand on my understanding (after the fact) that unless you get blue-ray 3-d you are not getting the true 3d dvd to be watched on the new tvs? And why did some buyers get what seems to be the real deal as advertised and others such as myself get the \\"low budget\\" version?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"As with those that are writing about the 3d version only I would also strongly advise you to save your money. The glasses that come with the movie are a complete waste of time and my Sony glasses don't work with the movie.

It misses the mark by a fair bit, and this animated movie highlights why the Pixar animated movies are so successful. Pixar starts with the story and characters and gives them depth and substance, which extends to the animation. This film takes the opposite approach to its own detriment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my $$$ on this garbage?","review":"The answer is yes. The story itself is wonderful. The 3D version has to be the biggest piece of 3D junk ever produced. No matter how I tried, move the glasses closer to my eyes, further from my eyes, whatever, there were obvious ghosting of images still visible. The 3D should stand for 3 \\"D\\"oses of Excedrin because that is what you'll need for your headache after trying to watch this train wreck (yes the pun is intended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Christmas story","review":"I have never read the book, but I found this movie to be really sweet. It's the type of movie you can feel free to let your kids watch. There are some great characters. All of them have unique personalities. That is part of the beauty of this movie. The characters are not clones of each other. They each have unique qualities about them. You really get to know who they are throughout the movie. I also like how the brilliant, yet impatient and selfish boy gets taught the lesson that he needs to learn. Billy learns that he now has people he can count on in his life. The little girl realizes that she is a leader (an honest leader, too). The main boy learns how to believe, which is something we all need, not necessarily for believing in Santa Claus, but we all need to know how to do that and not get overly sceptical. Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for 3-D TV","review":"This version is not made for 3-D TVs. It comes with cheap 3-D glasses that are virtually unusable.

The characters are bland,and their movements are creepy and mechanical, both of which make them feel more like robots than humans. The film's biggest problem is that it dosen't seem to know whether to treat itself like a horror movie, a children's Christmas cartoon, or a slapstick comedy. The film overflows with half-baked ideas,for instance,there is a mysterious hobo-zombie who makes his homeon the train's roof and a room filled with abandoned toys. It is NOT an exaggeration to describe the film as creepy, as many other reviewers have. While not quite the ''cat''astrophe of the Seuess films,THE POLAR EXPRESS is still something of a train wreck.SCORE:4/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing images of children in constant peril.","review":"The animation in this movie is vaguely disturbing.The story of freakish looking children constantly in peril and surrounded by unfriendly, bizarre, nightmarish characters has no payoff after you sit through two uncomfortable hours.There isn't an ounce of warmth or sweetness in this disaster of a movie.

The characters were awful: A goody-two-shoes girl, a boy who is determined not to have fun, and a dumb boy who doesn't believe in Santa even if he is surrounded by elves. The movie is boring. The only exciting bits are motion simulators, and the bits that try to be funny just aren't. With all the computer animation these days, you'd think that they'd make a GOOD story to go along with the visuals.It's all just chit chat about nothing, and two songs that are just flat out weird. I do not recommend this to anyone who hasn't read the book, because you won't want to read it after this movie.The time of the movie is entirely taken up by a really boring and depressing train ride. It seemse like the creators wanted the movie to be long enough, so the filled it in with junky parts.Santa was scowly, and seemed mean. The movie was flat out awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polar Express 3D Blu Ray","review":"I have to start by saying I love this movie and watch it each year at Christmas time.

He is perfect for his \\"roles\\", and watching this movie, you can really feel that he is a dad too...that he bore that in mind when making the decision to make the film, and during his performances in this film (albeit animated (CG'D) performances). There are some thrilling edge-of-your seat moments that some smaller viewers may find a little too tense, but it is like I say, THRILLING! I am down-right giddy with regard to this movie's arrival on DVD. Josh Groban's voice is spectacular on the soundtrack, which is also worth parting with a few of your hard-earned dollars in order to own and enjoy for Christmases to come!

I did grow up seeing and reading this book in school and I think the film is as beautiful an adaptation as any. I sent a copy of this to a friend for her young son and was shocked when she reported back that her family didn't like it. I'm pretty sure they turned it off and never finished it. It was, apparently, too creepy for her fiance. Yes, that's right, her fiance. While I can admit that there are a couple scenes that do not follow the guidelines for your average, family, holiday film, I think \\"creepy\\" is a little too strong a word. Then again, that's what makes the world go around.I think this is a gorgeous, thoughtful movie that is deeper than many others. The music alone is wonderful, but the whole experience is artistic and meaningful. My family has made it a tradition to watch it every Christmas Eve. We'll be doing that for years and years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Polar Express 3-D blu-ray","review":"when we watched the movie with the 3-D glasses you could see two images ... not sure if there was something wrong with the DVD.

The regular version of this movie is outstanding. However, the 3D version is absolutely visually awful. It is really poor quality 3D and not worth paying the extra money.

My 5 years old son is at the age questioning about Santa and was planning to stay late to wait for Santa. After watching this movie, he changed his mind. After poured a cup of milk, got a plateful cookie for Santa and couple of apples for Santa's Reindeer, he went to sleep. Next morning my son was very happy to find out that Santa and his reindeer came to our house and ate the food. He exclaimed \\"Yes, Santa IS real!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Legacy from Tom Hanks","review":"While my husband thought this movie was \\"okay\\", I was viewing it through the eyes of the child I become each year at Christmas. I loved every second of it and thought the storyline and animation was outstanding. There were only a few minor points (what child would go with strangers - but then again, the movie was set in a different time, when kids played in the street into the dark hours and neighbors could be trusted).In my opinion, Tom Hanks knew he had the resources to leave this world a Christmas legacy including a few new carols that will undoubtedly become part of our holiday folklore. I think this project inspired him to leave us this beautiful and wondrous gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all children! Preview first.","review":"My husband and I rented the DVD and previewed it before showing it to my 3 year old son who loves trains. I am very glad that we did that because it was way too scary to be shown to him. There are several scenes where the children are walking on top of a snow covered train and almost fall off. Another scene has the train losing control on a lake of ice and then the ice starts to crack. There is also a mystery ghost man who \\"lives\\" on top of the moving train. I know that all children are different, but I can't imagine letting my son see this movie until he is much older. I suggest that you preview this movie before you give it to the little ones in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, creepy, creepy!!!!!","review":"I have never written a review, but I have to warn you all about this one. What a horrible, creepy movie!!!! I thought this was going to be some warm, feel-good Christmas classic, but instead I felt like I was watching a children's episode of Resident Evil at the North Pole. The creepy echoes, desolate villages, and scary elves are sure to give me nightmares tonight - and I'm 36 years old! And what was with the Steve Tyler (Aerosmith) elf singing at the end? Oh, brother. If I could give this a ZERO, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh... why?","review":"The only reason to see this movie, in my opinion, is if you are a young child. I am eleven years old. Too old to find it entertaining. I have read the excellent Chris Van Allsburg book (be sure to check out his other awesome books too) every Christmas Eve night pretty much. It has this nice smell when I open it. But it should have stayed a book. It went on for about an hour and a half longer than it should have, and most of this irrelevant time frame was spent sliding, screeching, or walking down or up areas at high speed, like on top of the train, sliding down a gift shute, etc., et(yawn)c. For me it took away the whole charm of the book to see an action-packed Polar Express. If you have to add superfluous things to a book-movie, then it should stay a book. I haven't seen Zathura yet, but maybe it will be better than this unneeded venture into animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid 2004 version like the plague!","review":"This is a good movie, but if you want 3-D do NOT buy the 2004 version.

My dvd version had a 1.85:1 ration that fills up the entire screen on my tv. The blu-ray version is like 1.240:1 which gives you about 20 inches on a 60 inch screen. I couldn't see any higher quality with it being in 1080p over the dvd.

So it was about a 10foot screen, and I must say, for home 3D especially with anaglyphic technology, amazing, hands down the BEST 3D movie that I own for this format. I do own a few shutter DVDs as well, far better technology, but does not work on an LCD projector.

I kept thinking something was wrong with the TV or lighting or even maybe the glare but after trying different things I realized that it was just the poor quality in 3-D. It is true the Red images and Blue images do not come together - for the entire movie you see double of everything. The snow effect and other small items will come in 3-D pretty good but all in all, I wish I had never gotten it without reading all the reviews.

Using the red blue glasses also erase most of the color content and the cheap cardboard glasses are uncomfortable. Too bad they couldn't have duplicated the great 3 D that was shown in theatres. Warner Brothers should learn to perfect this system. I have been anxiously awaiting a good 3 D quality movie for years and have wondered why they think a red/blue pair of glasses is going to provide the effects. Also...the 3D effect is so much better with JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF EARTH (this time going red/green glasses why can't they at least give a better 3D effect with this great holiday movie. Very unhappy with this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this","review":"I recently purchased The Polar Express... again. The plot is cloying, the central theme revolving around cardboard characters. The backgrounds are exquisite. The faces of the characters are likely frightening to younger children and are extremely off-putting, in particular, the character of the main female lead. Plot points are made with a sledge hammer... repeatedly, but as my wife said, for little kids, that might be appropriate. But some of the scenes would probably frighten little kids.I wanted to like this. I like Tom Hanks, I like Christmas and I like Christmas movies. This one though seems geared to getting Christmas presents, characters are introduced and leave. The subplot labored, all in all, unless you are a fan of commercial Christmas, I would suggest giving this a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst 3D ever","review":"Love, Love, Love this movie, so I decided to buy the 3D version for my kids this year!

My husband and I got an instant headache just by watching it for a few minutes with the 3-D glasses on. We tried the blue ray dvd player and even real 3-D glasses from the theater... nothing worked. To their credit, a few scenes were OK, (we skipped the movie to the most visually stimulating scenes), but generally speaking is not worth to hurt your family's eyes when the original version is almost 3-D by itself!

We settled in on Christmas night to watch Polar Express. Her first words was that the animation was kind of eery and spooky. I commented that it was like watching a movie with animation that had the same look and feel of photo's from childrens books. Maybe we were too used to the amazing animation from studio's such as Disney's Pixar? We loved CARS, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc etc. The bottom line was that the animation for Polar Express was just too odd to keep us interested and we turned it off after 20 minutes and switched over to watching \\"Cars\\" from Pixar.

I urge Warner Bros. to go back and re-issue this in proper 3D form, similar to the \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\", and let consumers get a replacement disc.

Instead I found the Polar Express to be an eerily creepy animated film wherein CGI characters replace human beings with a mannequin-like unnatural quality I found unsettling. The worst animated character was Santa who didn't look very jolly at all, and seemed to scowl and frown for most of his appearance in a stern manner I found unpleasant.At times the computerized nonsense reached a new height of frenzy (such as the hot chocolate scene) which might appeal to children but made me want to reach for the fast-forward button.The only character which I thought seemed natural was the black girl, whose personality and character stole the show.1 star. Huge disappointment. Creepy moppet-like characters, frenzied animation and no plot to speak of. May appeal to really young kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polar Express","review":"I have not watched this movie yet I am saving it for Christmas. The Previews of the movie were very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our new favorite","review":"I'm not even done watching this movie and I absolutely love it. This movie is all about that meloncholy time in a child's life where they fall into the chasm between innocent childhood and cynical \\"growing up\\" and the beauty of finding out it's still possible to believe in magic. As Santa says in the end... \\"The true spirit of Christmas lies in your heart\\".Even though this movie is about Christmas, it is not a singularly religious film (a well-placed Jewish elf makes that clear) and it's not sappy, sweet, stuff ...I love the \\"angel\\" train hobo, the mafia-esque video-monitoring elves and the \\"blue-collar\\" style elves in charge of the presents.Ohh, this is just a beautiful story turned into a beautiful film and a new classic in our family from this point on. I cried at the end and was just so grateful that my kids can grow up knowing the true spirit of Christmas, which this movie helps teach."},{"rating":"1","title":"3D Polar Express movie","review":"When I ordered 3D Polar Express movie, I assume it was a movie for a 3D TV.It was a format to wear paper 3D glasses on a regular TV and very disappointing because it was a gift for my sister.With confusing electronic technology these days, a clear description would be a better way to describe the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to Watch","review":"First and foremost, the character animation in this film is just plain weird. Unfortunately, what would have been a really solid Christmas story has been transformed into something eerie and creepy. The child-like images are strange as are all the other characters. Also, using Tom Hanks voice for half a dozen characters in this film is overkill and nauseating. In particular, his high-pitched screechy voice for the train ghost and conductor is like nails on a chalkboard.Some of the music is very good, but the classic renditions like \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" sung by the elves... Again, very strange. If you like eerie, dark animated content to tell a good Christmas story, you'll be drawn to this one. If you're buying this movie for young children, make sure you have the DVD remote in hand to skip ahead from the more bizarre scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money for 3-D Version","review":"Just repeating what has already been said here many times....the 3-D version is a HUGE disappointment. Wearing the old blue and red glasses, I felt like the red eye was blind and no matter how I tried to maneuver the glasses the picture was at best mediocre. I would get flashes of the 3-D and get excited, but then it would slip back into blurriness. All I got was an incredible headache for my efforts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3D version stinks","review":"I bought the used copy of the 3D version which does include the regular version also, I did everything it said, dark room, TV brightness on high, used glasses properly, but no luck with 3D version coming out any good at all, I googled about this also and saw many complaints that it must be the DVD itself not done correctly in 3D, not even watchable really, unless you want to see double, very faded colors, on and on, look for yourself and save money and do not buy the 3D version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!","review":"The 3D Polar Express is not 3D at all. My grandkids love the movie and when I saw it was out in 3D I thought awesome and ordered it. We were all disappointed and when we checked, the reviews all agree with us.

The movie clips I saw were very child friendly even though the animated characters are a bit weird... When we started watching the movie we only made it to the point where the boy goes to the top of the train to look for the conductor and the girl.. The scary guy made us turn off the move!

As it turns out, it was a total waste of money since we already have a copy of the original movie. The 3-D simply did not work. When we put the glasses on the picture was still almost as fuzzy as it is without the glasses. It is still better to watch it WITH the glasses than without...IF you press them really tight up against your face, but that's about as good as it gets! My husband wears glasses and it was even worse for him. We gave up and watched the regular version. What a dissapointment! The box cover is really cool though. Sadly, it was more fun to watch than the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3D Doesn't Work","review":"My son liked The Polar Express the first time he watched the movie in school. We bought the 3D version hoping it would be like watching Journey to the Center of the Earth. Unfortunately, it wasn't a bit like it.

Second, the glasses are just cheap cardboard. Third, put those two things together and you get a headache.I attempted to watch it with my nephews and we tried watching in seats, on the floor, various levels, and nothing worked. Nothing looked 3D at all. The glasses didn't want to stay on and were made of cheap cardboard. Even with the glasses on you could still see the red/blue lines on the picture. After awhile we all got a headache and gave up.I'm sorry I ever spent the money on the 3D version. Looking forward to upgrading to Blu-Ray, but I think I'll pass on the 3D version there too.Note: This review only refers to \\"The Polar Express Presented in 3-D\\" (DVD) This is NOT a review for the Blu Ray version."},{"rating":"2","title":"3D The Polar Express","review":"I thought this would play on my 3D TV with my 3D blue ray player. The 3 D version (DVD, not blue ray) does not play with a 3 D TV, it is only good on a regular TV. I guess because my LG 3D TV does the conversion in the TV and this movie was made for a regular TV. The price was good, so I will give it away to my Grandson. Shipping was fast and condition of the movies were good, just my mistake. But I do now know you cannot play the old 3D movies made for the paper glasses.Continued: I did send the DVD Polar Express movie to my Grandson. I found this in true 3D, so just remember that you need to see the specifics of the movie before you order. This movie is great in 3D blue Ray version. The effects are as I expected them to be, and I always loved the movie in regular 2D format. I am just spoiled with my new 3D TV. Used the Prime service and arrived as promised. Condition of the movie was perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for 3D t.v.'s","review":"this video is not for 3Dt.v.'s. it comes with its own cardboard glasses that are not comfortable and do not work very well. the 3D feature is horrible. but if you want the regular 2D version, then this one is good.

Movie disk would not play when opened on Christmas day. Features disk worked OK. One star is not for product but for dealer. Movie when it works gets five stars. Understanding that this can happen any time with a DVD I requested the dealer to provide a replacement but he indicated that it was out of stock and provided a refund instead. However a check of that dealers site that day showed that he had 16 copies of the exact product that I ordered in stock and available for sale. It was apparently easier for him to provide a refund than to fix the problem. Some customer service, I will never make another purchase from this dealer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem","review":"Got a bad copy of the film. The 3D disc does not work. It does play, but the colors are off, sort of a ghosting of the red band to the right of where it should be. As I have had this for almost a year before playing it I doubt I can return/exchange it but..... so don't do what I did. Play the movie soon after ordering it just to make sure it works. The other 3D movies I have work fine, just this one has problems. I will be trying firmware updates shortly, but don't have much hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"We love the movie and plan to establish watching it as an annual holiday tradition.

Loved Tom Hanks in the part. The story was heartwarming, and the animation was well done. It was just a wonderful way to enjoy a beautifully-done, holiday-themed movie.I got the standard definition, as that was all that was available at the time. I considered buying the Blu-ray version afterwards, but honestly, the picture I got was so good, I'm not sure how much better the Blu-ray version could be. I may still end up buying the Blu-ray edition in the future, but for now, I'll enjoy my standard definition.For me, this was definitely worth the price for some excellent, holiday entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"3-d version not worth the money","review":"Save your money and buy the 2d version of the polar express.

Someone picked up this DVD, realized the DVD was loose on the inside, and they simply didn't care.

Sure, the people aren't perfect but in a few years filmmakers will make it better. The main character reminds me of what Toby Maguire might have looked like as a kid. And the little poor boy looked like a composite of Haley Joel Osment (who sees dead people) and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey the youngest in Malcolm In The Middle).My favorite part was the the lost ticket flying around and the roller coaster ride. That had to be fun to watch in the theater. What I did find creepy was when the elves was waiting for Santa and they were singing a slow reverent version of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\". It looked like a cult. Like a bunch of Moonies congregated.

I really am sorry I did not see it on the theatre screen but........it doesn't matter for it is as sweet and uncomplicated a movie as one would hope to see.The story is timeless with a story line that I can truly relate to as I am a child of the 50's. Do be sure to make time for your children and in my case grandchildren to see this wonderful story and to remember the message of Santa's bell, you won't be sorry, I promise.The music score is wonderful and the characters are so very life like - It's an old fashioned story produced with modern technological innovations.This book shall go on my shelf right next to the other children's classic \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" Thanks Chris for taking your imagination to a wonderful place for children of all ages!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar Express","review":"This is great and very cute.

The colors, the effects, the atmosphere!You don't feel how the time flies by as you see the movie characters and the train almost popping out of the screen!! Kudos to the makers of this latest release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"I love this movie. Seeing it in 3D only makes it better.

That is how much my family enjoys the Polar Express. The 3-D effects on this are UNWATCHABLE, double vision, bad color, etc. It literaly gave me a headache. I tried to watch it on 5 different dvd players and 3 diff. TVs and no change. I am very disapointed and wish I could return it. Get the regular DVD or BluRay (or even HD-DVD if you still have a player) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"As it's our favorite Christmas movie (we also have it on Blu-ray), we thought it would be fun to see it in 3-D. It is UNWATCHABLE! The colors are beyond awful and the 3-D effects pathetic. We tried through different scenes and finally gave up after a couple of minutes. The glasses which are provided can only comfortably fit people with tiny heads. By the way, we have a brand new Philips LCD 42\\" and followed all the guidelines. Do not buy in 3-D. Just enjoy this great movie on regular DVD or better yet, on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the 3D version","review":"The original movie and DVD were very good. The 3D version is another matter. To say this is poor is an understatement. Do not buy it. Check the blogs first. I wish I had. This movie (3D version) is not watchable. I have tried it on multiple TVs and DVD players. It is full of ghost images and characters with 4 eyes and 4 eyebrows. Save your money - buy the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"3D is Disappointment","review":"I had to go to several stores to find the 3D version and was excited to watch it - Polar Express is one of my favorite Christmas movies. We put the glasses on over our eyeglasses and were immediately disappointed. We even tried wearing our eyeglasses on top of the cardboard ones and that didn't really help. The quality was poor, the ghosting lines, blotches and the colors were all washed out. We were really disappointed. Yes, we could see the additional dimension sometimes, but it gave me a headache at first to get adjusted. I'd stick to the Blu-Ray 2D version."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a \\"new\\" item!!","review":"I purchased a supposedly \\"new\\" dvd. It was rewrapped in plastic, not manufacture wrap!

You have to watch this, regardless of your age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Polar Express already a tradition in my house","review":"I heard many reviewers and film critics say that the Polar Express lacked the warmth and humanity of a live-action film, that the animation made for plastic, emotionless characters. I guess these clowns didn't like Toy Story or the Incredibles either.The Polar Express was phenomenal. The attention to detail in the animation was next to perfect, and the story line, although not exactly like the book by any stretch, was warm, and entertaining, with a moral. Want to know the moral of the movie? I'm not going to tell you. Watch it yourself, and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful movie","review":"The graphics are amazing!

So, if you're looking for the new technology, this is not the movie you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Film for the Whole Family","review":"My wife took our son, who was just 3 years old at the time to see this. We thought since he loves trains that he would like this movie. We were wrong. He didn't like it--he LOVED it so much he wanted to see it again.When I first saw the preview for this movie on the DVD for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I thought that this was a live-action movie because it looked so realistic. I then took a closer look at it and saw (to my amazement) that it was animated.From an adult's point of view, it is a breathtaking piece of work. It is so well done that you don't think of it as an animated children's movie. This movie really will become a classic for the whole family to enjoy in the future. We highly recommend it even for those of you who don't have children and are young at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare in 3-d","review":"Loved the 2-d version & the 3-d movie version. This version is awful! Gave me a headache after only 5 minutes. The scenes were either red or blue, no vibrant colors, uncomfortable glasses, double images. I would not recommend this 3-d version at all. I do not remember the old 3-d movies but I thought technology would have improved since the old days, I guess it has not!! If you are thinking about buying this do not even bother!

Watching it was very painful from the very start, a chilly experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polar Express STINKS!!!!!!!","review":"The Polar Express is one of the worst movies I\`ve ever seen. First the story is just dumb, I mean a bunch of kids getting on a train and going to the North Pole. It\`s impossible to do that anyway because the North Pole is an island! And the kids get tickets thats stupid because they let the kids on the train why would they need one when there in the train? And the guy who hole punches how does he do it so fast? Did he take advanced hole punching at Dork University? Whats with the room with the hanging puppets real scary not. When they go through the present thing like anyone would do that. And the hillbilly who if you pull his beard he can talk to caribou I mean come on. The only good thing was the cutting edge graphics. I rate this two thumbs down one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Insomnia Express!","review":"The book is only 30 pages long and can't possibly be as shallow and boring as this movie. Parents, stop being so lazy and read a book to your children once in a while.The digital animation makes the already empty, souless charactors look even more creepy. The same guy does voices for at least three different main charactors. The producers shouldn't have been so cheap and actually payed some actual human beings to do the extra voices or, even better, play the roles themselves.Not only was this the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen but it's one of the worst movies I've seen period."},{"rating":"1","title":"How young is too young??","review":"I want to take my nearly 4 1/2 year old son to this movie but have found very little information on the childrens' perceptions.

Since most people are thinking of this movie for a child, it would be more helpful if we heard their opinions instead of the parents'."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me sad...","review":"I thought that this movie was very sweet and I enjoyed watching it. However it made me sad how it only shows that no one knows what Christmas is all about. It's not about Santa. It's about the birth of Jesus.

My grandchildren took off their 3-D glasses to watch the movie. Viewing was a hassle, as well as ruined the original color graphics by making everything look red and blue. Just terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie for the family","review":"If you are like me - very concerned about the garbage and leftist propaganda that Hollywood is bent on putting out, please consider this a movie safe for your family.Even though I am no fan of Tom Hanks and don't care of part of his past work (mainly 'Philadelphia'), he was actually quite a good voice over for the conductor. The animation is outstanding. The story is good. It is heart touching and a bit of a tear maker. I enjoy a good Christmas movie that can generate that kind of response.And they actually utter that politically incorrect and ever so offensive phrase, \\"Merry Christmas\\", a number of times in the movie....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar Express","review":"Saw the movie at the Imax Theater. It had so much more to it then we expected. The ride on top of the train was as if you were on a roller coaster! Tom Hanks was an excellent Conductor. The Santa Claus seemed old world and wonderful. Finally we have an answer to how Santa's Sleigh is loaded. What fun! The message of the story was perfect for this time of year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!! This is the version with paper glasses !!","review":"I just picked up my 3D Blu-Ray Player and new Samsung 3D Plasma TV and was very anxious to score some cool 3D movies to watch, which are still very rare and pricey. My fault I didn't pay close enough attention to the descriptipn and the reviews.This is a great little movie, which I already owned, it is not the new blu ray 3D version that requires special hardware, it can be watched on any tv, and the 3D is hokey at best. Just be careful when looking and know that any new 3D movie is in Blu-Ray and will say it requires 3D TV, 3D Blu-Ray Player with active shutter glasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Christmas Movie","review":"This is a very sweet holiday movie.

The visual look of the film is amazing. The new motion capture is brilliant. Tom Hanks is impressive in 6 roles. Those roles are Hero Boy, Hero Boy's Father, Conductor, Hobo, Scrooge, and Santa Claus. He voices 5 of them and his motion capture is on all 6 of them. Robert Zemeckis' directing is excellent. The powerful emotion of the movie stays with you even until after the movie is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad 3D","review":"If you already have this movie pleasedon't buy this one just for the 3D effect!

Great movie but do not get the 3D version you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regarding the 3D.....","review":"I will not provide a review of the movie as there are plenty of movie critics out there. I will however, concentrate on the in-home 3D aspect of this movie. Of all the new Blu-ray 3D movies I have, this is the worst and most disappointing - especially after seeing what was possible with this movie in the IMAX. as with the anaglyph 3D version of this movie, the image on this Blu-ray 3D ghosts terribly which absolutely ruins the entire movie. The only advantage over the analglyph version was an obvious improvement in the picture color. If I could turn back the clock, I would avoid this purchase until the company releases a clean version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get the 3D version..waste of money.","review":"The movie is great, but the 3D effects are horrible.

I do think there comes a point in your life when you have to accept the things that have happened and move on. Parents are not perfect. Find me a person who thinks their parents made all the correct child rearing decisions. That person is lying. While the author does not blame all her troubles on her family, these are the moments that scream the loudest. It's okay to pout about your parents and how they raised you, but to write a book about it after the age of nineteen suggests a deeper problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! What a load ....","review":"This is such a load of crap. Certainly, this should be listed under \\"Poorly-written Fantasy\\" rather than \\"Biography\\". We have all heard the \\"grandma in the kitchen\\" story, but even the rest of the book must (hopefully) be pure fiction. What Sanders practiced in no way resembles the Wicca that I practice. Supposedly, my tradition is an off-shoot of Alexandrian, but I can see no familar traces whatsoever.

It presents a fascinating but ultimately nauseating portrait of Alex Sanders (founder of the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca) as an egotistical, hateful, perverted individual. I found this in a second-hand shop, and horrified, read it cover-to-cover. Contains black & white photos of historical interest to modern Witches, and features naked Pagans dancing 'round a bonfire on the BACK of the dust jacket!

If they would have just shut up and let each other complete their sentences maybe this could have been an intelligent movie that really explored the relationship of a fifteen years long marriage.

They are basically at a point in their marriage when they are considering divorce, and one of their main concerns is their kids.I felt most of the material in the movie to be very realistic with a good bit of humor intertwined to lighten the mood at times.If you are not married or have never been in a long term relationship, you probably won't get the movie. My husband and I watched it together and both enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone but very true for many","review":"O.K. love is not the same for all, however, this movie did demonstrate how love is shared for some couples. This film comes off so true for some of my experiences with love. Is this healthy love??? Maybe or maybe not the point is that loved ones that share so many years together is not always the smoothest road. For many it takes strugle and even a little tourment but the point of the movie is to show that even love that does not come easily is still wirth it.. I loved the movie because of how real it was for me. I know it was not that way for all that is just how I felt about it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours of shouting","review":"I like Willis and Pfeiffer and expected some chemistry and also (with Reiner at the helm) some laughs. Instead we are treated to two hours (whoops, 90 minutes, it only seemed like 2 hours) of shouting, with little substance and no characterization. Two good scenes in the entire movie - the \\"six people in bed\\" scene and Pfeiffer trying to figure out where to put the dry cleaning. If only the positive elements in the last montage that runs through Pfeiffer's mind at the end could have been portrayed, instead of merely displayed like a Kodak commercial, I might have felt something for these two people. But ultimately they merely annoyed me without reaching me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Think Again","review":"This was perhaps one of Rob Reiner's worst.

It is one of the most depressing movies I have seen in a while. It is one of those annoying movies that allows the characters to do some narrating, then shows a lot of flashbacks. It was too boring for me, but maybe that's because I can't relate to it.

It not only features the most annoying and whiny yuppie couple to grace the sceen in years, but it is overly-sappy, sentimental, and the movie tends to repeat itself over and over again with the same lines, arguments, etc. In my opinion their entire problem lies in the fact that wife caters too much to her children's needs while neglecting those of her husband's. It's that simple. She should have told the children (who are not toddlers) time and time again that she was speaking with their father and that she would be with them in a minute. Oh, and the worst part of the movie was the last scene when Michelle Pfeifer gives this God-awful weepy and over-melodramatic speech which attempts to summarize why they shouldn't give up on their marriage. It's like listening to five munutes of someone scraping their fingernails across a chalkboard. Great actors/actresses, but awful material."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent","review":"Considering the talent involved in this film both behind the camera and in front of it this movie is an absolute failure. While the premise of the movie is acceptable (although somewhat hackneyed these days) much of its dialogue and plot development fall far short of its full potential. The movie's only redeeming features are a few amusing scenes and genuinely funny lines. Principal actors Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer and director Bob Reiner are all capable of much better work. Another of my criticisms of this movie concerns the excessive use of the F-word. Considering the story being told and the type of characters telling it the frequency of the F-word is totally out of place in most instances. It is probably true to say that nowadays the F-word has been used so much in movies and elsewhere that it original meaning and impact have been so diluted that now it means practically nothing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggh!","review":"What an abysmal, horrid, depressing movie this turned out to be! I found nothing enjoyable or entertaining in this entire film.This is the story about two people who, once in love, now remain in a marriage \\"for the sake of the kids,\\" when in fact they truly detest everything about each other. You can feel the tension in the air, to the point where it appears that each one of the couple is listening to the sound of fingernails on a blackboard each time the other speaks, walks or chews.The acting by Willis and Pfeiffer is, as usual, excellent. But that is the only decent thing about the entire movie. And the incongruous reconciliation at the end is so at odds with the rest of the movie, that it leaves you watching the credits, saying, \\"Whaaaat? \\"Whoever called this a \\"Dramedy\\" has a much more esoteric sense of humor than I do.

It is a very good movie and I highly recommend this movie to others who like drama dialog driven movies. This isn't the normal fluff you expect from Rob Reiner. Pfiffer and Wilis were very good and had good chemistry in both hating and loving each other.

Costs only gas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect a romantic comedy","review":"This film jumps back and forth between genres, which is a good thing. The whole point of the film is to depict the highs and lows and mediums of a marriage. Accordingly, there are funny momments in the film, dramatic momments, and just plain normal momments.What I'm trying to say is, if you just sit back, relax, and watch the film you won't be disapointed. If you're waiting for the punchline every five minutes, or waiting for candlelight dinners and sonnets, you will be disapointed.To sum it up, this is not a film for people who are looking to be entertained. This is a film for fans of 'reality' films.The acting is wonderful, the directing is great and the ending is solid.

The text covers most of the bases of the origin and lifestyle of the typical Greek citizen-soldier in a very simple and easy to read style of writing. The illustrations are bright and colorful, which makes it fun to read. The only point I wish Windrow would have emphasized more is how independent the Greek city-states were.

Instead, the author gathers bits and pieces of information from various cultures to support the theory that there is a universal story: creation, the flood, and onward, in all cultures. Although he visited with Cuna over 7 years, he repeatedly talks about \\"primitive cultures\\" as opposed to \\"civilized cultures\\". A paragraph may cite 3 or 4 disparate cultures. Descriptions of creation myths repeatedly refer to \\"onamism\\".

The writing and subplots were more suited to a 1960s soap opera than a feature film. This is no \\"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\\" type movie, although I believe it was made by the same director. A low budget, poorly written and overacted production. What was Geraldine Page thinking?

The acting of Gordon (she's not especially eccentric in this) and Dunnock is first-rate as usual yet it's Page who has a field day in her incredible tour de force interpretation of the murderous middle-aged Mrs. Marrable. Scenes which linger in the memory are many: when Page catches Gordon combing out her wig collection, Marrable winning a contest (she discovers this one evening while tipsy & opening her mail), a scene has Page tear into Gordon \\"Did I say you could help yourself? \\" after Ruthie's poured herself a brandy; there's the \\"Gordon dumping scene\\" and the ironic ending which concerns postage stamps.

Baby Jane and Charlotte were first of course and both had their moments, but the camp scale is upped a bit here due to the way the mod, ultra-cool early 70's sets and clothing look to the viewer today. Page is wild here: creepy and scary at one moment and then hillariously funny the next. Gordon is all plucky determination as she investiagtes the mystery of Page's character.

Why are the churches and Pastors condemning this?This book does a great job of debunking the rapture myth, showing the we have a God of Love not the mean, nasty God of the Left Behind Series, and also explaining the book of Revelations to that even a simple guy like me can 'get it'.Bravo on a fine book that hopefully will reach an audience of those suckered by the Rapture myth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful look at \\"rapture\\" theology","review":"The only \\"problem\\" with this book is that the very people who most need to read this are those who most likely will shun its message. We need to get past the idea of the Rapture, which is a made up notion less than 200 years old, and get back to the real meaning of Revelation--God is with us to the end, no matter what trials face us. The \\"enemy\\" will be defeated.I wonder if we would recognize Christ when he does come back. The majority of Jews didn't recognize him the first time; what makes us think the majority of Christians will recognize him the second time? We have all these pre-conceived notions, and I think we will be in for quite a shock when he doesn't come exactly the way we expect him to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sane, Hopeful and Compassionate Reading of Revelation","review":"Like other reviewers, I fear that those who would most benefit from reading this book are already too close-minded for it. God loves the world and is coming back to live with us on earth. The escapist \\"end times\\" scenario of the dispensationalists is just plain dangerous for the entire planet. If you've been convinced that you're going to be raptured away while the rest of humanity is destroyed, you've been sold a bill of goods. Please read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"If you want to read a critique of the Left Behind Series, from one individuals point of view and bad mouthing of repritable Christian Authores, then this book is for you. If you want to read and understand the truth, read God's Word for yourself. Be very careful what you read when your searching for truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant and ad hominem attacks","review":"Rossing engages in irrelevant and ad hominem attacks. She has not interacted with, or even significantly referenced, serious dispensational scholarship. The author is entitled to her views but that entitlement does not give her a license to be less than accurate, painting an incomplete and unbalanced picture of dispensationalism. And it certainly does not give her the right to be dismissive, derisive, harsh, or censorious in her unfair criticism of dispensational theology. As one dispensational scholar once wrote: \\"Normative dispensationalism is a legitimate, worthy, and conservative viewpoint. Other Christians do not have to agree with it, but they should represent it fairly and treat its contributions with respect. This is simply a matter of Christian integrity and courtesy.\\" Unfortunately, Rossing misses the mark completely regarding both integrity and scholarship in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Not the best work on this subject.\\"","review":"One adhering to the tenets of this book would have us believe that the neither the concept, nor the term 'rapture' appear in Scripture. In doing so, they merely extol an ignorance of the Word.Paul uses the stem-term when explaining he was 'caught up' to the third heaven. Careful reading of the promise to the church of Philadelphia also foreshadows this event.One would do better to spend time on more traditional works on Revelation such as John MacArthur's commentary, or (for more basic teaching) \\"Dragons, Grasshoppers, & Frogs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't read this book","review":"If you want to be deceived and left hopeless, then listen to this author and read her book.

Mz Rossing has no real knowledge and/or understanding of the Bible, when she states that the land of Israel doesn't belong to the Jews. It's time she read the Old Testament prophets such as Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and I could go on! They constantly repeat that the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people, even to listing the exact boundaries. As for the rapture, it is well documented in a number of New Testament books. All I can say in closing is as Paul wrote in the first chapter or Romans: \\"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools\\" !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Evangelical Christian Bashing...blah, blah, blah","review":"One more book that attacks those who believe that the Bible is fundamentally true and promises eternal life through Christ. This author should remain silent on the subject of the Rapture for it appears she knows very little about it. She has used her own intellect as the source of inspiration and information, not exactly the most humble place to start a theological discussion. Stick with Hal Lindsey and the men and women who know their Bibles well and teach the truth that is in its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where in the world are our mansions?","review":"John 14:2 - In my Fathers house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

It doesnt seem that way to me. If so , where are all these mansions? And where is God's house?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust the Bible not man's word.","review":"The pre-tribulation rapture can easily be boiled down to one easy to understand argument: There just simple cannot be a rapture surprise if you know it's coming at the mid point, pre-wrath, or end of the tribulation. \\"For this reason you be ready too; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will\\" (Matthew 24:44).In order for it to be a surprise, the rapture must take place before the tribulation starts. It would absolutely silly to apply this to any other view. During the final hour of the tribulation, 2/3 of mankind will be dead from the various judgments and the Church will be under constant threat from the Antichrist. In all this carnage, I can not imagine believers being oblivious to the nearness of the Lord's return. This is why a pre-trib rapture is the only position that makes sense.The author of this book tries to lead us down a conspiracy bunnytail."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Simplicity of Tarot","review":"I love the companion book to the Hudes Tarot cards. Prayers and affirmations are elegantly tied to the wisdom of the Tarot. The interpretatons relate to present life situations that are relevant in today's times.

I wish I had seen Deed's review before purchasing this product at my university bookstore.The cheap aluminum frame is attached to the fiberboard back by punching a hole into the frame to create a rough metal surface that \\"digs\\" into the back to hold it.To hang the calendar, you bend two very thin pliable metal strips (with holes in them) from the back to the front. You then put your nails through the holes and into the wall.In the process of bending these strips back, they came right out of the frame. The calendar fell, scratching my wall, and when it hit the floor the thin aluminum framing popped off and broke.This calendar is not worth the money; very poor design--avoid it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've read these reviews first","review":"I bought a Board Dudes 23 x 35 and it, too, is unmountable with the hardware provided.

This one is progress in the making! Beautiful album, would recommend it to anyone needing a lift, or a push!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cranberries are BACK!","review":"I've been a long time fan of the Cranberries. I've followed their career since the release of their debut album \\"Everyone Else is Doing It So Why Can't We\\". Most will agree that the the debut album and the follow up \\"No Need To Argue\\" are just superb. Both are delicate and reflective but with the release of \\"Zombie\\" it became apparent that the Cranberries had something more up their sleeve. The next couple albums brought us songs like \\"Salvation\\" and \\"Animal Instinct\\" but on the whole the albums could be best described as experimental. Almost certainly they were searching for direction. With the release of \\"Wake up and smell the coffee\\" its apparent that the Cranberries have finally found the path they have been searching for. They have seemlessly blended the delicate nature of earlier works with the heavier riffs of later albums. The result is a sweet treat that will leave you very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this one","review":"I bought this CD Knowing Lerner's music, in this CD his charm is lost since he invited other singers and ruined his music, if you don't believe me just buy it and you will be as upset as I am, now looking for a CD sing only by Alejandro Lerner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 26 x 1 1/2","review":"These tires arrived in a bag, twisted and out of shape.

Since most greatest hits are now being released with at least a new song or two you can always see an artist's growth - from where he came, to where he is now and where he is headed. I first heard Gary's new single - \\"A Feelin' Like That\\" and was totally blown away - I have all of his music and when I found out that this song was on a greatest hits package I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. It is great driving music. I believe Gary Allen is one of the most talented and often overlooked country artist today.

Unfortunately the move away from \\"pinyin\\" to LP's own crazy system is irrational. It is neither intuitive nor useful. My other grievance lies with the book's numerous language errors. If a traveler has problems pronouncing something, he or she should be able to point out the sentence to a fluent speaker. With this book though, you could very well be asking the wrong question.

Ultimately the book is as much about the righteousness of some other religion, but that idea backfires to the point that the underlying message is that all religions are pernicious. The book is divisive, war-mongering, and retro. Whether it is true or not isn't especially relevant simply because the human race will never progress or overcome while our thoughts are guided by children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling It Like It Is","review":"Robert Spencer lays it on the line, something we sorely need in these times of obfuscation and euphemism about a pernicious religion which is still at war with the whole world.It's too bad so many people seem to think that criticizing Islam is somehow an anti-social activity. Actually, it is the opposite, because it is Islam which has victimized so many innocent people.Here's the recipe for Islam: Take crude elements of Jewish monotheism, add in Christian-like prospects of rich and vulgar rewards in heaven, mix in the ethics of a ruthless bedouin raider, sanction bloody, mafia style retribution against opponents, and then establish a theocratic empire ruled by the faithful and paid for by taxed infidels, a sort of robber baron religion. No wonder it's growing so fast!I agree with Robert Spencer: We need a new Crusade."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth is Ou There!","review":"Read this book. Forget the PC nonsense you hear on the major networks. Read facts about Islam and be informed. Know your enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why We Fight","review":"This book reveals the agenda of Islam to subjugate the entire world. The point is that there is no radical Islam. All true believers intend to enslave all who are not followers. The picture painted is very dark and leaves one with the feeling that we must defeat all Moslems except those who sunscribe to a reformed Islamic faith. I really liked the book and felt that I have a better understanding of why someone would blow themsleves up along with many innocent people. I now see the need to fight our war on terrorism to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good expose of Islam","review":"I highly recommend this book. Spencer seems to know what he is talking about and is trying to enlighten us about the dangers that arise from Islam. I especially liked his comparison of Islam to Christianity and the history of aggression and violence on the part of Muslims. This is a good expose because many people don't understand what we face from the Islamic world. It is a timely read while the US is trying to combat terrorism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Very informative book written in a clear and concise manner.

Important book for someone to understand what is going on in the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide - a must read for any seeker of truth","review":"This book is well written and well researched. It is bold enough to make the truth claims that it makes. I especially like the chapter on the Islamic contribution to civilization and science - or lack thereof. The overview of the crusades and pointing out that they were in fact a reaction to the Muslim crusades that were launched against Christendom is a bold and courageous step in the midst of the politically correct whitewash history that is now being taught to students. The conclusion is that if there were no muslims their would not have been any crusades in the first place is inferred from this text. I have used extracts from it in teaching my history lessons. Keep up the good work. Somebody must have the guts to speak the truth in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"By far the BEST book on radical islam i've read so far(and i've read quite a few).

I bought this book for a book group that discusses timely topics with an emphasis on Jewish or related matters. Some of what the author relates is true but his writing style is so slanted and sarcastic that every person in the group disliked it. The editing of the book was also poor. There are errors throughout. One example that could easily have been checked is the Temple Mount not Mound as was stated a few times in the book. This was a waste of time to read and discuss.

I feel this book does not portray \\"the truth\\" as it purports to do. I am in the middle of converting from Catholicism to Islam and have learned that you must ready several sources (Quran, Hadiths, tafseer) to truly understand what it all means.

Spain was taken with the physical and financial support of the Spanish Jews, who were tired of the persecution of their Christian Visigothic overlords (many of the Roman population did the same).Also...when are we going to be treated to a \\"Politically incorrect Guide to the Jews and Judaism\\"???(I guess I shouldn't hold my breath)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to make sense, but doesnt have the spine you think it has","review":"To some one looking for answers it may seem that this book has all you need to know about the real Islam.

All verses in the quran were revealed according to different situations in Islam during Muhhammads life. The way these verses are portrayed are made to make them seem to apply to all aspects of life which is completely false. It seems that some people can take verses out of context and people will believe it in its still seemingly corrupt form.

Everything in it's context is based off of media of the extremists and not the other 99% of the 1.3 Billion muslims living mainly in the Far East such as China, Malaysia, etc.This book is as equivalent to a Radical Muslim explaning Chistianity to his audience form the examples of Timothy McVay, Hitler, David Koresh. Would you as a Christian want to judged by those who are evil and hijack your religion?? Think deeply and remember Jesus or Issa, Those who are without sin cast the first stone.This book proves one point that are some people rightly guided towards good, and others refuse tolerance and acceptance.

Using quotes from the Qur'an and 'Hadith Qudsi', Spencer leads us through the birth of Islam by Muhammad, into the Jihadists of today! By discussing the true reason for the Crusades, he 'lays to bed' the myth that Islam was a victim and not a perpetrator. Reviewing the 'peace of Saladin' (\\"say anything you need to in order to gain strength and win\\") brings one to the conclusion that the peace under Islam is only true for those within the religion - infidels beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opening","review":"I'm on my third reading of this book and have had access to a pocket-sized Qur'an (helpfully provided gratis while working in Libya and published by the King Fahd Complex in Saudi Arabia).By looking up quotations cited by Mr Spencer from the Qur'an and comparing them with this authorized translation, I am struck by the close approximation of his source (presumably the Dawood version) and the Saudi sanctioned one. Indeed, my version has the added advantage of an English commentary by the authors which elaborates on the thorny issue of the term 'jihad'. There seems no doubt whatsoever that this term is used not in the personal struggle every human being has to overcome bad and promote good in his psyche, but in the 'lesser jihad' interpretation of defending Islam through pre-emptive attacks on all and any who oppose it."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL. Great insight, well documented, very disturbing","review":"I like the early chapters where the author goes through common arguments like 'Even in the Old Testament Moses killed off tribes... so how is this different than Islam?' This and many other common arguments are answered and dealt with directly, not with clever phrases, but well thought and very rational answers. A MUST READ! Changes the way you see the news on the main-stream media. Look at the reviews below that rate this less than three stars. They don't even comment on the content and references sited. I was very impressed with how meticulously the author referenced assertions and claims that would understandably upset those that follow Muhammad. No matter what side of the fence you are on before reading this book or listening to the CD version, truth is truth, and this author can't change truth. Do the research and be informed. A fantastic read and listen! AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ FOR THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT THE WESTERN WORLD.

There can be no doubt that Robert Spencer fears certain strains of Islam and he explains the basis for those fears well, using history as a guide.As with any argument about religion and politics, there are many voices clamoring to be heard. On his side of the issue, Robert Spencer speaks eloquently. It would, frankly, be useful if someone holding opposing views would write an articulate, factual rebuttal to Spencer.

The OC (aside from being a smart, fun, usually well-written show) has done a really good job in its first season of showcasing independent and otherwise under-the-radar artists and songs you don't tend to hear on the radio. There are also quite a few British artists who don't always make it to US airwaves. Highlights for me are \\"Honey and the Moon\\", \\"Dice\\", and \\"Orange Sky.\\" I also can't help dancing around to \\"How Good It Can Be\\". Depending on my mood I will sometimes skip \\"Move On\\" and \\"Rain City,\\" but I do like all the tracks.

There is also no effective sense of the rich settings of the novel (Yale and New York City); reading this book is like going to New York on business and never getting a moment outside the airport, a taxi and a conference room. Sad, because the possibilities are so great! And the unnamed narrators long, unrequited longing for the ex-Yalie, ex-model, faux-designer Samona is inexplicable with what the writer chooses to reveal about her, and more appropriate to a pre-teen setting than to a bunch of New Yorkers pushing hard at 30.

Listening, then speaking, but for someone like myself with absolutely no French (ie a beginner)the content was inappropriate. I am planning a trip to France later this year. I still don't know any basic vocabulary, how to introduce myself. How to ask for directions, the bank, everyday stuff like that.On a positive note, I thought , hey, this is what I need for Spanish. I did very well in high school Spanish but have never been comfortable trying to speak. This method actually gets you speaking right away. So with a solid vocabulary in Spanish and a knowledge of grammer, I expect Smart Spanish to get me speaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart French is a bit too \\"Smart\\"","review":"I certainly would not call this a beginning level CD. It starts right in with advanced level conversations, offering no information on vocabulary or verb conjugations. I've had seven years of French study, but I bought this \\"beginning\\" level to brush up on my French for an upcoming visit to Provence. The one helpful thing about this program is that it does show you what to listen for in native french speakers. I would definitely not recommend this CD to someone who is a BEGINNER."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate tool to help you learn French- A must have","review":"I am currently a high school student, in my second year of French. Before SmartFrench, I did not enjoy learning the language. I have been to France four times already, and I only enjoyed my stay in France the fourth time, after I had been using SmartFrench. SmartFrench truly immerses me in the true French language, spoken by the French. After using SmartFrench, I was able to hold a French conversation smartly. SmartFrench has enabled me to be accustomed to the speed and style of spoken French. Along the way, I have also picked up valuable vocabulary. I am proud to say that after using SmartFrench, I have completed French II in highschool, with a 98%. No kidding. After trying out a lot of French programs, I have finally hit the jackpot with SmartFrench. I would like to personally thank the creaters of SmartFrench, for enabling me to finally understand and enjoy the French language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pronunciation only","review":"This product is not bad if all you want to do is learn how to pronounce French more like the French people do. But if you're expecting to actually learn any of the language beyond its conversational pronunciation, you would be much better off buying a different product.The whole package consists of 3 CD's -- a total of seven 1-minute long conversations that are repeated multiple times. You are expected to pick up pronunciation from listening and repeating after you hear each phrase. [...]If you already know French pretty well and just want to learn how to listen/speak more authentically, this would be okay for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, teadious and repeatitive...","review":"I was so exited about the course because of amounts of good reviews it has.... However a total disappointment... So boring and repeatitive that I didn't even finish the 3rd lesson!!! They read and explain 5 times for about 10 minutes a 1 minute conversation. For me it was a waste of money. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to say French Words","review":"Maybe I missed something when I ordered this, but I didn't realize they were only going to focus on how to pronounce words. I still listened to all the cd's multiple times, but I haven't increased my knowledge of French in any measurable way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"I was looking for a CD that would help me with conversational French on my first visit to France. I didn't think my high school French would suffice. (Boy was I right). If you are looking for a CD which helps you say how much is this? or, where is the bathroom? or how do I get to? this is NOT the CD you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love this program!","review":"I have studied French for many years, learned all the grammar, and know most of the essential vocabulary, but was never able to develop an ear for spoken French. This program has helped so much! I am now watching movies in French and understanding them, where before I was only able to catch a phrase here, and a couple of words there, and get the general gist of what they were saying. Now I understand almost everything. I'm so excited to go to France in the very near future and immerse myself in this incredible, beautiful language."},{"rating":"2","title":"SmartFrench: Beginner Level","review":"I have always wanted to learn French. I knew basic vocabulary having studied French at school for a year (age 12). I tried learning the language a couple of times using teach yourself cds but gave up almost immediately because I lacked the motivation to persevere. I purchased the beginner level cds about three weeks ago based on reviews I had read and already feel confident enough to hold a basic conversation in French. I practise around three times a week for between half an hour & an hour (the time passes so quickly) and I can't believe my progress!I have no hesitation in recommending this course to anyone who is serious about learning French. The French language tought by native French people. What can I say?If your taps need replacing you don't hire a painter & decorator."},{"rating":"2","title":"For me, the best course to learn french","review":"I found what I was looking for!! Finally, here is a course that told me how to speak French! What a difference it makes! I am finally learning French! It might be a little difficult for the true beginner but I wish I had bought it sooner. It's better to get it right away, practice with it once and eventually keep it preciously for later. You will not find such a nice product on the market very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely worthless.","review":"This CD teaches you no vocabulary at all. All you do is listen to a frenchman babble on relentlessly and you don't have a clue what he is saying. Sure, if you want to learn to pronounce incomprehensible words, its fine but if you want to learn french it is worthless and I have had plenty of french classes in my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way to start French lessons","review":"While I have enjoyed listening and trying to learn from these audio cd's, I do feel that personal lessons are inevitable. Christian speaks really fast on some of these and makes it very difficult to try to repeat at times. I get a little frustrated and turn it off, ha! He is good though and very nice to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am really an intermediate student rather than beginner, but thought I'd start with the beginner CDs in this series. Like most intermediate students of a language, I need to work on listening comprehension. This program does strive for that, but in my opinion offers too few opportunities to listen to native French speakers. Too repetitious--I kept falling asleep, or having trouble paying attention. Can't believe I bought these CDs! The narrator keeps repeating points he had already made...I won't be bothering with the intermediate or advanced versions.And of course I bought them based on reviews from others, which I consider to be a good indicator...not in this case, though!I have 2 other sets which I consider better (the \\"Learn French In Your Car\\" is especially good for beginners), and a set from the library that is no longer available."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"Poor methodology. I would suggest to continue looking for something better. You will not learn frech with this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"These CD's are produced for an English major. If your goal is to learn some French phrases, this is the wrong choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners","review":"I would not recommend this to someone who hasnt had some French before. I m using it with a friend who hasnt ever studied French and it is very difficult for her to follow along. I, however, took some French in high school and have a basic knowledge and found it quite helpful to be able to learn how French is really spoken on the streets. So, if you re starting from scratch, this is not for you. But, if you just want to polish up and learn some new grammar and some good pronounciation, it s a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Fun and effective.","review":"I enjoy this program very much. It's interesting and fun to listen to, and effective in getting you to understand actual spoken French. I bought this because of all the positive reviews, and they were right. This is a wonderful product. I find that I really like using it, and it's very effective in getting me to learn French when I do. To me, that means it's a good teaching method. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"What a horrible waste of money. If you want to learn French (even basic conversational French), do NOT buy this product. The only good feature is learning the numbers. The sounds and dialogues are absolutely worthless. There are no verb conjugation exercises or vocabulary drills. I do not understand how this product has an overall rating of 4. If there was a negative rating, I would use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent learning too","review":"I teach a small group of adults French and I've just started using the Smart French Beginner Audio CD set with my students who love it. They all agree that listening to the conversations is an excellent way to increase comprehension and augment vocabulary. We all value listening to native speakers carrying on conversations about everyday topics.I find that including both a slow version and a fast version of each dialoguemakes the Smart French series an excellent tool for teaching and for learning French.Sandy K.Berkeley, CA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ideal for the beginner...","review":"I believe this program is better suited for the intermediate/advanced French student looking to improve his/her pronunciation. Definitely not for the beginner. You are basically listening to and repeating normal French conversations with a little commentary thrown in for good measure. As a beginner, I got more out of the \\"Behind the Wheel\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This course is terrible!","review":"Don't buy this! The dialogs are useless for vocabulary (#1 is an interview with a model about her smoking habit)and the demonstrated speaking is choppy with the sentences broken into unnatural phrasing. The best thing you will get from this is how to understand heavily accented English. The actual dialogue is so poorly recorded that you can hardly make it out. Sounds like a low grade microphone was placed 20 feet from the speakers. This was a total waste of time, much less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time well spent","review":"I was ready to learn when I found this product. I put it right into the ipod and used it in the car and while hiking. It really focussed how French people actually speak and in time I learned how to sound more like a native French person myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated course","review":"Excellent program that helps you learn by really listening most of all to native french speakers. The speakers all have attractive voices and are easy to listen to over and over again. Enjoyed the different, varied dialogues and the focus on repeated listening. The booklet is very concise and helps by color coding what is and isn't spoken. Am enjoying learning french now due to this elegant and effective program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so smart","review":"If all you want is a CD that makes you repeat over & over again words & phrases then this is for you - otherwise it is not a good starter course.

October Circle, however, was written a quarter century earlier, and Littell definitely used the time between to improve his writing style. The first half of the book drags miserably, and the collection of oddball characters - the Racer, the Magician, the Dwarf, the Flag Holder - do not make the book more interesting. I rarely don't finish a book, but it was all I could do to keep myself reading in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of moral standpoint disgusting","review":"What turned me off this book was that not only did it fail to portray the horror of Communist tyrrany, as I thought it would ,but it glorifies a bunch of degenerates without a hint of dissaproval by the author of their intellectual dishonesty, or even of the cruel exploitation of children by the hateful dwarf.The style of writing was however good and that is why I will give it two stars instead of one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Nutshell","review":"One of the better written Nutshells. There is a combination of good examples, black letter law, case analysis and quizzes to test comprehension and learning. The authors do a good job of making a complex topic approachable and understandable, and identify a number of common pitfalls and likely exam topics. While I read the 2nd edition, a newer edition is available and would be recommended to the practitioner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful for exam review","review":"As acknowledged in the preface, \\"this book alone will not present an integrated coverage of the subject.\\" It just focuses on a few areas and delves into them in great detail, without really providing any sort of overview or anything to help you complete the whole picture. Not the book to go to if you are expexting a comprehensive overview of wills and trusts. I was very disappointed with this nutshell, because isn't that what a nutshell is supposed to be? I would recommend trying to see if another line, such as Examples and Explanations, has a book on the area."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"Book was great but I wish you would have warned me that it came from a smoker's home because I got the book a week ago and still have it outside fanned out trying to get the smoke out of the book.

I have enjoyed the activities in this book so much with my infant and two year old, that I bought a copy for both of my sisters once they became pregnant and also find this is a favorite gift to buy for baby showers. This book is jam packed with great activities. Activities are organized by helpful, real life categories like \\"meal time\\", \\"outings\\" and \\"bath times and bedtimes\\". Each activity has the suggested age range, approximate preparation time, sibling factor (what older siblings to do to join in) and (my personal favorite) messiness quotient. The activities are fun, creative, and very easy to do. My daughters and I have had countless hours of fun from this book. I would also recommend the \\"Busy Book\\" series by Trish Kuffner."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I bought this book based on the good reviews, but after reading it myself it's not worth the money.

When I opened the package I was impressed that the majority of hats had so much style and charm. I've made 3 hats from this box so far and will be making a fourth soon. My first was the Marseille pattern, challenging because of the twist technique used, but so worth it. I live in that hat! My next was Fifth Avenue, similar style to Marseille but much easier technique. My last was the On Broadway pattern, super fast and easy. I have not tried any of the scarf patterns yet, but will be soon. The individual cards are lamenated and is easily portable. The reference guide comes in handy too. This is the best of the Little Box crochet series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracing Native American Heritage","review":"This DVD was not very informative.

And for some reason, they don't even have devoted chapter on food allergy. Overall, I am disappointed with this book. This book is best applicable to medical students and residents. In my opinion, it will not fit the need of Allergy/Asthma/Immunology fellows or practicing staff.

Check out the DAMA reference guide .. at least it's built by actual practitioners.The help screens on the Data modeling tools are more advanced in explaining data modeling than this book.Probably great for theorists - managers or teachers that don't know what they are doing!

It shows the overall tree, leaf structure, and flowers, which are the main parts to use in identifying a plant. One thing it lacks is a close up illustration of the bark, useful in differentiating pines, firs, and so forth, and even hardwoods such as sycamore, which has peeling, deciduous bark, and the prunus genus, which contains cherry trees, which have horizontally striated, lenticele bark. This book covers North America so it can't be exhaustive in such a small book, but nevertheless, many important trees get covered, and it still makes a good choice for a young, budding naturalist. Also, trees are a good place to start with plant identification since they're so big and usually relatively easy to identify. Another great book on trees to start with trees Donald Culross Peattie's Natural History of North American Trees, which is now 65 years old and a classic, but still one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever Wondered About That Tree With The Fluffy Flowers?","review":"This book covers all the basic tree types you are likely to run across anyplace but a botanical garden.

Because Rogue Nation reads exactly like what you would expect from a sneering critic of the U.S., except this time the criticism comes from someone who could be considered part of the establishment.Rogue Nation has less to do with America's alleged policy blunders than it is a chance for Prestowitz to grind his axe and repeat line by line the same silliness the anti-war movement spewed for much of this year. Why is the world against the U.S.? Why because it failed to ratify the Kyoto Accord and Americans support Israel blindly, among other infractions. There are so many strawmen, dead-ends and pointless digressions in Rogue Nation that I'm appalled this book was actually published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vishal","review":"Awesome book for people in the learning curve for lead guitaring.

It's extremely difficult to follow and the words are spoken to quickly. Add a little extra and buy an interactive learning CD ROM rather than an audio disc. With no visual aid or english translation (unless you care to sit with the instruction booklet on your lap whilst driving), it makes learning extremely difficult and boring. I used an interactive CD ROM to start Spanish and found it much more informative as it had visual stimulation.

I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like Magic!","review":"No other program that I know of teaches like SmartFrench. Instead of the ineffective and monotonous lessons used by most language software, SmartFrench teaches you by way of real French conversations at real speed. Before SmartFrench, I was really frustrated. I thought I knew how to speak the language but each time I tried to listen to actual French conversations, I could never understand them! But with SmartFrench that all changed very quickly and radically. After just a few lessons, I turned on a French radio station and I could suddenly understand double what I could before I started using SmartFrench. It was like magic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great french help, but not always computer accessible","review":"The CD's in itself are pretty nice. They make you read and re-read the text and tell you how to pronounce spoken french compared to written french.But if you want to try to convert the CD's into mp3 to put them on an mp3-player or such (like me), then I have to warn you that CD 3 is tricky and not readable with every computer system.

The program uses snapshots (with common daily vocabulary) of real life interviews with French people to tune up your listening as well as speaking skills. The lessons starts with going slowly, reading the written text, and ends with the normal speed of French people speaking. Practice in your car for a couple of weeks, and you'll be amazed how much your pronunciation improves.The accompany text is just the translation of the interviews. At this level, you should have a solid background of French vocabulary and grammar, and probably don't need a detail text on the translation, except for looking up a word here and there. We're really happy that we found this excellent tool. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"Found these CDs and booklet to be useless.

There is nearly sixty minutes of monotony totally enacted verbatim from Her Master's Voice (Ravi Shankar)!! The only aspect worth mentioning are the tablas, two of them fortunately, to distract from the drudge! There is one thing going in Anoushka's favor. Fortunately she is not a musical wunderkind and there should be no concerns of her being an inspired musician! The music has nothing but mediocrity written all over it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anoushka: Harsh criticism?","review":"Anoushka is facing harsh criticism for her music. Reading a plethora of views one cannot help but agree with the people who seem to lend perspective to a tradition of music regarding which they are somewhat knowledgable. I am not a trained scholar of the music but familiar enough to at least understand that Anoushka's music is totally substandard. But for the fact that she is Ravai Shankar's daughter such musicianship could never have made it into a concert or recording setting! The previous reviewer is correct in pointing out that there are many American students of the music who show sincerety and seriousness in their playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anoushka Shankar","review":"I have to unfortunately agree with the last reviewers comments on Anoushka!

I realize that many wonderful talents will never have the opportunity to be heard in the West leave alone the clout to perform at Carnegie and have a live CD produced! Anoushka enjoys a special place not by her musical merits but legacy! This recording is lacking in originality and the newly \\"composed\\" pieces (songs??) are uninspiring and lacking in improvisational content! On a technical note, the tuning in the first raga is incorrect with two fourths ( the raga has only a raised fourth!) and the tabla duet produces some inconsistencies with rhythm!

One can always respect talent within its own genre and in any type of music!! I was unfortunate to receive this cd as a gift and a serious collector of Indian music. Vulgar clothing, cheesy photos and bad music all make for a [] demeaning representation of Indian music. Anoushka's aim is clear; success at any cost minus music.

At 20 Anoushka is not a child and much more needs to be seen of her individuality which is absent in her playing. The various pre-composed pieces in different ragas (along with the deliberate distraction of two tablas) have become a routine affair in her recordings and concerts. There is not a scintilla of feeling or improvisation in her rendition of ragas and there are many years still in the making! I attended Ravi Shankar and Anoushka's concert in Calcutta (2 years ago) and the same criticism was made by audiences and the press alike! There are a number of exceptional talents in Indian music (many in their early teens) and it is only through the grace of her father's name that Anoushka can get by (at least for now!) with such a gutsy display of averageness!! On a positive note, isn't it encouraging that we can produce intelligent music criticism about Indian Music in the West??!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gender and music!","review":"The last reviewer's attempt to politicize Anoushka's gender is strange! Need it even be pointed out that everyone likes to see a good looking performer coupled with good music! In this case, the looks are probably there but the content is questionable. On the same note, India has an abundant number of female peformers and Anoushka is not a recent invention to its old musical history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent is not always talent!!","review":"Just after listening to this album recently, I also attended Anoushka's recital at the Terrace Theatre (Washington D.C.). The performance was a renactment of the CD, ditto. There is not one moment of inspired music making in Anoushka's playing. What a far cry from the legend of Ravi Shankar and his improvisations! The issue here is that talent is not always assured just because the parent is talented! Anoushka is an example of what the priority of success can achieve over the values of music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Live at Carnegie Hall is dull!","review":"Recording lacks any originality or the depth of feeling of Indian music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anoushka - Live at Carnegie Hall","review":"I would have to say that the music in this cd is quite unimaginative and predictable!

Run from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I like books about ancient manuscripts, ancient relics, ancient secrets, which is both a good and a bad thing since there seems to be lots of this type of book being written now but not all are good, like this one. It seems as if the author was ordered to chop down a much longer book but refused to alter the plot; therefore, what's left are very shallow and unsympathetic characters, strange relationships that are never properly developed and overly long lectures that I didn't care enough about to make any sense out of.

As for the heroine, I've read better.<G> Her focus on her looks was rather annoying. I thought her shallow and silly. A good read but I've read better from Brockmann and haven't given up on her. HEARTHROB is still tops with me. Brockmann, when she's good, the woman is good.

I enjoyed HEART THROB, but BODYGUARD has to be one of my all time favorites. This tale was gritty and so well-told that I couldn't put it down. The hero, not your typical handsome hunk, certainly turned into a hunk in my eyes before I was even halfway through the book. Ms. Brockmann has certainly proven that she can write compelling, exciting tales no matter what the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"uuuuggghhh!","review":"This book really bothered me. But considering how Ms.Brockmann has written more great books then awful books, then I can forgive her for this one. First of all I did not like Alessandra, she got on my last nerve, maybe it's jealousy but maybe I should let all the romance authors know something about me. I HATE READING ABOUT WOMEN WHO ARE BETTER LOOKING THEN I AM! also, no offense or anything, but Harry was not my idea of a hero. I guess I am a little fickle but I want my romance men to be big, buff, and beautiful, and from my estimation Harry was none of those, he was interesting but did he have to be short, with a big nose, and a lawn mower haircut. Oh well I guess I'll read Heartthrob again and wait for Ms. Brockmann's next book.

Disfunctional characters, mediocre plot, and boring dialogue-- who wants to read about such things when we experience them every day in real life?The two main characters were flat and never seemed to come alive, though the Harry was marginally better-drawn than Allie. (The sub-plot with George and his women was outright distasteful. I hope that Ms. Brockmann is not intending to write a spin-off with this crew-- they are very unattractive.)I was actually relieved whenever the main storyline was interrupted and we had a glimpse of the teenager Shaun: he was the most appealing of the bunch.Anyway, I'm sorry to say that this is the worst Suzanne Brockmann I've ever read. Try one of her other books if you want something at all engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I found this book dull, and had no familar elements of romance (perhaps is wasn't suppose to be a romance?).

I will never again buy a Philips Magnavox product and I recommend you don't either.

Well that's really not true either. The first set I received was in a totally smashed box, the 2 styrofoam packing inserts were in a million pieces, falling out of the holes in the box. The power cord was dragging on the ground, the delivery man almost tripped over it. Part 2....The second set arrived, the box was well beaten and the styrofoam was in 8 pieces rather than two, but the set seemed to be in decent shape, it wasn't. The picture was in tri-color like when color TV's first came on the market. Adjustments did not fix the problem. This is a extremely poor television. The absolute minimum of packaging materials being used tells me that this manufacturer doesn't really care if this TV gets to you in one piece or not. This one will also be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great TV at a great price","review":"I bought this television to use in my study.

The best way to describe it is as a caring conversation with a best friend that makes you feel good and laugh at times but has the right dose of reality checks about how to eliminate your pain and find your path in life to have more joy.

I have used it extensively in researching family history and for general reading. The maps are detailed, clear and well-presented. Tight capsules of historical review are usually presented on the facing pages and gives a wonderful narrative into the never-known or almost forgotten history of East Central Europe.

Same Group, Same Title, Two Different Albums.","review":"I own both the 1976 Passport Records and the 1985 Windham Hill LPs (I do not own the Windham Hill CD). They are NOT the same! The 1976 version is much more frantic, electric, and progressive. Assuming you have access to both, check out 6 minutes into The Book of Hours: the lyricon solo is missing on the Windham Hill version. That solo was rough, grating, unique, and really defined early Shadowfax. Even the title cut has the tempo mellowed for the Windham Hill version. There are other differences. Which is better? Personally, I prefer the original. Good luck finding it.For album details, Mr. McKenna's review summed it up well. He had the 1976 version.I've only heard bits and pieces of other Shadowfax albums, and found them painfully boring in comparison.PS Somebody mentioned bonus tracks? How about both versions released together?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to pursue drawing the human figure","review":"Virtual Pose is a remarkable combination of technology, art, and aesthetics! I found this an easy way to approach drawing or sketching the human figure -- no concerns about a model getting fidgety or uncomfortable. The models are extremely well chosen and are a joy to contemplate. 360% rotation available through the CD makes it possible to capture any aspect of the figure and to appreciate it in a way no flat photo can match. For those who like music as a counterpoint to concentration, as I do, the CD sound track is a nice collection of themes which fit nicely with the poses. I have enjoyed this book and CD immensely. I especially like the notion that I can work at will, not having to wait until the class starts or the studio opens. This is an excellent means to study the art of the human figure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Multimedia Guide for Drawing the Perfect Creation","review":"Mario Chakkour has taken the world of artistic drawing and the human body and created a significant multimedia project in \\"Virtual Pose\\". Drawing the human figure becomes a less dramatic artistic undertaking and more of an enjoyable (the CD-ROM comes complete with soundtrack!) experience. The overall work is distinguished by Chakkour's interpretations, numerous classic poses by the models and the companion CD-ROM. The lens of Welton Doby has provided the models with a natural aura, which aids clarity. The CD-ROM, another sign that art is utilizing mainstream technology at its edges, allows the artist to see the human form in its essential three dimensions. In its entirety, \\"Virtual Pose\\" is an attempt by Chakkour to blaze trails as he has done in his previous projects. The result is the illumination for artists of the \\"perfect creation\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely useless","review":"although its a great idea, the CDROM is absolutely useless as a photo reference. this goes for figure drawing and other uses of the figure. the closeups are grainy at best and the navigation nothing more that a novelty without high resolution. the tutorial has some merit for just beginning, but not really useful beyond a very short introduction. i am embarassed to admit that i was lured into buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"To call this book/CD set the \\"Ultimate Visual Reference\\" is a wildly imaginative overstatement. Given that there are only 2 models in a variety of -STATIC- poses, and given that the images are not high resolution so particular body parts can be studied, I would call this a \\"basic\\" or \\"limited\\" reference at best. The book and CD are nicely presented, but the content is far from what I expected. The inclusion of music is unnecessary- more resolution and images a la Muybridge would have improved this concept immeasurably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a resource!","review":"This is beyond a reference book!

This is one of the most poorly cast movies in the history of Hollywood. Laurence Harvey is supposed to be a Texan, but he doesn't look like a cowboy/farmer and can't do the accent. Jane Fonda is supposed to be a 16 year old Texan, but she doesn't look 16 and can't do the accent either. Anne Baxter is supposed to be a Mexican -- yeah, right. And we're supposed to believe that Barbara Stanwyck, with her New York accent, runs a New Orleans Cat House? Puh-leeez!!! There's not one genuine southern accent in the entire film. The story is totally uninvolving, the characters are unbelievable and, except for Baxter, unsympathetic. The direction is all over the place, and the art direction fails to evoke the 1930s.

Some good humor between two young ladies politely and subtly, but aggresively, competing for the same young man. It is hard to find many good musicals.

The special effects aren't incredably great by todays standards, but include that Disney Magic. Oh yeah, and the plot it great, a little slow in parts, but still great.

I had never heard of this movie and in a moment of nostalgia decided to purchase it based on its high reviews. This movie was clearly a vehicle meant to capitalize on Mill's popularity in better more deserving movies, but in itself it is just awful. The story makes no sense and has no real resolution. The singing is abysmal and made me wince. Every Disney hackneyed device was thrown into this movie, and that and a bad script pulled it down. I'm sorry I believed the reviews. Hayley Mills was a wonderful child actress, but nothing could save this vehicle. If you like the worst of Disney cheese, you'll love this. Otherwise steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"This movie is very corny. It is also annoying. It is a little unrealistic that everything would work out so well for this family. It is horribly corny. It is unbelieveable because Hayley Mills has a British accent and her family does not. Burl Ives's role is also cheesy (what else is new), and the name of the dude who owns the house's name is stolen from the bass player is Aerosmith, Tom Hamilton. The movie glorifies old ideals, such as country being better than the city. U should stay away from this one. It is not worth a stinking penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this Disney Classic, however, when I received it I found out that the disc can not be played in my region.

Maybe a dress...but then again, what child (a male no less) thinks of rushing out and getting something to make his mother more beautiful in case she meets Jesus? And come on....like the kid is really going to know what size shoe?I just think the lyrics are poorly timed, cheesy as all get out and I just gag when I hear it.The sad part is that this song, along with the likes of \\"Simply Having A Wonderful Christmastime\\" by John Lennon and \\"Last Christmas\\" by Wham, will go down in history and be played year after year as \\"classics\\".The thought of that is enough to make anyone say Bah Humbug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!

All it lacks is a puppy dog, Charlie Brown's Christmas tree, and a children's choir. Oh, wait - it has a children's choir. There's enough saccharine in this song to embarrass Dan Fogelberg.

At no point does it suggest Jesus is concerned about footwear; the song simply reflects a young child's perspective and his love for his mother.Also, I find the assertion of this song being \\"schmaltzy\\" or deliberately gut wrenching to be curious.

To me, it seemed to run along the same lines as David Brant's Music video in \\"The Office Christmas Special,\\" or Eric Cartman's \\"Swiss Colony Beef Log,\\" from the South Park Christmas Album. All three of these songs are hilarious because their subject matter is about as rediculous as it gets, the music is overly sappy with a chord structure that could be written by a twelve year old, and the singing is so overemotional that one can't help but laugh.The problem with \\"Christmas Shoes\\" is that it's serious. It makes me sad that music like this can be a hit while so many talented musicians and song writers are struggling to get by.I'm sure the members of Newsong are fine people, but it blows me away that music like this can be taken seriously by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop playing this schmaltz!","review":"I listen to a radio staion that only plays Christmas music and this song is played over and over and over.

It's that bad.What's meant to be touching comes across as truly manipulative and unnerving - our narrator genuinely believes that he has done something extraordinary by chipping in to help a mangy little boy buy some high heels for his dying mom.

I would like to echo the sentiments of another reviewer who noted that many hard working musicians are stuggling to find success while junk like this finds it's way onto a record and then onto the radio. This song is so sappy sweet that I had to call Wilford Brimley to buy some of his diabetes medication. \\"Christmas Shoes\\" makes \\"Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time\\" sound like 'Stairway to Heaven'.This song is unacceptable; therefor, this album receives a 1 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shoes!","review":"Don't know how I missed this -- just lucky, I guess.

What a close-minded, judgmental, condescending thing to say.This song, IMO, is simply a poorly written, poorly executed attempt to pull at heartstrings. If the author's Very Cunning Plan had succeeded, great. But this one fails miserably. Phrases like \\"you see, sir...\\" would probably have most of the Saints in heaven rolling their eyes and reaching for the Mylanta.It's like a lot of Christian Rock.

The case is lightweight plastic - doomed to fail eventually. But it has many nice compartments and, if taken care of nicely, ought to last a few years at least.The case can hold a lot more connectors than it comes with. I was able to integrate a lot of other items into it in order to make it into a pretty nice travelling kit.

When I received the unit the box clearly states that the FW800 only operates at FW400 speed, in other words half as fast.Considering that they offer an identical unit that is FW 400 and costs 1/3 to 1/2 as much there is no reason to buy this unit.It went straight back to Amazon for a full refund (Amazon's the best!).

They kiss all wrong and the one sex scene is VERY brief.That aside, the writing is lousy. The dialogue was off (some of the lines were just unbelievable) and there are about 4 or 5 plot \\"twists\\" that would never happen in real life. Also Mormons come off very badly in this movie. They're portrayed as homophobic jerks and very evil too. Add in a pointless role for Jacqueline Bissett and a totally unbelievable happy ending and you've got one BAD movie!Want to see a good gay movie about relationships? See \\"Jeffrey\\" or \\"Love!

I generally like foreign and art house fare, but must admit to loving this little gem just as much as many of my favorite higher-brow works. It just goes to show you don't need tons of money or recognizable names to produce a wonderful film. Kudos to everyone involved in this entertaining yet substantive piece of work!!! Oh, and I forgot to say that the only weak link in the film was Jacqueline Bisset's wooden performance. I would have given it an even higher rating if someone else had been cast in her role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful film","review":"This is not your typical gay romance film. While not perfect, it shows the truth about the Mormon church - that it is oppressive of gays (to the point of using methods like electroshock therapy to \\"convert\\" gay Mormons to \\"straight\\" Mormons). Having had a lot of interpersonal contact with Mormons (I'm not one), what you see on the screen is accurate, from the attempts by missionaries to get people to listen to their religion, to the \\"court of love\\" Steve Sandvoss's character has to endure, to the tirade Mary Kay Place spouts.Steve Sandvoss is a major hunk. He also pulls off the role of Aaron very well. Wes Ramsey comes off as the stereotypical Hollywood gay boy who becomes more involved in the real world. The fact that the two characters end up happily ever after-ing made me shed a tear. I'd love to find someone like Aaron for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars","review":"One of the best gay movies of all times.

Go and see this movie it is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great love story","review":"Being raised in the LDS church (Mormon), and being gay I see a lot of things that are very true in this.Yes growing up we were raised to believe that we should stay away from people that are different or worldly because it was bad or evil; however to confuse matters they would also tell us not to judge others and to love others. So it is easy to see how some in the church had got all screwed up.I loved this relationship in the movie and the true caring of the two characters. I would recommend this movie to all who would love to see a nice love story. But will not get offended by the truth of what can happen in the LDS religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"It mattered to me","review":"I have seen \\"Latter Days\\" six times and I think I may have become addicted to it. Although I have read reviews that claim the characters are stock and predictable, I was able to identify with them and felt as if they were sharing my own thoughts and feelings and fears. I think this movie is powerful for those of us struggling to find our authentic selves and those struggling to find meaningful relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latter Days - Rises above Most","review":"I bought and watched Latter Days this month, and was moved by the story, despite some cliches that are built into many gay-themed movies and novels. The two main characters are well played and authentic. While Christian's conversion from circuit boy to thoughtful monogamist is a little unrealistically fast, the movie moves and touches the heart. Too bad that the dialogue occasionally gets lost by a too loud musical score. Hopefully screenwriters and filmmakers will produce more of this quality gay film. The story had an unexpected sad twist, and that's good, because, hey, isn't that how life is for most of us? Not everyone in real life is Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in \\"You've Got Mail\\".... Watch this movie, its worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving film about religion and self-acceptance","review":"This was an amazingly moving film. It was also an amazingly accurate film. In the lyrics he wrote for the songs, in the dialog, in the struggle on the faces of these 19 year old Mormon boys, C. Jay Cox has created an astoundingly accurate portrayal of the struggle a yound LDS boy has to endure before acknowledging that homosexual is not what he does, but an integral part of what he is. As a former saint, I felt that the film had an authenticity about the Church and C.Jay Cox's love/hate relationship with it.The love story itself was likewise moving -- I don't think I have EVER felt so much longing for an embrace in which I wasn't a participant!One thing I wondered about, however. If Cox really wanted to make a film that would be seen by a 15 year old Mormon boy finding himself, as he says in the commentary, why did he make an R-rated film? I would love to suggest this film to the remaining LDS portion of my family, but they do not watch R-rated films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Formula film full of of stereotypes. But I was moved by it.","review":"This is a story about two young people who fall in love. The fact that they are both young men and one is a studying to be a minister in the Mormon Church creates a lot of complications. During the course of the movie, we see the \\"pretty boy\\" whose only interest was himself, change into a caring human being. The young Mormon has a larger struggle as his parents disown him and his Church shames him.I didn't expect to like this film. It's a formula film with a lot of stereotypes. And yet, I was strangely moved in spite of a slow story without many surprises. I'll give it a mild recommendation but I know it's not for everybody. And it's certainly no great art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having a religious family","review":"I thought this was a wonderful film that exposes the struggle some gays experience when they must deal with a severely religious family. This movie was a great mix of comedy and drama to provide an emotional but uplifting experience. The fight scene between Aaron and his mother was practically verbatim a page from my life. Those who were raised in a conservative religious family will identify with and be touched by this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful and HEARTFELT Movie!!!","review":"Latter Days is a movie starring: Steve Sandvoss, Wes Ramsey, Joesph Gordon-Levitt, Rebekah Jordan, Amber Benson, Khary Payton, Jim Ortlieb, Mary Kay Place with Erik Palladino and Jaqueline Bisset as Lila.This movie is about Aaron (Steve Sandvoss), a mormon missionary, traveling door-to-door in Los Angeles spreading the word of his faith and religion.Christian (Wes Ramsey), is a cute West Hollywood Party boy, who goes from man-to-man without much committment. Opposites attract when Aaron and Christan meets, and sparks fly............MY ReView.......After, viewing this DVD like 15 times (literally) after having it for about 2 weeks I still cry because of what torture these two have to indure.

I've never seen a gay love story so touching and true to life. My friends and family both gay and straight were all moved by the superb acting and storyline. The music supplies not only an expellant background but the songs follow the story and are even a part of it. The struggles typify real life situations.

As each boy's reality is shattered, the two are drawn into a passionate romance that risks destroying their lives.

I didn't like anything about him. He was as unlikeable as the lead was genuinely likable.

This is just another example of bad casting and bad writing. Not everybody has the perfect body and face and when are they going to write something that some body else hasn't written already. Enough of this crap, try just once to make a movie with real people not the Hollywood-type.

Don't waste your time and why not give us \\"normal\\" guys a chance, we are not ALL superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy This!!!!","review":"I am absolutly stunned by how many people think that this movie is worth buying. I rented this movie when I first saw it and I wanted my $4 back. The acting as well as the writting is terrible! I could not believe how not only bad it was, but unrealistic as well.I sincerely reccomend that if you absolutly have to see this movie, rent it. The characters are just beyond unbelievable. There is also a strange sub-plot with the woman that apparently all the \\"friends\\" work for that never really means anything to the story.

I have also had 3 other LTRs, 2 of my partners passed away after 6 years each of monogamous partnership and my first left me for a drag queen and promptly died from AIDS in 1985. This movie does not do a good service to young gay men EXCEPT to give them hope. Some viewers may find love but the vast majority will not, at least not in any way this fantasy plays out. It is a contrived, by-the-gay-numbers movie with a plot that I had written out in my head after 10 minutes into it. It rings hollow and is cheap looking. The acting is OK in my opinion. Still stinks. Now, if you approach this fairy tale with the mindset that it is your boring typical boy-meets-boy story soap opera and is not as a documentary or as holding anything resembling true life, you will be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Movie","review":"I love this movie. It made me laugh and it made me cry. The story is unique.

I have worked in theatre all my life, i'm gay and i have a love for many years and i'm a Jehovah Witness.Seeing this film and the love that these two boys have for each other and then i look at my own life and my life with my long term partner, this movie only made my love for my partner grow even more.You can not pretend who you are. I have a termendous love and respect for Jehovah (GOD) and i have a termendous love and respect for my partner and this film becomes the glue that holds both my love for Jehovah's Bible and my relationship with my partner.This movie is wonderful in every respect. It's honest, funny, heartwarming, and if you happen to love God this movie will help you out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Romance","review":"A wonderful, moving movie. The ups and down Christian and Davis go through are touching and heartbreaking. I laughed and cried at several points in this movie. If you're looking for a lot of nudity, then this isn't the film for you. However, if what you're looking for is a true romance, you can't beat this one. It's one of the best gay films I've ever seen. It's a shame there aren't more of this caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Tolerance Movie","review":"I really enjoyed Latter Days because I found the love story between Aaron and Christian to be touching, and I also believe that the meaning of tolerance came out in this movie. I almost cried due to the epic scene with Aaron in the bathroom. If you liked Brokeback Mountian's forbidden love story, you will love the forbidden love story of Latter Days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latter Days","review":"Very good movie. Gets a message accross that love is love no matter who it is with. Being gay is not a bad thing. If you don't accept it, that is fine. But just leave it at that and leave them alone.

A Mormon from Idaho is sent on a mission with 3 other boys to Los Angeles, where the protagonist, Christian, ends up falling for a gay waiter who is seeking to conqueor Christian based on a bet.Nice premise, and it is fairly entertaining, but ultimatly falls flat. I don't mind bashing religions, I do it all the time, but it was done here in a very unconvincing way. I felt that the queers, one of whom is \\"shallow,\\" but \\"not really,\\" in this film were even worse than the \\"right-winged, narrow minded\\" Mormons. There is so much stereo-typing in this, that I ended up laughing at dialouge that wasn't meant to be laughed at. And the ending! Oh, please...it would've been an ok film were it not for the predictable, sappy ending.This is sure to have its appeal with some, but those of you looking for a Almodovar-ish intellectual masterpiece; I doubt you'll find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Why are gay audiences so unbelievably forgiving? The plot had so many holes in it I lost count, the dialogue was as cliche as it gets, the characters were plastic and unrealistic. Convenience trumped thoughtfulness over and over in this film. The music seemed slapped together by an adolescent and the scene transitions were artless. Its lone saving grace? beautiful, sometimes naked protaganists. Well, that is not nearly enough for me. Why must gay and artful be so chronically separated in the world of film? I thought this film was just wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sticky wad of gay bubble gum","review":"Religious persecution by radical sects against gay people is a serious topic so I wish it had been covered by serious people. The script writers and the cast should have been used on a movie with a more shallow theme that needed less thought and concern put into it. I hope some day a competent and talented director revisits this topic and does a better job of handling it.Latter Days is a chick flick, except that in the place of overly hormonal young valley girls we have two gay kids, one of whom is totally hot, by the way. The only decent member of the cast was the actress who played the Mormon kid's mother. All the rest of the actors and actresses were horrible. The screen play was contrived - at times laughable and at times cringe-inducing. Most of the movie's attempts to create humor fall completely flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REDO review","review":"I stopped watching this movie and gave it one star earlier this year, after a particularly sad scene, because I couldn't take what I thought was another sad sad movie ending. But then thanks goodness I watched it again, and I love it, especially the happy hopeful ending.Sorry fans, but this movie lover can't take another sad hopeless gay movie, even if the ending is the real deal.I love this movie and I highly recommend buying it. I have watched it more than 10+ times and I love it more with each viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See Gem","review":"This is a film that says more than just being a sappy romance. Hidden beneath the cover a romantic comedy, there is a harsh and dark truth, a plea for people to accept each other and to accept themselves. C. Jay Cox has crafted a story that hits all to close to reality for many of us, and he does so with grace and ease. Growing up in the Mountain West, I have seen first hand most of the pain and the sorrow that are depicted so beautifully in the movie. And thanks to Cox for being able to make the best of a bad situation and offer hope instead of sadness. The casting of the two main characters Christian (Ramsey) and Aaron (Sandvoss) offers a perfect balance, and the two work so well together. Their ability to understand these characters and give us a glimps into their own worlds is refreshing and rewarding.This is more than a gay themed movie, and worth a watch for those who have struggles in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Favorite Gay Movie--Ever !","review":"What a passionate love story unfolded before my eyes !

As for the movie, the actors are very well directed and the storyline is awesome, loved the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely OK movie, nothing more","review":"While it's nice to see that this movie affected some people, I found it to be predictable and disappointing. The main flaws: 1) I totally did not buy the relationship between the 'party boy' and the Mormon, and certainly didn't buy that they were in love, considering that they had probably only 4 scenes together before they professed their love for one another. 2) The characterization is inconsistent, especially with the Mormon. 3)The subplot with Jacqueline Bisset, while kind-of interesting, is handled awkwardly and ties in with the two characters in an eye-roll inducing manner. 4) I left the movie early, but I was able to predict the ending, which my friend confirmed for me. But this is just my opinion, my friend LOVED this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Movie - Highly Recommend to ALL!!","review":"Definitely get the unrated version - more true to the Direcor's vision.While this ultimately is a \\"gay themed\\" love story - it is so much more!

If you want to see a good movie about a struggle between religious belief and being true to yourself,this is the perfect movie for you. I read the one star reviews and found some of the comments laughable. One person felt as though this movie should be based entirely on truth. This is a movie, and it is entertaining! It is well acted and touching. I watched the movie a second time with the directors commentary. He explained that he was involved, at one time, with the religion of one of the main characters. Much of the dialog and character studies are based on people he Knew and what he drew from his former life. This is not a fact based story. Some of the acting is terrific!!

Top movie EVER!","review":"Everyone has explained the movie, so I won't waste your time with another description - I simply want to say this is by far the most moving, best picture ever. The acting, directing, and plot was beyond what a blockbuster release could ever even dream of. Yes, parts may be a little corny, and somewhat low-budget, but I would bet that everyone will at least LOVE this movie, regardless of your thoughts on the issues raised in the film.It's too bad this didn't get bigger release, but there is still a chance to make it more known - watch it yourself and get everyone you know to watch it. It certainly deserves large credit and awards (more so than Brokeback Mountain even!)Very powerful movie - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"so-so","review":"Not as funny or interesting as I thought it would be.

I loved this film not only for the fantastic story (which needed to be told), but also for the way the actors delivered the story. This is not another shallow \\"gay movie\\" that depicts stereotypical characters in humorous situations. This was a memorable and flawless effort to show people that love truly knows no bounds, and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. Another thing that touched my heart was how well I could relate to the emotion portrayed in this film surrounding the coming out of one of the main characters. We all have to go through similar situations living in the society that we live in and feeling that feeling of detachment from everything that is \\"right\\" and \\"normal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that sticks","review":"I could not stop thinking about this movie for three days after I saw it. My coming out story is in the past, and I can't say that I relate to any of the characters, but I was in tears when I watched this movie. This is quite possibly in the top 5 most touching movies I've seen. The only gay movie that made me cry more than this is \\"It's My Party\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"The direction of this film is excellent. I love all the characters and the way they interact. The storyline is very important also. It's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other. It's a well-paced and interesting story that's not like anything else I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"Definite must see. This one has a story line and its about love and relationships. Production quality is high. I was very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latter Days rewardlingly romantic","review":"Morman missionary Aaron meets West Hollywood party boy Christian and opposites attract. However, Christian's questionable motivation rocks Aarons world when he finds out he may have been had. More than just a coming of age gay movie, this film explores the dilema between faith and romance. It quietly looks at the stereotypes and prejudice faced both internally and externally and delivers some needed social punch. The actors are handsome and visually appealing, but this movie is deeper than it's surface skin might show. It shows how casually people enter into commitments only to find out that the process is far from \\"casual\\" in it's impact. Realizing that \\"you can't take it back\\" is a hard learned lesson, as these characters find out. There is an intensity to this movie that should broaden it's appeal. The even pacing and flow of this movie coupled with good acting (including some sceen stealing by some of the supporting actors) make it well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership is Not Smokership!!","review":"Chapters on George Bush's ridiculous presidential leadership (with a Harvard MBA!!)already worth the dollars and readership.Lee Iacocca has the guts and integrity to say things out, although he can be very blunt and direct. Talk straight and bring out the brutual truth/reality are arts of true leadership in this case.But one thing Lee Iacocca should pay attention to. If he likes to smoke, he can do it privately, like at home or somewhere else. True leadership does not imply that he has to smoke cigar (see the book cover!) to project a leadership or bossy image. LEADERSHIP IS NOT SMOKERSHIP.Besides, such image is already outdated!! He can consider changing the book cover in his paperback edition. Smoking is bad modelling and not good for health, especially for someone who presents himself as leader, like Iaacoca!! The tone of the book cover simply doesn't match the serious content of the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring Bush-Bash","review":"The first section of this book, some 124 bages, is a redundant, tiresome Bush-Bash.

From the author smoking a cigar on the cover - to whining about healthcare problems (hey Leader Big Man, get the darn cigar out of your mouth!)it's just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the first chapter.","review":"After reading the first chapter, I wasn't sure if the writer was Michael Moore or Lee Iacocca. Just another scathing critique of George W. Bush. Heard it before and no longer interested. I won't waste my time reading any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Have All the Writers Gone?","review":"Simply put, this book is awful. I was a huge Iacocca fan before, and it's apparent that his latest book was produced merely for the money. This book is nothing like the previous great books, but I bought it thinking it would be inspirational like those were.Where Have All the Leaders Gone? is nothing but a rambling criticism of every one in the country...President Bush, Congress, business leaders, and Americans in general. If Mr. Iacocca has all the answers, then why hasn't he stepped up to the plate and made a difference? He's been conspicuously absent the last 20 years.I quit reading the book after the first 100 pages, as I grew very weary of the negative ramblings, the lack of any substance and the continued bashing of Bush and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish Mr Iacocca wrote this book before the last election!","review":"He is right on, I agree with almost everything he says about our leaders. They are either arrogant, ignorant, cowardly, or a combination of all three. Worst of all, we are not being led by noble altruists who really care about our country or the world. We are lied to Bush et al, and the Democrats have not challenged them forcefully enough. Lee Iacocca is real life example of what a leader should be, not the partisan hacks we elected for and must rid ourselves in less than 2 years. Read this book and get justifiably angry. We should be screaming mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Lee Iacocca once briefly considered running for President at the urging of those who saw his leadership qualities. He consulted Tip O'Neal, who rightly advised him to \\"forget it!\\" Iacocca is far to logical, ethical and brilliant to have functioned as a Presidental Puppet....which is really all our Presidents are. Great book by a wonderfully candid man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iacocca's latest book","review":"This book is excellent! It is a down to earth practical critique of our government and our country's leaders [both political and business leaders]. It provides a practical guide for voters to use to assess political candidates. My 95 year old mother just read the book and wrote letters to all the Democratic Presidential candidates [she's a Democrat] telling them the book is a must read for any presidential candidate. I agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Loved his first book. In light of that, I overlooked his overt brutality of the Bush Administration until I realized that this was, for the most part, the focus of the book. Perhaps deservedly so, but the extent of his criticisms made his message unconstructive and more like a personal rant.Lee Iacocca made his name by being a straight-shooter and a man of ideas. This work showed him as neither and for that, I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as I expected.","review":"Not really as good as i thought it would be... Dont know what i was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Have All the Leaders Gone?","review":"\\"Where Have All the Leaders Gone?\\" does an excellent job of asking the questions of how United States leadership has failed us, especially in the last decade or so. As a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) himself, Lee Iacocca explains the limitations and responsibilities of such a role. He offers insights that we, the voters, should be demanding of our leaders."},{"rating":"1","title":"throw this bum out!","review":"Lee Iacocca (LI) was the product manager for the Ford Pinto. Somehow he dodged that disaster. Then, he went to Chrysler wherein 1978 he and the auto workers' union accepted billions from the US government. Chrysler today really doesn't exist even though Mercedes and then Cerebrus thought they could do something with it. The US government (again!) gave it ten billion dollars. Instead of the US auto union being part of the deal, it's the Italian auto union that has this \\"dead horse.\\" Hmmm ... isn't Iacocca an Italian name? :-)Googling on Chrysler took me to [...] where you can see more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!!","review":"This book was incredible. It was a quick read, thought provoking, eye opening, and I read it intently with highlighter in hand. I read Lee's autobiography years ago and enjoyed it but this was the best. Lee's style is honest, blunt, and direct. He offers a refreshing and unbridled point of view to today's leadership. Everyone should really read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much of What Iacocca says wise","review":"Lee Iaccocca said when Presidential candidates campaign, they should be announcing their team. This is a great idea. Months are wasted putting a team in place, and due to the partisan nature of our system, the hand-off from one regime to the other does not always run smooth.Other ideas worth considering are getting away from dependence on fossil fuels. How much work is really being done in this area?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest perspective on what makes a good leader","review":"This was a great read. It is not on any party lines, but rather looks at the qualities that it takes to make a good leader. It was insiteful in how off track the nation and its leaders have become in bowing to the spin doctors, and media frenzies. It gives you a new perspective in how to look for a good leader in the next election. I want to see leaders that are working for the common good of the nation, and not for the whims of some political party agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Inconvenient Truth...","review":"We need more leaders who are willing to speak out against the corporate and political insanity that is epidemic in America. Mr. Iacocca is one of the few willing to step up to that challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Rants from a previously respected spokesperson.","review":"I always thought highly of Iacocca as a no-nonsense guy, but this book is a dated DNC talking points Bush-bashing which in today's mess should be comical but instead is sad. I would love to hear what he thinks of the new administration he wanted and got and their current leadership ability. Changing parties is obviously NOT the solution.If you want to relive the old let's hate Bush & Cheney and the War is a lie, then this is for you. Otherwise expecting anything approaching wisdom in this effort is a waste of time. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its about time someone said it!","review":"Very straight forward book from a proven leader that is trying to give America a wake-up call. Good to finally see someone who is not afraid to be UN-Politically Right and tells it like it is.

Iacocca didn't have to compete.All He had to do was put his hand out & beg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee Iacocca, Where have all the leaders gone?","review":"Good read. I like how Lee is a straight shooter, he calls it like he sees it. His views on the business world, politics and people are spot on. It is good for a laugh every few paragraphs.I found his diolog with Fidel Castro entertaining to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Lee lost me when he mentioned Character and Clinton in same paragraph. It is a shame and sad that he spent so much time in the Bush bashing and not coming up with real ways to fix a lot of problems. Most of his leadership ideas could be found anywhere business is discussed. Getting new business leaders to follow the time tested ideas is the problem. All who think Lee saved Chrysler have not talked to those thousands that were put out of work. Like so many like him, it is easy to Monday morning quarterback, Branson of Virgin Atlantic is now a champion of the environment, would have liked to seen someone tell him 20 years ago his jets were causing global warming. Or tell Lee he could not do anything he wished to cut cost..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say garbage?","review":"Is this guy a parrot for moveon?Nothing in this book is original. Straight forward, yes, mindless bitter rants with no real substance, yes.I lost every bit of respect for Mr. Iococca in this book, I expected it from Catherine Whitney though.If you hate George Bush, read this book. If you cannot think for yourself, read this book. If you wish to know the talking points for every liberal commentator in the country, read this book.I am disappointed in selecting this book for a leadership paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great retired leaders should not write books.","review":"Tough read! Iacocca attempts to attack politics using business principles. The diatribes and laced discontent for the current administration defuse his message of the nine qualities of leadership. When I purchased the book, I thought it was on business leadership. Instead, the book bashes President Bush and skips leadership.However, great leadership as he points out does not put blame on others, but Iacocca squarely puts the blame on President Bush (whom I do not support) for everything from 9/11 to the auto industry woes. Many items rightly so, but does blaming and complaining convert us to be great leaders. I am afraid not.The nine C's of leadership are great, but disorganized when presented as one crosses into the next type. In addition, none is fully developed. Iacocca has the premise for a great leadership book, but fails to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give 'em Hell, Lee","review":"Too bad he retired from the auto industry.

After 20 pages of Bush bashing, I was very tired of it. Mr. Iacocca should have waited 2 more years to write this and Bush would look like an angel compared with what the current administration is doing to our country.

I wanted to see what he would say in hindsight as he looked back. Although he says a lot, probably not as 'deep' as I would have liked. A great man looks back and says \\"This was good\\" or \\"Made a mistake here\\", or \\"we could expand on this\\". I was disappointed to find his book more a justification of himself, and maybe even vitriolic. Although I like and respect leaders who stand up to be counted, Iacocca has his numbers wrong. Insightful book on how not to lead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Have all the Leaders Gone?","review":"For 263 pages, this old geezer whines about everything from oil to autos. Let me saves you $25...he hates President Bush, he hates everything he has done and he hates everything he's ever going to do. Al Gore has the right ideas. Nothing new or inspiring or even interesting. We learn what an important guy Lee is because he's got all of these friends, God rest their souls. The worst book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shere Have All the Leaders Gone?","review":"I read the first chapters in this book and thought I was reading the New York Times. I can get this liberal - blame America first drivel from the print media and the news networks. Why buy the book.This was the first book that I have ever owned that I wanted to burn!Such a waste for Mr Iacocca!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Lee Iacocca gone?","review":"Apparently in his old age Lee has forgotten what made America. In the first eight pages he makes over a dozen derogatory remarks about President Bush or his administration, drudging up every piece of tabloid gossip from the past several years. Naturally he fails to return to the days of whitewater or Monica Lewinsky yet he seems to bring up all the other media gossip that most of us have left in the past. The icing on the cake is when he insults religion by referring to the presidents faith as \\"crap\\". Lee should stick to subjects he knows best, corporate leardership, and stop using his famous past as a method for spreading his deranged ideological viewpoints like hollywood does. Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"This book could have been interesting, and some of Iacocca's suggestions and ideas are intriguing. The problem, however, is that he cannot get past his partisanship. The first chapter, for instance, details his ideal leadership qualities and why Bush does not live up to them. Unfortunately, he does not support his claims with a factual analysis, but, rather, unsupported opinion--even if many of his claims could be supported, he leaves them as stand-alone \\"facts,\\" which hurts his intentions. He claims that all Americans should--indeed, must, if they call themselves patriots--be outraged at the current government, yet he fails to support that opinion. He simply accepts opinion and conjecture as fact and moves on from there. Don't get me wrong; I do think that some of his ideas are quite worthwhile. But his political bias interferes with his attempts at providing a straightforward, rational analysis of leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harangue, not an analysis.","review":"I was impressed by the jacket \\"bullets\\" and ordered this book expecting to find a business-like approach answering the question posed in the title. Unfortunately, the author's continuous diatribe against President Bush left me cold. Certainly he has every right to criticize the policies of an administration, but I question the value of a shrill harangue against any individual and especially the President of the United States. It certainly detracted from the value of the book to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Have the Responsible Adults Gone?","review":"That would be a much more interesting book Lee. A 192 page ghost written whine is not my cup of tea. Even a dolt such as Lee Iacocca can look smart when the Government is bailing out his third rate company with 100s of millions of dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K., we get it. You hate Bush. But, what about leadership???","review":"This book isn't about leadership - it's a collection of hateful rants aimed at the Bush presidency. Touting the \\"success\\" of the Chrysler K car (!?!?!) was laughable and delivering a mean-spirited attack about the president's actions on 9/11 was churlish and really low. I'm glad my president had the good sense NOT to look panicked to the world (kids at school) and to assess his safety before heading back to D.C. This book masquerades as a book about leadership, but it is really an octogenarian's platform for spewing his political dogma and venom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self fulfilling","review":"I could hardly get through it. It is nothing but a self rightous epic that is too long on what he sees as the problem and not much on the solution. Too much on how he did things back when. After reading this I can see that he was only successful because of those that he surrounded himself with. This diatribe gave me a whole new perspective of Lee Iacocca. I'm sorry that I bought the book and threw it in the trash when I was done. I don't want to dilute the gene pool any more than it already is. He and the publisher win with my money and I lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Iacocca's brain gone?","review":"This book is nothing but a divisive, hate-filled diatribe against President Bush. I bought it to get some insight into Mr Iacocca's views of leadership. Instead what I got is 263 pages of anti-Bush rhetoric that is the same ignorant material that is found on the infantile pages of the Daily Kos and other extreme liberal web pages. It is obvious that Mr Iacocca did not write this or, if he did, he is slipping ungracefully into senility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Leaders Chased Off","review":"This book was a real disappointment. Mr Iacocca demonstrated a complete lack of objectivity. His main thrust was to bash Bush while extolling the virtues of Clinton and Gore and any other that will take a far left wing stance. A criticism of a president is ok but we do not live in a world where all of one group are right and all of the other are wrong. Where Have All The Leaders Gone? has nothing to do with seeking real leaders but instituting an ideology. Sorry, this book has little redeeming value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rantings of an Old Man...","review":"I find it hard to believe that this long time hero of mine has gone completely senile. Just how can you bash the government when they were the ones that guaranteed your loans and bought you time in order to turn around Chrysler? You became a hero because of them and the American public and this is how you pay them back? I thought a true leader was someone who not only fixed the problems but made the company a strong future as well? When a good leader leaves, the company should continue to grow? You can't blame him for selling to Daimler because you gave him nothing to work with. How can you only use political examples to show bad leadership when they abound in current day business? It appears that my hero, like Reagan and other heros I've cherished over the years, has prepared himself for the pasture. Please, Lee, go out in style. Not with these venomous ravings of a mad-man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Sad!","review":"I wasn't even through the first chapter and I realized that a once great American Business Leader has turned into a crotchety, whiny geezer. Iacocca's Autobiography was an excellent read and I was hoping for something along that line, but what we have here an old man, reminiscent of the old men sitting around the pot belly stove in the General Store solving the worlds problems by plowing fields in the other direction. Mr. Iacocca doesn't have a clue about the worlds problems and prefers to be at the center of attention at the latest snob party. Bashing Bush is about as original as DIRT, so stick to your Brandy and Cigars old man. As a side note, your POS K-car is no where to be seen today. That's because most of them broke down at 20,000 miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"More blithering idiot liberalism on display...","review":"I had no idea Iacocca was such a poor excuse for a leader.

To bookstores where they have purchased Iacoocca's book and now they are all trying to do ten things that start with C: In the rest of the world, leaders are playing with a full alphabet.

Reading this is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"Lee Iacocca presents his ideas on what it takes to be a leader, in an intelligent and concise manner. He explains why he feels that we, as a nation, are lacking the kind of leadership that will benefit our country and our children's futures. Mr. Iacocca challenges the reader to take an active role in ensuring that our country will continue its legacy of freedom, morality, prosperity, and civility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every American needs to read this.","review":"This is a must read for all Americans. It needs to be read so that voters know what questions to ask the next group of presidential candidates. I like Lee's suggestion that our politicians need to be held accountable for their actions in government and idea's how to do it.The discussion about how businesses are run and have to be profitable to survive yet our government doesn't seem to think they have to do anything but get us deeper in debt.There isn't enough space to point out all we need to be aware of and need to consider before voting. Read this one for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a straight shooter!","review":"Lee Iacocca gives his opinion in a clear and concise manner based upon his extensive experience as a leader. He does so with no sugar-coating or political correctness -- very refreshing! However, I'm sure that the current presidential administration and all of his loyalists do not fully appreciate the author's blunt approach and accurate assessment of their performance. Our country has some serious, deep-seated problems that the President and members of Congress are totally ignoring. It's time for other leaders to step up to the plate to help our country regain its competitiveness, to help the middle class, and to restore our outstanding reputation around the world. This is an excellent book and Lee has written what many of us have been discussing among our small groups for years! Well worth the price and time to read.

Lee states that the U.K. has \\"the lowest per capital income in Europe\\". But in fact, every country in Eastern Europe ranks lower than the U.K."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly disappointed","review":"For someone who has been in business for as long as Mr. Iacocca has, he should understand more about what makes the world go around, and deal with the realities. This book is long on whining and short on real solutions. The problem is corruption - corruption from the individual level to the society at large - and no one has a real solution for it. When a fix for short term thinking and greed comes, then all of the other political and economic problems will be solved.I am surprised that Mr. Iacocca takes no responsibility for the policies that he helped to promulgate (NAFTA), which we are now seeing the fruit of. George Bush is not God, and isn't the sole bearer of responsibility for 50 years of liberal ideology in America. There is plenty of blame to go around in all American political and business circles. If the reader wants good ideas for the short term, look elsewhere than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly Insightful","review":"Lee Iacocca hits the nail right on the head in this compelling and insightful depiction of where this great country of ours is headed unless we do something about it. Unfortunately, those most in need of the message won't read the book or, if they did, care enough to make the necessary changes. I took the words to heart and have agreed to work toward what Mr. Iacocca is asking for. It is a fast read and a must read for anyone interested in restoring America to greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I lost myself in the world of the first two books--this one was simply jarring! To disjointed, to many characters with names to difficult to keep track off, and to many unanswered questions to be anywhere near satisfying as a \\"conclusion\\". I was never able to re-enter the world and simply enjoy the story! Constantly having to look-up names in the glossary was so much helpful as distracting.Unless there's more to come, what was the point of the No-God? the bird, etc. While so many other authors of epic fanatsy simply keep the story going ad-infinitum (gouging their paying public?), I looked forward to a trilogy that actually was a trilogy, but this \\"conclusion\\" without a conclusion was just as frustrating and in many ways, more disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"this is the end, my only friend\\" ...!","review":"I guess mr. Bakker run out of ideas as soon as he finished writing the first book in the trilogy. Moreover when you reach the end of the book you have to realize that it ends in nothing... and that maybe all you read before is useless. Ok, I'm not saying that the book has no meaning (it is actually there, and it is quite disturbing...) but it simply couldn't satisfy anyone because at the end it seems you're back at the biginning which is quite annoying after well over 1500 pages of banal philosophy, sex and violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can this really be the end??","review":"I absolutely loved this series. Bakker's realistic way of describing fantastic events and making them seem so similar to our own history makes the characters and events flow, and flow quickly. Although the final book does leave many questions unanswered, this just allows for a huge opening for a follow-up trilogy. I'm hoping that Bakker will come out with a new story for these characters and soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Non-Conclusion to the Series","review":"The Prince of Nothing series started out well, there were great possibilities to be explored: an ancient evil, a lurking tribe of guardians, and an unwitting world. The Warrior Prophet, gave me no real conclusion, the series seemed to only chronicle the rise of the Kellhus (obligatory savior with a machiavellian bent, and his ascendancy to power. No great war with the No-God (ancient evil), just a bit of political subterfug, a little bit of scheming, and a war among men.I found myself doing the equivalent of \\"fast-forwarding\\" through a dvd and flipping pages. It wasn't the philosophical subject matter that made me do this, it was the sheer volume of prose in this book, that made me lose further interest. Yes, I read it to finish the series, if you start the series you may as well finish with this book. Otherwise, not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you ever forget how much everyone reveres Kellhus, don't worry, Bakker will remind you on the next page","review":"Imagine you're reading the Lord of the Rings. You get to the battle of Pellenor Fields, you see a Ringwraith killed and a huge army of Sauron's minions destroyed. Then imagine that instead of finishing the book, doing things like, you know, DESTROYING SAURON, Tolkien just held a coronation for Aragorn and ended it at that, with the fate of Middle-Earth still up for grabs. That would be this book.This trilogy could have been done in 1 1/2 - 2 volumes. Which would have been great, because it would have left room for the story to actually have an ending. But instead we have three bloated texts full of revelations and re-revelations of Kellhus' awesomeness, accompanied by descriptions of battles that somehow end up being dry and utterly boring. I'm giving two stars because Bakker has quite a way with word, but he has to learn when to stop using them and start advancing his plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"alien crash landing","review":"No one remarked on this one yet: What gave me the shivers is the gradually revealed SF background in this fantasy setting. Although it is more hinted at than fully described, the idea of creating a fantasy environment with an ancient alien crash landing is gorgeous! And its a black black scenario that Bakker creates: Sorcery against genetical engineering, absolute hostile behaviour of the alien arrivals (instead of \\"here's how to build a warp-drive works, folks\\"), the near elimination of the Non-Men (Tolkien's elves lent to these) by applying alien gen-tech. As said: You don't find it as part of the main plot, but it is all there, mostly in the very well made glossary, the Sagas and Seswata's dreamsApart from that: I just love sorcerers that wield the power of tactical nuke warheads in battle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slightly dissapointing","review":"Book Three in the Prince of Nothing trilogy is a step back from The Warrior Prophet. I think that the world Bakker has created is my favourite fantasy world (excepting Middle-earth of course!), but I think that in this book Bakker let's the plot get away from him a little bit. The end of the Holy War and Kellhus's confrontation with his father were both somewhat anticlimactic. Also I found the writing to be unclear at times. There were a couple of scenes in the book where I was not exactly sure what had happened even after rereading. However there was lot of interesting back-story delivered, much of it in a lengthy appendix, that gives juicy tidbits on the first apocalypse, the consult, the non-men and the No-god.To sum-up I was a little disappointed in this volume but only because I have such high hopes for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise introduction to cancer biology","review":"This book is really helpful for understanding the basic molecular and biological principles of neoplasia.

I had to cut the hair out of the rollers several times during each use. I must have overworked the thing because within a few days it just sort of died.

The battery holds a good charge and it doesn't need to stay plugged in so it can be stored anywhere.The bad points: It has absolutely no suction. The vacuum works by rotating brushes, NOT suction power. Therefore, it leaves a lot behind. It was poor on flat surfaces as it kicked up more that it picked up. Additionally, if you tilted the head by accident, it would spit out anything that it had vacuumed up.I would not recommend this product.I have since purchased an Electrolux Pronto with a built in mini-vac and I really like it.Needless to say, I've tried to sell my old Swivel at a really cheap price and no one is calling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quick Clean Up- CHARGE CORRECTLY","review":"This does a great quick clean up on hardwood and pergo floors.

We merely use it in the kitchen now, and even then, I generally have to pull out our upright vac if I want it totally clean. I cannot believe this thing retails for over forty bucks!

Battery doesn't last either - after a while it wouldn't charge the sweeper at all. I have replaced the battery three times in two years. Parts are expensive to buy - a battery with s/h could cost almost as much as getting a new sweeper from the store.

So she ran over and got it for me to try so I didn't have to open up my new one that I had just received. I tried hers and it worked o.k. on the vinyl floors but as soon as I tried to go on carpet runners or into my living room, it wanted to flip over. It wouldn't pick up anything on the carpet. If you are using it for just hardwood or vinyl floors , would be o.k. But definately no good for any kind of carpet, even if the carpet is low. I have a Shark sweeper #610 and love that sweeper compared to this one. The Shark goes on anything, even my living room carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as shown on commercial!","review":"This has worked out well for us. It works as well as seen on TV. It is quite amazing what it picks up. I bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon, so the price was OK. It does a great job on my linoleum floors and the floors are cleaner than when I used a broom. It by no means could replace a vacuum, but it does get up quite a bit on carpet. I use it regularly and have yet to have problems. I particularly like how I can clean small rugs that my vacuum could not do without sucking them up. I gave it four stars on account of hearing that the battery only lasts 6 months....but that really is the only problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midiocre sweeper","review":"I liked it when I first used it. It maneuvers in hard to reach places. It's good at leaning crumbs, dirt, small objects, like my son's Cheerios, and hair.I didn't like how if you make a wrong move while cleaning, it will spew all the dirt out. It does pick up hair... however, for optimal result, you have to keep pulling off the hair that is tangled on the brushes, which is really a pain in the rear.It started to degrade with time... and finally died on me after five months of use. I would've preferred to spend more money to get something more decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this product","review":"For the first 4 months I thought this product was a dream.

If it flips over or comes off the ground or even tilts at all, the dirt in the cup comes spewing out and you need a heavy duty vacuum to clean it up. Sounds like this wouldn't happen often but it does. After using it every day for a few months, it just died. I had a Bissel version of this and that one didn't last long either.

I suggest buying the touchless model, as I have owned all 3 models that Swivel Sweeper has come out with, and it is by far the best. Don't buy the G2 model is is very poorly constructed.

I bought this to save me some time...what a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this!","review":"This sweeper didn't work from the get go and forget about getting a replacement without paying for it big time.

I was always very careful to only leave the battery plugged in the charge no longer than directed. Even so, after just a month or two, the thing has died.

The lowest price battery replacement that I could found online is about $22 including shipping, or about 63% of the cost a new one on Amazon.

I'm not sure why some people have problems with the pole. I use it all the time to pick up messes. Please do not expect it to replace your vacuum cleaner or your broom and dust pan. This product is not intended to sweep your whole house. The battery doesn't last that long and the little dust pan is small. What this is great for is to pick up in between cleanings. Do you ever have company over and little pieces of chips spill on the carpet? And have you ever had to drag out the vacuum cleaner to vacuum the area where your guests were, like the living room or dining area? Or do you have small kids and they spill around the kitchen table? Then you'll love this. It's light and doesn't require plugging in. Pull it out, sweep the mess, clean out the tray, and put it away. For that, I love it. It's like a broom for your carpet. I don't expect it to clean my whole house."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE !","review":"What a waste of money !

Anyway, Im glad that I had the Extra battery . This thing runs out of charge before a large room is done, and i need to switch batteries. Not only that, it is made so cheaply that sometimes it just comes apart, and all the debris comes out of the holding compartment unexpectedly. It does okay with crumbs and that type of thing, but it wont even pick up paper shreds ! My house is full of kids and alot of my problem is little bits of wrappers and various paper trash left around. My old dirt devil worked way better. Of course, that didnt last a year either. I guess theres no quick way to do this. Get out the real vaccuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for cat hair, but ridiculously short battery life.","review":"I have two cats, and I was amazed at how well this little sweeper picked up cat hair I couldn't even see. It didn't pick up much else, but that was ok with me since cat hair is my biggest housecleaning problem. I had been singing the praises of my sweeper to anyone who would listen, but the other day, the battery completely died. I can't recharge it at all, and the sweeper isn't even three months old. I had read the directions before I used the sweeper, so I was careful not to overcharge the battery, but it is completely dead now anyway. I hope I can find another cordless sweeper that is as convenient but much more reliable. It's a real disappointment to find something so good that is made so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of $30!","review":"I can't believe I wasted $30 of my hard-earned money on this thing!

I will explain the battery situation to each of the gals I give it to and if theirs continues to work ok, I will purchase a replacement battery.....I think the manufacturer has made an error somewhere along the way and even so, will make a lot of money on this item.....I really, really liked it when it worked and I found that I was cleaning up more often because it was so easy. I have 6 rooms that are completely tiled and the Sweeper worked great until the battery died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I usually do not buy As Seen On TV products, but I thought that this was such a good idea that I would give it a try. I have certainly not been disappointed. The sweeper takes 8 hours to charge the first time, gives you 45 minutes to get your sweeping done and is very easy to empty when full. It easily manuevers around chairs and under furniture as well. I highly recommend this product as one of the few As Seen On TV items that actually works and is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Bad Idea","review":"This item is great for a quick little sweep up around the house.

I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"Awful product. It does NOT work on carpet, it won't pick up the dust between tiles, and if you have linoleum floors it's fine as long as you only plan to use it for about 3 minutes.Now, you can return in it if you'd like to make several phone calls and spend even MORE money on batteries and shipping.

It didn't suck up anything... just moved it around. This product, however, is awesome! The first time I used it, I cleaned my whole kitchen floor and hall (both hardwood), and then ran it over my carpet stairs. I must say, using the sweeper to clean my stairs in about 2 minutes is WAY better than lugging my huge vacuum up the stairs for 30 minutes!! I bought the Sweeper at a local craft store for $20 on sale, and it's the best $20 I ever spent! Can't say I'd spend $40 though...

I would have given it 4 - 5 stars before it broke but not anymore. It does a great job of getting up all the visible dirt, hair, debris, etc. from hard surface flooring and floormats. I have no carpet in my house so I cannot rate it on that. It's easy enough to use that my 3-year old loves to help out. The problem is that something in the gearbox must have broken because the motor makes noise but the brushes don't turn. Because I am still in the 90-day warranty period, I was given the option of sending another $12.99 (handling fee) to have the unit replaced or return it for a refund of the $40 purchase price. I haven't decided yet. I've already spent ~$55 with the purchase price and ridiculous $15 S&H. I'm not so sure I want to spend another $20 ($7 to send it to them and $13 handling charge) to get another one. It's just a little too cheaply built.

Now I clean the brushes a bit more regularly.I've had my sweeper for three months now and I am just thrilled! It's great for kid messes in between regular vacuuming. I'm going to get one for all of my family for Christmas. It's great on my wood floor and carpet.

I am not too sure about how long the battery would last, because it does start to loose its power after a few (10 minutes) of use.I like that fact, that I can carry it around.. its very light weight and slides under the sofa's and the dinning table, where the big clumpsy vaccumes have a hard time reaching.

I need to sweep or vacuum my hardwood floors daily (two dogs, two cats), and if I use the swivel sweeper, I also have to dust the entire house. Even a normal broom generates less dust than this thing. So all in all, it has not saved me any time or inconvenience. It's overpriced as well when you add in the exorbitant shipping charges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when new, but then battery dies...","review":"I too was seduced by the great infomercial for this sweeper and bought it. It was great in the beginning and I got rid of my cordless shark. It is so much more flexible and versatile in cleaning and lightweight.But the problem with this product is the battery. It quickly runs down. I've probably had the sweeper for about 6 months now, and use it regularly. I fully charge the battery, and can get at most two minutes out of it before the sweeper dies.I went to the swivel sweeper website and the replacement battery is 14.99+5.99 S&H.; I think I bought the swivel sweeper for 19.99. They need to use a more reliable battery for this product. If they can do that, I would definitely buy it again. For now, I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest piece of junk ever","review":"Got one of these for my birthday... honestly, it is nothing more than a noisy toy. Firstly, it is not very effective - you have to run the darned thing back and forth, back and forth, especially with cat hair, laundry detergent, etc. It somewhat works on perfectly flat surfaces, depending on what you're trying to sweep, so forget tile floors, natural stone floors, door jambs. Forget using it on a rug; also gets tangled in rug fringes. Make sure you keep it level, too, or else all the mess you just swept up falls back out again. Frankly, it is much easier just to take out the dustpan and broom."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!! IF THERE WAS AN OPTION FOR A ZERO STAR, THAT'S WHAT I'D CHOOSE!!","review":"POOR QUALITY PRODUCT, DO NOT BUY!!!!! THE PLASTIC GEAR INSIDE THE MOTOR STRIPPED OUT WITHIN 4 TO 5 USES. I CLEANED IT DURING AND AFTER EACH USE, SO I KNOW IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF ABUSE OR MISUSE. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS COMPLETELY!! WHEN I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER, THEY SAID I'D HAVE TO PURCHASE THE ENTIRE SWIVEL HEAD PLUS PAY SHIPPING. THAT'S NEARLY $30.00. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY, CONSIDERING IT WOULD PROBABLY JUST HAPPEN TO THE NEW HEAD. DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"battery problems","review":"Perhaps I didn't dig deep enough in your site, but I can't believe I didn't read any reviews regarding this unit's battery problems. 98% of all the owner experiences I've read are the same, including mine: works great for a few weeks then the battery dies. You need to have a no star category in your ratings. If there's someone out there who's had their machine for some time and it still works great, run right out and buy a lottery ticket. If you bought your last week, hang in there and get back to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing","review":"If I were the manufacturer of this product, I would be embarrassed. I am very disappointed as to what this product can't pick up. It should easily pick up the small peices of crumbs that they advertise, but it doesn' pick up a lot of things. And when you finally get it to pick up the debris, it spits it out later while you are trying to pick up other items. I have a very thin carpet and hardwood floors and it struggles. It also makes a lot of noise when on the hardwood floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"SMALL JOB SWEEPER","review":"WORKS OK ON HARD FLOORS AND CARPET AND TIGHT SPOTS,LIKE IT SAYS.BUT HAIR GETS WRAP-UP AROUND THE BRUSHES AND YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THE HAIR OFF AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK IF YOU USE IT ALOT,OR IT WILL BREAK LIKE MINE DID [MY FAULT] I TOOK MINE APART ITS ALL PLASTIC SO IT WILL BREAK EASY!THE BATTERY LAST LONG TIME FOR A NO NAME SWEEPER.OK FOR SMALL JOBS NOT LIKE THE TV SPOT SAYS YOU COULD REPLACE YOUR UPRIGHT JUST ABOUT!YEA RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad battery makes it useless","review":"This is a simple machine and a great product, but it's destroyed by using cheap batteries that have poor performance. I loved the ease of it and that it did so well, but the batteries gave out after less than 3 months. After reading others' reviews, I realize it's a common problem. It's too bad. I would spend a bit more to have decent batteries in it, and others would too. A good product that is destroyed by one component. So does anyone have any recommendations for a cordless electric sweeper? Sorry, electrostatic ones don't work on bare floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Killer","review":"I've had my swivel sweeper for about 8 months. At this point, a fully charged battery lasts about 30 seconds -- no kidding -- before it runs out of juice. I won't buy another swivel sweeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This particular item on this particular page is not a Swivel Sweeper. It's actually a spyware sweeper program for your computer.

But just be forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure joy for 4 weeks!","review":"Well, most of the positive reviews here are based on short usage, I think. Make no mistake this thing is as delicate as a flower. Within a month the stick broke in the middle. I returned and got a replacement from Bed Bath&Beyond.; After 2 months the battery won't charge anymore. Too bad the warranty is good for only 90 days. Now you know why.Pros.-Worked OK when it worked.Cons.-Very delicate-Battery dies in approx 3 months.-Forget about customer service"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job needed","review":"I've had my sweeper for about a year and a half. I was never PERFECTLY happy with it- but it did what I needed. It does a pretty good job for daily pick-ups in my kitchen/dining area. It works well on the hardwoods, and we have a large braided rug (dark) and it picks up all of the dirt. It's very easy to operate (It's my 4-yr olds favorite chore.). It's even easy enough that my kids empty it out. It's very lightweight.I am now having to get a replacement battery as it just can't get charged enough- but for doing almost daily pickups, and having lasted this long. I'm very satisfied.My only complaint is it doesn't do very well on other carpet. The rugs in my kitchen have almost not pile to them, but any regular carpet (like stairs) or my other bathroom rugs, it just bogs it down and the brushes can't turn. SO it's best on hardwood/tile/very flat rugs.I would definitely buy another one (and planning on it for my bathrooms)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swivel Sweeper","review":"I bought this as a gift, because we liked the one we bought.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Bought this as a Christmas present to replace an older model whose battery was shot. Also bought a replacement battery for the older unit. The new unit doesn't have the same speed/power of the older one with the new battery. And the battery is about dead after 5 minutes of use. And a fully charged battery is so weak after a week of sitting in the closet the unit won't even run. However, the older model with the new battery works better than ever. I wasted money buying a new sweeper. And the new sweeper won't accept the new battery I bought for the older sweeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"Same as other reviewers, the battery is the problem with this device. It will not hold a charge and will only last 30 seconds before needing a new charge or the terminals being cleaned. Otherwise, it is a good product for what I need it for-quick cleaning of crumbs under the table and bar after meals, getting dust bunnies out from under low pieces of furniture. It wasn't designed for more in depth cleaning. You will need your big gun for that. I have an Oreck. Nothing compares to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Everything this thing picks up also throws it right back out. The battery life is also junk.

This one does not work near as well. Wish I had never gotten it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swivel Sweeper... Better than a broom and dust pan!","review":"I think the swivel sweeper is better than a dust pan and broom. Cleans the floors a little better than a broom, but also you don't have to bend to sweep up a pile, and it works faster than a broom. Of course it is not perfect, like the fact that it doesn't get everything perfectly, and things get tangled in the brushes. Also it is not that great for carpets so I prefer my vacum on carpets, but if you have mostly hard wood or tile it is perfect. Overall I love this product, and it makes my cleaning easier.*UPDATE* After having this for three months the battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore. After this happened to me I did research and found this happened to many others. I also asked my sister and mother-in-law who also bought it, and they too had the problem with the battery. My sister even bought a replacement and it happened again. Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"swivel sweeper drama","review":"i am very happy with this product. i got it for my mom for her birthday, two weeks ago. she has been useing it everyday, sometimes a couple times. i give it four stars, for its light and easy to use, even if you have trouble with heavy objects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get ready to by a new battery!","review":"We have owned the swivel sweeper for 8 months. It worked pretty well for a while. Now, the battery will not hold a charge very long and it only works for about 7 minutes. Realizing that we need a new batrery, I checked into it. It is 14.95 and 7.00 for shipping. 7.00 for shipping a small battery? This company is really charging 18.00 for the battery because they could ship it for less. They are just adding shipping as a way to generate more income for them. It does not cost 7.00 to ship a battery that weighs less than a pound. They think the public is stupid. Typical of TV stuff and we shouldnt have expected more. I will buy a different brand rather than give this company anymore of my money. Why would I pay 21.00 for a new battery when I can buy a new swivel sweeper for 10 bucks more. But hello....I am not buying a new one. This product could prove expensive to operate over a period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this product","review":"I had one of these for about three months. It worked ok initially as long as I was careful not to let all the detritus fall out of the container. That happened a couple times -- very annoying.The real lame part of this product is the battery, which is absolutely terrible. There are very stringent charging requirements and even if you follow those to the letter, the battery still wears out. I think I used mine all of a dozen times. The whole unit went in the trash today when I discovered the battery to be dead beyond repair and that the replacements are $10. No thanks. I'll stick with my Dyson, even if it is bigger and heavier... Hey, at least it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"The first day I used it the plastic covering broke I don't recommend this to anyone I had one before and I did not have a problem with it.

I used this on mainly hardwood and on some rug. After a while it's very troublesome to clean because hair easily gets tangled in the vac which in turn breaks the vac down. It is also very flimsy and plastic and so if you push it hard it overturns and all that you vacuumed -dirt, crumbs, etc. flies out, and you're left with an even greater mess to clean up. Rip-off. Get a vac at much better deals on Amazon or at Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ontel Touchless Swivel Sweeper","review":"Took mine back tonight! It worked for little crumbs and that's about it.
