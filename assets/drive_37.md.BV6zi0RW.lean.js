Perhaps she was trying to meet a minimum word limit ordained by her publisher but that consideration shouldn't elicit anyone's sympathy.

We even posted a question on the radio flyer web site asking what materials, including paint type, were used. No response after a week. So we returned it and purchased another wooden walker, and there was no odor upon opening the box. The radio flyer is truly a good looking toy, and seems durable, however we did not feel comfortable having an infant play and live with it in the nursery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Design!

The title of the item is classic walker wagon! Most kids need help learning how to walk between 1-2 not at 3. The resistance pegs in the rear wheels are made of really cheap wimpy plastic! They break almost instantaneously! Don't buy this wagon unless you plan on forgoing the plastic resistance pegs. The only problem with that is now you have a runaway wagon that needs a couple of sand bags!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good wagon/walker","review":"My 11 month old son got this walker for Christmas. He is very tall for his age, and is able to reach the rail comfortably. He likes using this walker, but it does go a little fast, even with the \\"catch\\" wheel mechanism, so we will keep it on the carpet until he is walking better.

Overall, we are pretty happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy","review":"My baby loved this toy the minute we put it together. She puts anything in it from her toys, dolls and even the dog!

They love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer Classic Walker Wagon","review":"I love the quality of the toy. It is heavy so it doesn't tip when my daughter use it. We tried the cheap plastic one and that was a waste of money. We slowly introduce it to her so she learn to love it. Kind of have to get rid of the old plastic walker experience. She doesn't play with it as much as we thought because she love to walk around when we hold her hands. The wheeles don't turn so we have to help her out of corners. That's fine because she needs supervision anyway. Maybe when she actually can walk she will enjoy it more. I got this when it was on sale, almost half the price. That's probably the reason why I got it too. Can't seem to justify spending almost $100 for it otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned to walk","review":"Great, simply great.

By four months she would sit in it and play. It was wonderful - like a little play yard but with enough support to help her sit up properly. For months she would very happily sit and play that way for a half hour while mommy showered and got dressed. At nine months she started using it as a walker. I could not be happier with this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"I purchased this for my daughter as she learns to walk and she loves it.

Works for Mom too!Get indoors or outdoors...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute & Sturdy","review":"I got this wagon for my daughter when she started \\"cruising.\\" She is able to go at her own pace thanks to the function on the wheel that stops it from flying away from you when you're pushing it. It is quite sturdy. There are some things to consider before you purchase: the wagon is quite heavy so it is nearly impossible for a youngster to turn it and it was somewhat difficult to put together (took me a good 30 minutes). That being said, my daughter is now 10 months and enjoys pushing it when I set her up in front of it and point it in a direction with nothing to stop her. She much more enjoys pulling up to standing on the wagon and pulling the toys out one by one that I've put in there for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning to walk","review":"A friend of mine who is an occupational therapist recommended this wagon for my 9 month old, who was starting to cruise, because it does not contain all the bells and whistles which distract babies learning to walk. My daughter loves it so much, we have to hide it from her--all she wants to do is walk her wagon, it makes her so happy. It is VERY sturdy and great for newly cruising babies because the wheels are designed not to go too fast or turn, making falls less likely. My husband and I tied a rope to the front of it so one of us can walk in front of the wagon and steer it for her. This is definitely one of the best toys I've purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great- Except for the Missing Part","review":"Hello Amazon,This little wagon is great. Our 8 month old daughter loves it and now that she's learning to walk she can push it and stagger along with it. She also enjoys putting and taking things out of the wagon. All in all a great product. One thing though, we didn't get the correct part for the handlebar. Theres's a metal dowel with a threaded end that we didn't receive. We have the handlebar it runs through, but no dowel. So, it falls out from the slightest yanking of a little baby. We would appreciate it if that part could be sent to us, since I'd rather not return a wagon that I've already put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy quality product","review":"So disappointed when I got this. None of the pieces fit flush against each other. Directions to assemble were confusing and pieces were weak and crumbled. Product was made in China. The plastic wheel caps broke on day 1 already! cheap and terrible. I can't believe the quality has fallen this far. Can't believe Amazon is carrying this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This wagon was much smaller than depicted in the pictures. A small child would be uncomfortable after a short period of time sitting in it, as the pictures showed. The dimensions were from wheel to wheel, not the body of the wagon. The age range was 1 to 4, but a 2-year old will be too big for playing with this. It will probably be used as a decoration, rather than a toy. It was also missing the clicker. For the money, it was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"I was going to buy a couple of these, for my daughter and nephew but realized that the country of origin was not mentioned on the website. So I called and the customer support lady informed me that this and the little push car are made in china. Is anything from radio flyer made in the USA anymore?

It immediately helped her practice walking. It is very stable and doesn't tip forward when she is using it to pull herself to a standing position unlike other walkers.

I shouldn't have expected anything less from Radio Flyer. It did take some assembly out-of-the-box (thank goodness my husband loves this kind of thing), but it is a solid toy once finished. The wagon \\"bed\\" is generously sized and is perfect for toting around favorite stuffed animals. The \\"slow down\\" feature is perfect for the beginning walker - this item has NEVER slipped out from under my one-year-old. We did have one red wheel \\"cap\\" fall off just after assembly, but haven't had any issues since (we've been using this for about two months now). This is great for both an indoor and outdoor toy and performs very well on a variety of surfaces. I have recommended this to friends and family over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful walker wagon!!!!!","review":"I bought this item for my little girl when she was 8 months. She could walk with it on the carpet immediately. It is too heavy for her to tip over, and within a few weeks, she could walk all over the house with it.

Wonderful purchase, worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son's Favorite","review":"My mother bought this toy for my 11 month old son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it!

I would definately recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Infant/Toddler Wagon","review":"Grandma has gone crazy, snapping up every Radio Flyer wagon/rider she can get her hands on. This is my 10-month old's favorite. He's been riding in it as long as he could self-support, sitting upright. We could plop him inside it, along with a few toys, to keep him \\"contained\\" without being caged.He now uses it as a walker, it's a little wide to manage in a tight space, but the wheels adjust resistance for carpet or flooring.The durability of this item has been dissapointing, as the wooden areas have chipped or broken, and the wheel retaining nuts have come off twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer Walker Wagon","review":"This wagon is fantastic for my 9-10 month old granddaughter. Though not yet walking, she pushes this all over the house, giving her independence and a feeling of success that you see all over her bright happy face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little red wagon","review":"I received the wagon today, got it pretty quickly considering the time of year (Christmas). I put it together very easily too. In about 15 minutes I guess. The only thing negative, the wagon came with a pretty good dent in the sideboard. The box was not damaged at all but the wagon definitely was. Almost looked like a hammer head mark, broke through the paint into the wood. Very visible. What a let down! So it seems it was damaged before packaging or during the packaging process. It's too bad because this is a cute wagon, perfect for that little toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a 'just starting' walker!","review":"My son loves this wagon! He received it as a Christmas present (he was about 1) It is great for a child just starting to walk. Unlike other push toys it has resistance in the wheels so even when he was still unsteady on his feet he could stand up and push it. Now that he is older, he still likes to push it but also likes to take the rails in and out and also loves to have a ride in it! If I had to have a downside it is that it is a bit heavier and he can't really turn it by himself yet. However from my perspective, that downside was 'outweighed' by all of the other plusses! It is also extremely well-made and durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy little walker...","review":"I wish we had gotten this little wagon/walker. We bought a plastic Fisher Price walker and my son obviously senses it's lack of mass. Our friends bring this Radio Flyer walker to the park and my son (11 months) pushes it around. Even though the wheels don't adjust, it's sturdy enough that he can put some weight on it without it flying out from under him. It's a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and classic!","review":"I bought this walker wagon for my 8 month old daughter for christmas. The assembly was easy and it looks absolutely gorgeous! It is exactly what I expected from a genuine radio flyer. I did remove the plastic pieces that make the wheels click when it is being pushed because the sound scared the dog, and I think it rolls a little faster because of it. My daughter is just learning to walk, and she has so much fun pushing it, as well as riding in it when we push her around in it. The bumper in the front is great so it won't damage furniture or walls (or the wagon)! We get compliments on it from most people who come to the house. I highly recommend this walker wagon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest hit of the season","review":"I've purchased this toy twice because it's such a big hit with the kids. First purchase was for a 9mo boy just taking his first steps. He didn't open another gift, immediately started walking back and forth in our hallway for a couple of hours. It's been almost a year and it is still his favorite toy. He fills up the wagon with toys and blocks and pushes from one destination to another. Second boy is approaching 9mo so we purchased for him to help take his first steps. Arrived in great condition and easy to put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 year old loves!","review":"My son really likes this wagon, and it is helping. Him want to stand and try to walk.

Our little guy loves it!It wasn't too hard to assemble and all the pieces fit together very well.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's very hard for him to turn, so you either need room to go straight or constantly help your little one adjust the steering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Radio Flyer","review":"Thank you for making such a great walker. I can not believe I almost did not see this walker before purchasing a different one. I have the most amazing absolutely beautiful pictures of my baby walking around with this.

All the other kids want to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased often for physical therapy kids","review":"Very sturdy wagon that we use and purchase often for physical therapy for toddlers.

A friend recommended the purchase. From the moment we opened the box and assembled the wagon, my son loved this toy.

It has some little plastic pegs that create resistance (and some clicking noise) to make sure it doesn't fly out from under them when trying to walk. Our boy loves to sit in it and ride around the house, of course that means you have to bend over and push him around but it is well worth the exercise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile Wagon","review":"We have had this walker wagon for a week and are thrilled with it. My 7 1/2 month old loves to sit in it and get rides courtesy of his brothers and sister. He even likes to sit in it just to play with some toys without getting pushed around. His brother thinks that the baby likes it because it is \\"cozy\\". The older kids like to use it to round-up toys and roll them to the toybox. Of course, a few months down the road, the baby may use it as a walker. The best part of this wagon is that it has multiple uses. The baby has konked his head on the metal handlebar, but I just pinned a soft cloth around it to solve that problem. I like the sturdy construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wagon!","review":"This will be a fun walker for our newest Grand-daughter!

Bought it for my 1 year-old kid. He loved it after I assembled it. He has been pushing it everyday. The only minor improvement I suggest is to have the wheels able to turn, as it can only go straight forward/backward only. The clicker really helps because it slows down the speed. Perfect for beginning walker or learn-to-walk phase. I called the company to verify if it is lead-free paint, I was confirmed over the phone that it is lead-free paint product."},{"rating":"1","title":"PVC use!","review":"Hi, unfortunately, I have to ship this item back. Not because I do not like the way it looks or works. When I opened the box, I was surprised how wonderful this product was. Then I started to smell the paint. First I thought it is just because it is new and did not want to pay to much attention to it. Later, I took a closer look at the wheels - PVC! That was it! Now I kind of connected the smell of the paint. If they are using toxic PVC why would not they use a non safe paint? I am returning it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assembly is a Nightmare!","review":"This product is nice enough but it is unnecessarily complicated to assemble. It must have taken my husband an hour and when I came by to check on him he was surrounded by hundreds of parts -- bolts, screws etc. etc. Spending an hour assembling a wagon is not what a working parent wants to do at the end of the day!

Then two weeks later I went on Amazon.com and found I could get it quite a bit cheaper and with free shipping so I ordered it. He loved it and within the next two weeks was up walking around his house pushing it everywhere. The resistance it has built in was exactly what he needed. And it is exceptionally well built and durable- best present I have given him so far in his life and his parents agree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great starter wagon","review":"I bought this wagon for my daughter four years ago and bought the same wagon again for my sister's daughter. This wagon is perfect for young children due to it's size and durability. This wagon helped my daughter with her walking and coordination. This wagon is made of real wood and was very easy to put together. If you are looking for a fun, traditional toy this wagon is perfect. Also, the price was the best I could find anywhere (including shipping it was still cheaper than most websites and catalogs I had available). Radio Flyer is a great brand and this wagon is great for both girls and boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 10 month old loves it!!!!!","review":"I researched so many walkers and I am so glad that I purchased this one.

She also loves to put her toys in the wagon and push them around. I love this Walker!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great push wagon for beginning walkers","review":"Has lasted through my 3 year old riding in it while my daughter pushes as she learns to walk. I thought the clicking feature would get on my nerves, but actually is convenient to use to find her when she is cruising around the house! No complaints with durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"What a great product. Our daughter (9mos) can pull herself up on it without it tipping over and it has a great little clicking noise when she walks. She loves taking things out and putting thing in and she also loves getting rides in it. It's super sturdy - I can lean on it with most of my weight while I push her around. The only draw back is that it doesn't steer at all but I think that's to be expected on most of these walkers. Great price for a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, if it would just turn...","review":"The only downside is that the wagon does not turn, so every time my son hits a wall, we have to go and turn it for him. He still enjoys his wagon even now that he is walking on his own, especially since he realized that he can take the sides off by himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, but not worth the 70 bucks","review":"We got this push walker in hopes that the weight and bulkiness would give my daughter who is cruising the confidense to start walking with it. Unfortunately the non swivel wheels combined with the weight make it nearly impossible to turn for me, let alone my 11 month old. It is really sturdy and well built but the 'clickers' that are supposed to give it resistance are to soft and they really dont work at all.(i think with all the complaints of the clickers breaking off and becoming a choking hazard they changed the compasition of the plastic to soft plastic so they cant break and in turn fails to its job.) I really do like this as a wagon to have the older, stronger kids play with and put things into but not very good for babies who are just starting to walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for \\"Everyman\\"","review":"This DVD is listed as the only film version of this Middle Ages play.

It appears to be an independent student production shot very badly on digital cameras...home cameras. The editing is bad, with repetitious shots (like in a cartoon) and the picture cuts out at one point and cuts back into the next scene with Good Deeds, and from that point on, the sound does not match up to the action/speaking. The director's choices are just odd, along with many of the costume choices as well. The acting is not particularly good, and it is only updated in setting...the dialogue remains true to an early translation. The two contrast badly. I don't doubt they all worked hard on this production, but sadly, the result is definitely not worth the money...or time to attempt to view it...unless you want a good example of bad film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loved it!!","review":"This became a new long road trips traveling favorite for our 9yr old son!

I was thinking I may never hear this trio again, but for the fun of it did a random web search. Behold! They released it on CD! I was stunned.I have been listening and enjoying this CD the last few days. It is refreshing to hear a recording that is very pure. That is, very little overdubbing and studio trickery. Almost a 'live' recording. The merits are the interesting song-writing and great jamming. And of course for myself, the memories.This work is definately not something for everybody.

The CD is a good effort, given that he recorded it in his apartment and played nearly all the instruments. He gives inspiration to musicians strapped for cash that they can pull off similar efforts. There are songwriters who've spent a lot more to get a lot less. The only complaint I have is that it's not long enough and some of the keyboards would sound better as piano parts.

But also when He performs such a typical fusion, rock standard, He shows an aggressive and influential impact on the british guitarists, without forgetting the influence of the early Colosseum works, completely diverse!! A great fusion prog intro at the keyboards by Don Airey in the excellent title track, another memorable track(\\"Inquisition\\") and other fine stuff as well!!Recommended also to the fans of fusion prog..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fusion yes.... !","review":"In regards to the review by the guy who says Colosseum II wasn't a fusion band. Well they were but more like a half fusion half heavy progressive rock band, but the fusion or jazz spectrum comes out mostly in Hiseman's blazing drumming and the keyboard meanderings. So this in fact makes the music a bit more fusionesque, if you will. Gary Moore could be a funky guitar player but he could also lay down the more hard rock oriented sound . Due more to the aggressive nature of his playing. The easiest thing to do is pigeonhole Colosseum II as \\"jazz-rock\\" maybe the most ambitious and aggressive form of jazz rock ever to surface (\\"Winds\\" from Strange New Flesh). Not quite jazz but something jazzy and extreme. Fusion sounds better. This album was their last statement and I guess you could say,It is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great for compositions or styling, but amazing playing","review":"Gary Moore was a MONSTER guitar player... His awesome talents are showcased on this album. He was as good as Al Dimeola, there's no doubt about it in my mind. Perhaps not as original, but definitely the chops are there in abundance. The album is a little genre-confused pardon the pun. Is it progressive rock or fusion? Progressive fusion? Instrumental rock? One thing is certain, it has a heavy Return To Forever/Al Dimeola slant. Were it a more cohesive record, I'd give it a 5. However, it's a valuable document of what Gary Moore was capable of (he's much better known for his blues and hard-rock work with Thin Lizzy), so it's worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be stiffed my heart.","review":"Usually 15 mins into the movie I know whether or not I'm going to like it.

Like a family tree it has many branches, with many varied tastes and different interests but they are your family and you love them all, so it is with the blues. If you like blues music of a particular style note that T-Model is of the juke joint/street style playing from feeling inside him and not \\"polished\\" and smooth for example like Eddie Floyd.

I was furious when it was done because I had just wasted two hours watching a movie that has nothing to recommend it. This movie is neither funny nor inspiring.It was interesting in the beginning. Will the two main characters get together? My sympathy for Andie McDowell's character slipped when she had sex with Hugh Grant while engaged to someone else, and disappeared altogether when she recalled one by one her many lovers (32 of 'em). It's impossible for me to believe that she would remain faithful while married.Hugh Grant's character was not much better. When he couldn't have Andie, he asked someone else, someone who was absolutely crazy about him. Too bad the plot required that she be left at the altar.The only characters I liked were the two gay guys (what an incredible poem one read at the other's funeral).The two main characters were sexual slimeballs.

Hugh Grant and his merry band of friends are exceptional; the premise beguiling, and heartfelt. A gay relationship is of particular note, and provides the movie its one throat-closing moment. However, screenplay and most performances must depend on the believability of the Grant-MacDowell connection, and Andie is simply not up to the challenge. By contrast, Kristin Scott Thomas is the most electrifyingly real as she has ever been, in a slim but significant role. Charming, diverting -- could have been a classic, if we were rooting for them in the end..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD transfer","review":"I completely disagree with the prior post. With many substandard versions of this fine film in the past I can finally report that a we have a great new edition of the film. I didn't notice any dirt or scratches anywhere in the transfer. The new transfer is a High Definition anamorphic 1.85:1 version with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The sound was perfect with no loss of dialogue or variation of music levels. I can recommend this for anyone seeking the best edition available."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ambitious and successful proposal !","review":"Mike Newell's secure directorial abilities allowed this reflective comedy -seemed to be inspired in the famous stylistic tradition of Oscar Wilde. The occurrences of a irreverent womanly is seen through a warm friendship, but at the time his friends get marry, he feels the social conventions exert the invisible pressure through suggestive comments, until he hits off with another wedding guest. If you are not absolutely involved with the spirit of the British comedy, maybe you experience the sensation of being out of focus with this existential comedy which works out as a healthy life's lesson, respect the in and outs of the singleness.But if you are disposed and accustomed to this genre, come and enjoy one of most original and marvelous comedies of the Nineties which consolidated Grant as one of the maxim exponents of this engaging genre.Totally recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I watch this once a month","review":"My title says it all. This film is a classic, especially for people who enjoy ensemble casts. No one character is stronger than another, even though Hugh Grant is the \\"big name.\\" All the others are equally important to the purpose of this movie. The cinematography and art direction are beautiful -- it's a visually gorgeous film. The people are so quirky and wonderful, I found myself wanting to know them and spend time with them. Each time I watch this I'm sorry when it ends. Chick flick? Maybe, but I watch it over and over. A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good one!","review":"I have pretty much all of Hugh Grant's movies, so this one is another one in my collection. It is not my absolute favorite, considering all his others and Love Actually being my all time favorite movie ever I think! But this is definitely worth watching and owning if you like Hugh Grant. It's mostly a story of a group of friends and events in their life with a subtle focus on Charles (Hugh Grant) and Carrie (Andie MacDowel), who seem to keep meeting each other at these seemingly unrelated events, but also seem to be falling for each other. But there is a little twist in there that I'm not going to give away here. You must watch it! It is definitely a charming British film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy this lovely movie more by reading this.","review":"If you like this movie, you'll love this screenplay with many lovely pictures. Also, appendices of Richard Curtis are as funny as the movie itself. For example, he jokes about how he tried to use less slangs to sell this movie to the US in one appendice.

Hugh Grant's character, along with all of his friends, have no life other than bumbling along at weddings and funerals. It seems that Grant's \\"profession\\" is trying to have a constant stream of sleeping partners.I enjoyed the scenes in England.

A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat people review","review":"A young psychoanalyst (Tom Conway)calmly tells his patient (Simone Simon) that her idea that she is turning into a panther is merely a fantasy, so she kills him with her fang and talon.Val Lewton made his name famous as a producer in this fantasy-horror film, produced for RKO on a low budget.While other B-budget horror films that came out around this time used cheap imitations of the King Kong ape, fractured arms, and haunted houses, Lewton and the director Jacques Tourneur, employ suggestion, use odd sound effects, and camera angles that suggest Orson Welles, which leaves everthing up to the viewer's imagination.Some scary sequences, such as the scare at the pool or the restraunt are classical.The acting isn't as good as the effects though. With Kent Smith as Simon's husband, Jack holt, Alan Napier, Jane Randolph (As the colleague Kent smith likes), and Elizabeth Russell in a cameo as the wicked, real cat woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexuality and horror - two of my favorite things","review":"This movie is an elegantly realized story of a woman's fear, love, desperation, and jealousy. And it's about sex! The gender role of women to be chaste and not at all sexual is taken to the extreme - if Irena gets hot and bothered, she'll turn into a ferocious cat and kill her husband. However, jealousy also triggers this transformation, leading the movie's most suspenseful and artistically shot sequences. While I love old horror movies, I know that by today's standards they aren't considered very scary or supsenseful. The pool scene in this movie is one of the most suspenseful and eerie scenes in any movie I have viewed. Very impressive, especially taking into account this was a low-budget flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for the movie; 2 for the vhs: Where's the DVD?","review":"'The Cat People' is a wonderfully creepy and atmospheric film. Fans of 'The Sixth Sense' will love this suggestive, eerie classic of horror. This film just begs for a crisp DVD image and re-release with several extras included. With a recent book on Jacques Turner on the market how come this hasn't been released on the shiny disc format?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value and Cool Looking Shades","review":"Not having the benefit of trying on the frames, I was of course reluctant to order these from footlocker. But for only $10 plus shipping, I figured I couldn't go wrong too bad.I was worried that the lens would be too big making me look like a bug or that the shiny aluminum frame color would be too \\"bright\\" for my taste. Well I got them and the lens fit my face pretty well - pretty much the right size. For those of you who where caps, I wear a 7 1/8 cap size. Plus the color isn't too bright...the shiny gray is still dark enough. Not black so you stand out a little bit, which I prefer.Polycarbonate lens for $10 is a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST ROCK BAND'S LIFE STORY","review":"THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT HOW 5 YOUNG MUSICIANS DESRIRED TO BECOME STARS CAME TO LIFE.

But now it is just good. It lacks that edge that it used to have. I don't know, it was just a little boring this season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me.......","review":"Sadly disappointed by both the price ( which is now dramatically reduced already )and the content. Seems things come and go much more quickly, and have little depth to them. We're here, we're there, we're gone to the next event. It appears to be just an extension of the series, rather than a moving on of events, if that makes any sense. It left me with a great feeling of disatisfaction/disappointment, and if there IS a season 4, I will probably not invest in it.I DO love the cast, and the roles they play.It's also a big pain to have to FF through the entry, Last time on Nurse Jackie, and the credits which make up too much of the running time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing item","review":"How can I review a product I have still not received?

The artwork is stunning and the story is solid as well. Several hundred beings from the Crossgen Universe are abducted by the Negation Empire. One character, Obregon Kaine, assumes the role of leader and uses his smarts to help himself and others escape but they are constantly on the run from the empire and must use their wits and powers to constantly elude them. The dialogue is wonderful and the part where the Kremmin appear is hysterical. If your a fan of films like The Dirty Dozen or Kelly's Heroes then this is a match made in Heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I was not impressed with this book. It seems that the author was going for breadth but in his attempt neglected to go into the detail necessary for someone unfamiliar with power electronics. I liked the fact that the author introduced many practical considerations but without good coverage of the basics this book is useless except as a reference.In short, lots of coverage, not enough detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective binding","review":"I bought the soft cover version and it was bound incorrectly: pages 79-110 were inserted in the reverse order and rotated 180 degrees. Um, ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure garbage","review":"This book is total garbage. I have a BS in EE and wanted to learn more about switching power supply design. This book is useless. Instead of explaining the general operation of boost and buck converters with english words, Krein uses these convoluted switching matrices. It's like the following: here's a circuit, and here's its switching matrix, on to the next cicuit. Not insightful in the least bit. He should spend more time explaining with English words what is going on in a circuit instead of just throwing a uninsighful matrix at you. It's a typical professor/academic book: too many irrelevant details and not enough on the basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hole in the Sun","review":"I found the subject matter and content interesting.

Yes, this falls into category of fine brands known only by their name--the Mercedes, the Rolex...the Dyson. Mine looked new and was put together in a matter of minutes. I *love* the bare floor cleaning feature. We live in Las Vegas and have lots of tile/stone floors. No longer do we have to live with who knows what sticking to our bare feet! Vacuuming the bare floors is as easy as doing the rugs. I would have given it five stars but I've found using the hose a little awkward. I hope this gets better with time. If you're concerned about the 6 month warranty, American Express will double it to a year if your use their card. All in all though, I wouldn't trade it for the world. Don't hesitate to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I thought I had done all the research. Seemed like a fantastic product. It was - for about 2 years. Then it started making the awful growling sound like something is stuck - only there wasn't anything there, and I hadn't vacuumed anything up that I knew of. Can't find a place that repairs Dysons anywhere in the city. No longer under warranty. Beaucoup dollars down the drain. Dyson's web site is no help whatsoever. They say most problems can be fixed over the phone. Yeah, right. Didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check Consumer's Report First!","review":"I bought the Dyson thinking and believing the other reviews, but yikes! I won't do that again! It did have fairly good suction, I have to admit. But not good enough. Also, trying to use the attachments was SO time consuming! You have to undo the whole tubing section, then turn it upside down and plug it all back in again - very inefficient! I did like that you could stretch it all the way up/down stairs, but that didn't change my overall opinion of the machine. I read Consumer's Report and bought their advised Eureka and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyson DC07","review":"Pleasantly surprised. Cannot tell this refurbished from a brand new one. Best vacuum cleaner I have ever owned including Kirby and Electrolux."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!!!!","review":"I bought this refurbished one with a lot of scepticism but I am really happy with my decision... The vacuum is really good...It brought out dirt from my carpet that I didnt know existed in there..The packaging was intact and looked new. It had a \\"REFURBISHED\\" sticker on the box though. But I think its worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is amazing!","review":"I've seen all kinds of reviews for the Dyson on this site - my own experience was fantastic. I went over my carpets and it removed so much dirt It was shocking. The attachements allowed me to dust things as effectively as using a rag, and much more easily. The design is so clever, and it is so easy to use and manuver, it's really the best vacuum I've ever used. I know not everyone may have the same experience, but I'm very happy with it, and it certainly beats the dirt devil I bought a year ago that broke after 3 uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible service","review":"I bought this vacuum and then found I could not buy attachments. I called Dyson direct and they will not sell product to anyone in New York. So I can't get any accessories for this machine. I have tried on other sites and no luck. If you want a machine with no accessories this machine certainly sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choose","review":"I purchase this vacuum less then a year ago. It does not pick up all the dog and cat hair. I vacuum 2x a day. It also kicks back the dirt and I can feel it hit my feet. ALso, when you take the container out to release the dirt no need to use the release handle, the dirt falls right out and if you do not know this then it is all back on your floor. I paid full price thinking I was getting something good but I was wrong and a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suggested retail is WAY off targe","review":"The retail on this is NOT $500.00. I found brand new ones for $359 at http://www.best-vacuum.com/dyson-DCO7steelyellow.htmlwith no sales tax!!!!! Not worth messing with a refurb. I've tried one of these at a friends, new, and after a month and it dealing with some fine dust from a little drywall sanding, you can hear a horrbile whining noise.. The hose is VERY bad design. It pulls REALLY hard and is difficult to use almost always pulling the vaccum over."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"This is a great product! After seeing a friend's, I knew I had to have one. We have 2 indoor cats and they track dander and litter onto our burber carpet. It's hard for a regular vac to get it out. The dyson got it all and then some! It is hard to attach the attachments, but it's worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love your vacuum!","review":"This vacuum was expensive, but completely worth it. I LOVE this machine. Its suction is much more powerful than my previous panasonic. It's easy to use -- even cleaning the filter is simple. I selected this machine because I figured that over time the lifetime filter would save me money and be convenient. I have not been disappointed.My one (very small) complaint has to do with the extension handle/ hose. It takes a few steps to attach the hose the correct way to use. This really is me just being lazy... more than a real problem.The one actual problem I had with this product was that the carpet roller sometimes catches. I called the help line and the representative told me how to fix this (lay the vacuum down and switch the handle back and forth several times). I fix it when it happens on occasion and I continue on.No real complaints. This is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW what a vacuum","review":"I recently purchased the reconditioned Dyson DC07 and I am amazed by how much dirt it picks up! I was some what concerned since it was reconditioned but the vacuum arrived in excellent condition, the only difference I could find between the reconditioned and retail version is that it comes with a 6 month warranty instead of a 2 year warranty. I believe if you get a good product the warranty is useless anyway. Why pay $350 + at the local retail store when you can get it for much less. I have purchased cheaper vacuums in the past for around $100 & considered spending $150 before buying the Dyson, I believe it is worth every penny ! A + + + Product..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vaccum, Good Price","review":"This vacuum is awesome. The first time we used it to clean the carpet in our two-story apartment, we had to empty the container five or six times because it picked up so much cat fur and dirt. The suction power is amazing. The attachments are also easy to use and work well. It's well worth the price, and it seemed brand-new, despite being reconditioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy I finally bought one","review":"I had been debating buying a Dyson for several months. I had heard rave reviews, but couldn't justify spending $400-$500 for a vacuum. Then I found these reconditioned ones and finally decided to take the plunge.The vacuum looked great out of the box. The wand however was just slightly out of round and wouldn't fit in the hose as it was suppose to. I called Dyson's help line and no problem, they took my name and address and sent a new wand out-no charge.It works GREAT! I'll just keep my fingers crossed that it lasts as well as it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dyson Makes a VERY loud grinding noise that is \\"NORMAL\\"","review":"I have had my Dyson for about 1 month and it makes a VERY loud grinding noise. I called the help line and they told me that the noise is because my carpet is a Berber carpet and their vacuum is \\"too powerful\\" to vacuum my carpet and the carpet is \\"suffocating\\" the brush and causing the clutch to slip. If this really is true then they need to work on their design so that their vacuumed can handle the vast majority of carpets. This same noise occurred at my sister's house as well as at my parents. I would never purchase this vacuumed as this has a very serious problem that must be addressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product.","review":"Yeah, Dyson Sucks alright.

Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME VACUUM!!!!!","review":"I just purchased the Dyson DC07 Reconditioned Vacuum a week ago. I LOVE this vacuum.

I HIGHLY reccommend this product!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary sucking action","review":"The Dyson DC07 vacuum is awesome. I purchased the reconditioned Dyson DC07 vacuum. When I took it out of the box, I examined it from head to toe looking for signs that it had been used. It looks like a brand new vacuum cleaner. I am absolutely blown away with the suction power of this particular machine. My wall to wall carpet had s-o-o-o much dirt embedded in it. I knew it was dirty but not that dirty as my husband and I vacuum often with our old Panasonic which obviously had seen better days.I especially like the clear canister which allows you to see all of the dirt that is being picked up. Wow! is all I can say.The canister is a cinch to open. I empty the canister each time I use it as I want to see just how much dirt is being picked up. I cannot believe my eyes at how much dirty and dust is tracked through the house on a daily basis. And no more expensive bags or filters to buy.Anyway, thus far I am thoroughly satisfied with my Dyson DC07 and high recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refurbished dyson works great, warranty honored.","review":"The Dyson DC07 was a little heavier than I expected but maneuvers easily. Transitions well from hard floors to rugs. Cleans better than any upright vacuum I've owned. I was disappointed with the refurbished sweeper when I tried to empty the collection bin, it wouldn't.I phoned customer service and was pleased to learn that they would replace the chamber/bin no questions asked. I received the part within the week and now the sweeper works fine. I am disappointed that the warranty is only for 6 months, but don't expect to need it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"All I can say is that all those reviews that rated this item a five are correct! It works great, easy to empty and the suction is as advertised. If I had anything negative to say about the design it would be to say that the attachments are not easy to get to, but since I don't use them too often, that is not a huge issue for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Vacuum","review":"The vacuum works very well.

Hence the reason for buying the Blu-Ray, DVD, Digigtal copy version!What a joke Sony! Restricting the Digital copy to only your devices! I have never ran into this problem with a digital copy movie before. The Digital copy included with this copy will only download on a PS3, and can then be transferred to a PSP. Sony is increasingly making bad decisions and the big loosers are the consumers!!! It started with the PS3 having backward compatibility removed so that it would not play PS2 games, for what reason.... so that we have to buy PS2 consoles.I felt that I was being a responsible consumer by purchasing the digital copy rather then acquiring it through other means.

I took my kids to see it for the second time last night (to get out of the house!) and laughed even harder than the first time. You see things that you missed that will really crack you up. The expressions on the character's faces, the animation subtleties and the verbal and physical jokes are really genius. I found myself running to the computer to see when it will be out on DVD. I have a 4 y/o, 6 y/o and 14 y/o and they were all cracking up too; especially my older daughter. She caught the \\"older\\" jokes that the little ones didn't. Its great for everyone without the usual bathroom humor that goes with so many kids movies. (There is one part with the monkey in the \\"snow\\" but it was hilarious!)

Actually fell asleep ....zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I noticed all the bad reviews were about this being a digital problem. My complaint is content. On the outset it looked like a fun movie. A lot of animated films these days are done with parent and child in mind. It was just us adults watching and one of us fell asleep. The other one (me) stayed awake because ... well, I'm the one who bought it so I wanted it to be good. It sounded like a really fun story line but the story was all jumbled and it didn't tell the story in a way that was very interesting or funny.

No dark magic and is easy to watch it with kids,"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised","review":"I delayed watching this movie for a long time with my kids because i honestly thought it would be dumb. However i was mistaken!! This movie is so cute, i love that they make food out of water what an awesome thing that would be.The movie shows kids to follow their dreams no matter what any one says and that to be you to be who you truly are is what matters most. It shows girls that you are beautiful just the way you are. I could watch it over and over again, makes a great addition to our collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 3D Effects, OK Movie","review":"The high def 3D effects are good and the movie is cute at the beginning and at other times throughout but drags near the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"First independent 3D Movie available.","review":"Great 3D movie to share with your family.

Impress your friends and hope more 3D content arrives soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meatballs","review":"OK, this is an animated, rather silly little movie, but it is well done and the 3D effect is impressive. It should appeal to pre-teens and the older generation, if for no other reason than it is funny and absorbing.There are moral values incorporated, but they do not interfere with the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"This is a great family movie. So much of the media -especially cartoon films focused on children have so much sexual innuendo that I am almost always disappointed. This one is absolutely safe for children and won't leave them asking uncomfortable questions or giving them the wrong ideas about love and sexuality. Best cartoon movie I have seen in a long time. Great Job Sony and Columbia - I wish there were more like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent film to show off 3D capabilities!","review":"So, we bought this movie to test out our new 3D TV.

Definately top 10 in my animated movie collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good 3D and Pretty Good Story","review":"The 3D on the Blu-ray was up there and pretty good. Not as good as MvsA or Avatar, but still pleasing. The story was decent, but not quite as good as some of the other animated movies released over the past 10 years. Over all this movie is worth buying because it is fun to watch for 3D and the story making it a good compromise."},{"rating":"2","title":"bang for your buck","review":"I surprisingly enjoyed this movie despite the overwhelming comments about it not being funny or boring. Sure the humor was a little cheesy and a little excessive, but that was what made it its own movie. the 3d effect was consistent but it didnt have the depth that i saw on other movies, but other than that the colors were terrific and the sound superb.

My beef is with Sony's Digital Copy. It's not mentioned anywhere (except from other review) that the digital copy requires Sony's PSP format. In fact, this is ONLY mentioned in 6 point fine print on the back of the label. So if you're like me that don't have a PSP and was expecting to watch this on iTunes (really, was expecting to transfer this to my iPad so my kids can watch it) or Window Media, forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Absolutely nowhere did the information for this movie on Amazon state that the digital copy was for PSP via PS3 only. I never would have pre-ordered this movie if I had known that. There is a sticker on the cardboard outer cover that states this but the picture on the web shows the case cover that doesn't have the sticker. Very deceptive. From now on I will wait for the movie to come out and read reviews to ensure I can use the digital copy where I please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome 3D","review":"Even though the story line is dumb. I am amazed by the 3D version. I have every available 3D movie and this is the only one with constant 3D effects. Something is always coming out at you. The other movies have added a few effects, but they are not what you see at the movie theater. I was beginning to think that my 3D TV was not working. This one proved that it is not my equipment.

But like others have said Digital Copy is ONLY for PSP. Completely deceptive. Wish I could return didn't realize it until after return period was over"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Interpretation of a Good Story","review":"The original written story had a humorous creative charm to it but Sony, as it has shown a history of doing, uses the quickest and cheapest studio resources to produce a mass appeal product with plastic and stereotypic characterizations & animations, trite dialogue, and factual ineptitude that will take teachers years to undo in visually impressionable young minds. Really Sony, how much effort is there in presenting the story in a way that actually educates - in some very small way. For example, water always will be water & hydrogen & oxygen - that's it. There's no nitrogen, no genetic material. Anyway, it takes \\"work\\" for a studio to create a fantasy story that has a magical and, perhaps, believable quality to it. See \\"Ponyo\\" or any Hayao Miyazaki movie for a comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun family flick","review":"It's always tough for me to find movies that my son wants to watch that are not violent...this was enjoyed by our whole family :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Good movie but I wish I would of read the reviews here first.

If i could compare its greatness to anything I would say its is like theStrega Nonaof our children's generation. Up seriously has nothing on this masterpiece of CGI perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Digital Copy!","review":"Very deceptive of Sony -- the maker of Blu-ray! -- for not making it clear that the digital copy is NOT compatible with iTunes or Media player. Amazon should also supply that information in their description of the product. Not only is the digital copy for the PSP, you can only load it by using the PS3 and not just any Blu-ray player. Wow, Sony, way to go. I give the movie 3.5 stars, but a big ZERO to Sony for the digital copy rip-off. Yes, rip-off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"I didn't think I would enjoy a anime with such a odd concept. I highly doubted that it will add up to anything. But whole thing works. Characters introduced are odd. Almost all the characters are odd. The writer must have had quite a loner life when he was growing up. But all comes together. Storyline with all its oddity comes together to give you a satisfying experience. Very enjoyable movie for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive packaging","review":"Digital copy is not the digital copy we all know and love.

For me, this way was just easier and more efficient.It left highlights all over. I got compliments for the color (even though I thought it was too brassy and yellow but not golden).Overall, it did the job. It gave even highlights through virgin and dark colored multiple times sections of hair. I would recommend it and use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Great Lost LPs Of The '80s","review":"For anyone who thought the '80s were hair bands and synthesizers, here's the rebuke. I bought this \\"album\\" on the strength of the psychedelic freakout that is \\"I Had A Dream\\". Upon further listening, I found an album that opened up my ears to the real promise of what country music could deliver. Yes, this is the beginnings of No Depression/Americana/Alt-Country. The Long Ryders, along with Jason and the Scorchers opened up the roads for acts like Wilco, Son Volt, Whiskeytown, Ol 97's and even Steve Earle, to trod down. AAMOF, this album is how you get from Gram Parsons/Sweetheart of the Rodeo-era Byrds to those aforementioned bands. If you need proof, check out \\"Ivory Tower\\". Personal faves are the aforementioned \\"I Had A Dream\\", \\"Ivory Tower\\", Never Got To Meet The Mom\\" and the stunning \\"Too Close To The Light\\". Definitely worth a listen. Eighteen years later and it still holds a special place in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth buying","review":"For a defunct band and an out of print CD, I have done much worse in the past. I heard a remix of the track 'Magpie' on Sirius 35 and being a fan of downtempo electronica such as Zero 7, Morcheeba and Beck, I was very pleased to pickup both Abraham albums from a great dealer in NYC through the marketplace (2 day shipping from NYC to Tucson).If you like the sweet, soulfull sounds of Portishead and Beth Orton, this album is a great pickup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I'm sure that writing this book was cathartic for her, but it did little for me. This was not a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work","review":"Based on the reviews, I was really excited about reading this book. However, I was greatly disappointed to see the plethora of grammatical errors, the fact that it is presented as a \\"stage play,\\" and that it seems to lack professionalism. I commend the author on putting her story into words, and I'd recommend that she join a writing group, keep writing draft upon draft, and consider changing the format from stage play to memoir, as I think that's really what she wants to do but is perhaps afraid that it won't be taken seriously? Since it is presented in book format and not actually as a play, a memoir would be a much more organic platform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click. click. click. click. click. click.","review":"That's all this game is, click the button.

It is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't really do anything","review":"These ear plugs block out a very small amount of noise, like the hum of your computer fan or refrigerator. Everything else is still audible. I tried to wear these on the BART (subway of the Bay Area) and it didn't do anything for the noise. I tried to wear them at work and they just emphasized people's talking since it blocks out all the light humming noises in the room.Additionally the plastic is not made to last. After a year or so (even on the set of plugs I didn't use) they started to get this weird stiffness to them, making them even less likely to block out noise because they don't conform to your ear canal. Maybe it's the shape of my ears, but I'm going to have to agree with reviewer amyd - are the positive reviews from people who are hard of hearing? If you like this style of ear plug I recommend the Howard Leight SmartFit. Similar design, re-attachable cord, reusable, actually blocks out noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plug, if a bit uncomfortable under a helmet","review":"I have a noisy motorcycle helmet and couple noisy motorcycles so I always ride with ear plugs - especially at the race track. Typical foam earplugs don't cut it for me. I was riding with the Howard Leight 3 pack FUS30-HP Fusion Earplug Reg Corded In Hearpack These 3M earplugs are a bit quieter, but not as comfortable for my ear canals. I'll probably go back to the FUS30-HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont work at all :(","review":"Maybe my ear is too big? but these dont snuggly fit in my ear and have too much of a gap. Therefore, it does not block any sound. I have inserted it into my ear as instructed and tried to change the position with no luck on closing out the sound.

I had to add standard range ear protection over these ear plugs. The only benefit to these plugs are the ease of placement and removal."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than foam","review":"Works as well as any cheap foam plug. However, it comes with a warning not to remove too quickly to avoid hurting ear drum. Who needs that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"I do not like foam ear plugs but have to use ear plugs for sleeping. These were similar to ear plugs I had used and really liked, but these are terribly uncomfortable. I couldn't make it through the first night. The edges of the baffles on each ear plug are rough on the ear canal.It was difficult to get a good fit that would shut out the noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work","review":"Economical way to protect your hearing. Would rather use these than the muff's so I do not have to finagle around when shooting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Effective","review":"Bought these because my over the ear protection was not working when I fired my 22 rifle. But when people next to me fired their pistols or higher caliber rifles these were not effective at all. I quickly put my over the ear protection back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peltor","review":"These earplugs fit just fine and plugs the noise as you would expect something like this to. Not to use for the shooting range but effective for sleeping, taking exams, or just wanting the background chatter and street noise eliminated. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought it came with the white case shown in the product picture. Instead, it came with a small, black, velvet case. It's hard to put the earplugs in that little bag. I'm a student and I like to be able to put away my earplugs with ease but the bag is too small. I gave up and started using sandwich bags to hold it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet","review":"These ear plugs made a world of difference, when i was in the shop. Noise levels were dropped, and these tips were quite comfortable. I hated those over the ear plugs, since they applied a large amount of pressure on my glasses frame, and in turn my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peltor Tri-Flange Ear Plugs","review":"These ear plugs are horrible and I wish I would have listened to the bad reviews, but there were a lot of good reviews (which I have no idea what these people are using them for, maybe they are already hard of hearing so that's why they worked). I sleep with foam ear plugs every night and these did not work half as well as those. I only used them for a few minutes and I still heard the traffic, and the neighbors passing by. I surely wouldn't use them or think they could protect my ears while shooting ammunition. I re-adjusted them several times pushing them in as far as they would go which I thought was dangerous because at least with the foam ear plugs they do stop at a certain point. This product is not worth the money, or your wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not as advertised!!","review":"This product is pictured with one set of ear plugs and a round plastic case. At the end of the description it says that it is a three pack. So I figure three sets of ear plugs and three cases. Nope,three sets of ear plugs with no plastic cases at all, just one cheap little cloth bag that isn't good for storing ear plugs at all. If this is what was pictured I never would have ordered these. Now to use them I need a plastic case, since a cloth bag will not keep the ear plugs clean, it is hard to clean out like a plastic container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT block any sound","review":"I put these in my ears and adjusted them many times. I walked into the indoor gun range and it felt like I wore nothing. They did not block any sound. I jammed them in as far as possible and nothing. I had a lady friend try them and they didn't work for her. It seems like they need to be a perfect fit, like a shoe. I'm sure these work for some, but not for me. If you buy them, just make sure you know they will fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missleading Picture","review":"I recieved this item after only a few days, super fast shipment.. and the cord on the earplugs is a neon green/yellow color. Only downside, is that the so called \\"case\\" was actually a tiny canvas bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"This workout consisted of two 30 minute workouts, one step aerobics and the other regular aerobics. The camera work was very bad. I couldn't tell what the arms or legs were doing when the instructor changes moves because I can only see parts of the body. The two ladies in the back couldn't anticipate what the instructor was doing either at times. Bad cueing. I consider myself an intermediate level exerciser and I did not find either workouts challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense and easy to follow","review":"I've used this video as part of my exercise routine for years. The step portion has basic moves that you should be able to master within the first couple of viewings. The second segment (which is the same as in the video \\"Great Body Low Impact Aerobics\\") is challenging and recommended only if you can do some high impact aerobic exercise - she works up to running in place for a few minutes, effectively turning the routine into an interval one. Until I was able to start hopping around I easily ignored her's by substituting low impact marching. Overall, the moves in both segments are basic, non-dancey and easy to learn, making this a good video for beginners and also intermediates who can perform some high impact exercise comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Altman does TV","review":"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial was a made for TV that Robert Altman did in the late eighties. The film has all the good Altman elements and is a pretty good drama with good acting from Jeff Daniels, Peter Gallagher, and Eric Bogosian. The film is basically the trial being held for the court martial of Lt. Steve Maryk. The film is recommended for any Altman fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark entirely","review":"Altman is great, but this TV movie really misfires in many ways. There are many good actors here, but they all seem to be playing the wrong roles, the dialogue seems scripted and phony, the tension never builds, the drama is missing. This version was a huge disappointment.Watch the Humphrey Bogart version if you want to see how intense The Caine Mutiny can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny","review":"This is a true classic.

The product came packaged with with all the equipment needed (story pole, tripod, plumb bob, and scope). There are some higher end models than the Dewalt but the price was fantastic for something that will get moderate use. I am a contractor and not a big fan of Dewalt. I beleive Dewalt to be low end professional grade tools. So if your looking for something for day in and day out use you would be better off to purchase one of the more exspensive high end brands with all steel construction.

My signed copy sits proudly in my collection as a reminder of one of the best nights ever. This guy was a complete player and entertainer and the sound was very crisp and clear. While the sound on this recording is somewhat subdued, perhaps to add to the bluesy feel, it is still a good set. It was pretty cool when he Chuck Berry duck-walked out on the dance floor with his eyes rolled back in his head trance-like while he laid down some serious Stevie Ray caliber licks. Though no studio album can seem to capture the energy of a live show, this set is still worth a listen. Great bunch of guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Legends...Incredible Music","review":"I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer stated. I heard Mahavishnu Orchestra and Return to Forever before Colosseum II. They were both awesome, but it all came together with Electric Savage. This is without a doubt the most fiery display of musicianship ever recorded in the jazz-rock-fusion genre. Gary Moore is the shredder on guitar. He started his career playing the blues, then played with Thin Lizzy before joining Colosseum II, which is a revamped version of the original Colosseum with Jon Hiseman on drums and John Mole on bass. And also on keyboards was the great Don Airey, who along with Gary Moore rip throughout the whole cd. My favorite track is -Put it This Way-. If you love jazz or rock or just great music, you need to get this cd. It is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Powerful","review":"Tim Robbins does a fantastic job directing this film.also Susan Sarandon does a great job.but it's Sean Penn who takes this movie to another Level.it dealt with so many elements despite the tragedy involved here.a must see.very well done&Powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent! Wonderful performances by Penn and Sarandon","review":"Regardless of your opinion about capital punishment, this is a movie that everyone should see. Sean Penn SHOULD HAVE received that Oscar for Best Actor! Everyone in this movie was fabulous. Sean was so convincing as condemned prisoner Matt Poncelet, it was as if he really was a Death Row inmate instead of an actor. Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No big deal","review":"Because it's about death penalty, nun and savagery, it MUST make you think and it MUST be an intelligent movie ? No way. Both characters are hateful and very badly defined (you don't actually know why the nun fancies Penn so much and vice versa). Since the beginning of the movie, Sarandon's character does nothing but laugh at all that Penn says while crying buckets in front of the victims' parents. The ending is 300% American in its exaggeration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...I can't believe people love this movie!!","review":"Why a lot more people supporting the criminal side than the victims?

That nun held his hand, said \\"Goodbye\\" and he had the chance to say his \\"Goodbye's\\". I say, What a nice way to go because his victims didn't have such opportunities. Now he will never escape, be paroled, or God forbid freed only to reoffend. The actors, the story, the filming itself was well done. It must have been good to elicit such strong emotion from me.

As he proved in Mystic River, Sean Penn is an amazing actor and this movie wouldn't be the same without him. I think he should have gotten an Oscar for his performance in this.Dead Man Walking is about a nun (Susan Surandon) who receives a letter from a man, Matthew Poncelet, (Sean Penn) on death row. He asks her to come visit him, and they get to know eachother. At first the nun tries to help him prove his innocence, but when that fails she turns to helping him accept Christ and prepairing him for his execution.This film is so moving, it will bring tears to your eyes and will make you re-think your opinion of the death penalty. An absolute MUST SEE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This dark story is lifted into excellence by the wonderful script and the excellent acting by all concerned. Even the set decoration is wonderful. Sean Penn should have received an Academy Award as he deserved it even more than Susan Sarandan. It's the finest acting I've ever seen him do. And, what a joy to see an actress do a part like this with no makeup at all. This is possibly the best directing of a film I've ever witnessed. To do so much with so few sets and so few main actors. Tim Robbins did a masterful job. To anyone who is put off by the story please just watch it for the masterpiece it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Great Movie - Winner Best Actress Award","review":"This movie is about the death penalty (against it but presenting balance on both sides of the issue) and a search for what happened on that terrible day when two young people were murdered. Susan Sarandon plays Sister Helen and was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the movie. Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet on death row for murder. The film and the roles are intense, brilliant, powerful and strong.The movie was a box office sensation in 1995-1996. The acting in the movie is excellent for the entire cast. It shows the harrowing experience of the State putting one its citizens to death. It shows the horror of Poncelet being involved in a brutal murder of two people, and the horror of the State putting him to death.George MacPherson Reid (Woodbridge)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story but not well done","review":"I did not like the movie really.It is filled with many feelings and impressions and is many sided but I think it is not so close to the reality although it tried to show the truth.The movie was a bit too religious and Matthew Poncelet's part was not well presented by Sean Penn. He acted more like an actor and not like a guilty man who denies having comitted the murder.To put it in a nutshell I would say that the story and the idea is great but it is not very well done.I would recommend this movie to others because it shows the different angles and views of the people very well although I did not like the movie.--A student's opinion from Germany--"},{"rating":"1","title":"A TRUE LOSS OF FAITH.","review":"Faith Hathaway had just graduated High School and was one week away from going into the army. She was full of hope and life. Robert Willie( the man this movie was based on), along with his accomplice raped and murdered her. She was raped, stabbed 17 times, and raped after she died. The director of this movie denied requests made by Faith's mother, and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die. Where was the mercy for Faith? Where was the compassion for Faith? Where were the people protesting for Faith's life? Finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to Faith? What about her suffering and that of her family? Barely a foot note in this movie. Ohh and Sister Prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case."},{"rating":"1","title":"More garbage...","review":"...from the CEO of yet another \\"Toxic Company\\".I bought this book from another bookseller as a closeout clearance book (for less than five dollars), and I think I paid too much!!Overall the book's writing stlye is disjointed, as if it was made up of a collection of other articles and websites, rather written as a book.As for the content: I'll borrow what another reviewer had to say, it's the obvious and the wrong. If you know anything about business, you don't need this book, because most of it is common knowledge. The rest of it is just plain wrong!You'd be better off readingStorey's Guide to Raising Pigs: Care/Facilities/Management/Breed Selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"...hasn't this been tried before??","review":"So I ended up with this book because of work, and while I'm reading it I keep thinking 'Where have I heard about this before??'. Then it hits me: ENRON!! They used this same system of incentives, reviews, and bonuses as what is detailed in this book. The end result for Enron was it destroyed the company.So, I definately disagree with a lot of what's in this book, but the bigger problem is what ISN'T in the book - namely the costs. Any plan has costs and benefits and in the end you have the weigh those costs and benefits to decide if you want to use the plan. But, Stiffler treats his \\"Action Plans\\" as if there are no real costs. It's typical salespitch clap-trap. What about employee turnover (a major expense for almost any business), or damage to employee morale and teamwork (difficult to quantify but very important to most businesses)?I'd have to say that the cost of this kind of \\"Performance\\" is way too high for the very small benefits it might offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Its mostly a confusing jumble of acronyms and ideas. Many contradict each other and the core premise of being able to prduce performance through motivation by tangible incentivization seems to run counter to most modern management thinking and current studies on behavioural patterns.

This line of thinking not only benefits the company so that it will be successful in driving revenue, but it is also effective in creating a motivating environment for employees. Employee morale is often linked to job satisfaction, and without a clear idea of how as an employee, you can contribute to the success of your organization, you will be unable to achieve your goals.There is a lot of valuable information as well as useful charts contained within this text. Companies who have only addressed part of their performance management issues, would gain a unique perspective by reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridges a lot of gaps","review":"There's a lot of talk going on about \\"Performance Management\\" but nobody seems to really know what it means (or everybody thinks they know what it means but no two opinions are alike).

The book caught my attention in the beginning by the author's explanation of her own relationship with her stepmother. The author used a number of stepmothers and stepdaughters for examples; however, she did not organize her story subjects as well as she could have. There were so many stories and names given, that eventually I couldn't distinguish who was who and who did what in their personal sagas. I gave the author the benefit of the doubt and finished the book, but I did not learn much from it. I would like to remind you that the author's motivation to write the book was partially based on the fact that her own stepmother is an author and encouraged her to write it.

There might have been some suspense built around about whether the wife will survive, but the filmmakers chose to almost completely ignore it, making her death a side-note in a conversation later in the film.

The story would have a lot of potential, if the director would have been more clear about his intentions.

Peter Stormare is frightening as one of the kidnappers, and the always-watchable Steve Buscemi rounds it out.The storyline is engaging and not nearly as convoluted as the one in The Big Lebowski. It's also impressive that they managed to shoot with so much snow and wind going on. The only film of theirs that may be better than this one is No Country for Old Men....

Especially William H.Macy and Steve Buscemi. My husband always wonders why I enjoy this film so much when I really didn't care for \\"Pulp Fiction\\". Maybe it's because the Coen brothers didn't feel they needed to gross the audience out to make a film that is compelling dramatic comedy.

The script is clever, suspenseful, violent and very, very funny. It's greater success hinges on the cast and the wonderful performances. Without this cast, it could have become a very different film. Not enough can be said about the perfection that is McDormand in this film. Her potrayal of Margie G., police woman and midwest pregnant housewife is a revelation. While she actually has les screen time than some of the others, she creates a character that will forever be remembered in American cinema. A true triumph. William H. Macy - who also deserved an Oscar- is a stressed-out, comically twitching raw nerve. Just superb. Buscemi and Stormare are the perfect dopey villains and Presnell as Macy's father-in-law might be the most villainous of all.Beautifully filmed and acted, it is a true gift to the audience from the Coen brothers and deserved all its acclaim and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie, where everything goes wrong","review":"I enjoyed this movie because it was different. so many kidnapping/randsom movies are the same, but this one has amazing twists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Mystery!","review":"Call me confused, but when I first watched this movie, I took it seriously as a drama and not as a black comedy. I still found it to be very good, suspense filled movie. A well deserved Academy Award for MacDormand and what I thought should have been one for Macy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless killing","review":"Terrible movie.

Very depressing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the most overrated of all time","review":"OK, so you're making a movie ... and you stick your wife in the leading role ... But, there's a problem: She's a dreadful actress ... Solution ? Convince the starved American audience the entire thing is \\"quirky\\" .... And try to force her into being \\"funny\\", while attemping to make things interesting with \\"little touches\\" .... There are so many forced scenes here, I don't know where to begin ... It's really pretty scary how the movie audiences here are stricken with \\"The Lemming Syndrome\\" ... Don't believe the hype ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh, Excuse Me ...","review":"Since the scale starts at one star, I almost gave this two. It's not the worst movie I ever saw but I can't in good conscience contribute to the high average rating it's got here.The story and acting didn't seem too bad to me, but what pissed me off was enduring all the senseless violence in this film only to have the police lady at the end say something like, \\"Ain't it awful the horrible things people will do for a few dollars?\\"Like we all learned some important moral lesson.The main lesson I learned from this movie was the horrible violent \\"entertainment\\" that certain movie-makers are willing to unleash into our none-too-stable society in THEIR quest to make a few dollars.Sorry for being out of step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yah! Yah! Yah","review":"Yes, they do say \\"Yah\\" in Minnesota - but not every other word. And Yah is not the only word which is vastly overdone. It would violate Amazon's review guidelines to repeat it here. Despite some reputation as a comedy, I found nothing to evoke even a chuckle. It is an excessively violent, bloody film. The financial difficulties which lead a pathetic car salesman to instigate this reign of terror are never explained, making for an implausible plot. DON'T BOTHER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and Boring","review":"Geez those Northern accents get to you right away. Dark Comedy? I don't think so. Everyone in this movie talks like a retard because they are all retards! And it is not nice to make fun of the mentally ill. Like a bad Charlie's Angels episode, I found myself rooting for the bad guys because the hero (Frances McDormand) was such a dork. The only way the movie could have been salvaged would have been if McDormand had been the one going through the chipper/shreader at the end. William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi give fine performances, but McDormand is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as Jessie Ventura","review":"This is one of those depressing, weird movies that critics rave about. It's ugly. It isn't funny. It is as tedious as watching paint dry. I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"I couldn't stand their accents. I am saddened by the fact that this was based on a true story."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE....","review":"...if you are expecting, as I was, a movie that can live up to another Coen Bros. movie, such as The Big Lebowski. I rented Fargo under the assumption that it would be as funny and satiracal as The Big Lebowski, but what I found was a tragic tale of misfortune with some comedy thrown in.I laughed outloud at this movie maybe twice. In all, a total of six people died, and not even in comical fashion. The only thing good I can think to say about Fargo is that the characters did an amazing acting job, and I think this movie could have been alot better if the Coens would have used similar elements as those of their other films.Overall, I would advise the average comedy moviegoer to steer clear of this picture, unless you're really into drama or are currently taking antidepressant medication."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shocking Film that took me completely by Surprise.","review":"I expected Fargo to be a light hearted comedy that was set in the midwest. The movie not only was funny but it was thrilling and violent as well. The movie was good, very good actually. Frances McDormand did a wonderful job playing Marge the pregnant police officer. All the other performances are great including Steve Buschemi's as the ransomer of William H. Macy's wife. The plot is very gripping and the low score and cinematography was good too. I highly reccomend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous violence overshadows some great potential","review":"I tried to view this highly recommended film with an open mind. I was told \\"the accents are great\\", \\"the acting is wonderful\\", \\"you are transported right to Minnesota\\". I tried to go along with the crowd. I really did. But you know what, enough is enough. The novelty is gone just about the time the first close-range bullet splatters the first brain. This could have been an interesting, satirical movie. Instead it was mind-numbing and violent. It was for the pulp fiction crowd. Perhaps blowing someone's head off, or shooting them in the back is entertaining. I missed that point. McDormand and Macy give great performances, likable and disturbing, but please...leave something for our imaginations. Make it thoughtful. The number of times I have heard someone ask me \\"but wasn't the woodchipper funny\\" makes me think about a lot of individuals trying to justify something. Stand up for yourselves, go see a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't foget this one.","review":"This has to be the strangest movie I have ever seen. I went to see it with my 17 year old son. We were both shell-shocked when it was over but we have remembered more about that movie after one viewing than probably any other movie we have watched. To say it is Good leaves you open to much speculation, but it certainly is interesting and I will watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fargo","review":"I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It was so down to earth and kept me in my recliner wondering what was going to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story telling, visually astonishing","review":"This is one of those films, the first time you watch it you don't think about it too much and eventually you become addictive to it and start to be able to pick out the fine points that make this movie unforgettable. The entire movie is white and cold, with sharp contrast of red blood and the momentary coziness of the inside. Very powerful visually. One of the best movies of the 90's, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better combo version also includes the DVD bonus material.","review":"While the Blu-ray is an improvement over the DVD, the bonus material is not. However, MGM is making up for this by offering a combo pack that includes the Special Edition DVD so you will get all of the bonus material. Strangely I have this version, but Amazon only has it as a pre-order until August.Fargo (2pc) (W/Dvd) (Ws) [Blu-ray]Now we can enjoy the movie in HD and watch all of the bonus amterial. Sure, it would have better to put it all on the Blu-ray disc, but I guess it was cheaper to just include the Special Edition DVD than to re-master the Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated movie, disappointing DVD","review":"Definately worth watching when it comes on TV, but not worth owning by any stretch. Subjective reviews of the movie aside, the DVD has poor quality encoding and lacks any bonus material other than the trailer.The acting is great, though the accents are overdone. There are random plot diversions that never contribute (filler?), no great police work, no suspense...The Oscar winning lead's role is well done, and the character is loveable, but this definately isn't one of the best 100 movies of the century..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I ordered, and delivered very shortly after purchased","review":"I love this movie - it's funny, sad, thought provoking and just really really entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oakey-Dokey","review":"Weird,Quirky,off the wall,I loved it. A car dealer's plot to have his wife kidnapped and held for ransom goes somewhat awry. This movie's characters,from the bumbling kidnappers to the pregnant Police Chief(Frances McDormand) are a real trip. The story line is great and sometimes bizarre. It's a fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dark comedy","review":"I loved Fargo. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I have seen better movies, and I'll reserve the extra star for them. But I completely enjoyed Fargo. The acting by Frances McDormond is masterful, as are the performances of nearly all of the cast. The mood is interesting, and the cinematography and sound are excellent. This really comes off great on DVD.Not a lot of extras thrown in, but the movie is well worth it without it.If you enjoy dark, slightly twisted comedies, then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Had to add this movie to my library. Great acting and plot. Francis McDormand is wonderful and unexpected as the Sheriff. William H. Macy is a train wreck. Will enjoy it over and over again,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, my funny dark side","review":"First, I like Cral Reiner movies! I would recommend this movie if you like his humor, sound like this is a true story which I like. However, the actors are what makes the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fargo","review":"Really enjoyed this movie, grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. A friend told me about this movie...he said a must see, it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never leaves my VCR","review":"You can learn a lot from this movie. Love, hate, greed, murder...they're all explored in award-winning film by the Coen brothers. Throw in a few snowstorms, a kidnapping, a giant Paul Bunyan statue and a woodchipper and you've got a classic. William H. Macy and Frances McDormand turn in the performances of their lives, while Steve Buscemi tuly makes us believe he IS his character. The complexities of all the brilliant characters are examined and displayed with such mastery in this film. If you don't own it, get a copy fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We just had pancakes this morning\\" Well i want them again!","review":"Fargo was somewhat a long movie but it was really funny and really followed through with a big hit. I beilve this was Coen brothers first film. William H. Macy and Buscesmi preform great in this film. Kind of protrays at people from Fargo, Minnesota as well annoying, very annoying. but all in not all people from Minnesota are like that, i went there this summer. But great movie with a great plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny?? not really..","review":"I really do think the story should have some humor seeing as how people consider it a \\"dark comedy\\". Yes, it is dark.. but it's failure to make me laugh is hard to look past. But this doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. Besides the annoyingly overreacted accents, it did manage to keep me watching. Good acting and a great story, very much worth taking a look at. I did like the movie, at times.. it did tend to bore me however.But it's a good movie... not the greatest movie, but good or at least decent. Worth watching, buying however... I don't know. Not something I'd really watch twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not their best.","review":"Okay, I never thought I would be one of those people who didn't \\"get\\" a critically acclaimed movie, but there is a first for everything I guess. Fargo was good. It was entertaining, not particularly funny, but good. If I didn't know about all the hype surrounding it, I would probably give it 3 stars out of 4. Roger Ebert called this one of the best movies he has ever SEEN? Now THAT I don't understand. And you can't say that I just don't \\"get\\" Coen brothers movies, because I thought Raising Arizona was brilliant. I just didn't see that in here. Oh well. As for the DVD itself, I was extremely disappointed. For such a revered movie, it had absolutely no bonus material whatsoever. It had the trailer, and that is about it. A complete waste. So I give the movie 3 out of 4 stars, and the DVD 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wrost film ever made","review":"what a boring experince, this film is far from any masterpiece. It is too long, poorly writen and NO WAT IN HELL DID FRANCIS MACDORMANT DESERVE AN OSCAR FOR THIS FILM. She is a very very very very poor actress and the film is hardly compelling and makes little sense. As i see it the film stole two oscars from people who really desrved them. I also found the film way to stylish, so much that it overt took the film narrative. Every charater in the storie is either a sterotype or unlikable. THe best part of owning the tape is that there is a preview for the film Jude in it.( which is kind of ironic becaues macdormant stole that films lead actress oscar form here. ) ( I wirte reviews ofr the Long Ilsand youth film Society)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"After ripping off Francis Coppola and Dashiell Hammett (Miller's Crossing), Chuck Jones (Raising Arizona), David Lynch (Barton Fink), Preston Sturges and Frank Capra (The Hudsucker Proxy), the Coen Brothers can find no one else to rip off but themselves. So they give us a retread of Blood Simple. And God is it a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"why does everyone love this movie?","review":"I rented Fargo because of numerous recommendations and general curiosity. i'm still trying to wonder why... it was a terrible movie. I kept waiting for it to pick up, or make some sort of relatively intelligent statement about life, and it never happened. The only \\"excitement\\" (and trust me, thats quite a stretch) was the pointless, incessant killing. I don't have a problem with violence in movies, but in Fargo it just seemed overdone and stupid. The criminals were hardly believable, the protagonists were irritating, and the whole thing was simply a confusing, unfunny, slapdash mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Most Overrated Film in American History","review":"That the AFI put this miserable roll of film in the top 100 says more about the AFI than anything. This movie is quite possibly the worst movie that's ever been made outside of Ed Wood. NOTHING in this movie deserves merit. The mean-spirited scenes involving people of North Dakota and the subtle attacks on Asian-Americans is quite evident. I truly wish the Coens would realize one thing: It's great to have relatives in the business, but that does not make one an artist or a filmmaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE WAY IT IS UP HERE","review":"BEING FROM MINNESOTA I WAS OFFENDED BY THE WAY MINNESOTANS WERE PORTRAYED.

The acting is entertaining and engaging. It kept my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end. The plot is deceptively simple. It could have happened in real life too. It's about a man tried to kill his wife. Yet the directing and acting make it gripping.No wonder it got 2 Oscars in 1997. One was given to the Coen brothers for best original screenplay. The other was given to Frances McDormand for best actress.Other good suspense movies are U 571, The Usual Supsects and 28 days later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fargo","review":"I would recommend Fargo to anyone whow has a sense of humor. This dark comedy is for an intellectual who sees the underlying humor in a film about kidnapping and murder. William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, adn Steve Buscemi are excellent in this film.

This movie depicts a bunch of criminals who botch a kidnapping scheme and then try to cover it up in the dumbest way possible. Yes, the actors are good at their roles. But, so what?Artsy fartsy types make a living pretending that crap is art and Fargo is no exception. 20 years from now people will still be watching 'Seven Samurai' and 'Rear Window' and no one will even remember garbage like 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers' except to wonder, \\"What were they thinking?.\\"Fargo does have one redeeming value though. Hollywood almost always depicts criminals as people with intelligence gone bad. In real life criminals are every bit as stupid as the ones in Fargo. I recommend Fargo to anyone who wants to learn what real criminals are like. Fargo has the reality... not 'The Godfather'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only sane person watching movies","review":"I would just like to know if everyone was watching the same movie that I was, because Fargo was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I'm talking up there with Titanic and Over the Top.

Aside from making midwesterners seem either violent, greedy, feeble, or trite, this movie plods along from one boring accent-ridden scene to the next .... At best, I was able to watch this movie with apathy. If you want to see not only a great Coen Brothers movie, but one of the best movies in recent memory, buy Miller's Crossing instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time and Money","review":"One of the least interesting movies ever to win acclaim as some sort of classic. The acting is serviceable, with William H. Macy turning in especially good work. Macy is the only cast member able to transcend the snickering juvenility of the Coen Brothers' script.Boring boring boring. A film best played as a way to induce slumber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing...","review":"I also do not understand why so many people rave about this movie. It has been described as a comedy by some. There were some parts that made me smile, yes, but nothing laugh-out-loud funny. I'm not even sure what film category it is supposed to go in. The storyline is simply unbelievable, and I hope that is not based on a true story, as I've heard. Overall, I spent most of the movie with my jaw dropped, eyes wide, and stomach roiling at all the gore. I couldn't believe the terrible violence of the movie, and the language is horrible as well. I felt an overwhelming sadness that this terrible chain of events was set in motion, and that so many people were killed for absolutely no reason. What a waste. After such great reviews of the movie, I was sorely disappointed. I certainly will not watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, poor DVD","review":"My 2 star rating is for the DVD, not the film itself. Fargo won't win the Coen bros. any new fans, but if you already appreciate their particular brand of storytelling and wry sense of humor, it will definitely not disappoint. Alas, MGM did not see fit to give this Academy Award winner the proper DVD treatment it deserves. The print contains a number of scratches and the DVD is poorly encoded, resulting in pixel problems on a number of occasions. Save yourself a few bucks and buy the VHS until a better DVD release comes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fargo rules!!!","review":"There is no such thing as a coen movie without meaning, even the Big Lebowski. These guys are really smart so they know how, not only to entertain with some mischeivous humor, but they also know how to make a deeper movie. Fargo is no exception. It has all the elements of a classic Coen brothers movie with its cast of characters and bizzare idiosynchratic behavior. But again there is a method to all of this madness, which makes the movie all the more rewarding. In the case of Fargo, just pay attention to the main character and her particular role in society, not just as a cop. It's a rather scathing comment, but one that should not be ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, dark film","review":"Out of all the people I know, I seem to be the only one who likes this movie. Yes, some of the accents are a bit annoying, but then again so is Jerry.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy)works for a car dealership and has been up to no good and now he's in financial trouble. Out of sheer desperation he hires two men to kidnap his wife. He plans to demand the ransom from her wealthy father. What should have been a simple crime goes terribly wrong. Three people are found dead in a small town called Brainerd where the local sheriff, Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand) get on the case. Oddly enough, even though this film claims to be based on a true story, it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a true story, but the film is fantastic","review":"Despite the note at the beginning of the film, this is a true story only in the minds of the Coen brothers. But this is a wonderful film, creating black comedy out of murders and kidnapping and throwing in genuinely touching moments when you least expect them . Don't be fooled by the broad Midwestern accents; the acting and the writing are so good that this movie will stick with you long after it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clever Film","review":"This is an excellent and intriguing motion picture realistically acted by Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy and Harve Presnell. Offbeat it is well scripted and directed with great visual style. Buscemi gives a standout performance as he usually seems to. It contains another innovative score composed by Carter Burwell. Underrated Burwell just keeps coming up with one great score after another. His score attributes to much of the success of this film as it is very stylistic while subconsciously leads the viewer to one unexpected image after another. This is good filmmaking and will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie. See it.","review":"What is this movie about? Margie's quest for love, sensuality, and passionate meaning in her life. What does the scene with Mike in the restaurant have to do with the rest of the story? It is the pivotal point of the story. All of Margie's prior scenes lead toward it; all her later scenes reflect on it. Why is this movie's genre and style so difficult of define? Because the insane humor, the revolting violence, the numbing mundaneness along the way of Margie's journey are the common background of all our lives, and none of us can explain any of it.

Some of the songs might seem a little slow or just not perfect but that doesn't mean they all suck. I personaly love every song. This is an album you need to have, one of the best.

At The Drive In switches between absolutely electrifying and just plain boring with alarming frequency. They've got the sound, they've got the songwriting, but what they need is someone to point out that an album deserves a few choice ... edits now and again. I would say two more albums until some semblance of stardom."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound Track to Life","review":"If you ever get a chance to see ATDI live in concert you should. Is thirty minutes full of crazy Cedric daceing Omar playing his sweet melodies of life on his left handed guitar.

They have progressed so much from when Hellpaso came out to In/Casino/Out."},{"rating":"2","title":"ATDI IS THE BEST BAND EVER","review":"ATDI is the best band ever. they are so amazingly good. you can feel the energy when you listen to this cd. although the sound is a little sketchy the music is still godly and im in love with it. this cd is friggin sweet but Relationship of Command is a lot better because of the sound quality.

If At The Drive-In can play off their strengths and avoid their weaknesses, they'll be the best band ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathing new life into an often tired genre","review":"This is a stunning cd. The energy and emotion are beyond anything else that has been released recently. And to the reviewer Logan Buck.... it's kinda funny how you try to act smart, cause you aren't. Choose any single track on this cd and you will see that it is not 'lacking melodic structure' and is no way swamped in dissonance (which, by the way, isn't a bad thing, ever heard of atonal music, for those of you who don't know is when you avoid the use of a tonic and put equal importance on each of the 12 tones of the western chromatic scale, this usualy results in a large amount of dissonance). So, any potential buyers, don't be turned away by Logan Buck's faux 'music theory' because the guy is ignorant and knows nothing about the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a long term cd","review":"i started by getting the sparta cds, liked them, got mars volta, liked that too, heard about at the drive in so i went out and got in/casino/out. first time i listened to it, i thought it was average, a few more times and i got the hang of it, after a while it totally grew on me, this music really does grow the more you listen to it. i have ROC and acrobatic tenement and vaya, they are all very good, i feel this is a good medium of the albums. i can\`t believe it took me so long to find this music, the only problem now is i can\`t find any other bands quite like them, sparta is lacking, mars volta is going in a different direction........any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT ALBUM, CRAPPY MASTER: BUY THE JAPAN REMASTER","review":"In its short life, One Way Records rarely sonically updated anything, opting for the low (cost) road of issuing CD's from old, sad and tired LP-EQ'd masters.This CD was no exception.

Some excellent performers, plus a mixture of conductors, but for some curious reason all of the conductors favoured an extremely slow tempo. The worst offender was track three - the Fliedermonolog, sung by the superb Hermann Prey, but utterly destroyed by Kurt Woss, whose tempo suggested that Prey popped out for a smoke between bars.

Cousin Renie has invited her along because she is making a presentation to the board and her caterer has dropped out at the last minute. What was to be a short 1-day trip turns into several days as a giant blizzard snows them in to the lodge. The characters reveal themselves to be a self-centered bunch, interested only in advancing their careers. Judith and Renie discover a skeleton while they are out exploring and then several murders ensue. Everyone there realizes that it must be somebody at the lodge, so there is much fear and mutual distrust. After several red herrings, Judith, of course, deduces who the murderer is. This is a good read, if you enjoy cozies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Daheim's usual standard","review":"This book was disappointing in an otherwise excellent series. There were too many characters, and none of them were likable, so it was hard to care when they got killed off, and almost all of them did. That was not a very credible plot at all. This could have been a great cozy whodunit; snowed in at a mountain retreat, a number of suspects, no one getting in or out, etc. The background of the characters just wasn't interesting or identifiable to the reader. Also, too many corpses were piling up, which just was not believable. Daheim usually has funny characters and plot lines, but this entry just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for them being away from the Inn","review":"Of all this series, I cared for this one the least.

I thought that too many characters were included which made the plot hard to follow. I really did not understand why the murderer comitted the crime. Usually while reading a mystery, I can't wait to find out what happens next and the book keeps me on the edge of my seat. Reading this book turned into a chore after awhile.

The quality of the plastic container seems fine and the shot glasses have been coming out great. To get the glasses out when they are frozen, you just have to run some warm water over them for a few seconds and they will slide right out.

Knowing the rules is not the same thing as knowing how to apply them. This little book is a gem for starting to internalize the rules. Mind you, this is more of a grammar than a text book. But unlike many grammars, the example sentences are focused on core structures, not bizarre exceptions. If you've already learned some Turkish, say with Pimsleur or Teach Yourself, but you're still struggling to make sentences of your own, by going through this book you'll have countless a-ha moments where the clearly explained rules and simple examples bring to light exactly what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun as ever","review":"Ms. Halliday delights yet again with her particular brand of hilariousness that gets me every time. I had the pleasure of hearing her read one of the chapters in person on her book tour. I wish I had the whole book on audio because Ayun's theater background made for a really riveting reading. I could almost taste the sensation of white sugar between two slices of Wonder bread - Ayun's meal of choice in her early picky years - as so vividly and lovingly recounted in the book. I love how the book spans in memoir fashion her life so far, with the focus being on various stories centered around food.

Not only is this book confusing and irrational, but it is full of weird wordings and gaps. I had a hard hard time reading this novel and after several reads and some Cliff Notes help, I was still as confused as before. I couldn't imagine a teacher assigning this book without being fully prepared to answer the reader's confused state of mind after the first few chapters. Perhaps I am not as literary trained in novel reading as some people, but for me, a good novel must capture the reader's attention and emotions. This book didn't.

The Body Glove is not bulky, nice to hold in your hand, and offers good protection for the phone.

Grazulis has obviously dedicated a good part of his life to studying Tornadoes. This book has \\"labor of love\\" written many times over between its pages. And yet, it is an odd book. Grazulis combines tornado anecdotes, tornado science, tornado safety and even tornado mythology into a strange hodgepodge of information. This is not the book to buy for great narratives of tornado destruction. Grazulis' accounts are second hand and mostly used to illustrate his other points. Nor is the book packed full of great pictures. It has some, all in black and white photos and some that are more than a century old. This book is really an encyclopedic account of everything there is to know about tornadoes. I learned a lot, even if I found the book's style a bit bemusing. If you love tornadoes on more than a superficial level, I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book on tornadoes","review":"This book is quite simply my favorite book on tornadoes.

Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar for his supporting role as the narrative force behind the drama. A plot as thick as New England molasses unfolds in flashbacks and present day, and with Spacey telling the story, what's truth and what is fiction? There are some interesting twists throughout the movie, and of course, the final one is a doozie, although if you watch the film closely, you can see it coming.Along with Spacey, director Bryan Singer gets good performances from Pete Postelthwaite as a conniving attorney; Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro as members of the gang; and a good performance from Gabriel Byrne, the supposed mastermind of the gang.The identity of Kayser Solce is key to the film, and it's revelation forms the big surprise at the end.Well done, but not the classic others feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Fuss?","review":"Part of the 'cult' appeal of this film, I'm fairly sure, lies in its trick ending. This is all very well, but it's not a trick ending in the sense that it provides any clue to preceding events. This reduces it to nonsense. The Usual Suspects is well acted, though shoddily filmed, clearly low-budget and cringingly self conscious. The premise itself - five criminals rounded up by a character who may or may not be Kaiser Szoze to commit a crime that we are never sure was actually committed - is the stuff of graduate film school. It's clever, but finally not clever enough. If you're going to take the best part of two hours to play an elaborate hoax, make sure the hoax is worth waiting for. This isn't. Don't give youself a headache trying to figure out what the ending really means. It doesn't mean anything at all. This, apparently, is Bryan Singer's 'trick' on his audience.

When we tried to play it on two different DVD players, a BLU-RAY player and my computer it only played the highlights side--not the actual movie. It's a 2 sided DVD, and only the highlights side worked on any of the devices. Finally, just threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgive me this review","review":"Something just didn't sit right with me at the end of this movie. To be honest, I would have been happier had the twist at the end not been pulled.Even though Spacey delivers a bravura performance (more than worthy of his Oscar), the script itself seems to trip over its own feet at the end. Now, don't get me wrong, I found a lot of the plot quite entertaining, but pulling the rug out from under the viewer and wiping away 2 hours of movie in doing so doesn't instantly put me to my knees praising it.Also, it tries to be a little too stylish at points, making the protagonists of the story pull off these wild heists and stunts, yet never showing set-up, and giving them the ability to do this just because they're \\"really good\\" at what they do.But because it had an original idea, it was destined for classic status. I can live with that, but only because I don't agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Fuss?","review":"Part of the 'cult' appeal of this film, I'm fairly sure, lies in its trick ending. This is all very well, but it's not a trick ending in the sense that it provides any clue to preceding events. For all the central characters to have spontaneously exploded would have been as relevant, certainly more entertaining to watch. The Usual Suspects is well acted, though shoddily filmed, clearly low-budget and cringingly self conscious. The premise itself - five criminals rounded up by a character who may or may not be Kaiser Szoze to commit a crime that may or may not have been committed - is the stuff of graduate film school. It's clever, but finally not clever enough. If you're going to take the best part of two hours to play an elaborate hoax, make sure the hoax is worth waiting for. This isn't.

Yes, the ending was really cool, but the rest of the movie had me falling asleep. I'd rather see a very entertaining movie with a stinky ending, than a boring movie with a cool ending, any day.

And I hardly ever get bored, I watch everything from spy movies to documentaries on rodents. A good movie has to give some reason to be interested in what happens, a \\"carrot\\" to lead the viewer on to the rest of the movie, and The Usual Suspects holds back until the last five minutes. But by then it is an hour and a half too late.The \\"suprise\\" clincher ending could have saved it, if it had occured after the first 45 minutes. After an hour I started checking my watch wondering when the agony would be over.

The acting is pretty much bottom of the barrel. What's with the guy with the marbles in his mouth? I need subtitles to figure out what he's saying? Is he speaking English?

The first time I saw The Usual Suspects I walked in at the end and had the surprise ruined before I ever got a chance to see the film.That did not reduce my love for this movie at all. The beauty comes from the subtle way Verbal manipulates his way through tough situations. Most of the movie's finer touches, like the way Verbal smokes his cigarette in the American style while in the police station and European style when he is alone do not become obvious until you know the truth.Rarely have I come across a film that immerses you in another world so completely I get the same feeling from this film that I do from Casablanca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow A Picture Book With TRAILERS","review":"Gee you shouldn't have.

There's a burning tanker in the San Pedro harbor, twenty-seven dead bodies, and four other temperamental criminals involved: former cop Keaton (Byrne), explosives expert Hockney (Pollak), and the hot-headed duo McManus (Baldwin) and Fenster (Del Toro).The Usual Suspects could have gotten by on the storyline itself, but the script is funny and well-written and the acting is terrific all around, especially by Spacey and Del Toro (both in award-winning performances).

Bah! In the effort to appeal to the movie-goer by way of ambiguity and mystery, this movie loses its luster. Perhaps if the makers of this film had a goal other than to baffle the viewer, the plot would have been better. Instead, the director concentrated on the audience rather than the film itself. Additionally, while the movie does have a few twists coupled with a surprise ending, it is nothing unique. Like many other films, this one has the same gun play, murder, and ultimate 'bad guy.' This film is nothing special, and I am surprised that so many people found it 'amaxing.'

This is the story of a writer and director trying to outdo other writers and directors who are trying to outdo others in turn. Turn the dial up to eleven. It doesn't have three minutes in it that seem like anything that could ever happen in real life. You're just watching actors act and a parade of standard movie effects.

True, it achieves maximum hipness and self-conscious irony (all of the usual postmodern, Gen-X symbols), but the story is frustratingly vague (ambiguity can be good, but there should be a point, even if subtle) and the characters off-putting and uninteresting.

I saw through the gimmick of the movie immediately, and had nothing to do but watch the movie unfold and throw plot elements and bad performances at me. Kevin Spacey's work in this movie consists of repeating words that he saw written down on a piece of paper, rather than actually acting (creating a living breathing character).

I recently noticed it to be very popular among critics and fans, so I became a fan and saw it at the store ... The movie starts off annoying and slow and stays that way throughtout every now and then putting in not-boring parts to seemingly keep you from leaving the theater. When the end came it was a little cool but I was disappointed, because I felt that was the best and only good part.

This specialedition has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.Get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American thriller of the nineties","review":"Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie...","review":"Everything on this video is AMAZING, the sound, picture, acting, plot, everything.

I was thinking, what the hell is going on here? No one had told me that that responce was to be expected, and you're really not supposed to get the beginning until you've seen the end. So, in my confusion, I was still sure based on the stellar performances, and the mere presence of Kevin Spacey, that this was a good movie, and I was just the idiot who gave up on it too fast.So I rented it again, and this time watched it the whole way through. I still didn't understand the first 20 minutes, but it becones clearer after that. Boy oh boy, is this a good movie. It twists, and turns, and flashed back, and forth, and everything is spinning rapidly out of control, until the last minute & 30 seconds, when everything is completely cleared up; it's like a mind colonic.So please, take the warning that no one gave me, and be prepared to be confused beyond anything else, except maybe \\"Mulholland Dr\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Usual Suspects is a must-see","review":"The Usual Suspects absolutely blew me away the first time I saw it.

I felt like there was too much reliance on name dropping and intentional complications, which I guess fits in with the big twist at the very end, but that doesn't suddenly make it excusable. Tough to follow at many times, with some interesting storytelling experiments along the way; it's a good-to-very good story that often gets too caught up in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The usual 90's movie.","review":"I feel like they swore so much more in the mid-90's. Maybe I'm just getting old but every other line of this movie was f*ck, it seemed. So that kind of turned me off of the movie. However, on the hole this movie was good, good action, good plot and good mystery. Kevin Spacey did a great job with his role, it was a lot like his role in Seven. Kind of the relaxed sociopath with sarcastic humor.On Blue ray-HD the movie looked great, I watched it on a PS3 while sick one afternoon and it took my mind off of the stomach flu. And if thats not a great movie I don't know what is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I rented this movie as a recommendation from a friend, as well as from the reviews. At first, I couldn't follow the movie, it seemed a little too confusing. It wasn't until an hour until the movie that it began to make sense in my mind, and then the ending hit me in the face-AND that's where my mind began to backtrack and all the other parts of the movie came together. How it seemed a bumbling, crippled fool pulled the wool over four other unsuspecting crooks' eyes as well as the police force. And walks away clean. Not to mention a $91M fortune. Not bad for an idiot! Kevin Spacey is convincing, and brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Whodunit","review":"I rented this because it is on some top 100 list, and I was surprised at how engaging I found it. The acting is good, the plot is fascinating. I couldn't even have guessed the ending. The film alternates between scenes from the present and about 6 months prior.

There is one song in English (London, London by Caetano Veloso) (e os quem falam portugus também vo gostar ainda mais, com certeza). Reminiscent of the alternative rock that I listened to in college (87-96), brings to mind bands like The Smiths, World Party, Stone Roses, Toad the Wet Sprocket, U2, Counting crows, REM, and others...various and diverse influences, tight musicianship, varied vocal treatments, all very expressive, excellent performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a way to carry a Palm & be cool at the same time","review":"This is a very cool little slip case that fits my Zire 31 perfectly.

A great product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different than plain blue!","review":"Love my case. The Zire 31 fits snugly inside the case and the magnetic clip insures that it does not come out of the case.

Michael Flatley's stupid inflated ego completely eclipses his very fine dancing, and the dancing of his equally fine supporting cast, until the dancing becomes secondary to his head.

The Universal Studios version of it is disaster. You are looking at it through a mist, with poor video and sound quality. Looks like a copy of a tape on a DVD disk. SHAME! The other version that I rented once was incredible and outstanding, with excellent video and sound. Plus, LOTS more energy from the performers. Boycott this Unversal version until they re-released the other!!!!!If you've already bought it, write Universal. Let's have the real version again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, terrible video","review":"Lord of the Dance is a great show to see in person. It's flashier (and I guess sexier) than Riverdance, which makes it different, not better or worse. But you'll never know from the video. The switches between angles are much too quick, and the view is alternately murky with \\"smoke\\" and washed out by light. Perhaps this is a fine example of the vieographer's art, and if you want to appreciate that, fine. But don't buy this video if you want to see Lord of the Dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"video quality very poor","review":"Dancing is wonderful, but is flawed by the poor video transfer. It has the look of a eight mm film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Dance: Performance=4, film-making=0.","review":"What a disappointment! There's fantastic talent and effort here, but it is thoroughly painful to watch, due to the film-making.The constant, rapid shifting of camera angles, including up through the glass floor, combined with the switches to slow-motion video, make the effort to enjoy the tempo and flow of the show effectively impossible. Further, the VHS version alternated between poor lighting and oversaturation of color. Too bad. The performance is high-energy and creative, although without the \\"heart\\" of Riverdance. It's a fair-to-poor 90-minute encouragement to see the stage show, if it is ever performed again. That's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Show","review":"Excellent music and dance performances. Personal favorites in the program are \\"Gypsy\\" (great instrumental) and \\"Siamsa\\" (very nice traditional routine). Michael Flatley dominates the stage with his flamboyant dancing, but other performances in the show prevent his presence from being too much. Almost comparable to \\"Riverdance\\" that remains the original and best show of this type of genre. Ronin Hardiman's music is remarkable and his CD is a worthy addition to the music collection. DVD sound and imagery are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me a break","review":"I almost didn't purchase the video due to the number of poor reviews and complaints about the production. I'm glad I chose to buy the show anyway. The Lord of the Dance is the single most awesome entertainment experience I have ever witnessed. I have seen the show on more than one occasion and I own the sound track, DVD and VHS versions of the show. All are amazing. Although no movie can match the excitement of any live show, I enjoyed them all immensely. This is NOT Riverdance (thank goodness) and there's a lot more to see. I did not find the different camera angles to be distracting in any way. They allowed for great perspective, in my opinion. Whether you 've seen it live or not, get the CD and the sound track. There won't be another show like this one for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable production","review":"It's possible the content of this DVD is worth 5 stars, but I'll never know. My husband and I couldn't watch it because of the constant camera angle changes. Just as we'd start to become engrossed in a dancer's moves, they'd switch to an overhead shot or, annoyingly, one from underneath the stage. My husband and I were equally irritated by this and could not even finish watching it.This film is like those movie montage \\"previews\\" that show you a snippet of dozens of films without pausing long enough for you to take in what any one of them is. For this reason, this DVD is unwatchable and a total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent performance VERY POOR VIDEO EDIT!!!!!!","review":"As other have stated, the performance is excellent. My wife and I watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show. With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots. They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch. You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it. Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it. I hope they re-make this DVD. I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Editor of this DVD should be shot","review":"I went to see Michael Flatley's live show and thought it was fabulous. So I got the DVD hoping to see more fantastic dancing. Watching Lord of the Dance live was wonderful. Unfortunately, watching the DVD was like watching a commercial on fast forward. The camera angles were contantly changing. I felt like I didn't even have a chance to watch the dancers because a second later, the angle would change to something else. It was like \\"flash, flash, flash, flash\\".How this DVD made it as a finished product released to market in this state I'll never know.See the show live.

But, my gosh, what a disappointment!My first thought was, \\"Weird.\\"The costumes, the songs, everything about it was just plain strange. And then in swaggers Michael Flatley--Lord of the dance, the hero, with feet of flames! Humbug. He'd better watch out, he might burn himself.And then I watched Riverdance again. I began to notice just how big his ego was, even then. Now, after seeing it several times, I can't stand it! He strikes the most ridiculous poses, in Riverdance, AND in Lord of the Dance. It's simply nauseating.Michael Flatley may be just about the greatest dancer, but he knows it. That's the whole problem.So, if you're a fan of Riverdance, don't think that because you love that, you're going to love this. \\"Lord of the Dance\\" is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment and a complete waste of money.","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this video. The rapid camera angle switches made it impossible to get into the sense and flow of the dance. The film quality was poor, the stage seemed too small, and the lighting and smoke distracted from and obscured the dancers. The slow motion effect was used far too much. Once or twice to appreciate the intricate footwork would have been enough; however, it was constantly interrupting the rhythm of the dance. It was a travesty of a wonderful show. Don't waste your money or your time on this one. I'm surprised and disappointed to see Amazon.com carrying a product of such poor quality. This purchase has made me very wary of buying anything else from this Internet site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget taste","review":"If you want to see what the stage show was like, do not get this video.If you want to see something enjoyable, do not get this video.If you want to see how a great show can be massacared by poor taste, get this video.This video reprents the excesses of a narcisstic editor who is more interested in creating an abstract hurly burly of juxtaposed images than in helping the user enjoy a great visual feast. It is like somebody doing a video about an artist's paintings insisting on placing colored and distorting lenses on their cameras to misrepresent the artwork.Yes, this style is OK for a 3-minute music video where the star of the show is the music. This style is completely unacceptable when it is an hour long video that is supposed to show a dance.This video represents the peak of poor taste and bad editing.

Sometimes the lights shined right at you so you could see what they were doing.. Also, I found Michael Flatley so arrogant and conceited. At the end of the show, he overdid it with encores, and instead of thanking the audience, he just kept saying Yes!! Yes!! Not one bit of humbleness. He didn't seem to know that you might be extremely talented, but you are nothing if you don't have an audience. In my opinion, this is not worth the buy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Celtic Dream","review":"After seeing Lord of the Dance live in Indianapolis, I had to get the video, because I was amazed with the show. After viewing the video, I believe that the best experience you could have, is to see it live. Because the video quality is only a fraction of what it is live. The images cut every few seconds, which can be somewhat distracting, and sometimes, the lighting in the video can be too much, and makes the entire screen look fuzzy blue. But, if you are an avid Lord of the Dance fan, I suggest buying this video, especially since Michael Flately is not preforming this show anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"chopping block","review":"Although the \\"Lord of the Dance\\" is comprised of some of the most talented dancers and choreographers of Irish Dance, one cannot enjoy it or even NOTICE the steps.

To be honest I probably will not watch this dvd all that much and, in fact, probably will not watch the whole thing, even if I split it up into 10 minute segments.

I had hoped I was buying a recording of that spectacular event, but unfortunately the tape I received was something substancially different. It is quite simply incomprehesible that anyone would deem what I received an acceptable video presentation of anything, let alone Michael Flatley's venerable dance masterwork.Far beyond a matter of \\"taste\\", the video quality was substandard in every way; it's quality is more likened to that of a 15th generation bootleg.I've recovered from viewing the tape, and I can only conclude that there are 2 distinctly different releases of this title being sold in the same packaging.

The skillful dance is all but obliterated by flashing lights, smoke, and chaotic camera switches. Endless slow motion shots insult the dancers and the audience. The \\"story line\\" is phoney and gratuitous. Flatley makes a spectacle of himself, wandering away from the group in mid-dance to fondle and kiss the leading female dancer, casting himself in ridiculously self-aggrandizing poses, and whipping up the screaming live audience by shouting back at them, \\"Yes ... yes!\\" It's a sad thing to see Irish music and dance profaned by one of the very artists who brought them to the rest of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big production, even bigger ego!","review":"Riverdance, even when Flatley was in it, was a classy show. It had lots of varying elements to it, but was always enriching and fun. LORD OF THE DANCE is Flatley's run for the brass ring -- all spectacle, little substance. Sure, the dancing is top-notch (as it was in Riverdance), but the storyline is borderline silly and cornball. I saw this show live from a front row seat and really fought hard to keep the performers from noticing the pained look on my face during the show's moments of forced sentimentality and cuteness. An appropriate movie analogy for this show might be INDEPENDENCE DAY -- visually impressive but hampered by a script so lame and insulting that you'd just as soon watch it with the sound turned completely off. That's the rub with LOTD. Looks great, but less filling than Riverdance. My advice? Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Dancing - VPoor Video and Audio on DVD","review":"Saw the show live, it was FANTASTIC! BUT the DVD is not worth watching, the video looks very grainy, the audio is also poor. Save your money, don't buy or rent this until they redo it. (Hope they do.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, shoot the editor !","review":"I agree with some other reviews. The performances are incredible, and Mr. Flatley is amazing. But the show falls flat on its face with editing seemingly done by a 2 year old. Switching every 2 seconds from camera to camera, and interspersing with slow-motion at the wrong times makes it impossible to enjoy the immense talent these performers have. Seeing this show in person in October 2005 at a small venue was outstanding, even without Mr. Flatley. Up close and personal, something this DVD totally lacks due to the poor editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good DVD","review":"I have always loved Irish dancing (...everything Irish actually...) and after seeing Riverdance I knew LOTD would be great. It was...and this DVD captures all of it. The music is great. And, of course, Flatley and his dance troupe do a WONDERFUL job.The reason I give this four stars is because I found the camera work somewhat annoying on the DVD. As other reviewers have noted, the camera angle changes quite often and there are several slow motion effects that I would prefer not be in there. However, I have read many complaints about the sound quality of this DVD. I found it to be rather good. I don't have one of these super nice surround-sound systems (as I suspect most people don't...) so I can't comment on the quality of my 30th channel ;). I also don't see anything wrong with the lighting. I've watched the dvd no less than 100 times and the lighting quality looks great to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced Irish dancing.

But stilli managed to find a few grooves that i can get into,for instance,\\"Inside To Outside\\" has a nice feel and \\"Blue Sky\\" is a nicespacey laidback jam. The rest sounds like disco. I truly hopethat this is not a sign of things to come from Matt Cooper andfriends. To get a feel of Outside's best,check out \\"Almost In\\"This is their debut recording and in my opinion,their best workto date,followed by \\"The Rough and The Smooth\\" Each and everycut on both of these cd's is GREAT! \\"Discoveries\\" is the perfect experimental soundtrack for a movie.They all have a jazzy oldschool feel with great keyboards throughout. Hopefully they willget it back together again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Downward Slide Outside","review":"I can remember first hearing Matt Cooper, teamed with Cleaveland \\"Origin\\" Watkiss, on Outside's debut \\"Almost In\\". It was the CD that I used to [anger] my wife because I literally played it to death. Ditto for \\"The Rough and the Smooth\\". Since then, I've been a jilted (music) lover, waiting for another Outside CD to knock me out like those. That CD never came. But total disappointment in Matt Cooper's musical genius did.I'm not even sure if Outside is still a band, with Matt Cooper teaming up with Andreas \\"something-or-other\\" for a series of wannabe-eclectic tracks that sacrifice electronic raw grooves for experimental 'edge'. More like 'sledge'. \\"Blue Sky\\" is the ONLY track on Out of the Dark worth listening to. Too bad there was no single available.Hopefully, that old Outside mystique will come back to bless those of us tired of commercial radio schlock. Hopefully, Outside will come back 'in' again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the.....picture","review":"Over the past few years Matt seems to have lost nearly all his brilliance and genius in writing contemporary urban Jazz music so off-the-wall it could be a carpet. \\"Out of the Dark\\" nothing but confirms this. Gone are the days of Matt's melodic & rhythmical wizard-performances of tracks like \\"Crazy\\" or \\"29/8\\"- and here are the days of run-of-the-mill computer-loop drum'n'bass muzak. Weep, we shall, and hope we will be spared another musical insult by this (lost) genius.So, in a nutshell: If \\"The Rough & the Smooth\\" is your Outside-benchmark you ought to stay clear of \\"Out of the Dark\\". But if anything from \\"Discoveries\\" onward is then I guess you ought to have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why NOT on DVD?","review":"One of those little films that is a great watch.

The description of the ritual and significance of the bullfight and the contrast between the poetic ideal and the gritty reality is very strong, but it gives the gringo reader an idea of the appeal of this rather one-sided sport. I bought a recent copy through Amazon to give to my son who had just seen a bullfight in Madrid and wanted to know more about the subject.

Hancock is so adpet that he can take wildly divergent styles, and use these like tools from a toolbox to create a coheasive film score.

I applied the \\"stickers\\" according to the manufacturers directions onto my clean, dry tiled shower floor. They worked fine for two months, but are starting to \\"come up\\" on their own. The manufacturer needs to apply a stronger adhesive to the product. I still have a few older (20+ years) stickers on my shower floor that I inherited with the house. These products are hard to find anymore, liability reasons?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted longer than others","review":"As a \\"senior\\", I needed some traction in the shower and after trying other brands that didn't last a week, got this one. It's been a year and a half now and the decals are still sticking! Just remember before placing them in shower/tub, you should thoroughly clean tub, rub with alcohol, and dry with hair dryer. After placing decals down, use rolling pin or similar to finish sticking. Works for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't stick.","review":"After my wife first installed these we thought we had found the answer to a problem we have had. Other appliques did not stick well at all. In a matter of days they came off. The same thing happened with these. It just took a few more days.The appliques I had applied about 25 years ago almost had to be blasted off. Wish we could find some that would stick and stay stuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money and a Safety Risk","review":"Very displeased with the item, it was not expensive, and hardly worth a return. They did not work! I followed all directions in application, including using the longest wait time suggested. They didn't seem exceptionally sticky to start with, but I thought maybe the curing process would make a difference.After three showers (two days) one fell off, I replaced it with a new one and three showers later it was off again as well as several others. They did not even make it to a 'cleaning' day to worry about cleaning products being an issue.I remember these from long ago, but obviously they used a different adhesive back then. Its more than how they look, they are unsafe if you expect it to keep you or your children from slipping. A waste of money and a safety issue waiting to happen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"If you have a non-textured tub with soft water these are a MUST have.

Unfortunately, as several reviewers had already mentioned, they last a week or two (it you're lucky). Then they begin to peel off very quickly. This was a waste of money, and a total waste of time on my part. Perhaps it would adhere to certain materials better than others, but a week's use out of these is unacceptable. This product is not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed in bathtub decals","review":"These bathtub decals don't stick very well.

I won't try again","review":"After the first time I bought these stickers and applied them to my tub shower, and they began to peel off, I figured maybe I did something wrong, so I decided to try again and ordered another package of these. I followed the instructions to the letter. I made sure the tub was bone dry. I applied them with substantial elbow grease. I made sure the surface didn't get wet for 24 hours as recommend, but I waited a full 2 days, by showering in the other bathroom. Everything I did, I did correctly. The stickers at the back of the tub, where I don't stand, remained in place (hey, that's worth 2 stars), but at the front of the tub, where I mostly stand during my showers, these decals began coming up within a week. The quality just isn't good enough. I'm now looking for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a couple of weeks.","review":"I strictly complied with all of the application directions and let them dry for well over 24 hours.

However doesn't that defeat the purpose of applying them in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I thought","review":"I bought a few packs of these decals because I didn't want my mom to slip and fall in her bathtub. A few days after applying, they started peeling off. I followed the directions: make sure the tub is dry before applying and wait 24 hours before using the tub again. I'm somewhat surprised at the results because most of the reviews on Amazon are positive. But considering the cheap price, I think the product is still worth a shot. It didn't work for me, but it might work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety in the Bath","review":"Prior to purchasing this product getting in and out of the bath was quite treacherous, simply the bath was extremely slipy.

I followed the instructions to the letter, and also used a blow drier on the tub to ensure it was completely dry before applying the decals.

I should've skipped his entry, and heeded R. Kent Cullen's of FL \\"They Don't Stick\\" comments. I bought 1 pkg. and yes, they are cute, white, good size, arrived quickly--the middle pops out for smaller tiles--and your feet don't slip. I followed the exact instructions and let dry 24 hours between cleaning/scrubbing and applying. And then another 24 hours before using the shower to be sure all the appliques were completely dry and \\"stuck\\". I was so pleased after the first couple showers I ordered another pkg. I should've waited a week, because after about 5 showers, they are coming off one by one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last a Shower!","review":"We were eager to try these considering the great reviews they had, but the decals didn't work. We cleaned the tub well, let it dry a full day (we have two bathrooms), then put the decals on according to the instructions.

I washed the tub out, rubbed it down with alcohol and let it sit for several minutes before applying. I waited 24 hours to use the tub. The first couple came off the the first shower I took, almost all the rest of then came off within a week. The clownfish ones are all still on perfectly so I know its not my tub or my application.

I let them sit for over a day before using.It only took about 2 days before one came off. Then, the others started lifting and becoming half-on and half loose.I spent more time cleaning and applying them than they lasted in taking showers. Total waste of time. Heed what people say: Don't buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"After just 2 months, stickers are peeling off","review":"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because while the stickers are holding on, they definitely create a safer bath tub floor but it's only been 2 months since I've installed them and a few are already coming off.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starting to come unstuck !","review":"Followed direction to the tee. Now their coming undone after only eight months.

Didn't have any problems with them discoloring, so I guess that was a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I followed the directions exactly, and allowed the decals to dry 36 hours (instead of the recommended 24). Within one week, one decal had peeled off. Within two weeks, three have peeled off and I'm once again slipping in the tub.

This is a guitar player's delight. His playing can be at times delicate and ferocious, but always engaging. Di Meola teams up with his former boss Chick Corea on \\"Short Tales of the Black Forest,\\" \\"Two to Tango\\" and \\"Isfahan.\\" [The latter two--along with \\"Splendido Sundance\\"--are from Splendido Hotel, arguably his best album.] You also get two versions of \\"Passion, Grace & Fire.\\" The first is from Electric Rendezvous and features di Meola and de Lucia; the second adds McLaughlin. Di Meola is equally adept on the electric guitar, but I prefer his acoustic work. If you're unfamiliar with this gifted guitarist, this is an economical way to acquaint yourself with his early solo work.

The most astounding aspect of this album is Rick's poetic lyrics, which only add to his masterpiece; no one compares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought the single.","review":"Purchased because of \\"The Hop\\", but with the exception of one other song, the album reminds me too much of 1960s experimental jazz.

It is fast paced and takes you on adventures that you won't have in normal life. It is the 2nd novel in a 4 book series. My life doesn't seem so crazy when I get to experience life in the Taylor household. I think that others will enjoy this book.

Not only is it a well told tale of intelligent life in space, it is also a book of what could be if mankind would only try. From the callings of a dead world to the glorious successes and tragic failures of Man's attempts in space, _Encounter_with_Tiber_ shows how close we can be to space with experience that could only come from someone like Buzz Aldrin. This is a GREAT book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sci-fi novel written by one of the few who have been there","review":"When I heard about this novel, I was curious. I usually do not buy best-selling hardcover novels, (not until they are in the clearance bin). Most top of the line hardcovers are just over-priced, and would sell even more if they were $10-$15. But, I digress.I had the opportunity to meet Buzz and have him sign the book when I bought it (yes, I did have to wait a bit till he came to town, but it was worth it.) Buzz is your atypical celebrity. Maybe because he is comfortable with his past achievements. Knowing sci-fi well, I was prepared for Encounter to be another Michner's Space, I was plesantly surprised that it was not.Encounter is an engaging story of the not too distant future of space exploration. It is not as flashy or gadet ridden as other novels but does give you situations where you KNOW the descriptions are genuine because Buzz has been there, done that.Pick it up, and if you ever run into Buzz, ask him what Freemasonry is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will not make your Book Recommendations Contest","review":"Although the technical detail of Buzz Aldrin's novelis refreshingly accurate, it is clear to me thatJohn Barnes has not held to his part of the bargain-- namely, to bring the same level of attention toplot and characterization to the novel as his associateDr. Aldrin has brought the realities of space flight.The novel samples a range of characters, none ofwhich are treated with enough concentration to make themmemorable. Any richness of character is sorely absent.I cared little for the number of faceless astronautsof the novel, but no less so than, evidently, Mr. Barnes.In my view, their collaborative effort is a failure: thenovel still reads with the flat ring of Buzz Aldrin,Scientist and Astronaut; Nowhere in it do I see any markat all of the artist's hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue silly; some inaccuracies in technical details","review":"I gave up on this book 250 pages though because it couldn't hold my interest. Aldrin and Barnes are more technically oriented than some but they went in a little over their heads. I appreciate technical details but they must be consistent and accurate, otherwise they annoy and detract from the plot. The plot wasn't all that coherent in the first place--this was not \\"page turner\\". The dialogue was not realistic. The charaters' speech were too artificial in their use to explain this and that. Some of the subjects the \\"professionals\\" spoke about were too simplistic for actual professionals to discuss. They sounded more like space enthusiasts. Maybe I would have enjoyed this more as a juvenile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely literate.","review":"One of the first things any (halfway decent) writer of fiction will tell you is that the most fundamental rule is \\"Don't tell me, show me.\\" Aldrin and Barnes spend an inordinate amount of time in detailed explanations of technology, history, and motivation, and precious little showing their characters in action. \\"Encounter...\\" reads more like a premise for a book than real fiction, and the prose is among the worst I have ever seen published. It is difficult to believe that John Barnes, the man responsible for the wildly imaginative (if occasionally banal) \\"Mother of Storms,\\" among other competently-written novels, had anything to do with this; I would be embarassed to have my name associated with it in any way. Forget the plot; the \\"first encounter\\" scenario has been done so many times, in so many ways, and so often better than it is done here that there is no point to reading this. No point at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, and informative, but only if you're in to space","review":"This book is a futuristic science fiction, but nearly all the concepts and details of space travel are based on very firm physical concepts.

Big waste of space of paper, with enormous margins all the way around. So far, haven't seen any picures or drawings, which was primarily the reason I purchased this book. Would have returned it, if I hadn't opened it, but didn't know it was terrible until I did. Have buyer's remorse. Pricey and definitely not worth it. Would not recommend this edition at all.

Cool but never cold, these photos are simply beautiful. The noir-flavored night shots are among the finest, with the chiaroscuro of a John Alton film. Gottscho had the luck to be living during one of New York's most photogenic periods, after most of the Art Deco classics had been built but before the postwar clutter of shoebox skyscrapers had set in.Technically, this collection is very well produced, with sharp, lustrous photos on high-quality paper. Highly recommended for any fan of vintage urban photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly Boring and Pointless","review":"This book was a total waste of money and time.

It is excellent! Why it didn't get some type of award is beyond me, but let's face it they gave American Beauty Best Picture over The Sixth Sense! This has got to be one of Kevin Bacon's finest roles, he is fantastic as the blue collar family man trying to figure out what's happening with himself and his son.

It becomes difficult to discern what are Bacon's visions and what are the reality scenes.Kevin Bacon plays a middle class father, whose life is changed after he volunteers to be hypnotized.

The movie is a very, very loose adaptation, but many elements are still there. A little predictable, but definitely worth owning the film has enough twists and creepy moments to satisfy. It also features Jennifer Morrison (House, M.D.; Once Upon A Time) in one of her first film roles.

Then I opened the blu ray cover and noticed that the disc inside was very generic looking. The disc 's cover/sticker on the disc was not centered and the letters were grainy if anyone was to look closely.

It starts off pretty promising with Kevin Bacon having very weird and scary dream sequences, and some encounters with the ghost that scared me quite a bit. But then the scary part of this movie ends and it focuses more on Kevin and his family. The last hour of the movie is really boring and predictable, and the end is the standard thriller ending. I understand why Sixth sense got all the attention and this film was left behind. Sixth sense is actually good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Sorry, but I was expecting more.

I'm glad because this was one of best directed movies I've seen in the 90s'. It's like The Sixth Sense only not as sophisticated. Kevin Bacon (Jake) gives a very convincing performance as the freaked out brother-in-law of Illeana Douglas (Lisa). Illeana Douglas is just plain convincing (as an actor) in anything she's in.

The DVD advertises itself as fullscreen format, but as far as I could see this simply means that widescreen lovers such as myself can view it in their preferred ratio so long as they ensure the widescreen facility on their DVD player is switched on."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!","review":"THIS IS A GREAT MOVE LOVE IT,WOULD RECOMEND THIS IF YOU LIKE THRILLER/DRAMA/GHOST MOVIES!!!

Hard to believe this is the same guy who started out in FRIDAY THE 13TH, FOOTLOOSE and other mindless fluff. In his recent MYSTIC RIVER, I'm sure the only reason he didn't get an Oscar nomination is because Tim Robbins did and they didn't wanna do both of them? Anyway, in this highly atmospheric and chilling thriller, Director David Koepp leads Bacon, Kathryn Erbe and cast on a psychic journey of really creepy proportions. Kevin's scenes in digging up his yard, his house and the past of a ghostly scepter are riveting. A chilling and worthwhile adaptation of Matheson's masterful work.As far as SIXTH SENSE goes, the similarities are minimal and both are great movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Stir' in the Neighborhood","review":"Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) wanted to be hypnotized, so he did. Big mistake. He then saw glimpses of spirits and events that happened in the past. A 'receiver' as a mysterious cop told his wife. Witzky is sick of his pathetic life and doesn't realize what he has. His wife doesn't know what's wrong with him, but his son knows. There's a secret in Chicago that's about to be uncovered and a girl's murder will come to justice. I liked this more than \\"The Sixth Sense\\" because of its characters. Better performances and a better story. He tried to uncover the mystery throughout the whole movie, but little Haley Joel tried to help a spirit at the end of that movie. It just didn't belong there. In this, it does. I don't know if I can listen to The Rolling Stones again. Kevin Bacon is definitely a good actor. Think twice about children who have imaginary friends, they might be ghosts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Supernatural Thriller","review":"This movie is based on the book of the same name written by Richard Matheson. Kevin Bacon plays a fairly typical working-class guy living in Chicago with his wife and his son. One night at a party, he gets into a lively discussion with his sister-in-law, who believes in psychic communication and the power of hypnosis. He challenges her to hypnotize him, and she plants in him a post-hypnotic suggestion to be more open-minded. But the results aren't quite what either of them expected; he sees the spirit of a girl from the neighborhood who disappeared months ago; as does his son."},{"rating":"2","title":"STIR OF ECHOES VS.THE SIXTH SENSES","review":"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!,WAY MORE BETTER THEN THE SIXTH SENSES,THE SIXTH SENSES IS NOT EVEN GOOD.STIR OF ECHOES WAS SCARY AND EXCELLENT TO WATCH.SO RENT IT OR BUY THIS MOVIE,YOU LIKE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just O.K. - predictable but well done","review":"I was going to put 3 stars but 3 should be for atleast \\"good \\" movies. STIR is just o.k.; good. Nothing special, nothingnew, very predictable... BUT it isn't bad either. It has good acting, decent but well known, used story and it shot, directed well. I rented the DVD, but STIR is a movie you can wait to see on HBO or Showtime. You can save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest move I have ever seen","review":"I'm never watching it again, I was so scared. I should have rented it, then I could have returned it! Whew! Do not watch this alone! If you scare easily this movie is not for you, unfortunately I had no idea what it was about. Acting is terrific and cinematography is very realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie","review":"This was a really good scary movie. I Liked how it was very simple, without an huge buget, and yet they still pulled of a great story. There really never was a dull moment. The creepyness just starts right from the get go, and keeps you intrested up untill the end. If you need a break from all those slasher movies which worry more about the overly elaborate chase secnes, and would perfer a movie thats mysterious, creepy, and keeps you on the edge of your seat biting your fingernails, then Stir of Echoes is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as \\"Sixth Sense\\" --- but still very good!","review":"I was told by a friend that this movie was just as good as \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" so I rented it. It wasn't, but that doesn't mean it's not a good film! Some parts were excellent! Like \\"Sixth Sense\\" you've got a little kid who can see dead people, but this little kid isn't scared. His dad, on the other hand (played by Kevin Bacon) also acquires this ability --- by accident, after being hypnotized by his sister-in-law, who tells him under hynosis to keep \\"an open mind,\\" not realizing that this inadvertently OPENS HIS MIND in a way neither of them expected! There are some truly scary scenes in this one, like when the babysitter downstairs is listening to the sleeping little kid on the baby-monitor, and she hears him wake up and start whispering to an unknown somebody upstairs in his room! And there were several more scenes just as chilling! This isn't a slasher film, but it's scary none-the-less!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A View for a THRILL- pun intended","review":"Yes, I'm a nerd and here's my bad ass review:Clever references to: The Exorist, Night of the Living Dead, DAWN of the Living Dead, Amityville Horror, The Shining, Poltergeist- and every other older Generations X-'ers Killer Nightmare Flick.Added bonus? Kevin Bacon is so spectacularly yummy.All of the elements are there: horror, drama, humor- it got so scary at a point that I had to turn it off, but again, I'm a nerdy loser.HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND. HOLLA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sixth Sence's Middle Class Brother.","review":"Face it people, this was a little too close, a little too soon..... Wake up, people are obviously gonna compare the two. Sure, it's unfair, but thats life.It really is quite a good movie, though. Like the sixth sence, if you have any belief in the supernatural, you will walk away with a little more belief.The Acting is great, the film is tense and the last scene before the credits is one of the most haunting scenes you'll ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Digging Suspense Thriller","review":"This movie was touted because it just happened to be released in the same year as another paranormal nailbiter. You know what it is, Sixth Sense. I can assure you this movie stands on its own. It is the type of movie that keeps you thinking \\"what the hell is going on?\\". It is a great story with great acting. The ghost being shot at six frames per second was an excellent touch to give you something creepy that wasn't cheesey looking. This movie does not fall victim to the same syndrome as last years Armagedon and Deep Impact. Where one was worth the price of admission and one wasn't. This movie is definitely a good aquisition to any DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOUR MIND IS AN OPEN DOOR","review":"I found this Blu-ray in the Walmart $5.00 bin. 5 year old Jake (Zachary David Cope) has \\"the shining\\" as a phrase one might borrow from another film. In this one he has \\"the eye.\\" At a party his skeptical dad, Tom (Kevin Bacon) is hypnotized by his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) and acquires the gift. Together they see and and talk to a ghost that mom (Kathryn Erbe) doesn't see.The film builds character and the plot nicely. By the subway scene, I couldn't help about thinking about how much this movie reminded me of something Steven King might do. Bacon starts out as a rather non-convincing blue collar worker, but later when the weird starts, he fits the role perfectly. A good supernatural thriller mystery, one that drops clues. A little on the cliche side, but I didn't mind as it was done well.Parental guide: F-bomb, brief sex and nudity (Kathryn Erbe)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise.","review":"This is yet another movie I'm just getting around to seeing now.And my impressions?The good.Excellent performances from the entire cast.Direction, pacing, casting, score etc... were all done perfectly.The bad.Nothing really.Some people may be turned off by the slow burner approach the filmmaker took but I loved it.A classy ghost story in the vein of \\"The Others\\".People looking an action/slasher movie best look elsewhere.Let's sum it up.Awesome performance from Bacon.A classy and for the most part gore free ghost story.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolby Surround 5.1 at it's best","review":"This is an awesome DVD, ultimate sound quality. I started watching this movie at 9:00pm in a dark room with only candle lights hermetically sealed with my surround sound speakers. 20 minutes into the movie, I thought about stopping and watching it during the day. The sound effects with 5.1 gives you an eerie feeling. Scary. It is the best sound I ever experienced with a DVD movie.Oh, about the movie, read the other 29 reviews, but I thought it was an extremely well made movie that kept you on edge for the 95 minutes it lasted. Buy and enjoy this one, it is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A viewer","review":"O.K., I've tried to write this review 4 times and each one sounds more pretentious then the last. Bottom line - this is a good movie. 'Stir of Echoes' sets the mood quickly. In my case, uneasiness and in my wifes case, a sense of dread. The movie depicts an apparently normal blue collar family whose son talks to a dead girl. Dad (Bacon), after being hynotized at a party, starts having strange and horrible visions; he also starts seeing the ghost of the same dead girl in his living room; a ghost that wants something. 'Stir of Echoes' deserves to stand on it's own and not be compared to 'The Sixth Sense.' I personally think 'Stir' is better. If you failed to see this movie because you thought it was a \\"Sixth Sense' rip-off, do yourself a BIG favor and SEE IT. It is well worth the investment of your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Film Adaption of a Good Book","review":"Read the book! it is shame that the novel is listed as only a \\"basis\\" for the film. (Elsie the seductive neighbor, the surprise \\"twist\\" at the end, Anne's struggle as a wife to understand Tom's condition-all left out. Why?) I think if they used more of the novel's elements the movie would have done better in light of the blockbuster \\"Sixth Sense\\" The acting is good, a few suspenful elements in the film, but Bacon' plays Tom Wallace as a ignorant blue collored worker that doesn't really tap the author's character in the book. I'm glad I rented it, but angry at the hatchet job Hollywood perform on a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moral ending!","review":"This movie is a older one, but is loaded with many different directives. It is a must see. I advice the mature \\"movie watcher\\" to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a great movie","review":"I must say I was surprised when I read the book after seeing the movie. I think the movie is just better, as a whole work of its own, than the book. It maintains a better sense of creepiness, and makes a little more sense. The characters are developed a little more, and in my opinion they act more realistically. Especially the wife character, as you get to see much more of her reaction to her husband's unravelling due to his visions. This movie has two of the scenes that truly scared me, the first being when Tom first sees the ghost, and the second being the series of shots where the ghost \\"plays\\" with Tom's wife and child. My Japanese girlfriend could understand this movie with only a very basic grasp of English, which is always a plus. A good afternoon popcorn movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"A poor man's Sixth Sense. I generally like Kevin Bacon but he's a little over the top with the Chicago working stiff act in this one. It doesn't help that the story's predictable and not particularly engaging (nor particularly scary). The Blu-Ray transfer seemed fine to me, but the video that plays in the menu background gives away key plot points, which is not cool at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOORRRIIIINNNGGG","review":"To start it off, let me say I'm a huge ghost story fan, a huge Kevin Bacon fan, and an even bigger Richard Matheson fan. Logically, the three of these together should be awesome. In actually, it turned out to be a feature length episode of Ghost Whisperer. Incredibley typical plot, annoying and illogical plot twists at the end, and a total of 3 minutes of screentime for the scary ghost. Who taught these people how to make movies? I only gave it two stars because, as I said, the ghost was pretty creepy. But don't try to solve the mystery along with the our hunky lead, because the answer comes out of left field. Total Dissapoinment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"I rented this DVD after catching the beginning of this movie on TV. Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe are a realistic couple - not overly attractive, they live in a gritty Chicago neighborhood and they like to party. During one party Kevin Bacon is hypnotized by his sister-in-law (played divinely by Illeana Douglas) and he starts seeing strange things. Quite convinced he is freaking out, he is haunted by the disturbing visions, until he finally embraces them and the pieces of the puzzle fall together and a neighborhood murder is solved. During the course of the film, it is also discovered his son has the gift.This movie's best point is that it is scary without being gross-out gory, but the ending is kind of weird. The special features are decent enough and it holds up for repeated viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much appreciated collection .","review":"Never owned the VHS version but always had those memories of the MTV videos of the past. No hesitation in purchasing the new DVD Anthology, especially in the expanded version. Also really wanted to experience the 5.1 Dolby Digital upgrade with this offering. The 5.1 is truely an upgrade sonically ! Don't put off getting that DVD machine any longer. Is great cruising through the old videos, and also seeing old concert footage --Thunderroad, both versions of Born to Run, Tunnel of Love tour footage, etc. Add the 2nd disc to the picture --brought up to the Reunion , and it nicely covers the span. A very satisfying product I must say. It assuredly is a 'must have' for the Springsteen enthusiast, collector, fan, believer. Would also highly recommend the other recent release \\"Blood Brothers\\" . And here's hoping for an additional treat with the possible release of a Reunion Tour DVD ."},{"rating":"1","title":"An audio injustice","review":"I agree with the previous comments about the technical quality of this DVD. Compared to the Eagles \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" DTS DVD, the producers should be ashamed of this effort. It pales in comparison to other remastered material, like the Talking Heads \\"Stop Making Sense\\". Although a great selection of material by the Boss (perhaps a bit heavier on the 90's material than I'd prefer), the surround sound audio track if absolutely awful and I refuse to even play it anymore -- the standard PCM audio simulated into surround sound is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but pretty darn good","review":"Some good points made in previous reviews on the missed potential for including additional stuff (commentary, other performances, etc.)in this 2 DVD set, but it is very nice to have all the videos in this format for long time fans and newbies alike. Comments on the quality of the surround sound may be a bit overstated and compares apples to oranges when comparing it to the Eagles Hell Freezes Over DVD (that show was miked and recorded with digital sound in mind). Knowing how much Bruce cares about the products he produces, I'm sure the audio engineers did the best they could considering the wide variety of analog source material. If you have a decent home theater setup that includes an A/V receiver with a variety of DSP (Digital Sound Processing) modes, you will find one that that sounds fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically disappointing","review":"Although Springsteen fans doubtless won't care, this DVD was a big disappointment from a technical standpoint. The video is not especially sharp and suffers from many problems of live concert footage such as poor camera angles and lighting. Be aware also that this DVD is not in widescreen format. Likewise the sound quality was not up to my expectations - the surround sound aspect was limited and the clarity of the recording was far below any studio albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Disc is Weak","review":"The only reason I gave it two stars is because I need to feel I didn't totally waste $24.00. I am a huge Bruce fan but this is the worst of Bruce. The acting videos are campy, the live videos are good. The acoustic Born in the USA is about the worst!!!! It is so pretentious, this is BAD blues at best. Also there is no DVD extras at all, no commentary, no interviews...nothing. This DVD is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecompasses the Best of Springsteen","review":"This chonological colection of Springsteen's work is great for any Springsteen fan. The 2 DVD set is essentially his greatest hits in video form. A lot of these videos are live performances and show how great Bruce Springsteen is as a live performer. Bruce Springsteen truly is The Boss, and this video collection adds to the legacy. Highlights of the DVD include a rivoting live performance of War, found on the bos set, and a rare version of Fire, a song he wrote for the Pointer Sisters. This also shows some of the later work, including Secret Garden from Jerry Maguire, and Murder Incorporated from his greatest hits album. 4 out of 5 because of Weak representation form the pre-BITUSA era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the concert dvd instead","review":"New Springsteen fans may enjoy this anthology, but I was disappointed.The concert dvds are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Tell Me A Concert DVD Of The Reunion Tour Is Coming","review":"I am a huge Bruce fan, but found this DVD extremely disappointing.

My father-in-law can read engineering manuals that are boring as can be, and he can retain the info. This tape/cd is USELESS for providing hints at how to tackle stuff like that.

Recently I got the CD as part of the on-going LP to CD replacement program and now think it almost defines rock music of the era. Joe Walsh is good as electric guitarist, accoustic guitarist, organ player and song writer and Dale Peters (bass) and Jim Fox (drums) are pretty good too. The first six tracks work as solid, well constructed and well executed pieces. Lost Woman tends to degenerate into the self indulgant soloing that was typical of concerts of the time (it was almost obligatory for the drummer and bassist to take lengthy solos) but it's pretty good overall. Recommended to the rock connoisseur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and needs some remastering work bad!","review":"Joe Walsh cut three great CDs with his hometown (Cleveland) band, the James Gang: Yer Album, Rides Again, and Thirds. All three are great. I don't know why this sloppy live album was released unless it was to meet some contractual obligation following Joe's departure from the band. The album (yes, I had it on vinyl years ago) sounded horrible and was brief at 40-odd minutes, since most bands were releasing double live albums. Some of the James Gang's best songs are missing from this, and the audio, well, the digital age hasn't helped it. Joe, get in the studio, find some more source tapes and expand this to fill a full CD (or two!) and then have someone clean up the audio. THEN, this will be a CD worth owning.

In its own way, just as whacky as the recent Pitt/Jolie vehicle. But the similarities end there. Hitchcock's version is basically silly and not especially funny (he may have been a master of suspense, but not comedy), and headlines a slightly chubby Carol Lombard (Hitchcock's landlord who urged him to make the film--apparently against his better judgment). Robert Montgomery (not the Director's first choice) is the less-than-better half who seems over his acting head most of the time (especially compared to screwball-comedy veteran Lombard's performance).Outdoor soundstage sets look just plain phony while indoor sets look just plain cheap (and phony).

Instead of comparing it to \\"Rear Window\\" or \\"Vertigo\\", just enjoy it as it is: a great romantic comedy with some genuinely funny moments in it! The scene where Mr. Smith is in the restaurant trying to make his nose bleed is hilarious, and there are other parts that make it equally fun. If you want a great movie for an afternoon, this is it...if you want to compare it to Hitch's other works, then it's still good but not in his top ten. The direction is there, the characters are good, the situations are funny at times...what more do you need?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was William Tracy?","review":"Hitchcock was right to stick with thrillers and suspense. This \\"comedy\\" offered no laughs and completely underutilized the talents of William Tracy.

Despite the tedious plot, tired acting, and predictable outcomes, I hung in there thinking we'd see more of Tracy, whose best role was in TheShop Around the Corneras Pepe Katona. Tracy was conspicuous by his absence, which may have been accentuated by the lack of engagement by the other actors.

The remastering job, however, was terrible. It wasn't compressed to a fare-thee-well as some reissues are, but *something* made it sound harsh and wearying. I know the LP didn't sound like that.

This is the first Airplane album with Grace Slick on board. It is drenched in psychedelia and drug influences. Slick brought with her from The Great Society, both Somebody to love and White Rabbit. the latter is loaded with drug references and vivid imagery.

It always seemed to me that the Airplane stayed in music so long to make political statements, which bothered me. Sort of like Country Joe and the Fish, now that I think about it. They were both good, though. Every track is a classic, not to be missed. RCA does need to re-release this, with extra tracks.

When you read Eudora Welty, you get distinct pictures of humans and what it is they do and think and feel during their days. Porter does it, too. She doesn't go for hard contrasts like Flannery O'Connor, but has a simple workmens' ethic to her language. (John Gardner is recalled by this.)

It's perfectly serviceable and is quite attractive but the wood is clearly of the cheapest quality and shows signs of splintering and wearing upon arrival. For example, the notches for adjusting the head of the lounge do not work smoothly and you need to give it a hand so to speak to help it settle into position.

Of course, getting into the tight spots with all of those slats will prove to be a challenge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splinters, anyone?","review":"This is a nice looking lounge, quite comfortable, and the slide-out side table is very convenient. However, the surface of each piece is very rough and can give you a splinter or two while assembling it or lifting the piece to move it.

Yes, he does leak if they have been on all night, but no more than the Huggies he wore when we ran out of the SG for a few days. They seem very comfortable and fit him very well. I am giving them 4 stars because they do leak sometimes, but honestly, it's totally worth the extra diaper change knowing that I'm protecting my child in whatever ways I can from toxic chemicals.I am a firm believer that parents must educate themselves on what to put in and on their children's bodies.

The velcro on the new design sometimes chafes my crawling baby's belly, but if you position it carefully and check it if your baby seems uncomfortable, you should be OK. Your grocery store brand diaper is going to live in a landfill for upwards of 500 years, meaning Henry VIII's Pampers would still be around if he'd worn them! So I figure that while 7th Generation diapers aren't perfect, almost anything is better than knowing your baby is stinking up a landfill for centuries after he's left this earth. Personally, I love using cloth diapers (they've lasted through 3 children-what a bargain!), but my husband doesn't feel the love so much. So for times when Dad's in charge, I keep a stock of 7th Generations on hand. Who am I to press the issue if he's willing to change diapers?:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!","review":"I have used these on my 4 1/2 month old at night since he was first born (I use cloth during the day) & have always been very happy with them - until I purchased the \\"new & improved\\" fit - they may be slimmer & smaller but there are nowhere near as absorbent as the previous model. I stupidly bought a case of four - & now I'm stuck with diapers that just don't work for my son! I am going to try to get my money back for these - don't waste yours on them!!I have switched to the Tender Care brand & they seem to work very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute horror","review":"We've been using 7th generation diapers for our daughter Alex since the day she was born. Old design is hands down much MUCH much better than the new one. The wider tabs leave horrible red marks on Alex's thighs, the tabs are too wide, the stretchy closure does nothing really. A have to agree they are less bulky, but I don't think it added to the comfort of my baby. She doesn't like diaper changes anymore, and before we started using the new design she really didn't mind them. Now, the size... new stage 2 is easily comparable in size to old S. I have put the two together, and they were practically identical. I put the old M to the stage 2 diaper, and it much MUCH bigger, and the fit is better as well. To those who are looking to try - find the old design and check it out first. SEVENTH GEN - please, bring the old design back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Size seems off...","review":"We have recently switched to seventh generation from ordinary diaper and have found that the size 5 diapers seem to be more like size 4 in standard diapers. Am considering trying the size 6 diapers to test theory. Have had a bit more leaks, but nothing that would make us use a different diaper. Basically a good product and one you can feel good about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just as Great as everyone said they'd be!","review":"A diaper is a diaper, or so I thought. These diapers were Great quality and just seemed overall more durable than the Huggies I had been using. After buying them on Amazon I did a price comparison and the price is really the same, all but a couple cents depending on if I used a Huggies coupon or not. If someone has recommended these diapers to you because your baby has a medical reason to need them, BUY THEM!! But if you're just doing it because of the whole organic, natural thing... you might want to reconsider. My daughter had diaper rash all the time, and these diapers were pretty much the same as Huggies and Pampers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy bigger size than indicated","review":"We've been using seventh generation diapers for a while (son is now 14 months). Overall, they're pretty good, but probably not quite as good as regular diapers. A few extra leaks. But they do a pretty good job and they make me feel so much better than regular diapers (I just couldn't do cloth). I would recommend buying a bigger size than indicated. We had to switch to size 4 when my son was only 20lbs, even though size 3 claims to be good up until 27 lbs or something like that. Also, I like the fact that they don't have cartoon characters on them, but it would be useful to have the size printed on them. We left diapers at grandparents' houses, in the car, in various diaper bags, etc. and it's hard to know which size they are and whether they still fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory...","review":"PROS:- Environmentally friendly- AffordableCONS:- Gap where front and back of diaper meets allows blowouts at the sides and around the legs (I'm doing 3x as much laundry since switching to these).- Adhesive tabs irritate baby (she fusses every time I put one on her, and she has red marks above her legs where the tabs touch her skin)- Absorbent layer works great on pee, but not so great on poop (which tends to just slide around inside the diaper and make a mess - that is, what poop doesn't blow out the leg openings)I love the idea of biodegradable, environmentally friendly diapers, and I think Seventh Generation is *this* close to having a great product. But they need to address the design of their diaper (adding some waterproof tabs at the top of the leg openings, improving poop handling, and softening the adhesive tabs) before I'll become a convert.For now, it's back to Pampers Swaddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good transition from swaddlers","review":"Perhaps it's because we're going from the very effective Pampers Swaddlers, but we've found that these leak horribly. They are not especially roomy so it may be that we're between sizes and that has something to do with it - but for now we won't be using these anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Diapers Leak all over... get ready to change clothes","review":"I am a daycare provider taking care of 9 children a day so we change lots of diapers. I wanted to find the best diapers for the kids so I gave these a try.Nice idea, but they don't work. We rarely ever have leaks in other brands, but with 7th Generation diapers there are leaks daily. If they have poop, chances are that the diaper is going to leak and you'll find big wet spots on the kids clothes. They are really bad for runny infant poops.I had them on auto ship, but canceled it after a parent picked up her child and they were wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Batch","review":"It so happened that so far two separate packages were defective and were not functional. I have been using this product since the birth of my grandchild almost a year ago and so I take it that this lot was just a bad batch and will continue to use the product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diapers","review":"We've been using these for about a year now. My daughter never gets diaper rash. And, they hardly ever leak (maybe 3x in 1 year). They even hold through an entire night. I would recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seventh Generation Diapers","review":"I have always been a Pampers devoted mommy until I used these diapers. Not only are they better for your baby's skin, but they are soft and don't leak. I tell all of my friends about these diapers and other products that Seventh Generation makes. Their diaper wipes are also great. Just give them a try. They ship really fast also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Eco-Friendly Diapers","review":"I have used these diapers since my baby was about one month old. He is six months old now, and I was using them in addition to our local cloth diaper service. These eco-friendly diapers are great at locking in urine, but aren't the best at keeping in stools. The stools tend to shoot up the back of the diaper. I'm baby potty training our son now, and he seems to prefer doing his stool business on the potty. I would recommend any parent to start baby potty training as soon as your child has head control (sitting up on their own is not a requirement, but can be helpful). This can help reduce the use of disposable diapers and help the make the potty training transition natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Machine","review":"These diapers may not be the cutest, but who wants their baby wearing attractive undies yet, anyway? I can rely on these as an overnight diaper for my 7 month old without worrying that we'll have leak-out issues, the moisture is efficiently wicked away from baby's skin (preventing moisture rashes and irritation), and they are unbleached and more environmentally friendly than most other brands of throw-away diapers. Diapers are used up so quickly that it's a good idea to order a case at a time online (it's cheaper, and less emergency runs to the market when you see that your diaper bag is empty), unless you're baby is close to changing sizes.As with most other diapers, don't trust that if your baby fits the size description on the bag--for example, although a baby may only weigh 17 lbs, he/she may not fit stage 3 diapers and needs stage 4 diapers (which are indicated for babies 22-37 lbs). It's all about the circumference of the baby thighs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Baby doesn't get a rash with these diapers, plus no chemicals or fragrance. No product branding. Less leakage than any other diaper we tried. He'll actually go a whole day without needing an outfit change (we used to change his clothes 3-4x per day with other diapers). The only small thing is the color is a little odd when you're used to seeing white diapers all your life. You get used to this (the color matches our beige furniture)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a working mother who needs disposable diapers I was thrilled to find what looked like a promising replacement for other brand name diapers. BUT, every diaper has leaked. The result has been increases in laundry. So the savings to the earth from lack of bleache go away with the increased water consumption. not to mention the messes on my clothes when I pick my son up with a leak. I won't be buying these again.Cause of leaks- the absorption material doesn't have all the coverage of my usual brand- Huggies. Back to Huggies I go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful diapers","review":"These diapers are great. I have tried many different brands and these are just as absorbent and well-fitted. Wonderful quality and the Amazon price can't be beat. Chlorine free is the way to go. Who wants to take a chance when it comes to the health of your baby? Not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Diapers and doing my bit for the earth too.....","review":"I love the 7th generation products in general but with the amount of diapers kids go through it's a lot of chemicals etc going into the earth (and being rubbed against your child). When you buy these on subscribe and save the extra discount takes them down to being cheaper than some regular diapers too.....Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit, no blowouts!","review":"We're going through our third case of 7thGen diapers and am completely satisfied with our selection. The diapers run small, so definitely order the next larger size even if you think you are SURE the smaller size will fit. Even at 15 pounds our son needed size 3's. Never had a blowout, but we have had infrequent leaks, which is expected with little boys! Over all, well pleased with the diapers and will continue using them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Diapers","review":"We use these diapers on our newborn. They absorb better than Pampers and don't seem to leak nearly as often as any other brand. They are also priced to be comparable to the traditional brands. The best part is that they use less energy and chlorine to make than the traditional brands. Thus they are better for the environment. I highly recommend them for any baby. Even our pediatrician was impressed and indicated that they are perfect for babies with sensative skin.To quote Dr. Seuss in the Lorax, \\"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees for the trees have no tongue.\\" Uses these as a good green alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"More leaks than a New Orleans levee","review":"I bought these for my son in a smaller size when he was a newborn and they worked fine but these ones leak all over the place, they're terrible! He's 21lbs and these are supposed to work from 16 up to 28lbs, not a chance. Disappointing because I like that they are unbleached, that's the reason they got two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diapers!","review":"I must admit that I had some reservations about this purchase given that the more environmentally-sound products often don't work as well, but these diapers are great! They work just as well as standard diapers (pampers and huggies) and have really helped my daughter with her diaper rash that seemed to be caused by the chlorine in regular diapers. the fit is perfect too. If you can afford to pay a bit more, well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diapers that are safe for baby's sensitive skin","review":"These are great diapers. No harmful chlorine. And, they work great. No leaks, even overnight when super full. Fit well too. They do run a little small but I experienced that with other brands too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diapers Galore","review":"I just love Seventh Generation products! I have used them for over 13 years and since we adopted our now 16 month old son Seventh Generation diapers is all he has warn. Why do we need to have our diapers white when the Chlorine only pollutes our waters and iritates our skin. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is that the new style, with the elastic, leaves a gel residue on my son, which never occured with the older style. If they could bring back the old absorbant material my rating would definetly go up to a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch! watch out for the tabs","review":"Similar story. We used the old style, loved them. We bought cases of the new style and are very disapointed. If your child is crying and you can't figure out what's wrong, check the diapers. The closure tabs have very sharp corners that will cut babies thigh and belly. We contacted Seventh Generation and they are aware of the problem and will be releasing an updated style mid-summer. ):"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diapers are sized too small, cause leaks and diaper rash!","review":"I have these diapers in size 1 and 2. They were both too small for my average sized baby, cause major leaks. I tried the entire pack of size one and they never seemed to fit correctly and also gave my baby diaper rash. He is currently 13 pounds and the size twos look way too tiny! The tabs cut into his legs even when I try to pull the diaper up more. I do not like these diapers. If you are looking for an eco-friendly diaper, I recommend gDiapers. I will not use these diapers again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad batch--leaked everytime","review":"i usually purchase these from a store but thought maybe cheaper online. the first time i used them they leaked, i didn't think about it, but everytime they leaked. i checked them and realized the crotch area was not wide enough, the padding on the sides didn't reach to the edges. so i ended up throwing them away. what a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality diapers ...","review":"This diaper is of very poor quality. The tabs are not properly attached and hence, when you are putting on the diaper the tab comes off very often. This is annoying as I then have to toss the diaper. A waste of my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It is hard to believe that people report no leaks! I was so enthusiastic about getting these chlorine-free diapers that are environmentally friendly and better for my baby. However, I cannot wait to get this big box finished since I have to change my baby's clothes at least once a day for leaking reasons. It is very annoying since having to do more laundry does not help reduce the human impact on the planet. I am definitely going back to the P diapers that are so efficient. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seventh Generation - an excellent choice for disposable diapers","review":"I normally cloth diaper my son, but use disposables occasionally (when travelling, etc). I try to be as envir. responsible as possible and was feeling very guilty buying national brand diapers, since I know they are anything but. The materials used in Seventh Generation diapers are much more envir. friendly and they work great. Plus, no more annoying cartoon characters staring at you while changing a poopy diaper:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff overall (4,5 stars really)","review":"I gave 4 stars for couple of reasons:- sometimes diapers had glue on the inside- happen to get lopsided ones too.So Seventh Generation better take care of the quality.Good thing:- never had reaction to the diapers- looks to be comfortable"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these diapers!","review":"Seventh Generation Diapers are wonderful. I've been using them for almost a year and have only had one leak! My 14-month-old is very active and the diapers still work great. No annoying TV characters and, best of all, no chlorine!

And the Amazon subscription program is the cheapest way to get Seventh Generation diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"We have used these diapers through all of the stages on our son since birth and have not experienced any skin related problems.

However, they tend to clump up when wet, so leaks can happen without frequent changes. But frequent changes are healthier anyway. I like that they're biodegradable and scent-free. Babies R Us just started carrying them and I hope other stores follow suit, but I think the \\"subscription\\" option through Amazon is the best value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the only unbleached high quality diapers there are...","review":"Best diapers I found so far.

He wakes up soaked so we have had to switch back to Pampers for night time. The diapers do hold up to all other messes when changed frequently during the day and I don't mind the non-white color of the diaper.

In addition, the back is stretchy/elasticized and we have had no problems with poo leaks. I also like the lack of the artificial smell that comes with conventional diapers.

It was the 2T training pants. Now I can say for sure the older version holds more, and leaks a lot less. Also, becuase Diapers.com and Amazon charges tax, it's almost the same price to buy them at the grocery store, and $13+ per pack is not worth it at all. After three+ years of using these diapers, I am switching brands. Really disappointed with the new style. I would rather have the not-so-corpratized 'Trees and 1,2,3s' version over the Lorax version any day. They really sold out IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not good at all.","review":"I bought these for my son. Here is what is wrong with them:1. They don't absorb moisture property. The skin is left wet and that caused our son some problems of redness and fungus on his privates. We changed the diaper very often and it didn't help.2. They leave little gel beads on the baby's body. That's probably not how it should be and I don't think you want that stuff on the baby's skin where it's not meant to be.3. They cut the baby's skin around the hips because of rough edges. If they don't cut they leave a red mark which is unpleasant as well.4. If it's a small baby, they would leak poop all over the place.But I would say that the worst problem is the wetness. Once peed in it would be like sitting in a small puddle. Yuck.I recommend Bambo by Abena. We didn't like them when he was small because of the shape, but now they fit perfectly and we love them, they are perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small/short","review":"I found these diapers to be too small - and yes, I was using the sizing guide.

I use Fuzzy Bunz cloth diapers on my 2 year old most of the time, but I use disposables for \\"out and about\\" and for night time. Before Seventh Generation, I always bought Pampers Cruisers, which are locally made for me.The two problems with this diaper are that it's very leaky. I always have to change my son's clothes. And it rubs strangely on my son's thighs and gives him a rash.Another more \\"environmental\\" problem is when you work out how much CO2 is released in getting these to me (I can't buy them locally) as opposed to purchasing locally made Pampers, I really don't think they're much more of an environmentally friendly option.After this case is finished, we will switch back to Fuzzy Bunz with Pampers alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the extra time pretreating all of my sons laundry","review":"I purchased these diapers hoping that I would make less of an environmental impact with disposable diapers.

Despite the fact that he is at the lower end of the weight range, they were too small. I wont purchase these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks every time","review":"I really wanted these diapers to work. I've been using the Kirkland diapers and these are not much more expensive and so much better for baby and the environment; but if I have to change baby's cloths every time I change diapers, then it's not better for either. I was really careful to be sure I had them on as good as possible, but no matter what I did, they leaked. I have problems with the Kirkland diapers at night some times, getting him wet, but never during the day and NEVER poop, like I had with these. Maybe they'd be better for girls, or very slender babies, I don't know, but for my boy, they just do not work at all. If you want to try them, I suggest signing up for the auto ship so you can get the best price, but schedule your next shipment for several months down the line, you can always change the ship times if you like the diapers and it gives you time to cancel if they don't work out for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jello grains escape from a diaper and glue to a baby","review":"First bought a couple of Seventh Generation diapers at a local Whole Foods store.

More leakages with poop falling out from fresh diapers - resulting in usage of carpet cleaners, paper towels etc., which in turn results in more garbage and harsher chemicals in the Environment3. Poor Quality Diapers - while it is OK to have a small percentage of defects, we found more defective diapers in one shipment of these diapers than what we have come across in about 10 shipments of Huggies/Pampers - yes this results in more Landfill waste as well - not to mention the wastage of other resourcesTo summarize, here is a company that plays the \\"Green\\" card very effectively.

They certainly aren't falling off or anything and most of the time they are covered by pants so what's the big deal?I do like that there is no branded characters on the diapers (i.e. Winnie, Mickey, etc). The brown color reminds me of paper napkins.They are a little pricier but are supposed to be better for the environment. And as we all know \\"Green\\" is the new \\"Black\\"! I am pretty sure Al Gore invented them after he invented the internet but just before he invented hybrid cars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out for the tabs, ouch!","review":"Similar story. We used the old style, loved them. We bought cases of the new style and are very disapointed. If your child is crying and you can't figure out what's wrong, check the diapers. The closure tabs have very sharp corners that will cut babies thigh and belly. We contacted Seventh Generation and they are aware of the problem and will be releasing an updated style mid-summer. ):"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diapers that walk","review":"I have received these diapers before and there great but this time someone must have seen a large amazon box on my door step and decided to take them. It would be nice if we could have signed for them like other packages that I have received from amazon. Do like the ease of ordering online and delivery but will probably now just buy at the store to avoid having packages walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever..","review":"I thought I'd try them because them seemed like a smart choice...now my son's bottom is paying the price. He never had a rash before compared to this, a painful swollen red area... poor guy!Beware, not all babies react the same, if your current choice is working, don't fix it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not any more expensive, but better for the environment and Baby!","review":"Yes, these are shockingly \\"bare\\" looking, and you might get the impression that they don't work as well as Pampers or Huggies, but yes, yes they do! I just wish that I had changed over sooner. I challenge you to take a deep smell of your regular diaper and then smell one of these - no chemical smell at all. And you might think that since they are environmentally friendly they might be more expensive, but they aren't when you order through Amazon. I've encouraged all new moms to switch to these and take one more step to help improve our environment and provide safer choices for our babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"sub-standard performance!","review":"I really had high hopes for these diapers. I bought them based on other reviews. I wanted to originally start using cloth diapers to be environmentally friendly but my little one poops and pee's so often at 8 weeks that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the laundry. I decided that these diapers would be the best of both worlds- environmentally friendly and disposible. To my dismay, 10 out of 14 diapers leaked both poop and pee. My baby sleeps with me on his own little pad and his pee leaked through the diaper, through the pad and onto my mattress. I tried folding the top in to catch excess, I made sure the elastic bits were properly positioned, and I made them tighter and nothing worked. I'm super bummed that I have to go back to pampers until I find another alternative. Maybe my baby is just made differently than those who rave about this product. I gave 2 stars because I liked the color and materials used."},{"rating":"1","title":"major leakage problems with size 3","review":"I have used seventh generation diapers since my baby was born- in size 1 and size 2, and they were great. I love that they are unscented and have no icky chemicals. However, once my daughter grew into size 3, we began having MASSIVE leakage problems. Not once or twice, but atleast 10 times- I'm talking poo running down her legs. It wasn't even as though there was a lot of it- I was in denial at first thinking \\"maybe I'm just putting these on wrong?!\\" but really, how many ways can you put on a diaper? I'm so sad that these leak so badly, I feel like I have to choice but to switch brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointed","review":"I really was glad I decided to switch to these diapers and I was hopeful that they would work well for us as they had many positive reviews. Unfortunately they do not work well at all. Nearly every time we use them they leak. Normally we use cloth at home, but when we travel and at day care we use these. They leak almost every time unless you change the diaper every hour or hour and a half. What a shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...but beware of product defects","review":"One of the best diapers out there...and Amazon has a brilliant deal on these with their subscription service. HOWEVER, we've come across diapers with tabs that don't adhere completely and have had to toss about half a package of the defective ones. They are great when they work: no diaper rash on the kid, seems to hold up well under activity, and they do a great job soaking up the pee/poo. It's not entirely earth-friendly given that they do eventually end up in the landfills (same as the Pampers and the Huggies) but being chlorine-free does mean a little less pollution overall.Update: Amazon customer service rocks! I called about the defective diapers and they are sending me replacements, gratis. Let's hope that these tabs aren't a commonplace manufacturing defect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good diaper","review":"I love this diaper cuz is fragrance free,very natural. Good for baby's skin. Now I switched to this diaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so green","review":"I picked up a pack of these diapers at my local coop and loved the cloth-like feel and the fact that they were more environmentally friendly. When I saw them on Amazon I stocked up. However my experience with these was totally different. They feel cheaper (more plastic) and the velcro kept falling off the tabs. Out of the 192 diapers I received, at least 25 were useless. I even tried to tape some closed. I still haven't heard from the company about this issue, so I won't ever buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're using sposies","review":"We usually use cloth diapers, but when we needed disposables because of childcare issues, these made everyone happy.

Then we found this new \\"fit\\" which have been worked for our little one for a while. But now here we go again, this couldnt be so good to be truth.. the sharp endings are so annoying that I dont know what to do.. I have a bunch of diapers yet, but I'm planning to move back to Teddy's again. We'll wait until they fix that problem then, and my suggestion is that you wait for that improvement too. This diapers are really well worth it to wait a little bit and give them a third chance.Good Luck[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old style WAS better","review":"The old style diapers were the first we tried where our daughter would not rash. I agree the old style was better. I don't know why they changed. My daughter just leaks through these new ones. The old ones actually held liquid.

They're flexible and don't impair his ability to crawl, walk or climb over under and around the furniture!The simplicity of the Seventh Generation Diapers is what has kept my baby (and me) happy. I love that there's no prints, no advertising (Sesame Street/Dora etc on your diapers DOESN'T make you want to buy matching clothes and toys??)."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good, but...","review":"Other diapers we tried, pampers or hugguies, were leaking often times to my son. So, we tried this one and it never leaked. The only problem is it doesn't have good air flow, so we're considering to go back to pampers just for summer time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely bad quality control. Falling apart out of the package.","review":"Yes the product would have been nice if there were some sort of quality control. The diapers are soft and absorbent, adequate size, seems comfortable. The only problem is the defect rate is very high. You would expect 1 or 2 at most out of a 140 PAMPERS bag to be defective. But this is 10~15 times over that. The excessive glue on the diapers requires you to rip it apart to open the diaper. It is less of a problem compared to the falling Velcro strips. I once has 7 diapers in a row with the Velcro strip gone. It is quite frustrating when you are holding the baby's legs with your one hand at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It!","review":"Yes, I really like this diaper. It covers her well and though she sometimes wakes from a long night's sleep with a little leakage, the major brands leak sometimes, too.

Better for the earth, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good diapers.","review":"These are excellent diapers and I love the company so I'm happy to promote their business.

They must fit her well as she's never tried to take them off (and she's been capable of it for the last 5 months), never gotten diaper rash, and she's NEVER had a blow out. They cost a few cents more per diaper than the leading brands, but we try to make up for that by buying only used clothing, gear, and book/toys for our daughter. We've tried cloth diapers (diaper rash), G-diapers (messy if poop wasn't hard), swaddlers (skin crease), and snug and dry (skin crease). Seventh Generation diapers have been great diapers for our daughter and they're worth at least trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and Easy buying through Amazon","review":"We have always used seventh generation diapers on our son and love the fit and chlorine free diapers.

The \\"natural\\" color surprised me when I first opened the package, but now I think it's cute! These diapers do the job of holding in leaks (as long as it's fastened correctly -- I learned the hard way once) and keeps baby's bottom dry. The tabs are nice and stretchy and I can see it adjusting nicely as my baby grows. I've been using them on my baby boy since 1 week old and he's only had one slight case of diaper rash (but that disappeared immediately after I tried some diaper cream and hasn't come back since). Also, these diapers don't have any perfumey scent which is nice! Amazon provides these diapers at a great value too, so I order in bulk with Subscribe and Save. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite diapers","review":"These are my favorite disposable diapers. They are a medium tan, which draws comments such as \\"So what's with the brown diapers?!\\" or \\"You must be pretty green.\\" So either be prepared to ignore or address such comments, or make sure you can keep the diaper covered with clothes (which I don't).They are free of chlorine, latex and fragrance. They are hypo-allergenic too. They are hard to find in stores, even health food stores, so it is wonderful to be able to buy them in quantity on Amazon. They are as absorbent or even more so, than any mainstream diaper I've used when I was out of my favorite diaper.Seventh Generation has a whole line of products that I just love includingSeventh Gen Baby Wipes Tub.They have a complete satisfaction quarantee, so if you don't like their product there is a phone number, and website where you can return it for a full refund with a receipt and proof of purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"We've used 7th Gen diapers since our son was about 4 months old - when a friend handed us the end of a size 1 package.

Most of the time they don't leak, but every diaper I have bought (even Huggies overnights) leak on occasion. The only issue with these diapers is that they run a little small.

Definitely give this one a try if you are looking for a less toxic diaper. :+)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabs Dig Into Legs","review":"I so wanted to like this diaper. It had so much going for it on the surface- good for baby (gentle product on skin) good for the environment (chlorine-free). However, the tabs are really quite large and dig into my baby's legs. I've tried other sizes, still no luck. I do hope Seventth Gen. will come up with a better design, as I've seen we aren't the only ones who have experienced this problem. Until then, back to Pampers."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT LEAKS, wouldn't recommend it","review":"If someone pays me to use it, I wouldn't use itWe've never experienced so many leaks....

Pampers cruisers leave a gel on my daughter so we went with these. I have used them for several months. Very similiar in size to cruisers size 3.

We moved on to STAGE 2 when our son got bigger and they were a disaster. They leaked every time. Day and night. Not just a little. He was soaking wet each time. We switched to another brand and had no issues. More recently, we wanted to give these another shot and purchased the STAGE 3 diapers. Unfortuneately same results as STAGE 2. They leaked each time. We have a large amount of unused STAGE 2 and STAGE 3 diapers left. They are useless. I really wanted these to work. These seem to work for a lot of people; however there are a few reviewers who had the same results as we did.

The description on the back sounded interesting enough. Ex-FBI Agent Alex Rourke gets called down to his New England hometown to help the local sherrif with a puzzling murder case. Unfortunately, the author writes his book by the rules, sticking to a predictable plot carried out by one-dimensional characters. None of the so-called plot twists are surprising, and the outcome of the novel becomes clear about half-way through.It has to be said that the writing is decent and made the book an enjoyable read despite all its shortcomings. If Rickards works on his characterization and plotline, he might yet write a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for a gift !!","review":"these mini song books make the perfect gift for any season!.....was highly appreciated by all who recieved it as a gift from me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dello Joio is awesome","review":"I had never heard \\"Scenes from the Louvre\\" before, and it was quite a pleasant surprise.Dello Joio's music isn't that common, or maybe better to say not commonly found... so when a new work pops up I usually try to at least audition it.

And, having read and seen many American plays, it is. I recommend this to all with one caveat. Don't expect the night's end to bring a happy ending. Depression is a more likely reaction. O'Neill takes you, step by step, into the family's despair. As reader you will accept and believe every word.If you aren't aware, the play is largely autobiographical with each member of the Tyrones representing a member of the O'Neills. Each of the characters are representative of their real-life counterparts.Be prepared for an unusual amount of stage directions. Little is left for the director, set designer and the actors. All is spelled out. But how the actors make use of the instructions can make a performance, individually or overall, range from good to magnificent.On a slightly different note my favorite O'Neill and American play is \\"The Iceman Cometh\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Dull Read","review":"Wow, what a depressing and dull read. I cannot imagine what it would have been like to actually sit there and watch this on a stage. I appreciate the style O'Neill brought with him when it came to details. That was really unusual and interesting. However, none of the characters were even somewhat likable and the story was so depressing. After reading this I am much more grateful for my family. We have our problems but nothing like this. I think it is worthwhile to take a look at this play because O'Neill's style is so different, but don't be surprised if you hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a novel","review":"I was quite surprised to see the extent of stage direction the playright provides, but it does make the play \\"read\\" better than most plays do.

I'd never read any of O'Neil's works before...and had only seen a production of \\"The Ice Man Cometh.\\" This is so heart-wrenching and so simple a story. That's not \\"simple\\" in a pejorative sense at all...just that its emotions and truths are not buried under mounds of plot devices and flowery language. This play is just tragic and true.

This stage of D-Ts development shows their strong influence by Rush, early singer Charlie Dominici's vocals being only the most obvious clue. But the road they chose heads in the direction of more instrumentals and mid-size songs (7-11 minutes) rather than Rush's more radio-friendly vocal numbers with the rare huge sidelong work, even back this far.

What few people realize is that When Dream & Day Unite was their first album.This album right away shows that it's very different from the others due to the fact that James LaBrie is not the lead singer on their debut album. In my opinion this shows that the lead singer can make all the difference as musically this album is very sound and gives but a mere taste of things to come once James LaBrie takes over lead vocals.Ytse Jam stands above the rest as far as songs goes. The rest of the songs are good but none seem to stand up and be noticed. I recommend this album for die hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start For DT.","review":"Dream Theater are one of my top 10 favorite bands and they have some real masterpieces, this one's not quite a masterpiece but it's amazing besides that. Charlie Dominici is the current vocalist here, James Labrie doesn't come until '92 Images & Words, this is from '89. It's a bit more amateur than their later releases and the production's dated but the music and lyrics are still well written and they put quite a bit of effort into it considering that it's their first album. The songs aren't as structured and organized, more simple for progressive rock/metal. Still their music skills are good and decent on a technical level, WDADU is a very enjoyable album. A Fortune in Lies is absolutely amazing and it's still one of my favorite DT songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a genuine reprinting","review":"What I wanted was a modern reprint of the original.

This disc is no different. Do not be misled by the packaging that heralds the presence of Marillion's Mosely and Trewavas. They play on one song. The songs are weak, the production dated and the drums sound as if they were miked to the inside of a dustbin. Hackett's got talent but seldom is able to pull it off as a frontman. Weak songs, poor supporting musicians usually sink his recordings and did so here...Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Informer","review":"This blistering adaptation of Liam O'Flaherty's novel by John Ford features a searing, Oscar-winning performance by McLaglen, who plays the barrel-chested Irish boozer and Troubles-era traitor with gut-wrenching pathos, especially when he delivers his last line. A labor of love for Ford, outfitted with Joseph August's atmospheric evocation of foggy Dublin and a superb score by Oscar winner Max Steiner, \\"Informer\\" is the kind of full-blooded political drama we rarely get to enjoy today. And McLaglen's turn as the desperate, deeply remorseful brute makes the tragic story of betrayal and redemption even more worthy of struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Irish Republican Army takes a revenge on an informer","review":"A semi-simple Irish giant of a man turns in his best friend to send his girl friend to America in the 1930's.He is a drunkard and seems to have no idea that he has done something very wrong until the inevitable end.Ireland wants nothing to do with the British empireand has two armies: the British which is composed of men wearing Scotch hatsand the underground wearing trench coats.Even today the IRA sends terror into the hearts of otherwise tough people the world over.A very good movie for the 30's this was a way of showing people in the states that something was going on over there.A lot of blood has been shed over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankie, ya mother forgives me","review":"In his academy award performance as Gypo Nolan, Victor McLaglen portrays the life of an Irishman during the dark and dreary days of Ireland in the early 1920's.

But I love this movie. The innocense of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick make their denial of thier child's evil so believable, as their allowing of the new nanny. I love the ride Gregory Peck takes us on with the character, and how the movie has mystery, thriller, and of course horror elements. I'm astonished that this scary movie came from the director of lethal weapon, superman, and scrooged.

Considering this release does NOT appear to be remastered I don't see the point of releasing this movie again over the previous incarnation. Nearly all the bonuses are already included in the previous release. All they seem to have done is split it on two discs which is supposed to make it \\"special\\".

The Omen is especially scary due to its awesome story, great acting, spooky soundtrack, and suspense. I can't say enough good things about it. The movie is mysterious and great. It left me wishing that I was involved in mysterious events with strange priests beating down my door and other oddities conpsiring.

It's the story of a baby born to a wealthy family who ends up being the Antichrist himself, whiich is further explored in the sequels 2 and 3, but not 4. This is certainly better than the boring remake made during this decade. Well...they were trying to make it seem cool to a new generation, much like with Psycho, but failed. Only diehard Omen fans saw it and the rest laughed their cheeks off at how seriously they took themselves. Well these people obviously are not saved. This was made during a time when movies were not about making money but raising just enough for preservation societies, which this was Catholic. Go and laugh at this, go to hell. See what I care! Making fun of someone's religion isn't funny. It is high art that is not cheap to make!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Children are evil","review":"The beauty of Christian mythology is its evergreen ability to inspire fresh fare on the counter-mythology scene. The Omen is a classic story of \\"The Beginning of The End\\" as Damien (the Antichrist) is born, and proceeds to make his unsuspecting parents a living Hell. This is of course th version to see - dated as it is. The remake circa 2005/6 was absolute crap. This movie shows how easily a truly evil spawn of \\"The Devil\\" could slip into society pretty much unnoticed and protected by the bleeding heart liberals ;-) who value life over principle. (woo hoo!) What makes this movie so good is the casting. They really picked a great kid for the part. You can see it in his eyes, which speak more eloquently than is possible for a brat of the age of 8 (or in my case 43), to do. Are you still reading this? Go watch the movie! You will enjoy it infinitely more than my meandering drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Overrated","review":"Satan's son has arrived and he's not about to let his human parents get in his way. Christian horror movies tend to have overly simplistic, boring, juvenile theological foundations, and this is no exception. The hysterical priest is unintentionally comical in his over-the-top, Bellevue-esque rampages (I laughed out loud when he claimed that some dude named Bugenhagen was the only one on planet Earth who had a solution). The scoring is also surprisingly terrible. It's simply too overused, generic, abrupt, and intrusive to be enjoyable. It seemed like every single minute of running time ends with some kind of lame soundtrack getting blared in my ears in an amateurish attempt to force emotions onto me. There are a few cool death scenes, but they used too many \\"animal going psycho\\" scenarios which felt kinda lazy. Atmosphere is minimized, there's no sense of dread at any point, and the ending is unsatisfying. This is an overrated \\"classic\\" in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was disappointed with the content of this film.

I saw the remake before I saw the original, and the original is just not up to par.. The acting is laughable and very superficial sounding(probably due to age). Also, there are alot of things that happen that are unexplained in this movie. I don't know that I would have recognized them if not for seeing the remake, though. And why oh why is Ambassador Thorne in such a hurry at the end of this movie?! He wasn't being chased in the beginning!.. This movie lacks any sort of scare factor.

This is great, has two decent sequels, but the 4th one sucks. This is much better than Rosemary's Baby or The Seventh Sign.

For me the scope was too broad with too many artists featured. The timelines get layered and out of synch. And there is way too much information on the music moguls to be of much interest to anybody but music business insiders. Complex relationships are reduced to the simplist: who slept with who, egos clashing, who was doing what drugs...My biggest complaint was the redundancy: the point that money, drugs and fame corrupts gets beaten to death.. There is really not enough focus on the music..saying all that, the book was chock full information and did a decent effort to capture the LA singer song writer scene of that time. That the author felt the music was that important to write this much detail is well... indulgent..Only a hand full of the artists he tracks thru time are worth the mention today..."},{"rating":"1","title":"jumbled assortment of info, some fascinating","review":"If you're a fan of CSNY, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, Eagles you may find this an interesting read. It does not read as a narrative given from an inside view. It appears to be a montage of info collected from various interviews with the players involved and those around them. The best part is the Laurel Canyon beginnings of the singer-songwriter movement in L.A.It stops rather abruptly in the early 80s, although he occassionally makes mention of happenings in the 90s and 2000s.

It covers all the major players and some minor one you may not have heard about, but were significant influences and collaborators/co-writers (like J.D Souther). It also covers the major producers (particularly David Geffen) and their role in the whole scene. It also includes the drug excesses and sadness of those who let their addictions overcome their genius. If you are a fan of the Byrds, CSNY, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, Joni MItchell, the Eagles, Gram Parsons and all the others who were a part of this scene, you will learn things about these artists you didn't know before. The sections about David Crosby, Steven Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young - their life styles, ego clashes and tumultuous relationships - is particularly interesting.

I am also a musician and was looking forward to reading about how these artists influenced each other's music. Instead, the book was filled with ALOT about managers and record companies. It was way more focused on the business side of this time period. I also don't like the way the author portrays the artists and gives his slanted opinion of some of their music - which, by the way, I totally disagree with. I am hugely disappointed and sorry that I spent the money and time to read it.

He has one of the most fascinating topics to write about but he manages, chapter after tedious chapter, to dull the information with his writing style, trying to cover way too much territory, and I'm just glad that I found this at the local library and didn't waste any money on it.I feel that he went out of his way to take a whack at the entire 1970's southern Cali music scene, the likes of which we'll never know of again.

I cook steaks and chops on it, with great results. You could clean it after with a paper towel, it is so easy to clean (but I do use soap and water!).This pan replaced a similar one. That one had a lower handle and lower side. I liked the configuration of the older one better, but this was the closest I could find.

Initially, I put a dab of butter in for each crepe, but found that one dab at the beginning is all I need on the first crepe. They move easily around the pan. It works equally well with omelets. It also cleans up wonderfully - the brochure says to let it cool fully before washing which I found makes a big difference. Another fact I learned in the brochure was not to use PAM or similar products as they build up and create a sticky residue.

It does not stick to the pan's cooking surface, but instead peels off in big flakes.This skillet, and two other Calphalon pans that I've purchased from Amazon in the last year were made in China, and are terrible as to quality, endurance, and finish.

My first pan had two significant pits in the nonstick surface, so I returned it and received a replacement pan that had one, even larger, pit in the nonstick surface, as well. My one star is for Amazon and their excellent customer service.

The non-stick surface does not stand up to wear. Within a few uses, the coating started to come up. I made some pancakes on it this morning and have decided that it's time to retire the pan to the trash. I will be buying the Le Creuset cast iron pan. It's more cost effective to buy the more expensive pan if you don't have to throw it away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over 4 years old...","review":"Over four years old now, and still fantastic - the surface is slick, the pan attractive even after almost daily use. I handwash it with Dawn and a sponge, and the only thing that's happened to the coating is it's roughing a bit on the lip - not on the cooking surface! (I think this would actually be covered under the warranty if I looked into it). Certain things will stick to the bolt heads in the pan, so I advise either spraying them occasionally with PAM or just inspecting them after you wash. I have given this swank little pan to friends and family as a quick fry pan - though it does make fine crepes when put to the task - and everyone loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I purchased this pan because my husband and I frequently make omlets and crepes and we had been using fry pans for this purpose for years.

The heat conduction of the aluminum is superb and the non-stick coating performs very well. The only drawback of this item is that the coating does degrade over time, even using moderate temperatures and low smoke-point cooking lubricants. Watch Amazon for their periodic specials on this item, as the MSRP is high. Must be the cost of energy going into aluminum smelting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well pleased","review":"I am very pleased with my griddle/crepe pan by, Calphalon. It a very good product.

I saw this pan as I was looking to replace my Wolfgang Puck pan that started losing it's \\"non-stick\\" after 1.5 years. When I saw the list price on this I thought I should give it a try considering it's drastic price reduction. Although it did take over a week to arrive, it arrived in perfect condition and worked wonderfully this morning for omelettes. It was also a bit bigger than I expected! It's a nice heavy pan but my only complaint is the sleek metal handle is a big hard to hold onto and work with and I wish it was a bigger handle. A pan of this quality would be at least $40+ at any department store and this quality cannot be found at Wal-mart. I would recommend it both as a gift and for personal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"teflon flakes off","review":"need i say more?? the teflon coating, which is poisonous, flakes off in big chunks. i am not buying any more teflon products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the first year...","review":"Bought this two years ago and there is a significant amount of the teflon coating that has ended up in my food.

Initially it was a very good pan and I use it regularly - several times a week for eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. I have been very careful about the utensils that I use on it because I have had problems with non-stick finishes on other products in the past. However, after 3 1/2 years, the finish is flaking off all over the pan and food frequently sticks. I'm going to try and get a replacement for it at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"After 1.5 yrs of light use and despite taking great care in hand washing the pan, the coating came off in flakes.

I had other calphalon products and they are just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Pan","review":"I use this pan for more than I bought it for (which was just for frying eggs). It's heavy, so has an even distribution of heat. The shallow sides are not a detriment, and make for an easier turn over for sunny-side-ups. I try and fry meat for a family of three, but a ten inch pan is not quite large enough, so I will have to break down and buy the 12 inch version.

Honestly, I do this with all my non-stick pots and pans because I find it cheaper( cost = time, energy, and money ) to put non-stick pans in the dishwasher and just replace them every X years as needed. T-Fal is really the only company I can find that claims there pans are non-stick and dishwasher safe. I can say that although that may not be entirely true they will last and be fully non-stick for a very long time before they need to be replaced and they do have a lifetime warranty for the frugal minded. This pan didn't even make it through one or two washings, which for me really draws into question of the quality of the pan. Of course the warranty is void by putting it in the dishwasher and sadly the only use for a sticky crepe pan is to take up space in a landfill. Would someone please make a high quality, glass lid, oven safe handled, nonstick set of pots and pans, pretty please!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, but small","review":"I found this pan very useful for my crepe needs. The non stick part is good. I only wish it was a little bigger in size and was dishwasherable. But it's definitely a good addition to your cutlery."},{"rating":"1","title":"One time use only","review":"This is a disposable piece of junk. I had high hopes in the beginning. Before I put it on the stove. The first time, it started to stick. Yes I use only plastic utensils. But the poor quality reflects badly on Caphalon since they are supposedly high end. I had better luck with $5 pans. Take a pass on this. If it were so heavy, I wouldve returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small, too shallow, impractical for multiple use.","review":"This pan is too small to be practical. It's cheap but isn't worth the storage space it requires considering its very limited use for frying one egg at a time or cooking one pancake at a time. The pan is simply too small and shallow. I am returning it.Editing to add that nobody wants to hear criticism of this pan!! Folks, the pan is too shallow. I think most people would be better off with the 10-inch omelet pan - much more practical for multiple uses. If you have all the storage space in the world for specialized pans, by all means, get this pan.As to what pan allows more than one pancake at once - the Calphalon 12\\" nonstick commercial omelet pan - was my favorite pan. Unfortunately, the non-stick coating peeled on me after less than 2 years...let's see if Calphalon honors their warranty. I will let you all know....Update: Calphalon honored their warranty!! They rock!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Butter sticks to this pan","review":"I puchased this pan along with a few others after being under the false impression that it was of superior quality. It is heavy and solidly built but the non-skid coating is junk. I have never put it in the dishwasher and always washed with care but after a couple of months the non skid was nonfunctional.

The first one lasted about 3 years, being used on average at least two times a day. We make crepes in it once or twice a week and like many other reviewers have mentioned it is great for eggs. We reheat items in it, make pancakes, grilled cheese, hamburgers, stir frying vegetables - you name it. It is one of the pans we reach for on a daily basis. After continuous use the nonstick surface did start to come off (we always use nylon utensils but don't treat it like it's fragile when storing it - we have 4 kids ages 9 and under). I have not found a non stick pan that would last as long as this one did with all the use it got, as well as heat as evenly as it does. I don't believe I will ever find a pan with a non-stick coating that will last indefinitely, so our choice is Calphalon nonstick when it comes to purchasing nonstick pans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"After a few months the coating has started to peel of, not what I had expected from Calphalon, not like their standard material, just a common pan, but heavier.I would not buy this item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"dud pan?","review":"Given all the positive reviews maybe we got a dud, but we have never had any luck with this pan.

No oil needed - everything slides out of the pan with ease. Cooks evenly and holds heat well. This is a heavy, mulitpurpose pan that I know I will get years of use from.

This pan is great for preparing eggs, pancakes, french toast, and yes crepes. It's also great for making a quick burger or sauteeing some veggies. It's truly non-stick, was is fabulous in and of itself. And the shallow walls make it easy to flip, nudge, or otherwise move food around or out of the pan.It's worthwhile to note though that they are very low walls - so you're not going to fit a lot of anything. Last night for example I used it to make a simple sautee for two as a side dish. If I was cooking the same recipe for 4 I might find myself reaching for a different pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calphalon User","review":"Love the pan--we do, of course, use it for more than crepes.

It is also too small for making breakfast for a family. The nonstick coating is inferior to the anodized line, and the pan still can't be washed in the dishwasher. For $3 more, you can get a real pan, one you can use every day for 15 years for every type of cooking (14\\" anodized skillet w/ lid)that heats evenly and cooks wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need crepe advice","review":"I just bought this pan and I think it will work out very well. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is because I can't get my crepe batter to stick to the pan! I made a wonderful omelette in the pan this morning, but I bought the pan for crepes. I'm thinking the problem may be the small amount of oil in the batter coupled with the pan's nonstick surface makes the batter act like liquid mercury in a high school science lab. I've never made crepes before, so I'm at a loss. Should I take the oil out of the recipe, buy a steel crepe pan, or is there something else I can do?

Makes great pancakes, egg omlets, tortilla, etc. It's a bit shallow for stir fry, but still useable if you want to make sautee mushrooms or something in that nature.Non-stick, I've used it only for a few weeks, so not sure how long it lasts. But just from looking at the finish and the few weeks of use, it looks to last a fairly long time. Typically have to change the cheap non-stick pans every 6-10 month, this one costs about $10 more, but the material really looks like it's going to last at least 2x longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this pan","review":"This pan is awesome. First off, it's a Calphalon. Secondly, it's extremely usefull. I use it mostly for eggs/omlettes, but really can be used for so much more.

I had my first one for at least 9 years! I originally got it for crepes, but I use it for everything!

Making crepes with this pan is the greatest in that you do not have to use very much oil, if any, and the crepes are easy to flip without sticking.

Takes but a few seconds to clean the pan when done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan for egg-based dishes, but could use a handle guard","review":"The pan has generally been a joy to work with. Heating is even and adjustments to the temperature are apparent very quickly. Both crpes and omelettes easily slide off the pan without additional oil. Cleanup is thus very simple - hand wash with soap and a sponge.I wouldn't recommend the pan for tortillas because the higher temperatures needed. (Tortillas do not have eggs and, if done right, shouldn't stick. A cast iron skillet is more than adequate.)The primary drawback I've had with the pan is the handle: it does have hotspots, some which may get uncomfortably warm. Either a longer handle, facilitating grip, or a handle cover would greatly help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, great buy","review":"This pan is good for more than just crepes.

I mean top value for dollar. Take price out of the equation and they're still pretty darn good. No, they're not teak or other top end wood, but they are a nice cedar and have a pleasing deisgn. Quality was pretty good, in fact 95% on these chairs (less on the potters table I also bought). The only problem was that one drill hole didn't go all the way thru and thus when opened up by a scrediver, it ripped/splinted the wood a bit. No biggie and may even add character. Anyway, the hardware is average (brass screws and wahsers), and the wood is \\"combined\\" (not from one piece), but still the product is above average withotu price and outstanding with price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly remakes with added crowd sounds","review":"If you're gonna mess with classic songs - try to make it sound like a concert - then why not try to find tracks that...don't fade?For the long-suffering Little Richard fans, who patiently wait for a new song to come out about every three years, and read about albums worth of unreleased recordings, here's another symbolic kick in the patootie.

His book leaves you thinking: wow, he did that? And, where would music today be without Chuck Berry?Uncovering some of America's darkest truths, this book tells as much about race and America in the mid twentieth century and as it does Chuck and his music.The best surprise in this book is: not only can Chuck sing and play guitar, he can write; and he does it well.Definitely worth reading!

The music is excellent, even better than their first two CDs which were big International hits. If you are looking for songs that will make it to the top of the hit parades on radio stations around the world, focus on Huellas, Si Te Marchas (my personal favorite), Corzon,Corazon, and Me Nego. Whether you love to listen to salsa or love to dance it, this CD is a must have for all salsa lovers.

He draws too many concrete inferences from ambiguous material and situations. I'm quite dissapointed with his analyses..... they seem much better suited as introductory high school texts than college ones. His analyses and writings about his chosen subject seem rather dry. I reccomend this text only for its selection of international authors whom I may not have discovered had it not been for this text. The content of discussion is dismissible, however. As an alternative, I suggest Ciardi's \\"How Does A Poem Mean?\\" He covers basically the same territory, but does so with passion and an obvious joy in the unnailable.

This type of singing suits me, though. The sound quality is smooth, nothing jarring you awake. The volume is steady so that you still hear the lower tones and aren't disturbed when the voices become stronger. I've listened to it in the day when I'm involved in a project and it seems to help mask out the sounds from outside so that I can concentrate on the task.

This is Gregorian Chant at its most beautiful, soothing, and, yes, meditative. The singing is beautifully recorded. There is a calm, spititually centering quality to this c.d. that is not as easily articulated in words, as it is felt within oneself as soon as you begin to listen to this album.

I never cared much for the \\"horn bands\\" of the early 70's, like Chicago or Blood, Sweat & Tears. However, the Flock was different and had a edge to them that was quite appealing. Unfortunately, the Flock got little commercial exposure and usually played alot of the festivals going on at the time. The Flock was more appreciated by other musicians than by the average listener. The funny thing is when people saw them live, they usally liked them. It goes to show you success is not just measured by talent or the Flock would have been at the top of the ladder. The Flock's style is a mixture of Rock, Jazz, Classical & Folk that creates a sound that is raw and polished at the same time. The Flock is one of the best bands that never really \\"made it\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flock : Ground breaking psychedelia","review":"Led by Violinist Jerry Goodman, the Flock's debut, 1969, blends country, rock, jazz blues and psychedelia.

The electric violin screams in a very unique way thru it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to say it, but this is disappointing","review":"I bought this to hear the pre-Mahavishnu Jerry Goodman. I like late 1960s rock, especially psychedelic and progressive. So I was all set to love this one. The material is so weak that I could not enjoy it. The singing and lyrics are mediocre, but beyond that, the songs themselves are so poor. The elements are there for interesting music, especially the mix of Goodman with the horns, which was innovative at that time, but the songs are just so disappointing. The Kinks cover leaves me cold--it is overarranged, overwrought, just too over the top for me, and not sung very well. I try to give all honestly performed music the benefit of the doubt, but I really cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually very complex recipies","review":"The recipes in this book may be for \\"Simple French Food\\" but they are not simple recipes.

I don't know if it was an effect or what, but it's distracting.

I can really hear their struggles and love for God in their chants, and their harmonies are creative and sweet to the ear. True, if one is not familiar with this type of music--Gregorian Chant--it may sound a little spooky and strangely other-wordly. I would encourage the listener to look up on the Internet the portions of the Latin mass that are on this CD--the Gloria (#11), for example, and read the words in English along to sound of the song. That way, you can have a sense of the things about which the monks sing, which will bridge the distance between the listener and this genre of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbiased reponse to Caesarmagnus","review":"Agreed, the fan IS there, but I must admit they are actually singing well in the actual Solesmes style (based on these samples).

Currently, I have the PALM IIIC and I like it a lot. The only option that I wish it had was an expansion slot like the Visor products. Along comes the M505 solving the expansion slot problem and I really wanted to trade up. I went Best Buy to get a demo and let me tell you, the screen is awful. It is very dim and even with the backlight on, it doesn't compare to the IIIC. Save your money.

With this device, the batteries charge on the cradle, and the weight is better, as seems to be the touch screen sensitivity. I have only had my Palm m505 for a a day and I am already in love. 8 MB of RAM (Which I WILL be expanding even further) and the fit and finish of this device just called to me. I will be using it more, I can tell already (Grafiti just works!, It recognizes more of my symbols).Anyway, so far I would definitley recommend this Palm device for anyone looking to do serious notetaking and work on the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I've waited for a month with great anticipation of upgrading my Palm to the new Palm M505.

I have owned others (III & V) which work fine. The problem with the m505 is that the buttons below the screen (calendar, phone, etc) are not recessed, so when you close the cover with the slightest pressure, the buttons get pressed, the Palm gets turned on again. Once it is on any pressure on the scroll key keeps it running (you can hear it clicking away) and in no time the battery is dead.I got one for a friend who spent hours entering his 200 names & addresses etc while we were on a trip. Then he recharged it, put it in his suitcase and one week later when he opened it up again the battery was dead and all the memory had been erased. Totally unacceptable! I think the whole m505 line should be recalled."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CHRISTMAS PRESENT!!","review":"I got this awesome palm piolot with a keyboard and it is great!

I can't believe anyone is building their 'flagship' PDA without either built in wireless or a PCMCIA slot to add a wireless modem. The 'mobile Internet' option doesn't count - dragging around a data ready cell phone with a connecting cable is not 'wireless'. They better improve with the v 5.0 OS and upcoming models... or they're done. By the way the incompatible cradle data connector is one more bad move."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Palm thinking??","review":"As a long time, loyal Palm user I was so disappointed with the color screen on the 505 that I returned it! I own a V and a IIIc, my 11 year old son has a 100 and a VIIx, and I cannot believe Palm actually introduced this product! The screen is unreadable in my office or home under flourescent or incandescent lighting, even with the sidelight on. I have ordered a Sony Clie 710 and will see if their promotional photography is more true to form! If you want a new design Palm, go for the 500, or get a IIIc. Avoid the 505, you will be very unhappy! Note to Palm: Resolution is useless if your users cannot see the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any other PDA.. except for the color...,.","review":"I like this better than Clie (which my husband have right now). Well I got a Palm Vx as a gift and when my husband told and showed me the M505, I instantly fell in love with it and exhange my Vx to M505. Compared to Clie, I like the M505 Screen especially when you use the Stylus pen (it's soo smooth) unlike in Clie, though it's good they put screen protection, It's hard and felt sandy when u write on Clie. The only negative feature M505 have is the dead colors.. they should've chosen brighter colors like the Clie.. but other than that..

We have both in our household and the advantages of the Pocket PC are many. For example, go to your local retailer and try out the handwriting recognition. The Pocket PC's is almost flawless and does not require anything other than gradeschool letters. The special characters for ordinary letters required by the PALM often don't work and the screen always seems to need to be realigned. You don't need to use an extra stroke for numbers or capitals on the Pocket PC. And word compleation is a real timesaver over the PALM. The calander is much easier to read and the display looks much more professional. There is a great deal more functionality, with the ability to read and create Word and Excel documents. Games are better as well.And if you have a Palm and run out of battery, LOOK OUT. If you didn't sync recently, you may lose everything, which just happened with our household PALM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dim Display","review":"The display is more disappointing than reviews mention.

Yet for all the price, the screen on the M505 is not clear, even with the \\"front light\\" on. It is not as clear as the Palm IIIC. Palm is aware of this problem, yet they continue to advertise that it has \\"brilliant color\\".

The Documents to Go software is extremely useful as I am able to edit letters, spreadsheets and other documents while on the go. I can easily use my handheld on a plane as it doesn't take up all the room on my tray. I am planning to purchase the portable keyboard to make my handheld even more useful. The m505 is like having a laptop in my pocket. I give this product five stars for ease of use and functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"m505 has issues.","review":"Palm is not posting facts about the m505. The m505 can at times develop a hotsync problem. Users who get replacement devices have limited success with them. I received a replacement device today and the hotsync did not work. Palm has not FAQ's on their web site addressing the problem and generally seem to want to cover it up. Not every one has these problems but more people have them then should.With having Palm cover up these issues, and the only resolution being to use a serial cradle for slower syncing why would you want to buy one?When the device works it's pretty good, a semi-fast processor, back-light is a bit weak, battery life is good. But remember the potential you have for future problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmm","review":"I too have owned several palms and frankly I am quite disappointed. Considering the availability of other Palm OS and Windows CE PDAs, I am surprised Palm even bothered coming out with this one. It lacks so many features that other models on the market have had for a while now. As mentioned above, the quality of the color screen is probably THE biggest disappointment. Also, the lack of compatability with older international kits etc is a big bummer. I too will most likely be shifting to a Windows CE PDA after this one unless Palm gets their act together.Memory is a factor but the expansion slot meant nothing to me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great features, but as everyone knows, the screen is poor","review":"I noticed on the reviewers that the worst reviews came from former IIIc owners like myself. And other reviewers from a non IIIc back ground favored the screen. I for one, love the M505, feature packed, expandable, and inuitive. Nice quality, almost perfect. The screen, however, is somewhat lacking. No brightness controls, permanantly set to a dim sidelight, but nonetheless, very viewable in dim to no light, extremely viewable in bright light or outdoor light. So it's a matter of personal preference. Unlike a lot of the colr pda's out there, this one can be viewed in any lighting condition. Not a \\"brilliant\\" screen, just acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color... very dissappointing","review":"I checked out the m505 in the store first. When I saw the color, it took about 5 seconds to purchase the m500. There is no comparison with the screen. The m500 is MUCH clearer than the m505. I needed a screen I could look at quickly, since I do so much with my Palm. I didn't have the time to turn on the backlight (which still isn't bright enough) and take a hard look at the simplist of text. The m500 is rated 5 stars, easy. The m505 is 2 stars. The screen means that much to me. This is why the active matrix screens on laptops are so much more popular than the dual-scans. They're worth the extra money.

I can't help but compare the 505 with the 3C... they are worlds apart. Why can't palm put 3C's screen on a 505? THe 515 is better, but not that much better.

When I contacted Palm, they said they know about the defect and have corrected it, but in the meantime, I spent $478 for a NEW palm pilot that DOESN'T work and the only thing Palm will do for me is send me (at my cost of $25) a REFURBISHED replacement. Seems like someone is getting a good deal here, and it's not me. I will never buy a Palm product again. Additionally, the color screen is terrible without the backlight on. I am sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color Screen Dissappointing","review":"The palm m505 was very dissappointing when I recieved it and I even thought about taking it back, until I saw all the other handhelds that had color screens. The compaq Ipaq has a weak screen just like the palm without the backlight on, and it's battery only lasts about 4 hours. It is also a lot bulkier and costs almost twice as much. The handspring visor prism does have a better screen, but it is huge compared to the palm m505. I don't think the screen is very bad considering it's size. If you really want a good color screen handheld with the palm os format and don't care about price, get the sony clie. It's screen is much better then the palm m505, the handspring e]visor prism, and the compaq ipaq"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far...","review":"I've read the other mixed reviews, but the bottom line is this is the best Palm so far. Why? Let's start with the size. It is smaller than all the rest save the Palm Vx. It fits nicely in the hand and pocket. Then there is the expansion slot. On top of the built in 8 mb of memory, each SD expansion card offers another 16 mb! All told, that's three as much as either the Palm IIIc, xe, or Vx. That means you can save tons more software and really maximize the use of the m505. Finally, there's the color screen. Yeah, it ain't all that bright without the backlite on, but Palm now offers a software patch for free that allows you to have the backlite on when you turn hit the power button the first time. Sure it uses more battery, but so what? Hello, it's rechargable! And if you hot sync as much as I do to get updates to all the avantgo news and information, recharging ain't no big thing. Buy this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen is VERY POOR quality","review":"I got my Palm m505, and the screen is VERY YELLOW, VERY DIM, and of the poorest quality I have seen. They claim it has more colors than the IIIC, but they fail to mention ALL the colors are based off greyish yellow. There is no white in the display. Palm Technical support was of little help. They claim there is a manufacturing problem, but all the editorial claim the display is dim. I suggest looking at one in the store before buying. If not, you may be very upset with what you get. I have heard of too many people who got one with a bad display."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good thing they are replacing it.","review":"I owned one for a day. The touch screen kept getting false readings until I had to reset. The display at the store seemed to have the same problem.

It has caused us sleepless nights thinking how to recover lost data."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm specialist says stay away","review":"I am the Palm Specialist for a large hospital. When the Palm m505 first came out, one of our MD's bought one. From the get-go it had hardware problems and, in the end, we warranty-replaced it four times for different hardware problems (a bad screen, a bad power button, no hotsyncing through the cradle, etc). Since then, two other MD's got m505's and both of them have had the hardware go bad (hotsync hardware problems both times) and they recently got warranty replacements. Palm Desktop 4.0.1 was used in each case, which had a fix for m505 USB syncing, but that did not help our situation. We now have a policy that Palm m505's and m500's are discouraged. (There is an m500 that has given us glitches with Hotsyncing upon occasion, although it has not completely died yet). I recommend the Sony Clie T615 for the Color Palm OS option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but pocketable!","review":"I've had a Palm since they first came out. I had pre-ordered the M505 through Palm, but cancelled after reading several negative reviews about the color display. After seeing it in the stores, I purchased it and am delighted. True, the display isn't perfect, and does require the backlight in most indoor situations. However, the backlight solves the problem indoors, and outdoors its very readable. The features are great, the subtle improvements to the applications are helpful, and it's very well made. Above all, I can put it in my pocket now (the IIIe was clunky.) If size matters to you...you'll want the M505. if you want extremely crisp, clear color, buy a 27\\" Sony Trinitron!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inherent Design Defect and Inadequate Support","review":"Palm has acknowledged that a problem exists with static destroying the ability to hotsync via USB. Palm replaces the M505 and original cradle whenever this occurs, but has not yet been able to fix the problem. Of course, you, the consumer,will bear the cost of shipping the defective unit back to Palm and the inconvenience of being without it for any number of days (turnover is now 5 days). I am now on my third M505. The last one worked for less than three weeks.Apart from this major annoyance, the screen is dim, and Palm support is woefully inadequate. Franky, I hope it goes bankrupt soon so a real company like Handspring can purchase the intellectual property and make a go of it. I'm done with Palm. BTW, I've owned Palm devices since 1990, and had been a dedicated fan! No more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"If you're a person who needs a PDA to keep your schedules, notes, do calculations, etc... This unit is not for you. All you have to do is get the cheapest PDA, I recommend PALM for your simple needs, and use it. Also, for color PDAs, I suggest gettin a Pocket PC, possibly a Philips, Compaq, or HP brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen worse than IIIc, few SD cards available","review":"This has been a good product, but was not worth the [money] I paid for it. The color screen was okay, but then a colleague showed me his IIIc screen, and then I was downright angry!! Palm blew it on the screen. It's very marginal. The options for the SD cards are few and far between. There are book titles--but who is going to read a book on any Palm? And, wireless connectivity has been VERY slow to come. Utilizing maps (e.g., RoadAtlas) is almost futile with the small, low-resolution screen. I would not recommend the 505 and would suggest the following alternatives: 1) save your money and just get a Palm V, 2) if email is big for you try the i705 (no color though--Palm must be scared!), or 3) get an Ipaq.The future is pretty clear. Palm stock is WAY down over this last year and Ipaqs are spreading fast. Palm had a good niche market, but Microsoft reigns supreme with software and Comaq has a core competency in electronics manufacturing. Palm has neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible problem with USB HotSync on the 505","review":"I have been a loyal Palm user since the very first Pilot came out. When I replaced my Plam Vx with the 505, I was shocked at the difficulties with the USB HotSync. Granted, I use Lotus Notes v5 with Intellisync, but no matter what I do, including using the \\"developer's back door,\\" the USB times-out during true synchronization. That means that I can only sync from the PC to the 505 -- not vice versa. Palm at first refused to acknowledge the problem, but now no longer refuses to admit it. But still no fix. This is WAY too much money to spend to have buggy software/hardware. Either wait until it works right, or get a Sony. The Handspring Visor is nice, but extremely bulky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a Visor Prism Instead","review":"I too have been a long-time Palm user and currently own a IIIc and VIIx. I have been looking for a 65k color screen and waited to see the 505 - I was really disappointed - I agree with most of the negative reviews here - the screen is miserable. I have opted to purchase a Visor Prism instead - plus the Springboard slot in the Visor is much more robust than the Palm card slot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with that screen??","review":"I must say that I'm VERY dissapointed with the m505. I've onwed Palm III and Palm Vx before, and never thought that I will be switching, however when it came time to upgrade (just last week,)I had a chance to compare the Sony Clie 610C ... and the m505 side-by-side. This should be recommended to everybody before they purchase the m505, because the Sony screen is SO MUCH BETTER. It is actually bright, you can see colors clearly, it is great outdoors, and has 320x320 resolution as oposed to m505's standard 160x160. The detail, sharpness and brightness of the Sony are simply in a different category.To sum it up, shame on you Palm for selling the MOST ... Palm OS based PDA that has such a poor screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I am a loyal Palm user and have waited with great anticipation for the M505.

Palm missed it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"m505 has disappointing subjective image quality","review":"The Palm m505 has a dull looking screen, with subjectively low contrast. Black text appears painted on a gray background, instead of on a crisp white background.

It has become a real problem for me because I use it for everything and I have to send in both my palm and the cradle to the factory and I have to live without it for at least a week. I love my palm, but if I had to do it over again, I would have waited for the 515. The color on the 505 is not all that great and I almost always have to turn the backlight on. The ease of use is great, but the hardware problems are extremely frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Palm so far","review":"I've used a Palm III, a IIIc, and now the M505. I've liked each of them; and overall, I like the M505 the best; but there are some drawbacks. The main one is the lack of compatibility with accessories purchased for the earlier Palm models. I don't have a huge investment there; but now I'll have to get new gear to charge and sync on the road. Beyond that, if you like the Palm platform, I think this is the best yet. I've read several criticisms of the M505 screen; but after using it for two weeks, I have no complaints. It is very readable both indoors and out; and the fact that the graffiti area is lit when using the sidelight is a big plus in low-light conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expansion Card???","review":"I looked forward to using the expansion card to store large files such as many of the medical programs(e-pocrates,5emc,jhabx guide)I use.

I ran out and got one as soon as it came out. What a colossal disappointment. I couldn't tell the color screen from previous monochrome screens. The m505 has the dullest, hardest to read screen ever(in ANY light). Who is responsible for this travesty? I'm sure he/she works for Handspring and wants to drive Palm out of business. I have loved my Palm IIIc from day one and had high hopes of the m505 surpassing it in brilliance and clarity.

Luckily after hassling with the vendor (not amazon.com) I got a new replacement. I just got my new palm a week ago and USB connectivity has ceased to function, after reading up in newsgroups this is a common problem for a lot of M505 users! Other problems are screen resolution and brightness, after purchasing my M505 I got to play with the new color Sony Clie with the high resolution screen and it was MUCH better the the 505's screen.

Rodgers and Hammerstein's sweeping musical/drama has been the subject of much critical debate. The Siamese continue to feel that both the play and the film present their monarch as a simple thug converted by colonialism as represented, at least here, by the stunning person of Deborah Kerr. As a musical this is definitely one of the all time greats. It's just such a shame that Fox, the company responsible for this DVD, hasn't realized this. The non-anamorphic DVD is loaded with digital imperfections, aliasing, shimmering, grain and dirt that make for a pretty dismal visual presentation.

If so, does the 50th anniversary edition of the film provide these songs as \\"extras\\"?I think any \\"special edition\\" DVD-release of a film MUST include all material that was later removed by the studio for whatever reason; as included in the latest releases of \\"South Pacific\\", \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" and \\"Bells are Ringing\\" to name only three.

The songs are generally wonderful, and the adaptation of \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is visually breathtaking.What doesn't--It's too long. Also, both the main plot and the subplot (involving one of the king's concubines and her lover) are resolved too abruptly with the unexplained death of the king. In fact, the only reason that I can see for the king to die is good old-fashioned racism. Romance and possibly even marraige is the logical outcome of the close relationship that develops between Anna and the king of Siam over the course of the film. Killing the king, no matter how contrived, was the only way to avoid the distasteful (in some eyes) prospect of a romantic liaison between a white woman and a virile Asian male.Nevertheless, the songs and performances are strong enough to recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Songs","review":"Like Samantha Wiggins, I am saddened beyond belief at the missing songs, especially Shall I Tell You What I Think of You, which is essential to the story since she sings it in anger right before Lady Thiang comes to ask her to help the King, about whom Anna was just raging about. Every song in this film was pertinent to the story and it makes it unbearable for me to watch. But the sets and the singing (Marni Nixon did sing for Kerr, as she dubbed Natalie Woods' voice in West Side Story) are magnificent.I'd give it 5 but for the missing songs, which I remember hearing when I saw the movie on its original release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kerr & Brynner are winning in KING AND I","review":"A fine story, excellent performances and a lovely Rogers and Hammerstein score combine to make \\"The King and I\\" a picture to be seen and remembered. What's more, Deboirah Kerr is gentle but determined. Yul Brynner, as the Siamese King, repeats the role he played on Broadway and emerges as a most compelling new screen personality. A 20-minute Oriental ballet based on \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" is a memorable highlight of the thoroughly enchanting motion picture that will appeal to every member of the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie on our new tv....WOW!!","review":"Yes, I'm a romantic and I suppose that's why I love this movie. Deborah Kerr plays the strong, womanly foil to Yul Brynner's masculine, traditional ruler of Siam.

This is a must-have for any classic movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy the widescreen","review":"A word of advice: if you want to see this movie as it's meant to be, buy the widescreen edition. The King & I is filled with huge shots with tons of people in them, wide panoramas of the court, the Uncle Tom's Cabin scene, etc. Especially to get the full dramatic effect of the movie's final scene, there's no substituting for widescreen. I purchased the non-widescreen edition originally, but the mutilation of the scenes irritated me so much that I went out and bought the widescreen version to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful musical experience","review":"I enjoyed this movie. I know it's historically inaccurate (Anna probably had a much less important role at court and in the king's life.) and prejudiced, with its Westerners good, Easterners barbaric theme, but in my book it's still a good movie. Deborah kerr and Rita Moreno give good performances as Anna and Tuptim. The lavish sets are good, and so are the costumes. The songs are magnificent. Above everything, of course, is Yul Brynner's performance as the king, which demands the Oscar he recieved. He has a very commanding presence, even when he sits down (or kneels, as in the famous and funny sequence where Anna has to kneel lower than him and her skirts fly out from under her). A wonderful movie, evne if it is inaccurate and prejudiced."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLASTFOMY!!!!!","review":"Mr.Hammerstein and Mr. Rogers must be turning over in their graves! Fred Astaire always demanded that his movies never showed just his feet. He was so dedicated to the art of dance that he wanted the audience to see the ENTIRE STEP with his entire body flowing. Well, this film gave us just the feet. \\"I have dreamed\\" is one of my favorite songs. Its a classic Rogers and Hammerstein number. When I got to that part of the movie I told my family to be quiet and turn up the AV system. \\"Here it comes\\" i said \\"This is the most beautiful song in the film\\"...HA! The joke was on me. It was cut from the DVD along with \\"Toads\\" and \\"should I tell you what i think of you\\" This is the problem when uninspired corporate jr. executives are in charge of managing priceless works of art. I wonder how many of the people who decided to cut these musical treasures from the DVD have even heard of Yul Brenner or Deborah Kerr. For the sake of the bottom line we got just the feet. Not the whole body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Musical","review":"I've been a fan of The King And I since I was a child. The DVD is a beautiful presentation of this classic. The only reason I don't rate this a full five stars is the \\"sing along\\" feature on the DVD is cheesy beyond all belief....and not in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the pivotal scene?","review":"If this is the same video that came on the market about 2.5 years ago, it is missing the scene in which Anna tells the King off in a soliloquy (first line: \\"Shall I tell you what I think of you? You're spoiled!\\") Since that scene focuses the show's central conflict, eliminating it eviscerates the film. (If there's a different edition from the one I describe, please make it known!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting to Thai monarchy","review":"I live in Siam. Have seen this movie in US theatres.It is banned in Siam as being insulting to King Mongkut(The king Rama IV). Historically inaccuate, It portrays Anna as having an influence on the king which is simply not true! She was nothing more than a tutor for Mongkut's son(Chulalongkorn Rama V) who succeeded his father as King and is generally regarded here as a combination George Washingon, Abraham Lincoln. Anna upon leaving the Royal Court here exagerated her importance for self agrandizment Also the movies portrayal of the Kings devotions to Lord Buddha is insulting to Buddhism. In Thailand all the kings are highly regarded and can easily earn jail time for Less majesty for anything derogatory about the monarchy or Buddhism. I've ordered it to show my Thai friends for their oppinion. Hopping it will make it through customs.I guess historical accuracy is not important as long as it sells tickets!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yul Brynner is the king!","review":"I have seen 2 versions of Anna and the King of Siam and I have not been impressed with either actor who has played the king. To me Rex Harrison will always be known as Professor Henry Higgins and the original Dr. Doolittle. The actor who played the King of Siam opposite Jodie Foster didn't have the same arrogance that Yul Brynner did. Yul Brynner is the king!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Wonderful!","review":"KON-NICHI-WA! \\"Shall we dance?\\" is one the most famous musical number in Japan.

I was very disappointed in the color. Specifically, my copy had a large purple discoloration of the film image about a quarter in from the right screen margin. It was there for at least 3/4 of the movie and was quite distracting. Has any other viewer seen this? Could it be a defective disc?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shall we dance...","review":"A TOTAL CLASSIC!

After watching the VHS for so many years, I finally broke down and bought the DVD. WOW!! Just the opening shot of the boat at anchor made my eyes go wide. I actually saw the whole port and not just the ship! It's so nice to see the whole scene and not just the \\"center.\\"I don't really go crazy about all the extras. I just love seeing the movie as I probably saw it in the movie theater as a child and forgot how wide a wide screen is. It was great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the most wonderful films","review":"Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr are doing just fantastic work in this wonderful film of The King and I directed by Walter Lang. Music by Richard Rodgers makes this film even more enjoyable. The musical play by Oscar Hammerstein II is originally based on a novel written by Margaret Landon, and that's why this movie is also known as \\"Rodgers and Hammerstein's The King and I\\". Dated back in 1862 in Siam (Thailand) this royal tale is worth seeing and hearing, as the music is outstanding. Such unforgettable tunes as \\"The March of the Siamese Children\\" and \\"Shall We Dance?\\" et cetera, et cetera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Musical","review":"The King and I is one of Rogers and Hammerstein's greatest musicals. It is the musical version of \\"Anna and the King\\". The cinematography and scenery greatly captures the beauty and mystery of 19th century Siam. The story centers around the story of Anna Leowens who is hired to be the governess to the Kings adorable children. There is abattle of wills right from the begining between Anna and the King. Anna begins to fall in love with the children. She expresses this love with the song \\"Getting to know you\\". Anna brings in her Western Ideals and begins to have an effect on the king. One dramatic scene is when he tries to whip a runaway slave girl (Tuptim). Because of Anna's influence he can not do it. One of the best scenes is when Anna teaches the King to dance. This has to be the greatest dance sequence ever recorded on film (even better than Fred Astair and Ginger Rogers in \\"Top Hat\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast From the Past","review":"I purchased this DVD because we are going to be producing a performance of the King and I at the High School at which I am the technical director. I knew that my students had probably never seen the film, and most of them had not even heard of the play. Gave my kids a really good feel for what the show would be all about. The karaoke versions of the songs have been great for helping our cast prepare. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King and I Special Edition","review":"I have always loved the film of THE KING & I especially Yul Brynner magnificent portrayal of the King, like in his Tony award winning Broadway peformance, and Deborah Kerr's great performance as Anna Leonowens, which along with FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, I think are two of the best performances she has ever given, but I have always regretted the songs that were cut out of the film, but are on the wonderful soundtrack album, MY LORD & MASTER, SHALL I TELL WHAT I THINK OF YOU and I HAVE DREAMED in particular, to celebrate the film's 50th Anniversary 20th Century Fox are to release on to DVD a special edition of the film according to THE RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN ORGANISATION, in spring 2006, I very much hope some or all of these missing wonderful Rodgers and Hammerstein songs will be restored to the film!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I've felt for many years that this was the best of Rogers and Hammerstein's musicals and the original film was nothing short of magnificent. But the DVD is a terrible disappointment. The video is fine, but the sound is sorry indeed. (Perhaps they weren't able to recover the original tracks). But the real tragedy is the loss of two of the show's beautiful songs: \\"My Lord and Master\\" and \\"I Have Dreamed.\\" The original film was very long by today's standards, but leaving out these two numbers left a big hole for me. Darn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Looking DVD Release","review":"This is much better than the previous DVD release. The old release seemed foggy and had too much blue in the picutre. This release is vibrant and full of color. Great documentary (which could even be longer) on the background of The King And I and Rodgers and Hammerstein including some great photographs of the original Broadway production. If you like the film, it's worth buying again."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The King and I\\" holds up well.","review":"I hadn't seen this movie in years and thoroughly enjoyed it. The style is a little dated but not enough to hurt. That's one big palace the king lives in and the floors are VERY shiney. Lot of Mop N'Glo in the kingdom.The story is very similar to \\"The Sound of Music\\" when you think about it.Single woman comes to the home of a very highly placed man to take care of his kids. The forbidden romance: in S of M it's the daughter and the little Nazi protege. In K&I; it's the new young wife and her lover. There are even some song parallels. \\"DoReMe\\" is \\"Getting To Know You\\".\\"Something Wonderful\\" is similar to \\"Climb Every Mountain\\". The wife who sings \\"Something...\\" is similar to the Reverand Mother. The whole thing is \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" becomes \\"West Side Story\\".My only (and great) disappointment was that they cut \\"I Have Dreamed\\" from the movie. For my money, that's one of R&H;'s finest songs. Too bad, too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as seeing Yul Brynner onstage in 1978...","review":"As one who had the good luck to see \\"The King & I\\" on Broadway long ago, I always enjoy seeing this movie version, as well.

I love A Chorus Line, have all the CD's, saw it on Broadway years ago, saw the movie, and it was always balanced, so that every person who sees it can identify with one or more dancers. Well, I could not. Sorry, but I have nothing with women. It was always Astaire to me, never Rogers, Charisse or Hepburn. And here I sit, looking forward to sharing this great experience, and seeing women only, as if there are no men in the show. Really disappointing, a missed chance! Must I watch the deleted scenes? Well, I gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary","review":"It is an accurate depiction of what transpires in the world of auditioning for a Broadway show.

This is the first self-help sales book that really made sense. It is based on very solid research but is written in a pleasant and easy to understand manner. I will definitely be re-reading it in more depth.I still would have liked to read more real-life example stories and had more data on what kind of talent combinations tend to correlate with the highest levels of performance in the most common sales roles.One point they did not emphasize enough is that it is not so much the dominant talents that you have, but how you actively apply and adapt them to your job. Two people with very different dominant talent themes can sometimes succeed equally well by applying their unique strengths and managing their weaknesses. Also, it is possible to overwhelm a weakness with a particular strength to make it irrelevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for self reflection / helping with career choices","review":"Reconmended to me by extremely successful salesman with med device company.

They're almost identical and you really learn nothing new in 'Sales.' Having taken the StrengthFinders tests for both books, I found that 3 of 5 strengths were the same for me. In addition, I found that 'Sales Strengths' did nothing to tell me what sales environment or type of sales I should be in. The authors did a poor job of applying the theoretical strengths to practical sales environments and telling me that if I have x strength I should seek y sales job. Overall, the 'Sales' book read like a very long instruction guide to the test.

I grew up in NYC and find Queen's analysis of sex and sexual preferences goes far beyond the need to classify a person's feelings toward sex. I skipped roughly 70% of the book's chapters to avoid the author's incessant ramblings. Reading the book made me feel I was sitting through a horrible, post-feminist unending lecture, in which Queen makes lame attempts to identify every single sexual preference under the sun, while poorly and boringly validating every sex industry career move she has ever made.Chronicles of a Sex-Positive Culture only goes to prove how some people try to dismantle the mystical erotic pleasure derived from every exciting form of sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Irish Band since U2","review":"The Corrs are a definite worldwide phenomenon.

Sure the girls are pretty, but cutesy only gets you so far. The coloring of the whole DVD is blue/grey, the vocals are so so, musicianship only passable and the songs forgetabble. The sound is not 5.1 and the format is only 4:3. Their stage presence is almost non existent. For some reason the crowd is 40ish and very subdued (might be the performance?).

But the table is worse than awful. The legs are fastened by an obliquely set screw in the bare wood, and any pressure on the leg, such as moving the table slightly,or even tightening the screw too much, causes the triangle of brittle wood that holds the leg to the table to break off at the screw point, making the leg useless. You can then turn the leg upside down and drill a new hole to hold the leg in place, but eventually you end up going to a lumber store to replace the legs.

Even the more lyrically weighty songs don't come off as weighty. This is true even of \\"Promise\\" which is notable given the lyrics about divorce (perhaps Ty Tabor's divorce a few years before this album):\\"Cast away, loose the knotshe's getting sun on the spotwhere the ring used to bebefore feelings were stronger than a promise\\"For me, a few of the songs are less memorable than the rest, but when I listen to these songs I actually think they are very good as well.

Northanger Abbey is weak in ways I don't expect Austen to be weak, but for the person who seeks to watch her art in progress, this is an excellent example of the author learning her way toward her great masterpieces.You consequently will not be as swept off your feet, but you will learn a great deal about Austen's development as a unique and incomparable author in her time and place.I for one am always watching the way she develops her main female protagonist...giving her a mind in a day and age when women were seldom expected to have a mind, much less put it to any good use!I learned from this book...and for me that made the reading of it well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shimmering Prose","review":"Although this was not my favorite of the Jane Austen books, such an observation can hardly be interpreted as a criticism. I mean, there simply are not enough superlatives to describe her books. As far as Northanger Abbey is concerned, I was particularly struck by the exuberance of the heroine. When her imagination runs away with her in the wake of her reading of The Mysteries of Udolpho I was completely charmed. Austen captured the imaginative spirit of young womanhood in this book in ways that are quite timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that speaks volumes...","review":"So I thought that Pride and Prejudice was my favorite Jane Austen book. I was incredibly mistaken after reading Northanger Abbey. The story is told by Jane Austen herself.It is as if she was in the room with you reading it out loud. It is the only one of its kind. It really was a shock to know that this book was published so long after it was written and was one of the first novels she completed. As I found, this book was hardly re drafted, not like the other stories I believe. It is the closest we could ever get to Austen herself, the first instinctive writings we could ever read. Raw and powerful. When it was first published long ago it was some years later when it was written, Austen being the clever lady that she was made the story timeless,, so to speak as timeless goes .. that a women like me in the year 2010 could find enjoyment and humor in a book published so long ago. Now that speaks volumes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Northanger Abbey","review":"Not the best book from Austen. Still fun to read though.

Four instead of five stars is because I didn't like the story as well as other Jane Austin books."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not good","review":"Many of the references Austen made in Northanger Abbey were meant to be satirical towards the gothic writing style prevalent in her time. Certain elements of wordplay in her characters' dialogue will also sound dated to a modern reader. For example, Catherine describes a popular gothic novel as being \\"Horrible\\", which can be taken as \\"Awful\\" or that the book was scary, which is a way the word was used in the author's time.Having said this, the book is slow, and is not as easy and interesting to read as her other novels, which can be explained by saying that this is her first attempt, and improvement was inevitable. The characters were not well-developed; I didn't understand the love-interest and I didn't believe that these two people were suited for each other. Again, she improved later.If you choose to read this book, try to get an edition with notes on the text.It will help a great deal in clarifying that which is now a centuries-old inside joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Kindle Book","review":"The voices on the book are hard on the hear speaking with no feeling or expression.

My favorites are Pride and Prejudice ,of course, and Emma. The characters in this book are not quite as comical as Mrs. Bennett or Emma's papa, but none the less fascinating depictions of English society in the 1800s.

I couldn't put this book down, she is so descriptive and the story line was exciting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons in life!","review":"This is Jane Austen's first published novel though not as well known as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Emma\\", it is still an ageless classic. Written in the English of the early 18th century it is at the same time almost poetic and difficult to comprehend, which can cause the younger reader to find it stilted or boring. In Austen's writing you must often times read between the lines, as in that period of time many things could not be openly expressed but only hinted at, so take your time. All her books relate to the reader lessons to be learned from life and the character of persons one might meet or associate with. This copy is beautifully formated by VOOK for navigation throughout the book, punctuation, and ease in reading unlike most of the poorly scaned copies of the classics that are available. Northanger Abbey also has a few nice picture illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH better than anticipated","review":"Knowing this was one of the first of Jane Austin's works, I was a bit wary when I began to read it. It was thoroughly enjoyable.Catherine Moreland's imagination is in full swing. Much is harmless and no more than a young girl enjoying herself. An imagination out of control gets her in to a bit of trouble. In the end, all's well that ends well.... well worth the read!In fact, a few weeks after I read it, I was pleasantly suprised to find it showing on Masterpiece Theater! After seeing it on the screen, it made me want to read the book all over again!(P.S.

I'm not kissing up to my wife, and I don't feel less masculine in admitting it. I like good writing, and Austen is clearly a good storyteller.That said, I'm not always really into the subject matter of her stories - romance, coming of age, etc. But she writes well enough that I generally want to keep reading. Additionally, I've always enjoyed the many film adaptations of her books.But I wasn't crazy about Northanger Abbey. It was her first novel, and you can tell. The story is painfully slow, the characters (except for the heroine) are underdeveloped, and in general the love story feels very Jr. High (except with wealth and British accents).If you're reading the whole Austen corpus, then by all means read this. But if you are picking and choosing, I'd put Northanger Abbey at the bottom of the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable Experience","review":"I've been working on reading all of Ms. Austen's oeuvre, and all I have left is Persuasion. Reading Northanger Abbey was a miserable experience. The heroine is so insipid, and I could care less about the parody of the gothic novel. I'm reading Austen for her character-building abilities, not for her making fun of old novels I haven't read.The other characters were abominable too--Mr. and Ms. Thorpe, the Allens, the whole lot of them, Catherine as a child. And I thought for so long that the widower General was hitting on Catherine himself.I even had to listen to the audio version to try and move things along but it still made me grit my teeth and at times bored me to the end of my nerves.Well, if you only have one Austen to skip, skip this one. Or read it only if you're a diehard fan, which I am not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Work","review":"4 1/2 Stars:Northanger Abbey is my favorite book out of all Jane Austen's works. I really liked Catherine, and her wide open heart and indomitable spirit. She was so easy to relate to and likable. All her adventures were interesting and kept me turning the pages. Catherine was defiantly my favorite Jane Austen heroine and out of all Austen's male character's, Henry Tilney is my favorite because he isn't pretentious (like Darcy in Pride and Prejudice), there is a lot of dialogue between the two (unlike Darcy and Captain Wentworth-Persuasion) and there's a type of friendship between them. Overall, I really enjoyed the whole book and would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys classic literature with heart and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic from Austen","review":"Jane Austen is the queen of subtle satire, and in Northanger Abbey she turns a sardonic eye toward the Gothic novels that are beloved by the protagonist, Catherine Morland, while also weaving a critical view of social conventions and women's roles. This is as riveting as her other works, with the addition of some laugh out loud moments as Catherine explores the \\"secrets\\" of Northanger Abbey with a foreboding instilled by her reading habits.There is spookiness, family drama, thwarted love, betrayal, deception and manipulation, as well as the sense that integrity and goodness will win the day as they usually do in Austen's works. This is another unforgettable classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I didn't expect much and didn't get much in return. Only the faux Gothic parts were fun.

It's Jane, so it's a good book. It's one from her earlier years when she was still using a much more exagerrated view of society, so it can be a bit silly, but I still enjoyed it. I read it years ago and had forgotten most of it.The formatting for this Kindle version was just great. It's not in Courier, probably Georgia or another similar font. Quite readable and I had no problems at all with it.Kudos to Amazon for making these free versions of the classics available to all. No reason to pay for classics that are out of copyright just to get a graphic cover.

The novel is, however, not at the level of the previuslymentioned two, perhaps mainly because the heroine is somewhatdim, although likeable. The conversations between Mr. Darcyand Mrs. Bennet are those of equals. However, it is sometimespainfully obvious in the exchanges between Henry and Katherinethat it is Henry who is the intelectually superior. Although theplot rambles a bit here and there, this is still a very good read,and Austen's wit shines through on a number of occasions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh....","review":"Not one of Jane Austin's best works.

BORING!!!!! This book is extremely overrated. The novel is also hard to follow at times since Jane Austen jumps from one time frame to another time a lot longer down the road in only one sentence. If your teacher or professor makes you read this book, then good luck.

It was much better reading it as an adult, as one generally has a much better perspective on answering/understanding concepts of lust vs. love, desire/drive for material aquisitions and what importance it has in life. There are multitudes of discussion questions regarding this novel available on the internet, worth considering. I believe that our club's discussion of this book offered many different opinions, making it one our more intersting ones. Also, worth reading about F.

It is beautifully written, with a delicate, light, captivating and enchanting touch, much like Daisey's laugh. Hemmingway's remark that Fitzgerald wrote like the gossimer wings of a butterfly is completely accurate. Even the gritty and morally dissolute segments which provide a balance to the unreality of the upper class dream world of Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom are rendered vividly but lightly.

We all have masters degrees and above and are all teachers or retired teachers and we had no clue what was going on in this renowned book. It was short and wordy. That is amazing in itself when you think about it. I even knew the story from having read it in college and didn't understand much of what I was reading. I had to go on schmoop after (a great site with summaries of classic novels) to find out what I was reading. This is a classic but far from what I consider great reading.

The writing is stunningly beautiful and whole paragraphs deserve to be savored again and again. Yet the story is bluntly sad and tragic. It's a story about chasing after elusive dreams -- once you seem to have reached these them, they evaporate. Fitzgerald packs a lot of punch, style, and tragedy into less than 200 pages. I loved traveling back to New York in the 1920s and spending some time peering into these character's lives.

It's short and simple, beautifully descriptive and carries within it the weight of great devotion and tragedy. It's a book one would call a work of art. I would read this for a taste of the fabulous lifestyle of the rich, decadent and charming in New York at the height of the Roaring 20s. Also, for Gatsby's utter devotion to a lost dream, the depth and the consequence of such a devotion.If anything, I felt the characters of Nick Carraway (narrator) and Jordan Baker weren't built up enough. Fitzgerald's method of description wasn't too much to my taste either.

The love story between Daisy and Gatsby, with Nick and Jordon, Tom and Myrtle, and Daisy too, interuptions not to mention their individual ives, and how FItzgerald cleverly used elements of prose and literary devices, to convey confusion and suspense highlights the fact that this story was well written and will remain one of the best years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book","review":"Do yourself a favour if you haven't read this book.Pick it up and enjoy!!This book is a classic so just do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Print too small - 6 point","review":"The print in this version of The Great Gatsby is too small to read comfortably - even for a 16 year old.

For anyone who has ever felt that deep sense of purpose or meaning in a world that feels bloated with socialite zombies, Fitzgerald's novel is well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nature of Tragedy.","review":"It is true the story is not particuarly Original, but to qoute the wisdom of solomon The only reason something is believed to be new is because we have forgoten the past. It is extremly well written with lavish description that is not laborious, but enjoyable. The choice of Narrator as Nick carroway is brilliant, as it gives proper perspective. I don't believe the Previous reviewers understand what Fiztgerald was trying to convey. The perspective reminds me Seneca's Thyestes in the it is about are desire to fill the emptiness in our souls. The charecters in the great gatsby are longing for something that will make them happy. Something that will revive the joys of the past. Tom buchuan and Gatsby are both trying to pursue the oldest pursuit of mankind; the Pursuit of Happiness. The Tragedy is that nothing will fill their emptiness even though they think they can."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite","review":"I have heard many comments and praise about this book, and I had to read it for myself over a summer to see just how good it was. That first time I read it, I thought it was extremely boring, and couldn't even get past the first 8 pages. However, when it was assigned to me in my English class the following year, I learned how rich it was in it's symbolism and style. It really made me question where our society is headed in terms of ethics and materialism.

All in all 'The Great Gatsby' should've stayed a flop, just as it was in Fitzgerald's day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-developed story in so few words.","review":"I had read very few classics before readinf Fitzgerald's Graet Gatsby. He portrays each character very well. He gets his point across without boring the reader with every miniscule detail. It is a masterpiece. No wonder it is number 3 on the Top 100 novels of the century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent book, well written","review":"I loved reading this story, the entire intrigue of the mysterious Mr. Gatsby kept me going. Fitzgerald did a commendable job of portraying the typical attitudes of the different social classes of the 1920ies, and the overall feelings of the environment that were present after World War 1 and before the Great Depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bookcover is different","review":"I thought I was getting the one I saw on a picture but when I received it it had a different cover. I know I shouldn't judge a book by its cover but this one had NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE printed on it. Not happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great GatsbyI enjoyed re-reading this classic because it gave me a picture of the world my parents lived in while dating, and it is such a powerful comment about how people in every era have a number of different levels in their personalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad story of those living empty lives without meaning or purpose - but well written!","review":"One of the great pieces of American literature, The Great Gatsby is picture into the lives of individuals living in the Northeast during the 1920s. The story mixes romance with intrigue, but the primary theme of the story is the meaningless and empty lives of everyone involved. Great writing by Fitzgerald - great character development and very interesting plot twists along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"Other than the story being good, The Great Gatsby contains some of the most beautifully written prose in the English language. For that and the emotional power, you must read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull. VERY dull.","review":"This is supposed to be an American classic? Personally, I've read better children's books then this. It's boring, useless, and basically states that rich people are boring, drunken snobs. The story went about no where, and I can't believe I even wasted my time to read it. The writing style was good. Imagine what he could of done if he had actually had a good idea for a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated...","review":"I decided that I needed to finally read this \\"classic\\" and what a disappointment...The novel isn't written all that well (despite the comments to the contrary) and is filled with non-sequiters (not in a good, fragmented Dos Passos way), jumbled fill-in-the-gap flashbacks, and poor prose. Additionally, the novel suffers from an extremely contrived plot and climax. I'm sure at one point in the history of American Literature this could have been seen as a clever and biting indictment of the upper crust of society, but reading it in 2007 exposes it as only another variety of the boring 19th century society fiction in the same vein as Austen, Bronte, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from Theamwriter","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite classics. I read this when I was high school, but didn't get my own copy of the book until later years. I thought it was an interesting read. To read about the main character and how it was possible to redefine or recreate yourself and try to persuade the world around you to accept this new definition was amazing to read. Then to mix in a love story with Jay Gatsby and his love for Ms. Daisy Buchanan was a good read as well. Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to read a good book and a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kindle version of an American classic","review":"There are numerous reviews of this American classic available on the web, so I won't bother trying to re-hash them; suffice to say I found it thoroughly enjoyable and a good holiday read. This kindle version seemed well formatted, I had no problem with the default text size, and it is nice to have a linked table of contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Not quite finished with this book but it is well written and quite readable.

It worked out great for us. He has an A in english class. This purchase was worth it so he didn't have to wait for his chance to use a classroom copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it again","review":"I read this book in college. Decided to read again before the new movie comes out. Love it even more than I did before."},{"rating":"2","title":"One's Responsibility","review":"Of course, reading the Great Gatsby is something every American owe's to himself. I was never good about reading the assigned literature in high school, but I read this. It introduced me to a world of poetry and prose, people and plot, and all elements of writing that have enthralled readers for as long as writing has existed. The language makes me want to weep. Authors don't write like this anymore, they might not be capable of it. Though the book presents itself as a tragedy through a portrait of our nation's most riotous decade, it is soothing in abstract ways. I love this book dearly and I'll never love another one more. If you haven't read Fitzgerald's Gatsby yet, read it. It belongs in the pantheon of classic books one must read before they die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"This book is an amazing literary text! t's rich in the history of the 1920's and has a great story to it as well. I read this book years ago and still remember every part of it, this will always be a personal favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great copy!","review":"3rd time reading this book! as always a great read! i got the book used and it was a fantastic copy, pretty much new...very happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Received this book quickly. This is one of my son's favorite books, so I bought it for him. He was thrilled. I will probably read it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the 1920s","review":"This book is one of the 1920s most popular, and shows how life was back then. Before the depression, people had fun and would dance carelessly in the night to big bands and fox trot. Gatsby was an interesting character who had sort of a charm to him, and it just shows how during the 20s, not many people cared about affairs, racism, nor drinking. I feel Nick is obsessed with Gatsby because Gatsby has the personality and class he doesn't. The story is somewhat hard to follow at parts, especially near the end, but it has a nostalgic feeling to it, and basically is a portrayal of life during this time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated novel ever","review":"I really, honestly do not understand why this book is supposed to be a classic. True, it's a fairly nice love story, but there have been many better love stories written. The characters all seemed very one-dimensional to me, and the story was fairly dull. It's not a *bad* novel, but I cannot fathom why on Earth the Modern Library would rank in #2 on their top 100 list. I wouldn't have put it in the top 100. Or the top 1000, for that matter.If you want to read classic American lit, don't read the Great Gatsby - read Twain or Steinbeck or Salinger. Their worst books are probably better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated classic good for nothing more than '20's spirit","review":"I was intially enthusiastic that I had found time to read the \\"great American novel\\" and the definitive work of the 20th century, Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\". Much to my disappointment I found nothing more than an a superficial plot based mostly on descriptions of the 1920's. Fitzgerald succesfully caught the spirit of the 20's so if you're looking to get a feel for that era this would be a good book to read, on the other hand if you're looking for a grand literary work, there is a lot more out there. Fitzgerald's characters are shallow and unidentifiable, his plot weak and slow-moving to an extent which becomes tiresome even though the book is relatively short. Fitzgerald is not an author but rather a social historian, something apparent in other of his works, such as \\"Bernice bobs her hair\\". So if it's insight on the 20's you want, this should be great, but it falls short of anything else it's reputation demands."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"The book arrived in a timely manner. The price was wonderful. What wasn't so wonderful was all the handwritten notes throughout the book. It made it difficult for my high schooler to focus on the author's actual writing because of the writing, underlined marks, notes in the margins, etc. I wish the bookseller had stated the extra marks. I would have picked a new book or maybe another vendor. Guess I learned my lesson, you do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Eyed Monster","review":"F. Scott Fizgerald took inspiration from his wife Zelda. He wrote an essay that explains how the various colors relate both to her and to the important themes in his novels. The Great Gatsby is the perfect distallation of these themes and codes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading Turned Good","review":"A required book for my English class, _The Great Gatsby_ has become one of my favorite books. The symbolism is amazing--a green light, the watchful eyes of an eye doctor's ad, the owl-eyed man, driving, Gatsby's library... it is amazing how Fitzgerald pulls it all together. And on top of it all, Fitzgerald creates what is considered the perfect narrator in Nick Carraway (give or take a letter). All in all a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera without a plot","review":"Although Fitzgeralds writing style is unique and diffrent, he failed to include a valid plot worthy of praise. His \\"novel\\" on the demoralization of America is nothing more than a over edited piece of literature. I fail to see how this book got an average of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is up with all the symbols..eyes, yellow, etc.","review":"This book totally confuses me i'm supposed to do an art project on it and i have no idea what to do. The book had so many drags, why did the author use his symbols. What happened really at the end? And can some one give me an art project to do/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just added to my favorites","review":"I'm a high school student, and I'm still reading the book -- just started ch. 8 -- I got to say this book is pretty good. I love Fitzgerald's style of writing, and although some parts may be hard to understand, going over it again is very helpful. This books makes me wish I could've lived in the Jazz age."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great Gatsby","review":"This is the most overrated book of all time. It's all about ritzy partying, about the things that happen to people who party a lot. That's the great American dream -- sappy unrequited love before and after partying. I can't understand why it's revered in American literature. It doesn't have anything to offer but a melodramatic peek at the lives of very shallow characters. The characters sounded as if they were culled straight out of Beverly Hills 90210: The Jazz Age Version. The prose is masterfully done, but the story is just pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It was too \\"wordy\\". Members of the Book Club that I am involved in did not give it a good review. What makes it a \\"classic\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I fail to see why this book is such a literary rave. It's the story about spoiled rich people with no meaning to their lives. If this is the best of the author's works, I won't read any more of his books. There are too many truly good books in the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"why is this a classic?","review":"A bunch of rich snobs complain about how boring life is while putting down or bullying poorer people. Wow, great literature. I read about 30 pages, skimmed ahead, still didn't see anything of value, and gave up. Life is too short too waste on overrated crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised!","review":"The book cover shown in the ad and the name of the publisher are both different from what Amazon has for sale. The book actually is the commonly available Schribner edition with the so-called classic cover painted especially for the book. Click the look inside button to see what you are actually ordering. If the Oxford World's Classics edition is what you are looking for, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the rave about","review":"I don't like writing bad reviews for books since I would never want to defer anyone from reading a book just because I said it was bad but I just have to say how I feel exactly about this book. To be quite honest I have never been more disappointed in a book before. I heard many praises about this book but when I actually read it I kept asking myself what is wrong with so many people who think this is a great book...I guess it's because the title of the book has the word great in it.All it's about is this guy who becomes way too obsessed with a so said 'golden girl' and just dedicates all her accomplishments to her. It's a book about doomed marriages that ulitmately results in infidelity (what a surprise). It's no wonder the book is classified as a tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to know 300 words fun purchase detail","review":"The following is a cut-up of other one-star reviews of this product.Exciting needs to stretch the mind.

The most notable is the occasionalinsertion of multiple paragraphbreaks within a sentence. There are also occasional misplaced paragraph breaks in dialog paragraphs, which sometimes leads to confusion about which character is speaking.I downloaded the free sample of the Scribner Edition and although that is only a short sample, it appears to be a much better quality transcription.So since there are two Kindle editions available, you might want to avoid the Old Landmark Publishing Edition (the one with the car on the cover) and try theScribner Edition(the one with the stark black and white cover)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, if not overated classic","review":"A well written book about a wealthy man in pusuit of the woman that he once loved. Observed mostly through the eyes of Nick, the neighbour, the Great Gatsby brilliantly sums up the idealism of the roaring twenties.A touching love story and some wonderfully written extras, including Mrs Wilson and Jordan. Tom is also a great villain type.Not as good as it is cracked up to be, or anywhere near for that matter. Balzac has written similar story's which are all vastly superior. F. Scott Fitzgerald seems to get very caught up in his descriptions sometimes, spilling out metaphor after metaphor describing someones beauty. This doesn't all fit so well in a book under 200 pages.Never the less, very good, certainly worth reading. Not a book for the ages however."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANGRY REVIEWER","review":"I would have given this book 5 stars if I hadn't read the reviews of a couple of idiots several columns down that give away the ending and key plot surprizes in their review.

It's not that I don't think we currently live in a society where most believe that wealth and fame will make us feel loved and happy. It's that in this day and age, it doesn't work to end a story without hope. We live in an age of mass consiousness raising. Yes, show us the \\"evils\\" in the world, but then show us what the alternatives are. Show us the answers.

It's eloquently written and interesting. A classic love story, that will remain timeless. If you were forced to read it in high school and didn't like it I suggest a quick revisit to the timeless tale. It was wonderful. I'd recommend it to anyone and since it's a short book it only takes a weekend to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Symbolism, Unlikable Characters","review":"Fitzgerald makes great use of color as symbolism in this book, particularly in the ironic use of the color white which represents innocence. It is to be noted, however, that if I hadn't had to do an assignment on the use of color in the book, I may not have noticed.As far as the story goes, I could not like any of the characters, nor could I understand their motivations behind any of their actions. I found myself questioning why they were willing to do so much for a woman who wasn't in the least bit interesting at all. This generally made it a read that I dreaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant","review":"This is a nice read, although not particularly enthralling. Hence, the non-commital length makes this book worth the time. Fitzgerald does offer an interesting glimpse into a cross-section of 1920's life in New York. Perhaps his perspective seems subtle because of it's relevance to today's society. It reads like an Hollywood movie, and may be more useful to the foreign reader in understanding part of American society."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEW","review":"The novel, The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald is not a book for me. I felt like the novel was too boring, and dull. It was really hard to get into. This novel is about a man named Nick that lives next to Gatsby, who throws parties at his mansion every Saturday. He then befriends Gatsby. In the beginning of the novel, it was confusing when Tom showed Nick, his mistress. I felt like nothing really actually happened in the book. There wasn't really a plot. This book is supposed to be a reflection of the 1920s, but doesn't really exude it. The 1920s was fun and exciting, and this novel was not. Also the actual writing was way too eloquent and he used lots of big words, that was distracting from the actual plot. His writing was way to flowery, which made it unenjoyable. This book was just basically about affairs. I also didn't like how Nick was narrating it, because he wasn't a sole part of the plot. He was just there; nothing important. I don't understand why this is a classic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Book","review":"I began reading The Great Gatsby expecting it to be decent, to be sure, but not for it to be spectacular. I was wrong. It is the best written book that I have ever read, and it is one of my favorites.Fitzgerald's use of the english language is nothing short of amazing. His eloquence is jealousy inspiring.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence","review":"I think, or I glean, that American high school students are required to read this book, held up as a shining example of national literature. Perhaps because I'm not American, this novel wasn't on any lists when I studied English in high school and university. Just as well; I mightn't have appreciated it then.It's understandable that The Great Gatsby would be taught; it's damned good. It's tight, compact, linear, and practically every sentence is a work of art. I bought the audio book and listened to it twice. Then I picked up the novel and read it in a couple of days. It's excellent; there's no way around it. It's also rather different from Tender is the Night, also good, perhaps more evolved, but not nearly as flash or impactful.If someone employed Fitzgerald's style today, their prose would likely be labeled too ornate. A shame, because it's poetic and powerfully descriptive.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very articulate and slow moving book","review":"Your suppose to read this in high school but I never did.

The story follows Gatsby's search for an unattainable ideal of love through wealth, eventually leading to his downfall. This novel portrays the very spirit of the 1920's, also exposing its dark side. Very well written, but a dull plot. It failed to draw the reader into the story, nor did it make the reader really care about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eek","review":"Yes, I'm but another unfortunate soul who had to go through this book because of the wretched school. Let me try to be fair, the book started decent. I thought the writing style of the author was good, but nothing egregrious. I was interested in finding out about the narrator, of course, the story turns and introduced a mob of characters from parties and dreaded plots. It was plainly, and simply and tediously S-L-O-W. Reading this book is a torture. Okay, that was my first impression of the book. After finally reading it through, however, I guess I should say it was better than I thought. The story speeds up a little, still retaining the air of elusiveness. It is hard to grasp the theme of The Great Gatsby. But perhaps when you do it is worthwhile to you.

No, he wanted to be up there on the hill with the rich. What a cop out.Scott Fitzgeralds said to Ernest Hemingway \\"the rich, you know they are different to you and I\\" Ernie replied \\"yes they've got more money\\" and I reckon just for once that old braggart Ernie had hit the nail on the head.So what does Fiztgerald do, he has his hero Gatsby mysteriously get some money but no that is not enough because he is not part of society and he can only look at his long lost loves window over the water.

I do not even know what the plot was. I know that there was one but i do not know what it was. It was not even that long ago that I read the book and I do not even remember what it was about.Actually I do not even think that i finished the book because I just could not bring myself to finish it.Well, if you are looking to buy this book to read for pleasure then I suggest that you pick another and if you have to read this book for a class or something then I am so sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know the secret behind this book","review":"The secret is: the author was a drunk. Had I not been forced to read this book in school, I would never have finished it, and I've read a lot of dull books. I've read a lot of classics, but this is probably the only one I think is not worth the effort. Frankly, I'm still wondering why it's a classic; there's nothing to it. So Gatsby's not what he seems, so he gets shot, so Nick's a homosexual, so what? Is there anything worthy in this book? Anything at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"gatsby wasn't that great at all.","review":"Use this book for my ESL english class, but as an story the book is to short and the best is in the middle and too simple for the new generation in this time when there is better books out there.

There was nothing that stands out, the good thing is, at least the book is short."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story, poorly told","review":"I skipped this in high school, reading it now for the first time at 55 years of age.Despite the rave reviews, this emperor has no clothes. In fact, this book is a model of how NOT to tell a story.The tale itself is excellent; compact and full of surprises and irony. But it is submerged in such a wordy, tedious, self-absorbed monotone that the reader can only appreciate it in retrospect, when they have dragged it out of the muck, shaken it free of detritus and seen its bare form.Prose, be damned. A good story, told for the ear of the reader, that's where prose is.I feel genuinely sorry for every young person forced to read this when there are thousands of better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"I hated this book with a passion. I am a sophmore in high school and was made to read this book for class and I despised every minute of it. Maybe it's a book for an older crowd, I don't know, but it was a complete waste of my time. The love story was predictable and the characters were obnoxious. I like books when I can fall in love with at least one character. That was not the case with this book. My advice- don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the prose, stupid!","review":"I think Fitzgerald has the smoothest-flowing prose in American fiction. That's why I got so absorbed in this book -- even though some of the characters are people I know I wouldn't especially like in real life. I found myself questioning myself \\"Why are you continuing to read about these fatuous individuals? Do you really care what happens to them?\\" But I couldn't put the book down. I felt I was right there, actually participating in the storied 1920's decade, albeit a certain slice of that famous decade (which many liken to the 1990's). That's the magic of good writing.While Great Gatsby brings a distant generation to you, today's young generation (or a certain slice of it) comes right to you in \\"Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf\\" by Asher Brauner. In a similar way, this book has a hero you don't especially like at first, but the whole story is so engaging and the humor is so charming that you can't put it down either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great American PC Bore","review":"Wouldn't read Fitzgerald after the obligatory HS Gatsby tour. Boring progressive high school teachers of course praise a \\"cautionary tale\\" that warns about the \\"meaninglessness\\" of the \\"American Dream\\" (progressive trademark attached to that phrase) as if there were a mass disorder everyone who doesn't subscribe to their pablum suffers from.Then, I read the short stories collected in Flappers and Philosophers and a couple of novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned. Well, Fitzgerald had quite the cool imagination. I tried to re-read Gatsby to see if my opinion had changed.Leave Gatsby to those who think The Catcher In The Rye is a great book. Catcher was written by a phony using the subjective voice of a phony adolescent surrounded by straw-phonies. Fitting choice of protagonist.Nick C. is not much of an improvement on Holden C.Fitzgerald can really write, so 2 stars. Read Flappers and Philosophers, This Side of Paradise or The Beautiful and Damned instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Writing!","review":"There is some of the BEST writing that I've ever come across in this classic American novel.

You simply must read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with it through the first few chapters.","review":"My first thought when I was reading the first two chapters of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" was to put it down and stop reading. Lukily I didn't! This was one of the best books I have read. It is full of symbolism and heartbreak. This is one of those books that needs to be read a little slower than most books. Special attention needs to be paid to colour symbolism in order to understand some points. If you haven't already read this book, go out and buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I just dont get all the praise heaped on this book.

I found the characters insipid, vacant and superficial, and I know that's the point Fitzgerald was trying to make, but instead of being deeply moved and inspired by the depiction of our society as shallow and meaningless like THE REST OF THE WORLD, I found myself incredibly disgusted and repulsed. I know this is the Great American Novel. I know that I'm supposed to appreciate it for its sublime beauty and honest portrayal of the Diseased Elite. But I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked Raise the Red Lantern much better","review":"Perhaps as a previous reviewer noted I missed some fundamental points of this novel. I hated it and couldn't stand the characters. I also couldn't help thinking of Su Tong's novella, Raise the Red Lantern. It takes place during the same time period, but in China. It's also about some wealthy individuals who make ruining other people's lives a sport.

This is not a novel that is simply an enjoable read. Constant analyzation and understanding is needed throughout the process of reading it. Only after understanding does the novel become a literary classic and icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Not So Great Gatsby","review":"I was pretty disappointed. Couldn't read the book because it was missing the first 6 pages. I know I bought a Used book, but this was not \\"Acceptable.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok. Nothing special","review":"I picked up the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald since it was one multiple \\"all time best read\\" lists, and this thin book was ok. Nothing out of the world to justify its presence on top 100 books of all time; apparently, there is a deeper secondary meaning in the story -- one that I could see, but could not appreciate as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Novel of All Time","review":"I am a writer and I re-read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" once a year just to be inspired by the master wordsmith of all fiction literature. Although the characters and the period are dated, the craftsmanship of F. Scott Fitzgerald cannot be equaled. I defy anyone to pick a better word, for ANY word that Fitzgerald used in this epic novel.Though it was not a monetary success when first published (Fitzgerald actually made a living by writing short fiction for magazines and was paid enormous prices for his work when America was in a depression) the fact that it still sells the huge volume of copies each year speaks to its appreciation by those who love perfect prose.With the ease of writing these days (he wrote in long hand) it is a shame that there is not one novelist today who can match Fitzgerald's genius for putting words together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Another Read","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald explores social dynamics in The Great Gatsby. It's worth tracking the character development time and time again in order to better understand inter-and-intra-personal dilemmas. Fickle Daisy, egotistical Tom, and detached Jay allow a close up view of people that are in reality much different from their superficial appearance. Reading The Great Gatsby has trained me to recognize facades, and penetrate them, to realize better relationships with people I might otherwise have misunderstood. Much is made of the colors in the book, the environs, and the historical context, but I've found the greatest value in trying to relate to characters whose actions and images are polar. A good test of whether or not you've penetrated the facade is if the characters' actions start to seem logical from their standpoint. It took a second read for me to get to that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Book... Annoying style problems","review":"JUST MY OPINION.....While I do find the content of the book enjoyable,it has been somewhat agitating to read because too many times in the book,a sentence lacks commas thus making it difficult to quickly and clearly understandwhat the sentence is trying to express.For Example: About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering changed.While this one is pretty easy to understand, would it kill to put a comma between \\"o'clock\\" and \\"the\\"?So... \\"About three o'clock, the quality of Wilson's blah blah blah...\\"This is one of the hundreds of the problem in the book.Maybe it's just me, but this book could be a lot better with some copy-editing. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"What gives???","review":"This is a must read in most high schools, why can I buy the paperback for half of what a Kindle download costs? Thinking Kindle sounded good, but was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great","review":"This is certainly one of the finest American novels there is, as pertinent today as it was when it arrived, if not moreso. It is a haunting portrait of the quest for love in a world of meaningless glitz, beautifully rendered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who are these foolish people?","review":"This book was a study of the nature greed and ambition, and what they lead to. In this case they lead to a lonely Jay Gatsby unglamourously lying dead in his swimming pool. Of course I wouldn't know this if I HADN'T FINISHED THE BOOK! in which case I'd have no business writing a rewiew, like the person who's review appears below mine. In short--read this book, or at least try. If you don't like it, thats fine, but think about it when you're done; that way you won't be caught flaunting your ignorance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly great book!","review":"this is one of the best books i have ever read. it is a fantastic voyage into another time and place, and will sweep you away. fitzgerald tells of a way of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"As I type, I'm beating against my deadline for a journal of responses to The Great Gatsby, which I finished about two weeks ago, but still cannot decipher enough. Fitzgerald writes in the most crystalline prose, as somebody said, and if one is looking for something mesmerizingly well-written, this novel should be approached. However, I give it only four stars because eventhough I can relate to Nick Carraway's perception of Gatsby, and his opinion of him (his dream is very noble, and he lives in a fantasy world, never letting the outside world crush this), I'm still perturbed and annoyed by the rest of the characters. I will have to read it in another time, so as not to feel under AP pressure as I try to interpret/analyze it. Finally, I believe the story is moving once one remembers all those disgustingly superficial and supercilious people do have souls.When I started this book , the Jazz Age fascinated me, but now it kind of disgusts me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gatsby Really Was Great","review":"After having the coolest kid (Nate) referring it to me to read, I did. It was an absolutely astounding book. Aside from Perks of Being A Wallflower, the best book I've read. Even the film was wonderful. Almost exactly like the book, so that was great.It was pretty interesting to read the differences, I suppose, in society and such in contrast with today's.

For older eyes, I would recommend another printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"May favorite book of all time. Truly stunning to read, and even more relevant now than when it first came out. Beautifully written passages, send chills down my spine each and every time I read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmatched","review":"A short book, a simple story, but Fitzgerald does things with the English language that few human beings have ever been able to do. This novel floats ethereally through the mind and settles in a place where it refuses to be dislodged. It is a pity that it is on almost every high school reading list because it is worth much more than the simple distaste that comes from most required reading. And what might be simple can also be classic. This is one of those books that resonates stronger and stronger with each succesive re-read. The movie (despite Robert Redford's presence) does the book absolutely no justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic masterpiece","review":"Need I say more? It seems inane to review The Great Gatsby because of its proverbial timelessness and consistent crowd of faithful readers, especially at my age and lack of literary experience, but it also seems blasphemous not to pay homage to Fitzgerald by indulging in his brillant novel. He intertwines the moral value of the rich vs. the poor in the early 1920's, and the general thematic virtues of life in an exceptional storyline. Fitzgerald tactfully constructs the plot throughout the majority of the novel, resulting in a crescendo of clashing characters and settings, but then slowly extinguishes the tension with a calming resolution. Several literary philosophies/movements are threaded throughout and it is an extraordinary read. I suggest it to anyone who likes classic literature or just books in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gatsby lives!","review":"This book has lost none of its punch. Fitzgerald's prose is heartachingly lyrical, the story tawdry and the times legendary. I have read it thrice now and it only gets better.For those who want a basic plot sketch, here is my take:Wealthy man (a bootlegger?) Jay Gatsby moves into a mansion across the bay from his former lover and throws a continual party in hopes of winning her from her husband. The carnal excesses of the Jazz Age ensure that this won't end happily for anyone, including the seemingly detached narrator, Nick Carraway.Kids, skip the Cliff's Notes and just read this one. It's short and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does a man have to do to get attention?","review":"A rich man, a middle class man, a tennis player, an adulterist, a confused freeloader of a wife, and story that involves them all in a toned down but twisted sort of way. At first glance this book seems to revolve around a love interest between Nick,(Our middle class man) and Daisy, (Our tennis player) while Gatsby (the extremely wealthy man) is our third party who's fancy parties help them together. But slowly this novel turns, and sends the reader into a situation where Nick Carraway is a third party in the Great Gatsby's life, and a love situation that will have the reader hooked....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Brilliantly written. It was extremely interesting, but also confusing, and I'm hoping when we do it for a set-work it will be a bit clearer. But I did get the most of it. The ending. It was horribly sad.

Jay Gatsby, the mysterious millionaire is one of my favorite characters of all time. They call them \\"classics\\" for a reason, and this is definitely one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the greatness in this novel?","review":"This book has often been described as Fitzgerald's most beautiful piece of work and frankly I do not see it. I first read this book as a teenager for fun and remember disliking it immensely but later not remembering why. Now that I ave reread it I realize what that is. The type of people described and the way they act irk me. They are well off family surrounded by people that dothings to each other with no feelings. They just keep hurting each other without caring about the consequences.In the beginning of the book it is very boring and does not become interesting until Gatsby becomes involved in the story but the way people act towards one another.I do not really see the beauty in this story but I do see commentary on society I just do not agree with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Blue\\" and bleak it is","review":"I see this book as being rather a bleak subject. If you are not sure whether you should buy it, YOU SHOULD. F Scott Fitzgerald is my #1 favorite author. He knows how to display a scene so vividly that's unlike most authors. His books can render much emotion in a small way. This book is the presentation of pitiable people and displays people in a realistic light-people with flaws and worries, not characters that do one bad thing and that's it, or characters that are all angel or all villain. The whole book is rather sad in my opinion. Nothing seems to be particularly happy or motivating and then ends on a tragic note. Yet Fitzgerald weaves a web around the reader that makes him want to continue with the rainy-day feeling and leaves you with a sad/wonderful/bittersweet/memorable book.And that is how it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An american classic","review":"Gatsby has achieved legendary status in the American canon because it plumbs perpetually attractive themes: unbridled ambition, wealth, power and their inevitable diminution in the face of the most powerful human reality of all-that these are like springtime blooms, satisfying, evanescent and ultimatley to no purpose. For that alone the book is worth reading time and again, ironically rather like the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"the underside of the American Dream","review":"the underside of the American Dream laid bare by a master of modern prose. Daisy Buchanan, beautiful, utterly superficial, parisitical symbolizes the bankruptcy of the American Dream.

It was required reading. Am I glad it was! Once I began reading, I couldn't let go, so I stayed with it far into the night. Since then I have kept my hard-bound copy, and I feel compelled to delve into it once a year or so. I'm always newly amazed at how GOOD a story it is! The Great Gatsby is a stunning novel, with believable characters, wonderfully haunting descriptions of time and place, and a a fascinating plot with a shattering ending. Once you read it, you don't forget it.PS: The film starring Robert Redford, Mia Farrow and Bruce Dern was great, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is hands down one of my favorite books of all time. What a wonderfully written and poetic story. Fitzgerald did not live long enough to enjoy the success of this book, but he would have been proud to see it so well received now. Best ending of a book ever, and some of the best characters ever written. In my opinion Gatsby mirrors Fitzgerald, and is completely fascinating if not sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the book more than the Movie","review":"This the book that I need to read for my examination. At the beginning, i found this book was difficult and boring, however, when i continuned to read, i was attracted by it. the thing that most attracting me is the description of the characters, the words are beautiful. besides, the author successfully creates the mysterious backgroud of Gatsby, this attracts me to read in order to find out the truth. Finally, i must say that the book is much much more interesting than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"gatsby overrated,but Fitzgerald's stlye exhilarating","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the most overrated books I've ever had the displeasure to read.Don't get me wrong their is stuff to enjoy in the book like F.Scott's rich and simple style and syntax, but the book lacks in other areas. The main one being that the book accomplished it's purpose.That is to show the lifestyle's of the rich that lived in the 20's and Gatsby's obsession wiht Daisy.And it was obsession not love.The problem with the above achievements is that the lifestyles of these people including Gatsby are so incredibly dull it makes for very little interest in the overall story.Also Fitz's choice of having a narrator as opposed to Gatsby's view made for even more yawning.The narration distanced me from Gatsby's obsession toward bland assessments by an outside presence(Nick).If you want to read a good book about obssession read Lolita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to re-think this classic","review":"I originally read this book in high school, but I purchased this e-book to refresh my memory for the new Gatsby movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio coming out in the near future. The only thing it refreshed about my memory is that it's an extremely boring book with syntax that is hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipped through the cracks","review":"Somehow I had completly missed the Great Gatsby. I never read the book in High School or College, so I decided to give it a shot. It is a classic for a reason. The characters and setting are timeless. The pacing of the novel is perfect right up to the conclusion. Check it out before the movie comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Online Publisher-low quality","review":"I was surprised to find that this book was missing the copyright/publishing information usually found on the first page. I looked on Amazon and determined (after I had already received the book) that it was printed-to-order by Lulu publishing, an online single-copy book publisher. There printing was low quality: there were no page numbers, the font was too small (maybe a 9 or 10 pt.) and it has weird formatting. None of this actually prevented me from reading the book. I just finished it and enjoyed the writing style and story. But, the printing style was just annoying. I will be more careful in the future, when buying paperbacks from Amazon, to only buy from reputable publishers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic! Must read for everyone","review":"I read this book in high school but when we decided to read this in my book club I realized I forgot almost the whole story line.

The context was hard to understand at first, but we grew accustomed to it as we progressed. The beginning was slow but it soon picked up pace and was exciting. The story is almost like a soap opera. Fitzgerald uses large words to portray his thoughts and to give the book more detail. Overall great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was expecting more","review":"I began The Great Gatsby with extremely high hopes of the great American novel. In truth, while well done, Gatsby is not as exceptional as many would have you believe. I think perhaps people have gotten to the point of lauding this book simply because it is the popular thing to do. I found it rather disjointed and mildly slow but the quote of the \\"orgastic future\\" and the \\"mouth full of money\\" are unforgettable and might be worth reading the book by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gatsy takes alot of time","review":"The Book is filled with tons of symbolism but you may have to read it more than once to get it.

I gave the teacher a stinker review as well.The books is a pointless exercise in futility about pointless stupid people. The only point to the story is that people with money are just as trashy, if not more so, than people without. The characters have no development, are barely two dimensional, do stupid things for no reason and face no consequences for their veniality.This books is the literary equivalent of being stuck in a window seat on a airplane for 14 hours next to a drunken, smelly creep with bad breath and smelly gas who talks at your for the whole flight about his pointless job. For being such a thin book, it is the hardest reading I have ever had to do.Of course, it is even more aggravating that the kindle edition costs $11 for a book you can get at a bookstore for less than a dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some cheese with that whine?","review":"It seems that complaining is the national pastime, and this book is no exception. It would apear that Mr. Fitzgerald was somewhat unhappy, and decided to tell the world, along the way gving the rest of us something else to complain about. The critisisms of the American dream, and of rich people are true certainly, but hey, we already knew that. He seems to veiw love in a distant manner, as if it never works out for anybody. Self pity is such a wonderful thing, isn't it.

The overflow of useless and uneeded information in this thing makes it several chapters longer than need be. In fact, if Fitzgerald had written this book properly (no extra junk I could care less about) it would have been EXACTLY two sentences long- \\"I'm rich.\\" and \\"Oh, boo hoo.\\" The plot line resembles an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 (namely \\"Let's sit around and whine about being rich. Next we'll get drunk and call each other names, fight, and run each other over!\\" SHUT UP ALREADY!) I can rarely can say this, but I HATE HATE HATE HATE this book!

The last chapter says it all, the rest is filler. It is considered a literary masterpiece according to the preface. What makes it a masterpiece is the rewrite Fitzgerald did to make it so boring. It is a tale of monied people leaving shattered lives behind for someone else to pick up, but written with priggish, even highhanded prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype","review":"If people read this book without knowing its history of success, what would they think of it? My guess is that it would be forgotten very quickly. If you are a high school student assigned to read this book, then unfortunately you have to suffer through it. If you are a teacher, please save the children and assign them a more interesting book. For those reading for pleasure, I recommend skipping this poorly written book. The characters are cartoons.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatly Stupid Gatsby","review":"In my time I have read many novels, most of which were at least pleasing and gave me a sense of having learned something.

I didn't know what to expect so i was really surpised at how good the writing is. I agree with the reviewer who said the genius of this book is not just the story but the meanings hidden within the text. It really is extraordinary writing. You could analyze almost every sentence in this book and find a hidden or alternate meaning. The story wasn't edge of your seat action but it was still very interesting.

I bought this book knowing it was a classic (I love classics). I expected it to be more entertaining. For one thing it's very dated. I had trouble understanding what was going on most of the time. Another thing were it's racial undertones. The way mister Wolfheim was portrayed (a shady selfish businessmen) is an obvious anti-semantic stereotype. I couldn't get myself into the story because the characters were unlikable. I found myself checking the clock more than reading the story.

The Great Gatsby, however, is probably one of the only books I've read that I hate.It is the story of a man who, basically, talks about nothing. The plot is nonexistent, just the ramblings of a man who's confused about society. The characters are either boring or not developed enough. The worst part about the book is that you get the feeling that F. Scott Fitzgerald is going to hit you with a great, dramatic, thought-provoking ending, and nothing happens at the end. When I finished, I was left with the feeling of \\"Okay, what was that all about?\\" I can understand that it is a reflection of the 1920s, but certainly not a very good reflection.This is a book you should read when there is absolutely nothing else to read.

The book is short and barely has any character development. You don't route for anyone nor really care about finding about anybody's back story - including Gatsby himself. The book does do an ok job of portraying that \\"rich, post-World War I, 1920s era apathy generation\\" but the problem with portraying apathy is that your readers are going to be apathetic. There is one part of the book that has some \\"action\\" in it but it's so shoe horned in for the sole purpose of rapping up the story that it's almost unbelievable. For those that poo-poo Twilight for \\"stalker\\" type mentality of Edward, you have the same behavior in Gatsby as well. I was very underwhelmed and feel sorry for the countless public school students who had to suffer through this book. The one positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as boring as \\"Wuthering Heights\\".

But I was wrong. the book was kind of boring and it didn't seem complete. it was all about parties and stuff. It was also sort of vague. I felt as though I didn't know any of the characters. I just got a very brief history. I couldn't grasp them. This is the first time I have ever encountered this. This book was just plain boring. And yes, I did finish it, for those who read my 'Brothers Karamazov' review and hated it. But, I will not give up on Fitzgerald. I soon plan on reading 'This Side of Paradise,' or 'The Beautiful and the Damned.' Hopefully they will be more interesting than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Tasty","review":"This book is a fine example of books that will be entertaining to those who like to read and those that are inapropriate for School purposes. this is a more pature book and i believe that it was writen with great passion and this is shown in Mr. Gatsby himself. with all the tragety in this book and the love story that is displayed, i would recommend this to anyone who wants to read a classic but not to anyone looking for just any old book and doesn't give it the respect it deserves.

It takes you on an amazing ride of emotions, from being piqued at the beginning to depressed at the end. Although the story isn't brilliant, the beauty of this book isn't in the story.

My daughter read in high school and really liked it. Due to it's short length this is almost more of a novella. The decadence of that era was brilliantly portrayed. The grand parties were painted so vividly. Having not read spoilers I was a little shocked at the ending of it. I wasn't expecting it so it was refreshing to read a classic that I didn't already know the ending of."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Its easy to see why this is considered a classic of American literature. Historians see it as a mirror of those who lived during the Jazz Age. To me at a deeper level, it deals with the issue of what you want in life or out of life, and what you do when you find you can't get it, and you realize you can't. And, no amount of money or power or friends can get you there. To those peers living during the self-indulgent Jazz Age, the Great Gatsby speaks prophetically about the realiy of not finding satisfaction through indulging. The way to realization of goals is to be ethical and principled. The only one in the book who is that and is thus the hero turns out not to be Gatsby, not matter how great, but the narrator who is the \\"least among these\\", telling the story and is a distant observer of those caught in the chase. Anyone contemplating setting out on life's journey to find fame and fortune ought to consult the Great Gatsby before going too far down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"Although I am not exactly old enough to read some of the other classics, The Great Gatsby is my favorite book of all time. Its plot is tightly knit, so when Fitzgerald goes out on what seems to be a tanget, he knits it back into the story miraculously. Gatsby himself is one, if not the, most memorable charater in all of literature.The Great Gatsby has it all- drama, suspense, irony, romance, and comedy. The reader can see how the past affects the future and how amazing and sometimes foolish human nature can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"The Great Gatsby has been reknowned for some time as one of the greatest pieces of American fiction. And, after reading the short but incredible novel, I will have to agree with this assertion. The story is vivid and colourful, and the narration truly engages the reader and makes him/her feel that s/he is living the story. You will feel the pain of long lost love, the shallowness of the urban-socialite community, and respect and admiration for an incredibly well written novel. The novel is fairly short, which is one of the strengths of the novel, as it is not verbose or overdrawn.

I couldn't believe that none of my friends liked it. I thought it was such an intricately-woven story and a biting social commentary. It was so illustrative of 1920s culture and society.

This book certainly does not attempt to tackle any of life's problems. I give this book two stars rather than one, however, because Fitzgerald deserves credit for the mystical, beautifully flowing,light, prose which he uses.

While it does depict a historically accurate and believable account of the 1920s, not one of the characters seems to be anything more that a superficial comsumer or partygoer. Through the entire novel, Nick Carraway, our straighfoward, if not boring, narrator is a shadow of a real man, showing no courage or brain for himself. In the end, just when he could stand up and change the entire point of view for the characters, he chooses to stay comfortable in his little corner of his unimpressionable life.

In the story his over use of meaningless description and verbosity indicates to the reader that he was trying too hard, and it would be unrealistic to believe that this is a natural voice. As an example of writing style, I would expect it from someone in grade 6, with a dictionary. The sentences are basic and blunt, and interspersed with horrendously redundant words that were probably put there to make the author look smart, since they were more than 5 letters long of course!.

I take that to mean that there wasn't too terribly much there.There was an added difficulty in the fact that I didn't like any of the characters. If you can't stand any of the people in a story, then you don't really care about what happens to them, and you start to skip large sections of stories that involve them....Anyway, I'll say this: It was OK.

In this case, it did not. He just skimmed over the important parts and honed in on pointless details. The entire book had a very ghostly quality; I always felt like something was there, but it was mostly undetectable. Still, it has its good points - I liked the way Fitzgerald protrayed Gatsby's fair-weather friends, and the tragic ending that could be compared to a Shakespearean tragedy, when no one is left but the narrator :).

To whoever it was who set these prices: I think it's disgusting that you would pull a dirty trick like that on your customers, knowing that a lot of people buy the Kindle edition first, without looking at the paperback. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.This book would have been an easy sale to me, Amazon, because I would really prefer to have it on my Kindle. But I will instead be buying the paperback from Barnes & Noble, even if it comes out to more than $12.99, out of sheer principle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and capitivating","review":"I read The Great Gatsby years ago and selected it again because I wanted to read it before the movie comes out in 2013 and I wanted to read a well written book. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is excellent and after reading so many poorly written books, I really enjoyed this one. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"This book was one of the most adorable books ever. It amazed me that Fitzgerald made so many references to transient yet important moments in life which we usually take for granted in life. It evoked feelings in me that made me think of the emotions behind a first kiss or the ones evoked when watching a couple bloom and fall apart. Simply Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a well written novel that portrays life in the 1920s in America. It reveals many of the dishonest motivators present in that time period and also present in today's society. Some of these motivators are lust, greed, money, and love. Fitzgerald causes the readed to reflect on how ethical these influencers are. This is a very worth while book to read. It caused me to question what motivates me in my own life. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot better than the majority of the required reading","review":"I recently read this book for my 11th grade Honors English class. I was only assigned to read up to page 30 but I just kept on reading. This is truly a classic piece of American literature. Not only is the book enjoyable, it is easy to read. This book shapes the Jazz Age as it tells a tale of lives of the people in it. F. Scott Fitzgerald also throws in a few autobiographical notes as well. This is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even In Perfection, Flaws","review":"The favorite novel of romantics, it is put together like a mysterious machine from another world. Interestingly, movies can't get close to portraying Gatsby's passion. The code has never been broken by those who wish to trade on or exploit this tale. There are a couple of flaws in the marble, but that just adds to its mysterious greatness. This novel is read, and then re-read and then re-read. There is nothing else like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"I purchased this book for my high school lit class and found it to be a huge rip-off. Besides lacking page numbers, the opening epigraph, and consistent formatting, the copy is also printed in an extremely small font, making it quite difficult to read. Save your money and buy one of the other versions of this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! An American classic.","review":"Fitzgerald captures Americas \\"roaring twenties\\" with great detail in this classic novel. The story takes many twists and turns and keeps the reader in the dark about Gatsby. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read an American masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can understand why this is a classic now.","review":"Before reading the Great Gatsby I considered all the reviews were probably just hype. I finally decided to pick it up after the modern library listed as the number 2 book in the 19th century. I can see now why it is a classic. Fitzgerald's magnificent mastery of story telling had me entranced. This simple story set in the 20's moved me emotionally, and turned me into a Gatsby fan. This was a beautiful book about a misunderstood man, and it touched me. I am sincerely glad that I finally read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware. This is a miniature version","review":"While it states in very small print at the very end of the description the measurements in mm, many people either don't take the time to interpret it into inches or don't even see it.

However, they serve to illuminate the story further than I would have ventured to go at alone. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitzgerald's Jazz Age masterpiece.","review":"This classic American novel is the story of Jay Gatsby, that fabulously wealthy Long Island party giver, as related by his less affluent neighbor Nick Carraway. Written in 1925 at the height of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby expertly captures the 1920s and all its excesses.As Nick Carraway begins this intriguing tale wherein wealth and gayety mask underlying tragedy, Gatsby is presented as an enigmatic character. No one really seems to know who Gatsby is or where he obtained his fortune. Because of that knowledge vacuum, multiple myths concerning the man circulate, growing more fantastic with each telling.But ultimately, Nick and the reader learn that Gatsby is a mere mortal whose inner life is a less than satisfying one and whose moment in the sun is destined to be short-lived. Much like (as we now know) the Jazz Age itself.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not order this version of a great book","review":"This is the cheapest version of any book I've ever seen! I wondered if I had received the wrong book when I saw how THIN this paperback is. Well, here's how they did it: The print is so small as to be unreadable, in addition to the ink's being so light that it is grey instead of black. The pages are not even numbered! The paper is of lowest quality. Overall it's an embarrassment of poor quality. Mr. Fitzgerald would not approve and neither do I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitzgerald never disappoints","review":"I've read and reread this book since I was in junior high school. The story is capital, but it's the writing that always stands out. Fitzgerald is a master of American English prose, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC","review":"Vivid imagery, vast landscapes, and mysterious characters make for an intriguing read. Although, a bit long-winded at times, still a fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Get Into Story","review":"This is a wonderful book that describes a love story set in the 1920's. Gatsby was a man that seemed to always get what he wanted, and he wanted a married woman. Sad ending, but most love stories have to end sadly."},{"rating":"2","title":"has what some books forget to add","review":"Unlike many novels and stories, Great Gatsby was not dragged down by its meaning. Instead of coating every page with out of place symbols or stupid dialogue, it worked on the art of telling a good story and letting the reader learn his message from that. There were no pretentious passages that distracted the reader from enjoying the book. Everything added to reading the book and learning from it while still being entertained. This is what literature should do."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER as AN ADULT","review":"I don't know why I decided to read this, I don't even know if I read it in HS, but as an adult the nuances of the book are much more relevant. This is a timeless read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious Consumerism and It's 'Benefits'.","review":"This is a story of how loud 'leaders' who lack honesty and respect can mislead others who tend to be followers. It is a story of self-centeredness, disrespect, dishonesty and obvious consumerism. It was so discouraging that I finally quit the book, which I very seldom do. There is just no entertainment in self-indulged depravity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Easy Read","review":"Loved this book. I couldn't put it down, I read it in a couple of days. I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific","review":"if the book doesn't immediately grab you, it soon will.amazing. too bad that in his time, fitzgerald didn't get the credit he so richly deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"An interesting read. The style of writing is descriptive and not very difficult to understand. The comment on Daisy by Gatsby \\"Her voice is full of money\\" is explanatory itself. And the last paragraph where the author describes the future as a green pasture which eludes us , but we strech our arms further every evening and one fine morning .... is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!","review":"What I love most about the Great Gatsby is how it depicts what the 1920's were like. It gives you a taste of what it would be like to live back then and how society functioned. It brought together the 2 worlds of Gatsby and Daisy and George and Myrtle and showed how much they contrasted. Fitzgerald really does a great job of installing images into your head of what different scenes looked like-especially the huge parties Gatsby would have at his house. I really liked the story itself although it could be seen as depressing. Oh well, I guess all stories can't always have a happy ending!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The 1920's Are Over","review":"They say a book can never get old, and with age they become classics. The Great Gatsby is a prime counterexample of this.In my opinion, a book that is entertaining and exciting needs to stretch the mind. It needs to use great imagination. Imagination makes mystery and murder novels scary and thrilling. Imagination makes a sci-fi interesting. What is there to imagine about The Great Gatsby? There are murders, but not very unique ones. If I wanted to read a good murder mystery, I would go to Thomas Harris. As for the love story The Great Gastby is placed around, I see this as the only conflict in the book. Every event in the entire book was based on this unrealistic relationship between Daisy, Tom, and Jay.To conclude, I would expect this story in a 1920's newspaper rather than being a mass produced as a \\"classic\\" novel. The only use I have for this book is a sleeping-pill substitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"I struggled to get through - then I failed the test.","review":"Okay. There's a program at my high school in the English department, called \\"Accelerated Reader\\". You are assigned a book off of a list, and you are to read it, then take a test about it on the computer. The program is quite helpful (I think), but when I was assigned The Great Gatsby, I was struggling to get through it! There were maybe one or two parts (for me) that made me want to keep reading. The rest I had to jam down my throat. It is well-written, therefore I give it at least one star. But it was so \\"boring\\", that I failed my test on the computer!

I argue that a book that is painful to read, however perfect the style or structure, can never be 'brilliant.'It failed to entertain me and it failed to convey its fundamental mesage of social criticism. It is a waste of precious time."},{"rating":"1","title":"great bore","review":"I really tried to get into this book. Sorry, I could not get past the shallow, dislikeable people and situations. Prose and symbolism are nothing if accompanied by a boring, unreadable plot. Maybe that is the point, but there are plenty of classic books that have it all: prose, symbolism, good plot, good characterizations, action, social commentary etc. It seemed like this book was an outline of a novel where the author sketched the main points, threw in some symbolism, then decided not to fill in the outline and create any depth to the story. Maybe that was the point, but it made the book really lacking. It does not require a thin, shallow book to portray thin, shallow people or times."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY THE HELL DO SCHOOLS USE THIS BOOK","review":"This book is a perfect example why kids don't like to read or find it boring.

I just wish that someone would have warned me before I read it. I read constantly and have been for 25 years or so and this was one of the least engaging books I've ever read. I feel as if the people that read it and laud it are just being followers for the most part. I'm being very serious when I say that I honestly cannot believe this book ever got famous.

It was boring and had no point. Even though it is apparently one of the greatest Am. novels from the twenties, it is bad. I dont like any of the characters.

The narrator(Nick) is very honest in his evaluations of other characters, which keeps the book fair, showing the good and bad side of all characters including the narrater himself.The story is about a man(Jay Gatsby) whose past is very shady and the source to his wealth is unknown. He throws lavish parties and hope's to see his past love(Daisy) in one of those parties.

Daisy's irresponsibility inI. wanting stupidity in her daughter(boy do I feel sorry for the girl)- there were some women then who wanted moreII. letting Gatsby (her LOVER for God's sake) take the blame for running Myrtle over when she drove his car, getting Gatsby killed.4.

This book is called the Great Gatsby, but everyone in the book treats Gatsby like he's regular size. What's so great about that? I mean, if he were a giant or something, that would be totally sweet, but if he's just a normal size guy, then why does he get a whole book about his greatness?All I really remember about this book is there are some strange things about lights on the shore, and a chick named Daisy, which made me think about the Dukes of Hazard a little bit, but that's it. I sorta vaguely remember Gatsby fighting a jive talking robot, but it was in one of the later chapters, so I won't ruin it for you.You can read this book if you want, but I'd recommend you try and figure out who is better: Kitt from Knight Rider, or the Orange car from Dukes of Hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's sad when a good author can't write well","review":"It truly is. I am quite sure that Fitzgerald is more than capable of writing a work of art. Unfortunately, this is not it.The plot is very tiresome and the book gets boring FAST. The dialogue is simply the hobnobbing of a bunch of snobs.All of the characters are quite one-dimensional which allows for minimal character growth and even less character depth.The only redeeming quality of this book is its use of \\"color symbolism\\".

People describe F. Scott's Fitzgerald's writing as poetic, and indeed it is at some points in the book. However I believe that as a result of this, Gatsby is much more difficult to read and comprehend.

Now it is time that somebody tells him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: disaster","review":"I remember listening to my first Haujobb CD clearly; it was an experience that still goes on. With this CD I can also tell you that this is my last Haujobb CD. This band had its time, and impressed the entire industrial community.Now they have reached the point where inspiration is gone, and where the singer (Meyer?) clearly has lost touch with reality: his singing is embarrasing and as stated by another reviewer WAAAY out of tune many many times. In none of the tunes can I find the sound of the REAL Haujobb, the sound from Solutions for a small planet and former CD's. This CD sounds more like Cleaner, Meyers sideproject which has also reached the bottom.Dear reader, it is time to find new bands and new CD's, because Haujobb is no longer the leader of the pack, it is a waste of time and money, and for Meyer and co. it is no doubt close to the end of Haujobb era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change, yes, for the worse","review":"Whatever category you want to put this CD in, it wont make the music any better.

They make use of artistic dissonance! The lyrics are consistantly good; the only ones I dislike is the vocoded set at the end of CD - last song. The tunes are spunky, interesting, varied, breath-takingly textural, and a style of dark not available everywhere. The best part is the fact that they are the very opposite of boring and repetitive. This CD is a fantastic example of DnB, IDM, and the other styles all incorporated here. Obviously, if you can't appreciate the themes and techniques employed here, don't buy it.

That being said, I have to point out to the music fan(s) from Denmark, I suspect it's the same person doing this, because it's all bad reviews and his (?) only complaint is bad singing (which I don't think it's all *that* bad) and it's not old Haujobb.

I thought that the videography was great, beautiful scenery etc, but I ended up having to rent this one again just so I could rewind to catch all the parts I couldn't understand due to Gerard Depardieu's accent. Why do did they have a Frenchman playing an Italian in Spain, but speaking English. We as a class decided that there was a lot of Historical inacurracy, not only in events as they happen in the movie, but also in the character of Columbus as well. Sorry folks. He was the not NICE GUY that this film makes him out to be. I also felt that they needed to explore a bit more into the tensions of the crew during the voyage and after landing. This would have made those scenes much better. I recommend this film for the beautiful scenery and the good acting (albeit hard to understand sometimes), but I would not recommend it if you are a stickler for historical truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked, big time!","review":"It sucked hard.

The fine french actor Gerard Depideueu was not in top form here and that's a total upset. Usually most historical films i've seen are done with good taste and do not lingere on and on with pointless melodrama, which is this film's biggest problem aside from the poor acting. I personally believe the title role shoud of gone to Mel Gibson or Liam Neeson instead, actors who can actually make a historical figure more compelling to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"1492 DVD comments","review":"One of my fav films ever!! only disappointment: couldn't get it to play on my computer!

What is the problem here?Also excellent is the soundtrack, one of the best ones I've ever heard.The main characters are played by Gerald Depardieu and Armand Assante, and their English is not to understand, which is why I'd like a nice DVD with subtitles. . At 150 minutes, this film dragged in spots....yet the visuals and music are just too good to pass up, but this movie needs to get some respect here and presented with a transfer worthy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Movie!","review":"This film is so underappreciated it's sad. This film makes us feel like were going back in time and reliving the life of Christopher Columbus.This film has a great cast. Including Gerard Deapardieu who plays Columbus. He is very CONVINCING playing the 15th century mariner who was the first explorer to conquer unknown lands.Other noteworthy performances include Armand Assante who plays Sanchez. Sigourney Weaver who plays Queen Isabel. Tcheky Karyo who plays Pinzon and Michael Wincott who plays Moxica. The cinematography is first class and the film is superbly directed by Ridley Scott.

Period.","review":"It is utterly unclear to me, what has the editorial found \\"ridiculous\\" about this movie. Yes, the Depardieu's accent is obvious, but I've never had any difficulty understanding his lines. Besides, let's not forget the fact that Columbus wasn't an english as well. The music is simply magnificent. It alone brings at east 3+ stars to the rating. The plot is very dynamic and action-packed. Within two and a half hours we see not one, but two journeys to the West and back. Moreover, due to such limited time, the film shorts some of the developments which could otherwise make it a much deeper, dramatic and touching movie. For that reason I gave it 4 stars. on the other hand, Mr. Marshall Fine, the editorial reviewer, clearly makes an example of ill attitude and politics taking over common sense and objectiveness - the very principles of fair criticism. I'd wonder if he ever passed a highschool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie for history classes","review":"I showed the first hour or so to my 7th grade students - up to the point when Columbus makes landfall. It was age appropriate, up to that point. Then comes the naked natives and the bloodshed, so don't show the movie after that. If you're looking for a good video - something better than the cheesy school videos kids often see - get this one. Oh, and it didn't matter that the cover or menu page were in Portuguese. The film is in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise Found","review":"Ridley Scott, who also directed Blade Runner and Gladiator, had an equally impressive take on the great Columbus. Columbus was really a great mariner and that is all; the movie shows this richly, as he is at a loss amidst the political infighting in Spain and later in the colonies. Tapped to be the first governor of Hispanola(now Haiti and the Dominican Republic), he was so inept as to antagonize the native peoples as well as his own fellow Europeans. The movie captures this with vivid outdoor vistas, driving traditional music, actual natives(brought to the islands from South America for the filming), and the beauty attached to seafaring. Historically, it is as accurate as Hollywood gets(50%?), which is fine. This is 500 years ago+, and the history has segued into mythology by now, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"1492 import","review":"I bought the import DVD and it appears to be a digitized version of the VHS widescreen.

It doesn't do Ridley's film justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary","review":"This movie is an awful misrepresentation of the truth. Columbus was not a peace loving advocate of the \\"indians.\\" He and his men were responsible for rape, death, and enslavement. Hundreds of thousands of natives died! Our history textbooks are filled with lies and dangerous films like these simply continue ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible misrepresentation","review":"As a fictional tale of a man who did not historically exist, this film could potentially be a decent movie. As an attempt to portray history, however, it is a wretched failure. Not only does this film perpetuate the false heroic image of Christopher Columbus that already exists excessively, but it magnifies it. Columbus is portrayed as endlessly peaceful and sympathetic and harboring too much fascination with the \\"Indian\\" cultures to concern himself with the quest for gold. This is an outrageously false portrayal of a man who led a ruthless slavery system followed by genocide of Native American cultures. A film like this is dangerous because it is interpreted as a true account of history when, in fact, it is horribly false"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful filmwork","review":"Ridley Scott put together some absolutely stunning footage in this film.

He showed Columbus to be a determined man. The scenery was incredible. The palm trees and the water falls gave it a natural look. The wild life was incredible. Costumes for the queen and for the Indians were extrodinary. The dramatic fight scenes were very entertaining. This movie deserves four out of five stars. This movie is not a movie for children. It had very graphic fighting scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie, but a little to long","review":"1492 Conquest of Paradise is a movie with great cinematography, and is filled with great material. It is a great portrayel of Columbus and his accomplishments, although it is not completely accurate. Some of the parts are hard to understand because Columbus has a pretty bad accent, but it does not affect the quality of the movie much. The movie is also a little to long, but not boring. The movie gives a great view of Columbus, and I recomend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Marvelous!","review":"I rarely see films on the big-screen that are as complex and haunting as this one.

A perefect movie with a perfect score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break!","review":"First of all, Gerard Depardieu is OBVIOUSLY FRENCH! I don't believe Christopher Columbus talked like Inspector Clousseau! They could have at least attempted to be historically accurate. The film also makes it look like he was some beneficiary of the natives, though he was the one who ordered their enslavement in most cases to search for gold for his own wealth and standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely watchable on two fronts","review":"By many accounts, this movie was poorly made; certainly not one of Ridley Scott's finest moments.The second reason this movie is not good is its take on historical fiction. Columbus is portrayed as a tolerant and patient man, kind to the natives. He also portrayed as a man of science. Nothing could be further from the truth. The first thing Columbus did was write about enslaving the natives and showed little to no concern for their welfare. While Columbus utilized the most advanced technology of the time, he put most of his faith in religion and mysticism - hardly the characteristics of a man of reason and science.Historical fiction can be forgiven if it is entertaining (like Scott's Gladiator). But going too far by including many historical inaccuracies (like The Patriot) distracts from an otherwise good movie (like The Patriot). Unfortunately, this movie combines the worst of both: not entertaining or historically accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot see this on my new dvd player","review":"I have to send this back.

Along with detailing Columbus's first trip to the New World, they feel the need to show his second trip as well which takes up a good hour and a half. It is very hard to follow at some points and I found 4-5 places during the movie where it could've ended right then and there. As a whole, this movie could have been made much better and a lot easier to follow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific album by an under-rated artist","review":"Dave Mason somehow got lost in the shuffle of his on-again, off-again relationship with Steve Winwood and Traffic. And then he had a rough relationship with the Blue Thumb label, although Alone Together is an absolute classic.When he got out from under all that Dave Mason next showed up on the Columbia label, with It's Like You Never Left. What a great surprise this was. Guest vocals from Graham Nash, great guitar work throughout. Stevie Wonder too!And the songs are great. Maybe and Every Woman are two beautiful love songs. Headkeeper, in another incarnation, as good as the Blue Thumb version. Misty Morning Stranger, one of my all-time favorites. And one day I'd love to hear the full version of Side Tracked, a little gem of an instrumental.I played cuts from this album all the time on my college radio show nearly 30 years ago, and for me, it's one of the best albums of the 70s. A small treasure, to be sure, but a treasure just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you own this album?","review":"When \\"It's like You Never Left\\" was released, most of mainstream music media (those who cared) concurred that it didn't live up to Dave Mason's first solo effort \\"Alone Together\\". That one is a classic for sure, but this record is on that level, as far as I am concerned. They are two different albums for sure, but \\"It's like You Never Left\\" is unparalleled for its deep melodies, serene vocals, and musicianship. There is no need to mention each song, because I like all of them. Especially moving is \\"The Lonely Ones\\": incredibly soaring melody and vocals, replete with Stevie Wonder playing his best harmonica. I can't tell you how many times my Brother and I have played \\"Maybe\\" with guitar and flute when we get together. My college band played no less than four songs from this album. If you like real music but you are not familiar with this one, then you have certainly missed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"But where's adam beach and graham greene","review":"I bought the movie because I like the native american actors Means and Beach and greene.

There should have been a higher number of stars to choose from on your rating scale, because to her this movie is worth at least six stars. In the forty years she has been watching movies she hasn't found any other actor to perform the way Daniel Day-Lewis does here. If you liked his performance in The Last of the Mohicans you will love this movie. He is the true definition of a what a real man should look and act like."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a guy","review":"Daniel Day-Lewis must be the most versatile film actor in the world. He looks like a different person in almost every film he makes. I assume that's the real Day-Lewis in this flick about the rebellion in Northern Ireland, revenge and absolution. His romantic interest, Emily Watson, puts in a good performance too. Day-Lewis looks a lot different than he did in \\"Gangs of New York\\", \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\", \\"My Left Foot\\" and \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" but he is just as compelling in his performance. I thought this movie degraded a bit at the end with its somewhat Hollywood finale, but otherwise I enjoyed it. If you like substantial filmmaking, good acting, great drama, unfamiliar vistas and a good story, you'll enjoy it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting...dynamite movie","review":"Highly recommended ... and I generally hate boxing movies. In fact, I hate them so much I stayed away from this film when it was first released despite the fact that Daniel Day Lewis, an actor whose work I adore, starred in it. Dumb. I saw it awhile ago on HBO and was so blown away by it I bought the DVD. All I can say is, it's not your average boxing movie. Yes, it's about a helluva boxer but it's also a very thoughtful political drama and a great love story. It's beautifully written and the entire cast is superb. The scenes between Daniel and Emily Watson smolder with both understatement and intensity. It probably helps if the viewer knows a little about the Catholic v Protestant divide in Northern Ireland (still part of the U.K.) but any movie lover who listens well should have no problem following it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd format","review":"dvd wouldn't work in my dvd player..dvd player screen read..will not play this format,returned to amazon..refund was prompt and without question..i thank amazon for their good customer service..tom"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Cast Very Good Story","review":"This Movie Was O ne Of The Best I Have Ever Seen.

Their love scenes are some of the most honest, intelligent and erotic ever filmed. Watson plays a woman I can actually identify with, as well as respect--which is a rarity. And, although this film isn't nearly as great as the two previous Sheridan-Day Lewis collaborations, both of them do things we've never seen before. It is one of the few films in recent years that is definitely worth watching, and can be recommended to friends, with a good conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale of moral relativism","review":"I saw this film, with high expectations, in the theater. I thought Sheridan had done a good, though not great, job on \\"In the Name of the Father,\\" capturing some of the reality of the Irish situation.\\"The Boxer\\" has no appealing characters. Brian Cox comes closest. The British are portrayed in the age-old, inaccurate role of \\"honest brokers\\" among the irrational, bloodthirsty Irish stereeotypes. The IRA man trying to mess up Cox's peace initiative seems to represent Sheridan's attempt to wrap up a goofy and unwieldy plot.As the choppy plot unfolded, I expected that at least the Day-Lewis character would resist adultery with his friend's wife. This struggle, though nearly lost in the unlikely political plot, was the most compelling thing in the movie. Unfortunately, the film dashed even that minimal expectation. Day-Lewis rekindles his romance with a woman who is married to his imprisoned friend. So why should the audience empathize with these characters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The product I received would not play.

I am reminded of a Lester Bangs article on heavy metal describing how mid 1960s garage bands transformed into hard rock/heavy metal later on and The Litter (much like MC5) fit this profile very accurately. The guitar distortion was still evident, but the tone was much sharper, guitar solos more abrasive and prominent, bass and drums, much deeper and the vocals are well mixed. The songs were longer (the epic \\"Future of the Past\\") and less radio friendly in a non underground FM sense, but are nonetheless memorable and powerful. The Litter could definitely hold their own among their American and British counterparts of the time when it came to raw energy and heaviness.

On further inspection of the perfume inside the dove bottle appeared to be plastic instead of the usual glass dove bottle I am so familiar to seeing.

The case is reopened when the disappearances begin again, and Dalziel finds the original cast of characters reassembled, with some in surprising new roles.If you are new to Hill as a writer, you are in for a real treat.

Trainspotting isn't as depressive and dark as RFAD.It has it's own moments.The English accent used is quite amusing and difficult to follow but you get the hang of it.I laughed out loud 4 times and cried 0 times.Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Different View On Trainspotting...","review":"...but a very real view on the horrors of seriously hard drugs such as heroin. Sharp, witty, superbly acted and directed this film offers bright and clever humour along with deeply harrowing warnings for everyone to take notes from. A group of disillusioned Scottish youngsters are at the bottom and digging themselves even further down. Addicted to heroin and involved in crime to feed his habit one of them, Renton, (McGregor) decides, yet again, to give it up. But how on earth is he going to do that when his loser junkie friends just won't leave him alone?Ewan is good as the guy narrating the story but Robert Carlisle (playing a seriously dangerous psycho) and Ewen Bremner steal the show with their performances.Gritty, scary stuff which everyone should see to help them realise that the drugs just don't work and they most definitely make things worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Book","review":"Read the book by Irvine Welsh if you liked the movie--a masterpiece by a very talented and fresh author. By the way, Welsh appears in the movie as the drug dealer \\"Mikey\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"This must be one of the best movies ever. In my top 5! The surealisum of how live acutally is comes through in this very entertaining movie. Its deep and touchs on some of lifes more harsh side, but also is lighthearted and very comical - cool ending. Awesome, awesome movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It figures the USA version would be censored...","review":"What is up with America? Movies here can show all the violence they could ever want... but they can't show Ewan's penis?! This is my gripe: I found this movie absolutely incredible when I first saw it a few years ago in France. Now that I'm back in the USA and I bought the video, I still think it's incredible... only it REALLY bothers me that the entire clubbing scene was cut out of the US version!!! That part was hilarious! :-( I recommend that everyone to fly to Europe and rent the movie over there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone over 30","review":"Yes, it is a very well-done movie. It is one of extremes. If you can handle life in the low levels of the drug scene, then watch this one. If you prefer a more upbeat story, look elsewhere. I loved the Matrix, and this is nothing like it. I give it a 2 for subject matter/content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too many 5 star reviews here","review":"There are 2 to 3 moments of humor in this film and 2 to 3 moments of brutal reality. Otherwise, it's far too disjointed and muddled to rate any higher than two stars. Basically shows the depressing and pathetic lives of severe heroin addicts and how difficult it is to quit using. Unless you've been living under a rock, you essentially know heroin is dangerous, addicting, and difficult to quit. No new material here folks. \\"Traffic\\" has nailed this plague far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever","review":"this movie is the worst ever. its nasty and stuped. i hate it, and would not recomend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realistic? I don't EVEN think so","review":"Realistic drug addicts... who look like movie stars!! Yeah right! The Jonny Lee Miller character was always so doped up he had no time for anything else (letting his baby die of neglect) yet he somehow found the time to keep his baby-blonde hair perfectly bleached and coiffed."},{"rating":"1","title":"why wait so long?","review":"The laserdisc version of this film with all of these bonus features was released before DVD became a format. Why did they wait so long for this? I wound up ordering a Canadian version of the movie to get the deleted scenes, and now suddenly they release all of the same stuff that should have been on the original release? Is there a good reason why the studios release junk versions of a film, and then five years later release a special edition?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This was a great yet disturbing movie. I am glad I saw it but it is not the type of movie I'd ever watch again, because its too unpleasant, kinda like \\"Seven\\" or \\"The Day of the Locust\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scottish depicted reality of addiction and life's struggle","review":"This is frankly one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. Too many people write off this picture because of the harsh content, but if you get past the non-naiveness of the film, there are some true life lessons to be learned. It's documentation of addicition is neither biased towards the pain or pleasure of it, so no this film doesn't advocate any kind of drug use. It does wow you with the surrealistic effects and awesome soundtrack with one of the most beautifully written movies screenplays ever. The constant flow of the plot and the struggles of Renton and company are just awe-inspiring. If you like the film, I reccomend the book. It's written in scottish toungue and makes the dialect even more interesting. Deserves more acclaim. One of my personal favorites of all time. Just too deep not to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of sight, mate!","review":"Sons & daughters of Alexander Trocchi, rejoice! Although I couldn't quite understand Robert Carlyle, his performance as a Scottish Joe Pesci violence-for-the-sake-of-violence Francis Begbie was high-voltage. I plan to get the book now. I've seen the film 6 times, and it's always the same - f***in' bloody great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW TO REDEFINE COOL BRITTANIA IN 94 MINUTES","review":"This film epitomises everything that Hollywood isnt, and I love it. Superb performances from a cast not shy to make the parts their own and that comes across well in the context of making the story believable and dramatic. This film doesnt condone drugs, but it gives meaning to the beast, \\"What they forget, is the pleasure of it all\\" - Renton. Im still undecided on the greatest motion picture ever, Trainspotting or The Empire Strikes Back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray is completely featureless","review":"I actually like this movie quite a bit but I was a fool and didn't check out any of the features the blu ray version had before buying it. There is none, zero, zilch. Every feature that is on the 2004 collectors edition should be on this. I hate to sound petty its not a big deal in the grand scheme of life I just felt like they should of added all those extras with all the room blu rays have. Movie itself is 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous","review":"Like I said, simply outrageous in all the best ways. The thick accents did make it difficult to follow the dialogue at times, and I am pretty good at understanding accents. Mark's withdrawal scenes in his bedroom were incredible. Not just a heroin-is-bad story, but a true slice of life flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this. At first it's shocking, and yes a little difficult to understand but concentrate for a little while and you'll pick it up, it is in English afterall. I've also read the book (absolutely amazing) and I have to say that I think the adaptation was done really well considering the length and depth of the story line and all the characters.Now just a correction... this film is set in SCOTLAND not Ireland... as it states that Renton goes into \\"the worst bathroom in SCOTLAND\\" not to mention the references to Scottish cities and of course Renton's tirade about how horrible it is to be Scottish.... but i suppose if some people weren't so busy reading the subtitles they might have actually gotten the chance to watch the film....But seriously it is definitely worth seeing, it's dark, funny, raw and very NOT hollywood infested.. :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring to do what Hollywood doesn't","review":"A film which educates and ultimately deters people from the use of Heroin. A film which successfully threads humour with shocking realism.It was said in Britain that the Americans weren't reasy for this movie, and by it's realtively unknown status in the US that would seem a relavant point. Maybe it's the Scottish accents, or the far-from-hollywood feel of the film, but for the rest of us, this is a well-made and thought provoking film."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"I worked on this movie and was really proud to be a part if it. It tells the story like it is, no pussyfooting. DON'T MISS IT. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really Great British film","review":"Based on a novel by Irving Welsh, this film focusses on the adventures of a small band of friends united by their dependency on heroin. They have good times and bad times and eventually, they set out on a scheme to make them all rich.The characters are, in no way, every day people but the film makes them all believable and, in the end the viewer finds that they are relating to the characters and caring about the outcome. Despite the hysteria that greeted this film in the UK's conservative press, in no way does it glorify the use of heroin. Instead it paints a pretty offputting picture of the drug.The film ranges from sad to funny and it is always gripping. A great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"heroin sitcom, with a liberal dose of horror thrown in","review":"This is a story about a bunch of stupid losers, who have nothing at the center of their lives, so they became addicts, drunks, and thieves. What is amazing about it is how blackly funny they all are, as they dive into toilets, allow babies and friends to die, burst into violent rages, and seek some kind of fantastical out. The acting is so good that you can believe all of their chaotic lives that can go nowhere but down or prison. Will the narrator turn his life around with his latest scan and last chance? You assume so, but don't know.Recommended. Cult classic. And that young Ian McGregor! First rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it in the gutter","review":"I thought this film was way overrated. Too trendy a look into the heroin culture with a strong dose of fatalism. Provides a great existential backdrop for rationalizing escapism but not very much entertainment value (unless the viewer enjoys watching people trash their lives).Decent enough music kept me watching the whole movie...wish I hadn't wasted my time renting it, though. My $.02"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most depressing film ever....!","review":"This is the most depressing film ever!...There is not one redeeming factor, that has any impact on the audience. Robert Carlyle's character, where he randomly beats the crap out of folks that he gets in a brawl with is so terribly annoying!!! Unless, if you really have no direction in life, or lavish a sadistic, twisted nature, then this movie is by all means for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning in the mainstream...","review":"Not my cup of tea, but being open-minded I can find it a good movie if your looking for a documentary on the unrepentant evils of heroin junkies. I would recommend it to addicts to watch, perhaps they would then realize how they are wasting away. For entertainment purposes, I found it truthful yet dreary, disturbing, violent and pretty boring. Basically that is all it is about is a junkie trying to go straight in the ghettos of Scotland. Not too much more content then that. I am certainly not going to say I liked it just because the mainstream said it is brilliant or something. I couldn't wait for this movie just to be over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MY REVIEW","review":"DVD was scratched and I was unable to watch the entire film, very angry, I would return except you can't send back open CDS/DVDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"prepare to be bored and depressed","review":"This movie is about a bunch of addicts who kill their baby and are totally sociopathic. Gee what a vision of a film. I watched it because of great reviews. I must not have gotten it.If you need to see a movie find anything else. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst and most disgusting and disturging movie I've seen","review":"Disgusting, repulsive, and absolutely disturbing stuff in this movie. Feces, heroine, dead babys with twisted heads, swimming in sewers, what more needs to be said. Warped and twisted and absolutely aweful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"after hearing about how 'great' this movie was and seeing all the good reviews, i finally rented it. and i HATED it. i hate this movie more than any other movie i've ever seen. i can't exactly tell you why...the characters were boring, and worthless, I didn't feel any sympathy for them at all. This movie just glorified drug use. bleh. i'll give it 1 star for ewan."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films ever made","review":"Okay, so after rejecting this one out of hand for years because I hated every band on the soundtrack, I finally decided to give it a try. And afterwards, I not only hate every band on the soundtrack and every song they contributed, I also hate the movie. If you want to see a really good movie about the horrors of drug use, you'd do a lot better with the recognized classic in the genre, Drugstore Cowboy. This is old territory, only worth going over if you find some redeeming quality in the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trainspotting","review":"I loved this movie because it deals with a time in my life that I just cannot forget; The movie handles the issues of drug addiction, friendship from both serious and funny views well. It's also moving (that may be because I can relate to it well?) with lovable characters, no matter what they are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Baby","review":"It was...uh, different. The effects were bad on the baby on the ceiling scence, but what are you going to do about it? Ewan did play his role well but I must say his charactor was the most not the most likable. I suggest you skip this one..and maybe the 2nd on the is soon to be filmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you think junkies are glamorus","review":"I just couldn't believe the hype this movie got when it came out. I had trouble trying to follow the conversations (they were spoken in a very thick Sort of Scotch accent). The people were sooooooo ugly. What happened to all the beautiful movie stars????????????? The men were ugly and the women were even uglier if that's possible. These people where obviously extreme low end people. Unless you like junkies, baby death and ugly people pooping in their beds don't bother with this. Rent \\"The Full Monty\\" instead! It was a much better movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scots at their best","review":"I really enjoyed this film when i first saw it.Although a bit graphic then i find it hillarious now. Plenty of laughs as well as an engaging storyline and script. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trainspotting is one of the best films of the decade.","review":"When i first watched it, I saw a few scenes in the begining and thought 'Oh, great, a movie about drugs, sex and boose. We really needed another one of them..' But as the movie went on, I was totally surprised by the quality in which they showed how horrible heroin is, and added some humor in, too. The acting and driecting was top notch, the story line was great, and the way they showed the people who's lives heroin had ruined was exceptional. :-) Not to mention the fact that very fine Ewan McGregor was in it (he's also going to be in the Star Wars prequel this spring!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"man, did I get old or what?","review":"Ummm, I remember hearing about this movie when I was an undergrad back in '96. I didn't get to watch it back then, but I finally have been able to see the movie. All I can think is that I am 30 something, and this didn't appeal to me. The humor was off the mark for me a bit, but I still couldn't say that the movie is bad. Its just for the younger crowd. So if you are 20ish, it will be good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scots Punks on Parade","review":"Another glossily realized finally trite/empty celebration of life without ideas, intelligence, foolish hobbies like learning or responsibility. The celebration is stylistic rather than substantial.

Not even close to harrowing enough. Commercial trash?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious Film, BAD DVD - NON-ANAMORPHIC TRANSFER","review":"I REFUSE TO BUY DVD'S THAT USE LETTERBOXED WIDESCREEN.

Where things that would embarass and even disgust a normal person are of little oddity to these Hardcore drug users. But there is more to this movie than just drugs. There is a unique outlook on life and the actual power of friends. In the end the friendship they had wasn't as strong as they believed. I recommend this movie highly and won't spoil any of it for you. Enjoy the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, hilarious, stop reading so much into it","review":"Have to say, as a librarian and parent of 2 young children, I found this book to be an absolute joy.

Chris Raschka is a talented illustrator and artist, as he proved with books like \\"Yo? Yes!\\" However, success has made him, like Sendak, think he can do whatever odd thing he feels like, and his publishers seem to concur. As a result, we get this weird, morbid thing that critics may like but which no child will. The art is interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've GOT to be kidding!","review":"I have yet to meet a child who has actually seen a sardine, much less eaten one. This book, from concept to execution, is one of the worst examples of the picture book format I have ever seen, and, being a librarian, I've seen plenty. Despite what other reviewers have written, most children will not find humor or comfort in the story and will not be \\"uplifted\\" by the illustrations. Kids are \\"uplifted\\" by COWS IN THE KITCHEN or DOUBLE TROUBLE IN WALLA WALLA, not by the death of a fish. The book is dark, ugly and pretty much a waste of a tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's fishy here","review":"I have been a children's librarian for ten years, and this is one of the worst picture books I've seen.

How ridiculous! Does a calf decide to be a sirloin steak? What lesson does this teach children about life and death? That death is a choice - an option to be selected at a young age? I work in a public library. We recently lost an 18 year old member of our staff to suicide. Is this the conscious choice we want our children to be making - to wish for death- to be stuffed in a can with no air to breathe. Our library staff has unanimously decided to omit this book from our collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Children's Book I've Ever Read","review":"Arlene was a fish who wanted to be a sardine. After being caught in a net, Arlene was pulled onboard and there she died. Really, it says that. It's not that I don't want my kid to know about death, but to teach her that animals want to die for her, that becoming a canned good is a great goal, was strange and bizarre. The only good thing about it was the huge laugh we had when I showed it to other adults. Maybe I next they'll publish a book about a girl with \\"magic cigarettes\\" or something just as bizarrely creepy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A GOOD ATTEMPT GONE BAD","review":"I admire Chris Raschka for his willingness to take creative risks. He certainly does that here. But in abruptly killing off the protoganist midway through the story, he seems to be taking aim not just at the character, but at the reader. It's a loathesome move. Books for even the youngest kids can and should contain the darker undercurrents of life, including death. But this book fails to broach the subject in an honest, responsible way. It's simply using death as a device to shock and provoke. That's not appropriate for adults and it's not appropriate for kids.

Albeit the beat remains essentially the same throughout the album, this really makes you want to move on the dance floor.

It's very stretchy, so if you wear a low-cut shirt, you can just pull it down and nurse. Or you can pull your shirt up over your chest, pull the tank top down, and your belly stays covered.

Anytime the season starts to get even remotely interesting, like when they get hotel jobs in Seattle, boom, they're gone and on the run again. There's weird random graphic sex scenes with characters who have nothing to do with the story and which leads nowhere. In fact the whole season is pointless and really leads nowhere. No great new characters introduced. No fun juicy dramatic new stories to really get into. Just the family on the run being chased by drug dealers and the FBI. Really???

We waited and waited for Season Six to come out on Netflix to no avail. Season 7 began on Showtime but Six was nowhere to be found. For less than the cost of another month's waiting for Netflix I just bought season six.If you're addicted to the show, you'll watch it and enjoy it even though it's clearly the weakest season. Spoiler alert: they just spend the entire season driving around. One episode is entirely spent at a Montana State Fair. Nothing happens that really contributes to the plot as a whole until the last two episodes. Everything else is an amusing little Botwin Anecdote.Not the best, but I'm a TV Junkie so I'll take it. I've definitely spent $16 on worse things. Hell, we've all lost $16 in our lives so at a bit more than a buck per episode watching the Botwins drift across the country is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sixth Season Disappointment","review":"Weeds has gone downhill with season six.

I have watched season 1-6 so far, and overall, I find the show to be pretty good.Season Six:I really liked the first 4 or 5 seasons, but somewhere in there something changed for the worst. I really felt that this sixth season was the worst they have created so far, and I have actually decided to quit watching the show entirely. If I was rating the show from season 1 to 5, I would easily give it 5 stars because of how good the first few season were, but I would definitely quit watching after season 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"best season","review":"Just in my opinion, I think this was the best season.

That fine looking Cougar in the green dress and that brigade of bad boys makes for an awesome front cover, but heck that's all this show has to offer at this point. It really was ok when it started but it went from being dramedy (drama with comedic themes) to just a boring series. This this should be the last season or maybe they should end it next season.

I didn't see the interview (it's posted on the Wikipedia page) so I don't know if it's true or not.But I do know that I was so board with season 6 that I didn't even watch the season finale until a couple weeks ago.Unless you're a collector I wouldn't waste my money on this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"The last episode of last season had such an amazing ending and this one opened to a nimble start.

Their album Third marked the beginnig of their penchant for long jazz influenced pieces. On this their follow up album Fourth, we begin to hear a more free-floating abstract jazz style, somewhat reminiscent of very early Weather Report.

It followed on the heels of \\"Can You Fly\\", and in tandem, these are two of the best singer-songwriter records you'd ever want to buy. The imagery inherent in the lyrics, the power of the story telling and the melody that tied it all together left you wanting more.Unfortunately, this album doesn't hold up to the standards Freedy set for himself. He almost sounds like he's gotten lazy, ripping off his own, now tired chord changes. The stories sound as though he rushed his way through the lyrics and the New York edge that spun through \\"Perfect...\\" and \\"...Fly\\" is gone.I love Freedy and wish he'd awaken to his former self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine album from FJ","review":"One of the best yet from Freedy - altho' all of his records are so good it's tough to pick one that tops the others. This time he delivers an impressively diverse collection of original songs - straight-ahead rock, indie folk, blues, pure pop - plus one superb cover tune (\\"Love Grows,\\" originally a hit in 1970 for Edison Lighthouse). Throughout the CD, Freedy's vocals are consistently smooth, and the musicianship and production are both top-notch. The tunes are mostly all quite hummable. This is a disc I will be coming back to many times in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since \\"This Perfect World\\"","review":"A great album. If there was an option for four-and-a-half stars I would have used it. Incredible songs as always, but what sets this one apart from the last couple is the diversity--akin to \\"Can You Fly\\" and \\"This Perfect World\\". For that reason, I can't imagine growing tired of it. And it's not just the varied instrument selection and production choices that make these songs so refreshing. The type of writing in the songs themselves varies from the specifically detailed stories--which he happens to be the modern master at--to the more ambiguous \\"Anyone\\", to the spare use of words in \\"Arriving On A Train\\" in which he lets the music tell the rest of the story. And the more unique strands of Freedy we get the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable guide, but missing some questions","review":"If you're going to reengineer, this book is a valuable one to have-- in particular, I'd like to take the chapter about choosing a consultant and staple it to the doors of many a company (and I'm a consultant). The book covers elements of success, practical tips for making it work, and some case studies.What I find missing is the question \\"Should I reengineer?\\". (The answer, I think, isn't always 'yes'.) It would be *most* useful if it first helped managers make sure that reengineering really is a Good and Necessary Thing, given the pain it inevitably causes a corporation. There's also a little bit of a sense that nay-sayers shouldn't be tolerated at all, and I find that a little bit short-sighted.Nice to have for managers and consultants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the uninitiated","review":"If you are looking for grounds up information on this subject then this book is NOT for you.

Pavarotti is the ultimate singing machine with the highest notes all in his pocket. However, he was not up to himself in this Paris concert.

It's a 15 minute story dragged into, what? a movie that's over 2 hours or only SEEMS that long!I found the pastor father reprehensible, stuffing HIS beliefs down his son's throats before they were old enough to decide about religion for themselves. He was just a small-town fish trying to be something bigger, basically on a power-trip. The oldest son was not strong enough or independently smart enough to fight him, but the younger son rebelled in that way preacher's kids always do: Major sinning! And boy, did this movie need some sin so you wouldnt fall asleep!Redford's one of the best directors around, heavy and fantastic on his visuals, but he needs the right material. He even photographed Pitt in ways that remind you of a younger Redford.

They all loved fishing, and used to go to the river to fish. Norman, the elder brother, loved his family, especially, his brother, Paul, but he could not help Paul when a tragic accident occurred. Fishing and the river remind the aged Norman of the old days and his brother.Beautiful pictures and beautiful, beautiful Brad Pitt make this movie worth seeing, even if you do not have a brother or a sister or the memory of a river."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAME QUICKLY","review":"ORDER CAME FASTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD VERY HAPPY WITH THE SPEED IN WHICH IT CAME WOULD ORDER AGAIN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow, too poorly directed.","review":"I have tried on more than one occasion to like this movie. It is beautiful to look at of course and worth seeing it just for the scenery. But, Redford just missed the boat on directing it. It just doesn't hold the interest. The pace is so slow most of the time that you could doze off and there seem to be odd things thrown in for no particular reason. Brad Pitt was too young, with too little depth as an actor to put everything into the role that needed to be there. He just comes across as a rather delinquent personality with no real depth. Pretty much a tragedy looking for a place to happen from the time he was just a kid. I think the test of any movie is \\"does it grab you and hold you from the first scene?\\". This movie does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent and dramatic","review":"Robert Redford has done it again. hes made a movie so memorable that it is great. with a cast like this it makes the film worth while. Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt are brothers, Pitt is the wild one and they have a priest father played awesomely by Tom Skeritt. full of powerful scenes and the tear jereker for some girls when the shocking news of their beloved Brad Pitt dieing"},{"rating":"2","title":"A plotless slice of Americana","review":"I was not too crazy about the plot or the subject, but I gave this movie 4 stars because the execution was impeccable. This whole idea of Prodigal Son has been done to death. There is just so much of Biblical allusions and sugary Norman Rockwell nostlagia that you can take in one seating. It's really a challenge for the director to take an overprocessed idea and present it in an interesting fashion. The photography and the costumes kept me stimulated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self important and boring","review":"No one can deny that this film is stunningly beautiful. The Montana scenery all captured by fine photography is wonderful. But, unfortuanately that's all the film has going for it. The acting is good and it's certaintly interesting to see Pitt, (looking alot like the young Redford), in his first major screen role but no one really makes much impression. Basically this is self important, one note movie about the susposed joys of family love brought together by the dullest of sports, fishing, with little plot, humour or suspense. The strikingly similar \\"Legends of the Fall\\" is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there something wrong with this release of the DVD?","review":"I was looking at the main title sequence of this film, and maybe it was the DVD release, but why was Elmer Bernstein credited as doing the music, when even the back of the box says that Mark Isham did the music? When I saw the film on VHS, they had the correct information, but why was the DVD incorrect? Are other releases of this film on DVD providing the same incorrect information, or actually listing Isham as the composer. What made the issue even more ridiculous is how the end credits had Isham's regular orchestrator and conductor, Ken Kugler, and Bernstein always conducted his own scores by this time period. Please, will anyone explain this discrepancy? On the whole though, bad film, but beautiful cinematography. However, Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn were extraordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story about relationships","review":"It's hard to classify this movie. I guess it's a \\"drama\\", but nothing particularly dramatic happens. Mainly it's a chance to watch the interplay of personalities, mainly between the father and the two brothers.Oh, and there's some really pretty scenery and some fancy fishing.To enjoy this movie, you have to be prepared to sit back, relax, and be receptive to a slow unfolding of the story's subleties. A little bit like the way people enjoy fishing, come to think of it.The DVD version is great for maximizing the scenic aspect of the movie - this really requires the wide-screen format. Not too much in the way of bonus materials, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too excellent.","review":"It is rare that I will watch a movie more than ten times but that is exactly what I did and am going to keep on doing with \\"A River Runs Through It.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature in motion","review":"This movie is my \\"hands-down favorite\\" of all time because of the moving dialogue (straight from Maclean's book) and passionate acting.

When I saw Harold Davis' book what struck me was the title's ending \\"...using any Web Browser\\". Any book on programming must decide on SOME computer language. As a budding web-page designer/maintainer, this seemed like a good way to combine learning how (or better)to program AND to see how Javascript interfaces with HTML coding. I couldn't be more pleased.

The answer is that the software, the programs, can be written (by those who know how) to carry out any explicit procedure. Even if you are an utter novice, this book can help you to become one of those who do know how. If you have a computer and surf the internet, you have all the equipment that you need.

Masterfully directed and compelling.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fonda amazing in an average movie","review":"What grabs the viewer in this movie is Peter Fonda's extraordinary ability to evoke feelings of frustration, rage, impotence and anxiety, while playing a character given to almost no outward display of emotion. As one who remembers him from his earlier days (or even that hokey cameo in \\"Escape From L.A.\\"), I was astonished at his range. Unfortunately, the movie itself is held back by a rather laborious script. It gets tiresome watching Fonda single-handedly represent truth, reason and virtue in the face of a bunch of derelicts. Plus, it is hard to disassociate Patricia Richardson from her 'Home Improvement' role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet little film","review":"I found the opening shot in this film chilling, and not because I found the bees disturbing. As the camera moves in to Peter Fonda's face, for a moment, he looks exactly like his dad....As other reviewers have pointed out, the film is slow moving. If you're not the type to use honey because you're too impatient to wait for it to flow slowly from the jar, you probably won't appreciate what takes place here. But a tension develops in the first moments of the film that is nicely sustained until the very end. Further, there are some scenes in which the verisimiltude hits so close to home I found myself getting anxious. Anyone with a dysfunctional family understands that as each member makes poor choices, the entire family is affected in some way eventually. Enough said there.Peter Fonda has come into his own in this film. I'd love to see him do more work like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"meditation","review":"This is a great cd for meditation reflection or relaxing.constant peaceful mood throughout"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I use this as backgroung music while working on online courses t teach.

Not this one. The protagonist's inner conflict does not spring from the same insight that created \\"The Scapegoat\\" or \\"My Cousin Rachel.\\" This poor girl of the moors is a bore. The most interesting character isn't in the book enough to compensate. Try another one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak attempt to invoke mystery and romance in the novel","review":"There were little mystery and romance that DuMaurier is famous for. Failed to stir up reader's interest as the plot is weak and characters are not well developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Good plot, characters and a great depiction of the Cornish coast give this novel a real boost. Not as good as Rebecca, but recommended, nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other Books","review":"Jamaica Inn by Daphne Du Maurier is an adventure an I suppose something of a Gothic romance, in that the adventure is about a woman who goes to live with very disturbing relatives, and a lot of nastiness goes in.There is, of course, a bloke around who is not a nogoodnik for the heroine to lean on."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful story","review":"I went to the public library once to get an english book. wen I asked the librarien if she could recommend me a book she immediatly said jamaica Inn. And she just kept on talking about how great the book is.Well now i have read it myself and i really can say that the librarien was right. It is a beautiful story about a girl who lost her parents and goes to live with her aunt and her husband.she discovers the criminal activities of her uncle and tries to stop him.I am from holland so i am used to other kind of books. But i have to say that jamaica inn has opened my eye for english literature.the story is beatiful and what i liked most is the struggle of mary during the book because her parents died and she has to do it all by herself.An other great thing about the book is that things happen that i did not expect like the fact that Francis Davey turns out to be the leader of the gang.I found it great reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"romance,\\" alright","review":"I started to read Jamaica Inn in preparation for seeing the HItchcock film of it, so I could appreciate how much and how well or ill the adaptation of it was. I put the book down after about 140 pages. It has utterly no sense of period, just like the standard historical-romance novels of 2011. It's set some time shortly after the Napoleonic Wars concluded (1815), but might be happening in 1715, 1615, or even 1915, as long as the references to the nineteenth century were changed or expunged. Du Maurier's ear is strictly middle-of-the-road 1930s; she apparently couldn't even appreciate the Cornish accents among which she lived. The flatness of her diction makes the heavy sentiments that course through the book seem forced and artificial, and the characters seem hackneyed. If you're looking for richness of language and convincing realization of period and place, don't bother with Jamaica Inn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching the Youngest Writers: A Practical Guide","review":"This book was very informative.

It's a large LP SIZED package with 8 CDs in 4 double-disc jewel cases.While versions of these films have yet to be marketed in the USA on DVD, those familiar with these Karl May film adaptations know that the music is a major element, and deservedly so.

My only complaint is of the sheet enclosed with the CD. It neither lists the records in proper order nor credits them accurately (or credits the orchestra properly). However, since this is a matter of a piece of paper and Ms. Borja's singing is a matter of beauty, I strongly recommend the recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a bigger ear I guess...","review":"I got this because it matched my phone and the price was right.

Don't really like the volume control either. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it came in a package that included a matching case with a wrist strap (designed for a Razor but fits my LG Muziq just fine) and a little screen cleaner that works nicely, so not a TOTAL loss I guess, but still irritating and disappointing.

Being a rather cranky, middle-aged female myself, I found Agatha charming in her cantankerousness. The writing is amusing without being cloying, and I actually chuckled aloud several times.

Finally Agatha had a chance to live with James under the same roof!!!

Drums, bass, keyboards, back-up vocals... all are excellent. The funky title track is just sheer musical fun.Dave Mason has always been under-rated by the record-buying public, but not by fellow musicians.

The included documentary is also something special for those who truly love this movie. However, since I own both the original DVD release and the new Special Edition, I have noticed one minor flaw. The color in many of the scenes on the Special Edition DVD appear washed out or faded when compared to the original. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Badlands scene. The colors on the original DVD were bright and vivid, while those on the Special Edition were relatively dull and pale. While this fault is not enough to keep me from recommending the purchase of this DVD, it does raise an interesting question.

I was only able to watch this movie in incriments of about 35 minutes each. The first 35-40 minutes of it were good. I really enjoyed learning about Lt. John J. Dunbar, and the Lakota Sioux. After the beginning it flies down hill. They make Union Soldiers, American Citizens, and Whites all together look like nothing more than evil killers, and they make the Sioux look like wise, all- knowing, super- humans. Neither of these descriptions fit neither of the races.Basically, this is good if your so naive to think that Dunbar and the Sioux wouldn't have opened fire on eachother the first chance they got.P.S.- In the year of \\"MISERY\\" (Rob Reiner) they chose this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the official history now","review":"There is a famous piece of educational research where a class of school students compare two films - the 1950s western 'Searchers', and this one, 'Dances With Wolves'.

Storytellers, filmmakers have always distorted history somewhat to tell a good story. The real sadness lies in our own failure of history education, leading to our ignorant credulity when hoards of us watch such films and believe they depict some kind of historical reality.As H.L.

Scenery is spectacular, costuming is great and props are totally realistic--especially the dead and hided buffalo's, and the music score is very good. The historical accuracy from the Civil War perspective and the treatment of the main character by the US Army is neither realistic nor plausible. The Indian life scenes, especially the buffalo hunt are all very well done with terrific acting but on the negative side everyone always has perfect hair brushed-shiny and groomed, even Kevin Costner's hair, and the Indian costuming is always spectacularly colorful but nothing is ever out of place.

While this film is flawed in its accuracy of Lakota culture in many ways, which is why I deducted a star from the rating, and while to the trained ear the Lakota is not spoken well because none of the principle cast was a Lakota speaker, this film..especially the long version..remains one of my best teaching tools for my students. I give Costner a great deal of credit for insisting on using the actual Lakota language rather than having the film all in English as he was pressured to do by Hollywood. Lakota, like many Native languages, is in danger of extinction if more young Lakotas don't take the initiative to learn their language, and this film put that language in the ears of the world. I can nit-pick on the cultural inaccuracies in DWW, but I'd rather concentrate on the fact that this film presented this beautiful language to the world and for that, I am grateful.

This has long been a favorite movie of mine. I love listening to the Sioux language, I love the imagery (grew up about two hours west of where this movie was shot) and I love the storyline.One word of caution - this movie is the extended cut, NOT the original version. So, it's about 4 hours long. (whew!) Many of the extra minutes were just longer scenes that existed in the theater-released version, but there are also some scenes that will give you new insight into the characters and motivations behind the film. Most notably, the scenes with the troops at Fort Sedgewick before Lt. John Dunbar arrives and the reasons behind Dunbar's sleeping alone the night before the buffalo hunt. Overall, I recommend this movie to someone who has already seen the previous version and loves it... because let's face it, a four-hour movie, good as it is, is freakin' LONG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like movies about the American West, this is a must!","review":"This is a wonderful movie.

This is a great MOVIE, not a documentary! As for the bison: yes, their demise was mainly caused by the slaughter of the \\"white man\\", mostly the American soldier following government orders. It was a military tactic. Just a fact; live with it and get over it, but don't try to put their near extinction down to the weather and the Indians needing food!

The whole extra hour (!) of footage is interesting to watch, but fatally detracts from the pacing and power of a film that was already three hours long. Now, if this two-DVD set included the option of watching the original theatrical version, then I would enthusiastically endorse it.

I thought perhaps they had shaken loose in shipment. It is impossible that these discs could have been so severly damaged in shipping. These are old, used discs.

Not to shun those who love the extended scenes, but to me...after you watch the movie you kinda get why they were cut out in the first place. For example, I for one liked not seeing or knowing who lived in the caves at Fort Sedgewick before Dunbar got there - it added to the mystery. Do we need to see the crazy officer at Fort Hayes screaming for his crown?The extended scenes throw the pacing of the movie out of whack and also affect the timing of some of the wonderful John Barry music cues. If you are very familiar with the original theatrical version you'll notice how some scenes that had music (Dunbar star gazing early in the film by the fire) no longer do.Just wish the disc had both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic movie","review":"Took a while to arrive, but it got here in perfect condition, as expected.

First of all the movie is racist toward whites. Kevin Costner seems like the only white man who has sympathy for American Indians. Costner depicts whites as sloppy, drunk, and incompetent, while depicting the Native Americans as pure, noble, and peaceful. The settlers who came from Europe did horrible things to the American Indians, but that does not mean the American Indians were all pure at heart and the white man was all evil.The war and genocide that occurred between the two groups is what almost always happens when two people of different race, religion, and ethnic groups conflict with each other. Costner was paying respect to the Native Americans and that was a good thing that he did. The American Indians deserve it up to a point. But don't go around thinking they were not deeply flawed and did not have darker side like other human beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inserted cuts ruin film","review":"This review pertains only to the DVD special edition, which is a case study in how not to release an extended cut. The new cut of the film adds about an hour of footage, most of which are repetitive, ruin the continuity, have production problems, or disrupt the pacing. For example, pointless scenes of the original Sedgwick soldiers are included. Furthermore, there is no way to view the original theatrical cut of the film.

While the book could be more visibly attractive with more pictures, the recipes are nonetheless excellent, some of the best I have found. Being Italian, I can certify that the author has retained the authenticity of the dishes.Readers from most countries in the world should be able to find the ingredients required.

I believe this was done because most light switch boxes don't have the second (white) wire needed for a 120 volt connection but have only the black \\"switch leg\\".

I really enjoyed the first one since it lasted 1 year I actually went and bought another one Now I am taking them back to Home Depot since they are kind of spendy and I feel like I got screwed when I bought it the second time.

Having read _Animal Farm_ and _1984_ as required reading in some prehistoric educational experience, it was refreshing to be inside the head of a much more personal Orwell than I remembered. It was also particularly meaningful to read about places with which I was becoming increasingly familiar. The book was written before the end of the Civil War, and published around the time of Orwell's death in 1950, but it feels so very much in the present.

Two of the versions of \\"Come And Get My Love\\" included here are practically note-for-note rewrites of that wonderfully cheesy track, complete with vocoderized vocals and synth fills straight out of the 2 Unlimited songbook.On the other hand, the Bradski & Jenski trance mix is practically a different song altogether -- it has an alternate lyric and melody, and shares only the title with the original versions. This commercial-trance mix does feature a full vocal that's preceded by a long synth intro. I find this mix more enjoyable than the originals, actually. It's similar in spirit to the \\"Heaven\\" remake by DJ Sammy, and it makes this single worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous book","review":"The most beatiful and informative book on lichens I've ever seen.

It was the ideal size, and I wanted a glass cover. But metal handles get hot, and are not acceptable. This handle is also very long, which isn't obvious in the picture.The glass dome lid is high and I would like it, except that its handle is made of some rough metal that is uncomfortable to pick up by hand.And also, there was no nylon spoon.I have other calphalon with good handles. I'm going to send this one back and search for more like that. This kind of pan might look more \\"professional\\", or whatever.

You might ask, how could I have seen this movie three times and yet call it forgettable? Because I forgot I'd seen it and rented it twice more. My SO and I stood at Blockbuster and said, \\"Oh, I heard this one was good,\\" and then paid the money for it, took it home, stuck it into the VCR and realized, \\"We've seen this before...\\" and the last time \\"TWICE\\". I find the acting excellent, the cavalcade of stars interesting -- but overall, I found the movie superficial and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone LIKE this pile o shart??? IT SUCKS!!!!!","review":"Definatly one of the worst movies ever. The dialog is so boring I had an A.D.D. attack trying to watch it. I usally never turn a movie off in the middle but I had to do it with this one. I tore it out of my laserdisc player and smashed it, so I would never have to suffer through this again. The characters are so lame I did'nt even care about who was threating his life. I wanted the stalker to go ahead and kill them all already. Man this movie is making me enraged just typing about it.

It has drama, suspense, comedy, an excellent plot, outstanding acting, the cast was extraordinary and to top it off, has \\"cameos\\" of marvelous actors! One scene that's very particular is one with Whoopy Goldberg, where in the most dramatic, tense scene of the lead star, there is such a funny twist juxtaposed! Simply superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic hollywood classic at its best","review":"This movie has thee all star cast of any movie ever produced with a great plot and story line. Would recommend for the movie enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Better to Skewer Hollywood Than Altman?","review":"\\"The Player\\" was a comeback film for Robert Altman, whose fortunes had declined in the 80s. He threw himself into the briar-patch and stirred up a wicked satire on Dream City. Even though I suspect the reality is even worse and more outrageous than what Altman gives us here, so too was the Korean War in comparison with \\"M*A*S*H.\\" A must-see for Altman fans; for others, a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amoral, Boring, and Unlikely -","review":"The movie begins with a lot of industry self-adulation, then develops a plausible plot (angry rejected writer seeking revenge is accidentally killed in self-defense). Eventually the police realize what happened, but their only witness is unable to identify the killer. No matter - killer/script reviewer Tim Robbins seemingly pursues a death wish by dumping his girl-friend (motivating her to rat him out), and then confesses to the murdered writer's girl-friend who he eventually marries.

I mean, who wouldn't? And of course I found the satire and critical eye taken with regard to the big business of Hollywood to be interesting. But in the end I found the movie to be wholly uncompelling. I never really laughed, which had I done so regularly, would have made this movie very good.I also never really cared about any character in the movie. Maybe you could say that this is Altman's point, but it still doesn't make the movie any more entertaining.All in all, this movie seemed just OK. That's a horrible review for a Tim Robbins movie, because I think he's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Player? you mean The Sleeper!","review":"Tim Robbins' performance as Griffin Mills in the only redeaming thing that this movie has to offer. The plot is very weak and moves along with all of the swiftness of molasas uphill. This movie was at least one hour to long. I realize that it was supposed to be a spoof on the real Hollywood process, but come on! The film techniques that were used made the plot entirely to predictable. I knew how the movie was going to end fifteen min. into it. If you are looking for an exciteing and a fast paced movie, this one is not it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant moviemaking - don't miss it!","review":"This one has everything but the kitchen sink. At once a celebration and satire of filmmaking and Hollywood, this is one of those movies you can watch with your friends over and over and see new stuff all the time. Made with a wink to the audience (like \\"Dead Again\\" and \\"The Freshman\\") this movie is even better than them. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Altman's better films","review":"An often entertaining look at Hollywood, with Tim Robbins as the Hollywood insider being blackmailed by an irate writer, and Greta Scacchi as the decidedly offbeat love interest. Like many of Altman's films, this is not so much fun to watch as fun to contemplate afterwards. Also like many Altman's films, half the fun is to be had by getting an eyeful of drop in celebrities, and seeing how many you can spot.A highlight of the picture is Richard E. Grant as an idealistic and slightly insane writer who swears he wont sell out and then does anyway. How very Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literate and Surprising","review":"If you like Robert Altman's film style, you'll love this film. I happen to think Altman is a genius, so this was a joy to watch. It moves, keeps you guessing, involves the viewer all the way from beginning to end. Speaking of the beginning, watch the opening shot that has to last five minutes without a cut! Pay close attention because Altman often has two or three conversations going on at one time and you need to listen to just one of them! The murder is solved - sort of! You never quite understand it all until the end and even then, you're not completely sure of what you've just seen! This is a lot of fun for armchair detectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, poor use of DVD","review":"This is a great film but i fell the picture quality and horrible use of surround sound leaves me disapointed. Even though the disc has the Dolby symbol it doesn't use it enough to even warrent the notice. The picture quality suffers in dark setttings aswell and isn't as good as others from the same time. This is one of my favorite movies but I feel the transfer to DVD could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Kris' Soul","review":"Although this album did not contain any popular hits or ever made it to the charts, it has to be my most favorite of his albums (and I have them all).

These girls made history before they were in their twenties and include such notables as Harriet Tubman, Golda Meir, and the modern singer Charlotte Church. The biographies are lively and revealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing reading... until the very end","review":"I apparently must echo what other reviewers have said about Camouflage. Good, bordering on great if but for the end.The first few hundred pages of the novel focus mainly on the alien changeling's initially fumbling attempts to be human. It uses myriad identities over the span of a century to better understand humanity, but also to find out exactly what it truly is. To a lesser degree, Haldeman tackles the \\"chameleon\\" who is no less intelligent but is motivated by more primal, baser instincts.The final part of the novel focuses both on the key to unlocking the changeling's and chameleon's identities as well as on the changeling's final lesson in what makes human beings unique. The problem, as other reviewers have noted, is that the denouement seems more than a bit rushed... almost a stock HEA ending, in fact. Nevertheless, I enjoyed Haldeman's excellent writing: his attention to detail and well fleshed-out characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, engaging story","review":"This was way better than I expected. I admit, when I got started on this book. It seemed a little goofy at first. But as the story progressed, I was impressed at the depth Haldeman gave the central characters. I really like Haldeman's light and clean writing style. It makes for effortless reading without losing any good details.I won't give away the ending, but its a fun ending. Maybe it was obvious, but it still was satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good science fiction adventure with some romance.","review":"This is the first book by Haldeman that I have read and it was enjoyable. I had just finished reading \\"Light\\" by Harrison, so this book was a nice change. Very easy to get into, fun and straightforward--it made me feel like kid reading Andre Norton for the first time. At first it seemed a bit formulaic, the themes are very familiar. However, it doesn't matter, Haldeman builds (almost literally) the main character, the \\"changeling\\", from the ground up; we get to see it's transformation as it learns to be human. The style of writing makes for easy reading, if you are traveling or sitting on a beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending WHAT?","review":"Very well writen stoy about the 'good' shape shifter. Book would have been great with just that story... the whole bad shapeshifter story... sorry... lost me... total let down of an ending... Sure the reveal was a surprise but the culmination... bleh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start - disappointing finish","review":"From the first few pages of the book, it promises to be an enjoyable read with a great premise that seems to have limitless potential. Unfortunately you quickly realize that the author wasn't really sure where to take this idea and how to develop it. Half way through the book you start to realize that this is not going anywhere and with every read page, my interest in the book was greatly diminishing. The ending feels rushed and completely dissatisfactory, as though the author decided that he wrote enough for publishing complete book and didn't feel like putting any effort in completing the story. To add to this, lots of things in the book don't really make much sense from any logical point of view. I'm not sorry about the money I paid for the book, I am sorry for the time I wasted reading.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well shaped novel, looking for a sequel","review":"Joe, I am always happy to see you work out for sale! This was no exception. Joe, please, please give us a follow up tome. This story line has tons more material to explore and explain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Concept- Poor Execution","review":"I liked the concept of two aliens roaming the planet changing themselves and events around them. This could have been a much better book but I got the sense that the Author was rushing to get to the end. The first third of the book is intriguing but then its downhill from there. I think he should take this story re-write it when he has some time to really finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lack of Morality Does Not Equal Progressivity","review":"Haldeman writes excellent science-fiction. In Camouflage he tells the stories of a couple aliens who poke around the earth for a few millenia and make disparate judgments of what it means to be human. The novel rides pretty far on the strength of its premise but eventually it becomes clear that this is essentially a short story centered on the alien who comes to appreciate humanity for what it is. Though a fine story, there was much more that could have been said about life itself. Maybe Mr. Haldeman is just leaving room for a sequel.Finally, the author's theme of an alien discovering what it means to be human was bound to focus upon sex at some point. But seriously folks, generations of talented authors and playwrights have managed some excellent explorations of sexuality without dwelling on the pornographic. The explicit scenes in this book were just embarrassing. And the author's portrayal of Samoan morality as quaint and outdated was unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read","review":"I found Haldeman's work easily digestible, yet unsatisfactory. There are a number of weaknesses evident in the writing style and plot development. The most irritating have already been indicated by other reviewers. Looking to read anything at all? This is your book. If you want better Haldeman, check out The Forever War."},{"rating":"1","title":"... plot for a television pilot?","review":"I like Haldeman... well liked anyway.What could have been a terrific story ends up with lack of depth and is rife with inconsistency in logic and technology. The good news however is that this type of effort draws television production like mice to that which is cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"reprint","review":"Is this a reprint of a 1960s book, with a very similar plot and set of characters, including the egg?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read, not his best.","review":"I'm giving this book four stars for it's a fun and solid science fiction. I can't give it more because this book it just that. I read this story when it was serialized in Analog, and my initial responce was 'Is this really a new story freshly written in the 21st Centry?'This book is old-fashioned. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. It's just too-typical, too-1970's-like, too-comforting. I think readers who started reading science fiction back in the 1950s would find this book more interesting than I did. Haldeman is definitely a telented writer-I still remember the shock and wonder I felt when I first read his best works like _The Forever War_ or _All Sins Remembered_. This new novel won't league among them, but for those looking for a classical science fiction with a classical idea and humour, it would still be recommended. You won't be surprised, but you will be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open minded aliens","review":"This was my first book by Haldeman, and I enjoyed it. The story immediately drew me in. I don't usually read books about aliens, usually avoiding anything about outerspace, but this was worth the read. Its opened up my mind to check out more science fiction, with and without more aliens in them. Since reading everyone elses reviews, I'm looking forward to checking out more books by this author especially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sci Fi story","review":"This was a very enjoyable sci fi story.

The strap is comfortable and looks great. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that the case size appears to be incorrect twice on the information page for the watch. At the top it says 42mm. Down in the \\"Watch Information\\" section it lists the case size as 40mm. I think both of those are incorrect. The watch was smaller than I expected when I opened the packaging, so I compared it to my 42mm Hamilton - it is quite a bit smaller. Then I measured it and while I am not 100% sure of the correct way to measure a watch case diameter without a caliper I would say it is most definitely a 38mm watch (at least the one that was sent to me is). Great watch - but not nearly as big as I expected. I am returning it in favor of something bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Watch","review":"This watch is not too big or heavy and keeps excellent time.

As a previous reviewer stated, this is really a tribute by the author to his father and not a biography of Randolph Scott, doesn't even get to first base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Randolph Scott biography....","review":"This book was disappointing. I was expecting a Randolph Scott biography. What I got was a loving tribute to a father by his son. As C.H. Scott wrote, \\"This is an account of my relationship with my father, the thoughts we shared and the experiences I had with him.\\" If I deleted Randolph Scott's name from the book, I could just as easily have been reading about my own father.

I was looking around the bookshelf for something to read a few days ago, and came across it. I figured, well, why not read it? It's about twelve year old twins, Joan and Joey, who discover a stegosaurus living on their ranch. He has been alive for millions of years, and he can actually talk. But he's shy, you see, and doesn't want the kids to tell anyone else about him. I won't give away any more of the plot, but I will say that this is an enjoyable kids book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for children","review":"All throughout elementary school, I took this book out of my school library so many times that the librarian used to make me wait a few weeks between each borrowing so other kids could read it too. All these many years later (I'm 44 now) I've asked my husband to buy it for me for Christmas so I can share this wonderful story with my two daughers. They don't make them like this anymore. A truly delightful and heartfelt story that will make you laugh and cry and be so happy that you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that... at all.","review":"The art in this book is pretty good, if a bit broader of stroke than I tend to like. Still, the imagery is solid, and the motions of the characters really carries itself off the page well.The rest of it is pretty much crap. The story is basic, with very little to endear one to the any of characters. The happenings are boring enough that I was distracted by the weather outside the window. The erotic part of it can be better attained by one's own imagination. Not what I would call a worthwhile read, and certainly not for the price I paid. If you see somewhere for $3 or so, pick it up. Otherwise, hang loose and look for some stuff you can count on. Or check my dumpster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"We got this DVD as a hand-me-down from my child's older cousin. I really didn't expect a Barney movie to be at all watchable, but it is. My 2 year old absolutely loves this, so I've seen it repeatedly and don't suffer. It is a cute story with a decent children's plotline and is visually appealing. The young actors are good and quite likeable. It's not as enjoyable as any of the recent Disney or Pixar productions (which have a lot of comic turns for adults as well), but for small children it has everything; a touch of magic, adventure, comedy, warmth, and lively musical numbers. Adults won't love it, but your little ones will! Another asset that's important to me is that there are no real scary moments. My 2 year old is not ready for scares, and that's why he doesn't watch *my* favorite kid's movies yet (toy story, monsters inc, etc.), and he won't be able to enjoy those for a couple of years at least. This movie is exactly what I look for for him right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barney movie is ok","review":"Well I like the show better then the movie.

Fast songs and powerful lyrics just makes this CD as good as ever. The guitar solos are better in this one too. So I guess no matter what Maiden I buy they will never change and I like that. I hate when groups change their style of music when I'm happy with what they're playing.The only problem is the lack of Bruce. The singer in their earlier days isn't too bad but not as good as Dickinson. But in spite of that Iron Maiden still makes it rock.

The songs does not have the power or the quality of later releases, and Paul DiAnno simply does not come anywhere near Bruce Dickinson as a singer.The album meant alot to metal and thus is worth listning to, but it does not seem to hold any emediate qualities that are usualy atributed to Iron Maiden. The production is pretty bad, but it was too on Number of the Beast, so that is not what is to blame.I think that Iron Maiden simply matured...and got a worthy lead singer for their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY BLEW ME AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Killers is now my favorite Maiden album. Before I purchased it, I just bought Bruce on vocals. I was skeptical, because alot of Maiden fans don't like Paul Di'anno. I bought it anyway, just to see what he sounded like. And I have to say he has one the greatest heavy metal voices of all time. This album also introduces Adrian Smith on guitar after Dennis Stratton left. There is absolutely no filler I loved every song. If you are a fan of Iron Maiden or just like good old 80's Heavy Metal than this should be an immediate purchase. If your new to Maiden you may want to listen Bruce Dickinson first, to get used to thier sound. Then get this killer album."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING IMPROVMENT IN PRODUCTION ...","review":"Dear Mr. Arsh Karma (the reviewer below). Thanks God you chose to buy \\"KILLERS\\" instead of \\"NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING\\" ...The latter one is a shame, while KILLERS is a masterpiece, the second album from Maiden, the first featuring ace producer Martin Birch and the first featuring ace guitarrist Adrian Smith. In this one, Maiden worked on songs that were already tried and proved for years playing live in the British pub scene. So they just refined it a little and went into the studios. The result was a tour-de-force of great metal music, great solos, Clive Burr's amazing drumming and Paul Di'anno's unique voice giving it all he could (I'm sorry, Bruce Dickinson, your voice is wonderful, but for sheer rock'n roll voice Di'anno was the one ). Steve Harris wrote all the songs for this album, with the exception of the title track, co-written with Di'anno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, there are listeners","review":"Tierson's music is romantic and cosmopolitan.

We received it as a wedding gift and its simple utilitarian design became an instant go-to cookware and serving tray. They should build tanks out of this stuff because it is extremely durable. If you are looking for an attractive serving dish that you can cook on, look no further. It is similar to cast iron but is more attractive, does not retain oils and flavors after washing, doesn't rust, and is a slightly lighter in weight.

Bruce hits the high notes, such as the bone chilling scream at the end of Aces High, just as good, if not better than on any other live albums. Also included are some oddities, that haven't been in the setlist for years. These include the epic Rime Of The Ancient Mariner, Children Of The Damned, Powerslave, Aces High, and Die With Your Boots On. The only real complaint is that several songs were not put on the album, but on the singles.

You get excerpts from two nights at Long Beach areana and a few songs from Donnington. This is pure greatness in my opinion. It could well be the best live album of all time in my book. Listen to the samples if you have any doubt. I have bought this album many times on all three major forms of media(I just worn them out).

A very complicated plot unfolds with murder, attempted blackmail and the unleashing of a powerful, mind bending drug by a company with whom she was connected years previously, surfacing.

It's like they are reading the script as they go and even the actors must think it's stupid, because they don't seem like they care. As I watched, I guessed that someone in Hollywood heard about a town that would be completely flooded, so they went there and made a movie without any time to write a story.

The Prokofiev rolls--as transferred here--are totally lacking in expression and dynamic range. The REAL recordings of Prokofiev that I have heard--such as his marvelous recording of his own Third Concerto--reveal a far more fascinating pianist.

Taking off to a great start, he is painting the picture of a great Hungarian philantropist, who resembles the real life, well known financial tycoon G. S.From there on however, any seasoned thriller reader can easily predict the turn of events. Even more, the writing is sloppy, commercial, and unmotivated. Where Ludlum used to paint a picture for all of his characters, making them unpredictable, he does only the minimum necessary to fulfil his page quota. His hero's picture is more ellaborate, but one would imagine, that R.L. can come up with some new character profiles.Why do I give two stars?

This is not vintage Ludlum. It was certainly not written by him. First, the dialogue is too fresh, and that points to a younger writer. Secondly, after around page 200 or so, after the plane blows up, the story goes downhill. Up to 200, it may have been Ludlum. But after that it just goes down. The suspense of the book died then, replaced by action, too much detail on the technology of the guns or cars being driven, and the angles each shot came from. After the plane exploded, there was only one twist, at the end, that just about anyone could have seen coming. From any other author, this would be a four or a five, but if you put the name Robert Ludlum on a book, I'm expecting something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Bourne","review":"A friend lent this to me and I am really grateful. I'm sorry Ludlum didn't live long enough to develop Janson into a Bourne-type series character, because he's just as interesting and complex. I liked the action, the international settings and the technology, but most of all the characters. This is one fast-paced thrill-ride with a lot of depth to it that you won't put down. Like I said, I only wish there could be more.In a nutshell, Paul Janson, a retired spook, comes back into the game to help out an old friend who's been kidnapped, and then the plot takes off from there. No constraints, no subtleties.

It seems that all of his works, carry the same story line. It gets boring after a while. So why am I either going to bother with the new Bourne book, even though it is not written by Ludlum?

Having read almost all of Ludlum's work, the Jansen Directive certainly felt like \\"a Ludlum.\\" This was a great book....very hard to put down.This book grabs the reader early and does not let go, leading on more than one occasion to fits of yawning in the morning because I had stayed up too late reading the night before.

Ludlum's heros are always like James Bond: you know that they will eventually surmount the challenges around them and triumph, but you're with them every step of the way.

There are also too many incidents where someone happens to be in the right place at the right time. I can't even meet my wife when we plan the time and place.

I almost think that this story would have been better served as a plot for a Splinter Cell game, though Sam Fisher is more interesting than Janson.So is it worth it? Well, yes if you want a low maintenance read to pass the time, perhaps on a beach or airplane.But as I said, it's almost as if the book was written in the hopes of making a screenplay out of it.

Also, they keep repeating the same 3 phrases over and over...Come on Branch, please come up with something intelligent to say..ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"50% Inspiration 50% motivation","review":"Branch Warren and his workout partners give inspiring workouts in this video, which also motivates a person to get off the couch. It is not an instruction video, because they do not use safe lifting practices they swing heavy weights that can cause shoulder and back injuries. Buy it for inspiration and motivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"bodybuilding","review":"In watching this dvd, I found myself put off by how these guys showed no respect for the weights & the gym itself. Tossing the plates around like rubbish. I know if these guys were at any of the hardcore gyms in Sydney,Australia, Like ex-wrestlers Paul Graham or Billy Moore's Gym's they'd have been neck cranked & thrown out of their weight rooms pretty bloody quick.I've seen Arnold work out. He'd put the weights away for the simple respect of any other gym member to use & wipe down the bench with his towel so as not to leave his sweat behind.Now Branch is a strongman, no doubt. Everything else about this dvd was good but boys. put your TOYS away neatly so the other kids can play with them okay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculous... In A Good Way","review":"This movie is completely ridiculous, but in a good way.My boyfriend was watching it while I was playing on the computer, but it was so entertaining that I ended up turning my game off and watching it.I definitely would consider this movie a win for the Coen Bros. You get the same intelligent humor that appears in Fargo, without the dark plot. Definitely an ecclectic cast that fits together nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FEW curse words?","review":"Technically, this movie has the most curse words of any film ever put on celluloid...averaging over 2 per minute... but that's besides the point! Its freaking hilarious. The \\"ashes\\" scene is priceless. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thing of beauty","review":"First, an aside. I don't know why so many reviewer say there is no plot. There is a pretty obvious plot, a very convoluted one, having to do with the payoff for a kidnapping. There are also more than a few sub-plots. What IS true, is, as an earlier reviewer said, the plot is just a McGuffin -- it doesn't really matter what it is, just so long as it brings together the various characters so we can enjoy their interactions. (Maybe that's why it had to be so convoluted.)But the one thing of importance I wanted to add is that the movie is glorious to look at. The cinematography is brilliant as is are conceptions behind it. As a small example, pay attention to the fades between scenes at the bowling ally near the end. And more obvious are the Dude's dreams, or hallucinations. Many reviewers concentrate on the left-brain humor, but the right-brain is also rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy Noir","review":"This was the first time I saw The Big Lebowski, so I was not attuned to the fine points of the re-release \\"Collector's Edition\\". I just enjoyed the creative Coen brothers masterpiece of characters and vibrant yet dark and twisted plot. The Big Lebowski is just a fantastic engaging steady stream of laughs.Jeff Bridges (the \\"Dude\\" Lebowski), John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Julianne Moore are the stars and unforgetable as they go on a journey of mistaken identity, White Russians, kidnapping, bowling championships, and the Los Angeles underworld.The Big Lewbowski is a hilarious comedy noir full of colorful bizarre characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"For anyone who has a \\"different\\" sense of humor and often finds themself quoting movies, this is your movie.

Find it someplace else where greater care is taken with product shipping and the return policy is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest movie of all time, perhaps.","review":"Truly comic geinus, not only very, very, funny but also very smart clever and a good plot to boot. The music works, and the dance scenes are very good.

Jeff Bridges and John Goodman were made for each other. I'd like to see more of them together..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, smooth and relaxing movie","review":"I love to watch The Big Lebowski over and over again. That's so relaxing. You just listen to the confusing story and get mixed up a little bit, but that doesn't matter : you laugh at the characters, enjoy their brilliant play (of course, especially Goodman) and admire the authenticity of the film itself.I would recommend it to everyone who is not in the mood for trying to understand the moral of this movie. There is a very simple reason for that : there is no moral...Oops... the star I scratched down, well, it's because The Big Lebowski is a little longer than it should be.I'll have a white russian, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I can get a toe with nail polish by 3:00\\"","review":"This is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Script was hysterical, and casting was perfect. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and John Tutorro were fantastic. Clever, unusaul plot executed wonderully. Special mention has to go to veteran actor Ben Gazara as a sleazy pornographer. I really loved this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BD is garbage","review":"Universal took an old outdated HD transfer (same as released on HD-DVD) which had already issues and then applied generous doses of digital grain removal and some digital sharpening to it and fiddled with the colors and contrast till it \\"popped\\". And there is your remastered version that looks nothing like the original film it came from. Poor release, poor policy. To see how it's done properly check out the new Cohen Brothers Blu Rays for \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"Miller's Crossing\\". Why do these look much better, more detailed and like film with a texture of grain? Because they are new transfers made on modern equipment and unnecessary and destructive digital tinkering was abstained from.Universal has probably the poorest record of all major studios when it comes to catalogue titles. And Lebowski is another victim of this cost cutting strategy (no new transfers, recycle and overprocess old ones instead)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the funniest movie ever!","review":"Jeff Lebowski a.k.a. \\" The Dude\\", doesn't have a job. He lays around, gets stoned, and goes bowling. A couple thugs break into his house and threaten to beat him if he doesn't pay back the money he owes. They mistook him for the rich Jeff Lebowski. He later goes to see the \\"Big Lebowski\\" to get reimbursed for the rug that they mistakenly peed on. The Dude and his friends embark on a quest to makes things right and get a new rug. That rug really tied the room together.This is probably my favorite comedy ever. It has an all star cast featuring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro. This movie has non stop laughs and crazy plot twists that will have you rolling on the floor. You haven't seen comedy until you've seen The Big Lebowski."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite movies.","review":"Definitely in my top 5 comedies along with; \\"Spinal Tap\\", \\"Vacation\\",\\"Caddyshack\\", and \\"Young Frankenstien\\". I am a big Coen brothers fan though there are movies of theirs I don't like; \\"Barton Fink\\", \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\". I think this is their best film. It is visually stunning at moments, brilliantly directed, and absolutly funny in a smart way. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman give some of the best performances of their careers playing two of the most memorable characters I've seen on film. Their chemistry is very natural, like that of two brothers. The writing is spectacular! There's really nothing bad or wrong about this film. I own it, I've seen it many times, and it never gets old. Even if you're not a Coen brothers fan, see this movie. Unless you have a problem with the F word. I believe this movie broke the record for the amount of times it was said."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"One of my favorite movies ever, The Big Lebowski is a masterpiece. The parts are perfectly cast and the music gives the exact mood to every scene.It took me a long time to finally buy it on DVD and to be honest, it doesn't have as many extras as I would like to (it loses a star because of that)"},{"rating":"2","title":"bigger lebowski","review":"did you hear the dudes story? then you have no frame of reference. the chinaman is not the issue here."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets BETTER every time I watch it!","review":"Seriously, I've seen this movie, oohhhhh, approximately ten times, and I enjoy it more and more each time.I have no idea how the Coen brothers do it, but they manage to create characters that fit their cast, which, of course, makes for a perfectly cast movie. Every time. Especially in The Big Lebowski. And the dialogue! This isn't the only Coen movie that people vapidly quote, but there are more memorable/quotable lines in this one film than all the rest put together; and that's saying a lot, when you look at their film discography.So if you haven't seen it, see it.If you're not going to watch it, no matter what, then so be it. The dude abides."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're out of your element...","review":"This is unquestionably one of the greatest movies ever - if you say otherwise you're a travesty. The Cohen brother's propensity for genious is astounding. The acting and script make this movie an insight into all that is good about this country. I'm just going to go to a cash machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dude Abides","review":"This is quite possibly my favorite film. I must admit that I'm a little biased since I am a huge fan of the Coen brothers films. But it is probably the most amusing film I've ever seen. I've seen it several times now, and it seems to get funnier every time. With great dialogue and the usual wacky characters, the Joel and Ethan have made another great film. The interview with the Coens that is included on this disc is also informative but I wish the Coens will do a full audio commentary for one of their films in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated movie of all time","review":"I don't remember seeing the trailer for this movie, or remember it coming to the theaters. A friend of mine told me it was worth watching so I rented it, then bought it, and have watched it about 5 times over the past 2 years. It is one of my all time favorite movies. It's amazing how a movie of this caliber can get so overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anniversary Edition a big hit","review":"Bought for my husband and he loves the bowling ball.

Enjoy the comic drama that allows you to escape all the crap you deal with in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dude abides","review":"Perhaps one of the greatest movies of it's time, it is definitely worth the [money]Buy it. Watch it. Rewatch it. And then again, and so on. The cast is so well choosen for each individual role... especially the Dude. Normally Jeff Bridges is sort of bland, but this is Oscar-worthy, that is if the committe wasnt a bunch of hard [noses]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Untouchable","review":"As far as off-beat commedies go (or any genre of film for that matter), this movie is untouchable. The only commedy I can think of that even comes close to this movie in wit and brilliant character development is Rushmore, and even that is a relatively distant second. I have watched this film about a thousand times and I still find interesting and minute details that I have never noticed before. Anytime you get stressed out or find yourself taking life a little too seriously just kick back with a White Russian and enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad language","review":"I have never heard the use of the \\"F\\" word so many times in my entire time whether in life or in a movie. Not that Amazon had anything to do with how the movie was made but I think perhaps there could have been more of a description to the language used may be offensive . I couldn't even watch the movie because it seemed like every other word was the \\"F\\" word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film I have seen","review":"Without wishing to upset the others who have given this film glowing reviews, I must say that this film has to be the worst I have ever seen. Its' wafer thin story line , which also had holes a jet could fly through, was so bad I had to resist ejecting the DVD. I only watched all of it so I could give it a balanced review and maybe see if it had a scrap of worthy dialog or even one small piece of humour that wasn't contrived or derivative ( the urn ash all over the Dude, really ). All in all a waste of money. The opposite of funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I don't approve of drug use, and this movie just proved my case further.

He assured me I would like it. I had my doubts from reading the DVD jacket but said okay. Curious, as I'd explained to him numerous times what sorts of films or themes I like, and don't. And every I \\"don't\\" is amazingly encapsuled in this--uh--film--if one can call it that.So we watched the DVD. I gave it about twenty minutes--to be polite--though after about three of them I knew I hadn't the slightest idea in the world what the hell this--thing--was about. Here's a bunch of guys who they seem to think are 'with it' I suppose. The dialogue is essentially one raunchy joke followed by another cheesy joke, with a \\"f\\" bomb about every four seconds. The twenty minutes seemed like 20,000 years in Sing Sing, as the book goes.Apparently most people love this movie. I'd like to see a breakdown of the demographics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Dumb and Dumber","review":"How can people like a movie in which every other word is the \\"F\\" word? If simple minded people get a kick out of watching a guy named the Dude smoke a \\"J\\", I'm worried about this country. Spend your time elsewhere, because this is not a thinking man's flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Disappointment","review":"What are you people who rave about this movie smoking. It simply stunk, and I wasted a buck to rent it (not to mention an hour before I fell asleep). My wife now refuses to let me rent anything. (My last selection was Son of Rambow, so you see why). What the hell - not funny, no plot, and who wants to watch an ugly guy walk around in boxers and an ugly bathroom. Whoever gave this more than 1 star (I wish I could have given it 0) is an idiot! The Coen Brothers have done some good work - Fargo and Old Men, but this one was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned it off","review":"Felt Jeff B was playing himself and shut it down for lack of real laughs. Have difficulty understanding how it got 4.5 stars. I've enjoyed many Jeff B movies better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it...","review":"I absolutely love most Coen Brothers movies, but when I tried to watch this one when it first came out, I hated it. Wanted to give it another try, given its rise in popular culture to iconic level. Unfortunately, I still hated it. Didn't like 'The Dude', didn't find it funny, and didn't care for the plot. For the second time, I turned it off before getting halfway into it. I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good movie.","review":"I had no expectations for this movie, as I did not know anything about it beforehand, but it was still a disappointment. It just seemed to go on forever. I guess with movies that have no real plot, there can't actually be much of a natural ending. It had pointless obscene language and drug use. The dialogue was not funny, in fact the characters were so stupid with their back-and-forth it was frustrating. Maybe all the pot-smokers out there will think it's trippy, but if you aren't into that, don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"Having loved Barton Fink, I was looking forward to something amazing! I didn't get it! I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about! But then, we can't all like the same thing. I gave it one star for Jeff Bridges. Usual his presence would guarantee at least a 2 star rating, but he wasn't exactly lust material in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Horrible? I like Jeff Bridges and expected a mature comedy. Unfortunately you would have to be between the ages of 15-23 to enjoy this movie. I knew I was in trouble when Lebowski said he goes by the name \\"Dude\\". I made it through about 2/3rds of the movie and then gave up and didn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Calmer than you are, dude","review":"This is nearly the most hilarious movie ever, and one of my favorites. It is so bizarre, and filled with twists in the plot, you have to watch it twice in a row to appreciate it all. The best part is the funny situational dialague, that is so true to every one of the very well developed and thought out characters. Every character is completely hysterical in their own very different way, and I can hardly watch the scenes with Walter (Goodman) without wetting myself. Every person in this film gives a great performance, and Kudos to the Coen brothers for another masterpiece. Am I wrong?.....Am I wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your entering a world of pain","review":"Let me say this:This is without a doubt, i'll repeat that, without a doubt the best and funniest movie of all time. Since I bought this movie, two years ago, it has not left the bottom tray of my dvd player. I watch it so often that if it where on VHS the picture would already be as worn and faded as if it where 20 years old. The characters and one liners from this movie are unforgetable, and, if you watch it enough times you will probably start talking like the Dude with acessive use of the word \\"man\\" and the exagerated pauses between words.I must say that for the people that gave this movie only one star, they must only have 2 or 3 brain cells working to not be able to appreciate the witty humor of this movie. Do yourself a favor and see the movie for yourself. There is a reason why 99.8 percent of the reviews cant say enough about it. Basically, you shouldn't own a dvd player if your not going to own this movie, simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant like no other movie...","review":"People I have encountered have often made negative comments about this movie, but I think this is because the people don't understand it. This movie is pure genius, and anybody who has read a raymond chandler novel will understand the incoherent coherence of the plot. This is my favorite movie of all time, because of the amazing character development and the witty dialogue. Other than Raising Arizona there is no other movie that comes to mind with such brillant dialogue. I'm positive that the Coen brothers are the greatest script writers to ever live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dude Abides","review":"This is the definitive comedic installment of genius of our time. Everytime this DVD enters my player, I know that for the next hour and 39 minutes, I will consistently laugh. Not just \\"oh that's silly\\" laughter. I'm talking gut-wrenching \\"Bwah hah haws!\\" This movie is so ridiculously funny its legions of fans and impersonators don't even do it justice. You know when one of your most non-funny friends is making you laugh just by quoting any line from this movie, that you have a classic on your hands. Parts of this movie will just enter my head for no reason while I'm going about my day and I'll have to physically try getting the images of Walter, Donnie and the Dude out of my head so I can function. I love this movie so much, I may have watched it more than anyother, but when you're partying or alone, and you suggest to anyone: \\"Should we watch Lebowski?\\" The return reply is always, most assuredly, a heart-felt \\"yes.\\" The only hard part is when the film ends...you just want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BIG FUNNY","review":"THE BIG LEBOWSKI, A MIX UP BETWEEN LEBOWSKIS BECOMES A COMEDY YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS.

Before that, it seemed stupid and i would have probably given it only 2 or 3 stars. The more i watched, however, made me believe that this movie is the best work yet from the Coen bros.

The Big Lebowski is such a brilliant movie, that i have trouble explaining it in words. I have seen it more than 50 times, (literally!) and EVERY SINGLE TIME that i see it, it gets funnier and funnier. The dude, Jeff Bridges, is a slacker without a job or any money that likes to bowl. One day, he unknowingly and unwantingly gets involved in a scheme that involves a millionaire with the same name as him, his feminist daughter, his nympho wife bunny, three german nihilists, a porno king, and his two buds.

You will THANK ME after you see this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes 8MM look like The Godfather.","review":"Yeah, 8MM was a horrible movie. With that out of the way, let me say that The Big Lebowski was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. People are gonna write negative things about my review. Yeah, well, get over it or get a life. Either one. Fargo was so much more superior to this film (not to mention so many other films). I popped this into my VCR with such high hopes. Turns out I couldn't even watch the entire thing; it was about 3 in the afternoon and I didn't feel like napping. It's a movie about a guy who takes ransom money. It was a good idea, but presented in a sloppy, over-stylish fashion. The only reason I give it two stars is because of John Goodman's gun-toting character. Hehe. I guess it's worth a look if you liked the Coen's previous movies just to see that every master has their one failure. A drag, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"the big lebowski","review":"i did not realize it was an HD DVD and the disk will not play in my regular dvd player - i was incredibly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeez, what a boring, unfunny movie","review":"I've heard about this movie for years. Finally sat down and watched it, with great expectations. Total disappointment. I cannot believe this piece of junk is from the same guys who wrote Fargo. This movie is so self-conscious and full of itself that its every attempt at humor is infused with desperation and heavy-handed \\"cleverness.\\" Lots of profanity-laced, repetitive tirades masquerading as hilarious dialogue.

Bought the movie from amazon. Was totally disgusted. The 'F' word was the most used word in the movie, practically every sentence. No reason for it, it didn't add a thing.

It's terrible. Simply and plainly terrible. The characters are boring, the plot is simplistic, and there's far too much pointless profanity. Jeff Bridges' character is an idiot and a loser, and somehow we're supposed to identify with him and the trouble he gets himself into.Thinking back, I realize that most of the rave reviews I heard of this movie came in my college days, and not coincidentally, most people I knew back then were a lot like Bridges' character- losers, drug users, drop-outs, and drifters. The Coen Brothers are great film makers, but not here. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Lebowski","review":"I had seen a short clip of the movie on a show devoted to Jeff Bridges and it looked like it would be a fun type film to see. However, I was disappointed. I'm not a prude, but the F word was used much too often and I felt it distracted from the story. I think that John Goodman did an excellent job in portraying a Viet Nam vet who cannot get Nam out of his mind. It permeates every situation he is involved in.

This is how the boddhisatva lives.The plot follows the Dude (Jeff Bridges) and his bowling buddies Walter Sobchek (John Goodman), a preposterous, bloated vet with anger issues, and blank Donny (Steve Buscemi). The plot is hilariously circuitous, following a pompous crippled fat cat, his manservant (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his porn star trophy wife (Tera Reid), the attempts to recover that wife and/or ransom money from a gang of nihilists, etc. Great surreal scenes when the Dude trips, cool soundtrack too."},{"rating":"1","title":"the big lebowski","review":"This movie only makes sense if you are stoned.

When this Achiever's Edition was announced I was thrilled. When it arrived, I was underwhelmed. The sound and picture don't appear any better in this edition than the original DVD released 7 years ago. Also, the disc in the Achievers Edition is identical to the Collectors Edition also released at the same time.

The \\"Dude\\" is a perfect imitation of himself, beginning with the opening scene where he writes a check for 79 cents. John Goodman's \\"Walter\\" is just too real: I KNOW guys like Walter, and Goodman does these gentlemen to a \\"tee\\"....when it comes to acting, they are both in their element in this movie. A rich blend of good story lines, good comedy, and very earthy people bring together what should have been a smash hit and not a cult favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say what you will about this movie, but at least it has an ethos","review":"Like a lot of the Coen Brother's recent stuff, its whole is less than the sum of its parts, concerning itself with style rather than plot, and with witty, smirking dialog substituting for a storyline. What keeps the movie going throughout a largely rudderless middle and ending is great dialog and acting. When you have the Coen brothers writing and three of the best character actors in the business (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro), you can't go too far wrong. And the point of the movie -- life is too short to get stressed out -- is well-taken.Also, this movie is much better on multiple viewings. If you saw it once and thought \\"eh - o.k. I guess\\" then I recommend watching it again. It will improve the second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coens at their best","review":"I saw this when it came out and didn't get it. After Fargo, The Big L just seemed like a loser's mystery that never went anywhere. A year later my friends are cracking me up doing movie quotes and it helped me see it in a new light. The movie is hilarious! It's awkward at first because the Coens are messing with you, setting up expectations and constantly doing something else instead. Once you're in on the game, sit back, make a white russian, and let the funny happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suggestion","review":"If you've never seen this movie I suggest you watch it at least five times before you form an opinion.

Almost half of those are Blu-Rays. This is the very first one I've ever purchased that didn't have subtitles. I see now that it doesn't list subtitles in the description but when you're already batting .1000 you don't think you need to any more. I always check with regular DVDs, but a blu-ray should have them, period.The movie itself isn't under review, it's this edition. The movie is great, the quality on this Blu-Ray is average, what you would expect, maybe just a little less than that I guess.

Having grown through the 60's and myself being one opposed to the war in Vietnam; I feel that the whole movie ties in real well with the casting of the characters and with the writing of the story. Not only did I watch this movie once but, 8 times in 4 days. It was not until the 4th time did I realize that there was a character involved in the movie that was not given credit. At the end of the movie when Walter and The Dude were scattering Donny's ashes unto the Pacific ocean, from upon a cliff, and the ashes blew back into The Dudes face; Walter and The Dude were embraced, and Walter says \\"Let's go bowling\\"...whom is ontop of the cliff in the background, dressed in black, walking by?

Usually, when a \\"Collector's Edition\\" is released, especially after a movie gains such a huge cult following like Lebowski has, people actually go through the effort of including cast commentaries, more bonus features, and...well, more than just repackaging the old DVD with a new name, a new cover, and a higher retail price.Shame on Universal and Focus Features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty Santa, Lebowski-style","review":"I don't actually know anything about this particular HD DVD Copy of Lebowski. I didn't watch it. I ordered it for a Dirty Santa present. There was a copy of the movie, a bowling pin, a turkey baster, and fixins for White Russians. I was awesome.***Edit: Great movie. Makes you want to smoke and drink and cuss and bowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film #7 for the Coen Brothers","review":"There is not much else to say, that 600 some odd viewers have not said already. That's actually a tell tale sign that a film has to be pretty decent. Few films get that many reviews.Well a few thoughts coming to mind...Jeff Bridges rocks and who doesn't love John Goodman? The characters that these two actors play are just fantastic Coen Brothers creations. As I watched there 7th film, I just can't help but admire the Coen's creativity and direction.This said, I am completely stumped by the ending of this film. I guess I wanted the film to go out in a big BANG, but the film just didn't do that. It ended laid back and cool. It ended as though nothing ever happened and I guess, for \\"The Dude\\", this was the case as nothing really changed in his life. This is a film for just about anyone out there, but two kinds of people in particular come to mind; action or heist film junkies and stoners. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the Coens","review":"Only the Coen brothers could create a wonderfully fantastic, completely improbable film and make it totally engrossing. From Jeff Bridges' laid back stoner, Dude, to John Goodman's Vietnam veteran, gun tottin', wired for sound character, to Peter Stormare's ferret loving nihilist.The most impressive scene has to be the bowling musical number during a dream sequence. Combining bowling with viking imagery is always something one thinks of. The pull it all off with characteristic wit, charm, and occasional violence.One of the Coen's best, right up there with Raising Arizona and Fargo. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Great and Twisted","review":"Shame on me for waiting to see this movie until now! On the other hand, I got to see it in the Widescreen Collector's Edition.Jeff Bridges gives a tour de force performance as The Dude; I can't imagine anyone else in the role. John Goodman's performance may be the best in his career and all the supporting players are top notch. Too bad Steve Buscemi is underutilized, but it's good to see him all the same.As in all of the Cohn Brothers' films, it's useless to summarize the plot. Just sit back and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking Wonderful!","review":"\\"Nihilism, eh.

It is essentially the same as the original DVD. The documentary on the making of the movie is the same documentary that is on the old DVD! There are previously unreleased \\"still\\" images (big deal!) and a new \\"Introduction\\" that is kinda funny, but overall there is nothing new on this disc. The picture has been \\"digitally remastered\\", but that is it! There are even fricking previews!!!!! After I bought the DVD, I found out about the \\"Achievers edition\\" which has multiple discs, etc. I could not find it in any stores.

It goes way beyond the satire and silliness of their other films to tell a myth of post-60s America and the Wild West, line-in-the-sand, \\"mine's bigger than yours\\" mentality that got us here.

I have liked some of the Coen brothers movies but this film is truly awful and an embarrassment for everyone involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get suckered in!!!!!","review":"I was told by many people to see this movie because it was \\"hilarious!\\" Sure it was! I laughed a whole 3 times during the movie. I feel bad for anyone who shells out money to see this pointess film. The plot goes nowhere.

It is a hollywood production at heart, even if it has quirky details. So it was striving to be like an Indie film, sincerely striving. That made it boring to me. Nothing to savor.

Yes, it was funny at points, but overall I found it stupid, imature, and embarrassing to the film industry. It had no great plot and it glorified drugs and sex to an extreme point. On a lighter note, some parts were funny and entertaining, but this is on the lowest level of humor, the kind that takes out any logic and intelligence, insulting the audience's minds. Over all I do not reccomend this movie to those capable of higher thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ordinary guy with big problems","review":"A millionaire's young wife is supposedly kidnapped. And it just so happens that the millionaire shares the same name with The Dude. Two thug's break into The Dude's house and ruin his favorite carpet... what can you say? They had the wrong Lebowski. So the dude tries to get his carpet replaced (because it really tied the room together, afterall) and embarks on a wild journey with his paranoid best friend, euro-trash anarchists, an erotic artist, and an eccentric Latino bowler.The story itself is pretty arbitrary... it's the oddball cast of characters that really makes the movie so chraming. It stars Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and Steve Buscemi. The characters are quirky and very loveable. The dialogue is witty but not for the faint of heart. And the DVD comes in both standard and widescreen formats. This is among one of my favorite movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"The Coen brothers' best film, in my opinion.

People talk about it in almost reverent tones, but I found it more like The Three Stooges: You either love 'em or hate 'em, and I'm neither a fan of the Stooges or of this movie. Don't misconstrue me to saying this is like a Stooges movie; rather that both are a \\"you do or you don't taste.\\"An obviously great cast, with a few wry laughs, but seemingly weird for weirdness' sake. Plus, it has all the swearing of a Tarantino film without the truly great dialogue (that some of his movies have). If I'm going to be beaten over the head with the language of the docks/high-school, at least give me some substance to go with it.All in all, I felt more in the camp of, \\"I wish I had those two hours of my life back\\" than I did, \\"Glad I finally saw that.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Waited way too long to see it","review":"Strong performances, and I love the Coen brothers' sensibility.

This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and the teaming up of Jeff Bridges and John Goodman was a stroke of genius.In TBL, you can see echoes of Jeff's Jack Lucas character from the Bridges/Williams classic The Fisher King, but here, Jeff is playing it strictly for laughs.No shortage of the eff word in here folks, so unless your granny is a tattooed biker chick, I'd suggest it ain't a good, solid movie for all the family. Good solid entertainment in every other way, though.One of the best Jeff Bridges movies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Great Coasters","review":"I had originally purchased Big Lebowski coasters from like Blockbuster or something.

I was very excited to get this in the mail and consider it a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY funny and original","review":"Yeah, the F-word is uttered about 500 times, the lead character is either drinking or smoking grass all the time, and the core plot was probably written on a couple bar napkins at 2:00 a.m. But this is a laugh-out-loud masterpiece, full of both subtle humor and farce/slapstick. To those who are tired of unfunny Hollywood comedies (does the name \\"Adam Sandler\\" mean anything to you?), this is a breath of fresh air. Marvelously inventive in its concept and presentation, with dialogue that almost demands that you watch the movies again. The fact that I came of age in the 60s and was a dedicated stoner for a number of years undoubtedly enhanced my appreciation of this flick. But anyone with a taste for over-the-top humor and quirky characters will love it. While Jeff Bridges was quite good, John Goodman's character is the most memorable in recent memory.

I have seen this movie multiple times now and it just gets better every time. There are scenes where I laugh so hard I'm close to tears.

Raising Arizona and Miller's Crossing I think are pretty decent. But this movie just seems like one long Coen Bros. \\"in-joke\\". The first fourty-five minutes I thought were uproariously funny, and I particularly enjoyed the fantastic cinematography for the bowling scenes. The movie just got bogged down in its preposterous characters--Julianne Moore, John Goodman as the psycho Walter, and that German techno band (?!) --and situations (one of the most bizarre, yet strangely affirming endings I've ever seen).

I'm a sucker for cool packaging, and Blu-ray Books are second to only Steelbooks in my opinion. The full color pages are high quality paper and filled with great photos and trivia. The Blu-ray transfer is good, but could have been better. Night/dark scenes are a little muddy/messy looking, and the movie overall isn't very vibrant. The picture quality is still great (the best Lewbowski has ever looked) and a huge leap over the DVD version, but it's not the kind of quality where you'd use this movie to show off your new HDTV, either.

It doesn't represent the character of film in any way, looking quite like an early, heavily scrubbed hi-def video transfer. It's at least better than the first-issue DVD I own, but anyone who has any of the DVD re-issues would be hard-pressed to find a great improvement in this version.I saw the film in 35mm last year at our local art-house cinema, and it looked MUCH better than this release. Yeah, it wasn't a particularly crisp film, and did show some age....but it did contain film grain, and it looked real.

The first viewing of the movie I was confused and wonderinf if in fact I mean well.... um if I liked it man, Then I watched it a second and third time... It started slowley growing on me man, My fourth and fifth viewing of the movie well ... umm... like I had been smokin some Tie stick man.... and like it was just far out especially the Halusination scenes. With every viewing I have picked up stuff that I had not noticed in previous viewings man, like everytime you watch it you will too. The movie will definitly grow on you man, so grab a white russian man, and just go and pop in the movie man, and pretty soon you will be calling your self \\"THE DUDE\\" you will be saying \\"SHUT THE F**K DONNIE\\" etc. One of the true Stoner movies glad I saw the movie, I highly recommend it man."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Mistake","review":"Unfortunately I wasn't able to view this DVD.

One of the guys was lucky enough to die from a heart attack. He didn't have to suffer trying to act in an actless story. The film never got out of the gutter. By the time it was half finished, I began to realize that it wasn't an awful movie. It was a tiresome movie. From a bunch of guys who could make humorous FARGO I expected something, anything, funny.

The character Jesus' potential was totally wasted. He could have been the funniest character but instead his lines fell flat and were boring. The plot was boring. The drug-tripping scene broke the continuity of the story. Any time a movie goer is suddenly reminded they are watching a movie, the movie has failed, and that's what the tripping scene did for me. Fargo was ten times the movie this was. I will concede that if you're a Coen Brothers fan, then you will probably enjoy this. But if you're not, stay away! And do me a favor, don't say this review wasn't helpful just because you like the movie and want to punish me. This review is here for the non-Coen fans who might get hoodwinked into thinking this is a comedy. Which it's not.

It has some good stars in it (John Goodman, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, Jeff Briges) and has the two best directors in the world (Joel and Ethan Coen) This is a cult classic for a reason, its great! The story is over the top (which is a good thing if you like that sort of thing) It's a good movie to watch over and over again and still get joy out of it, which is why I bought it on DVD.

Nothing is more refreshing than the protagonist of a movie being a loser like \\"the dude\\" (or duder, or el duderino)- as the lead character refers to himself, and Jeff Bridges is perfect as the dude. i couldn't imagine anyone else playing this part and succeeding like he does- he definitely makes it his own (kinda like Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great radio... small prob when using ipod with it","review":"This is a great radio.

I am also a huge fan of concert DVDs. The only performance worse than this is the so-called Beach Boys concert from a few years ago. Orzabal is spot on, and his vocal talent remains second to none. On the other hand, Curt Smith looks & sounds like a musician with an acquired brain injury... frequently off the beat or off-key. I had to turn it off after about 10 minutes. There is so much good stuff available, how did they think they could get away with such an uninspired project?

I listen to bands like Korn, Nirvana, Pearl Jam and all the other so-called rock bands today, and I fail to see the appeal and even less of the talent. Iron Maiden influenced so many musicians during the early and mid eighties, myself included. I sometimes think that I wouldn't be a music teacher today if it had not been for Maiden, Sabbath, Ozzy, AC/DC, Van Halen, Rush, and a host of others (well, Bach and Handel too).

The lyrics on the album are espicially strong, with the exception of \\"22 arcia avenue\\" these songs are ones to be remembered. The mix of rythmic guitar and lead guiltar combined with a steady bass beat creates good songs such as the prisoner or run to the hills. Vocals on this album are also very strong. Get this if a fan of 80's metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best metal album of all time!","review":"I cannot beleive that just before I wrote this review this album had an average score of a mere four and a half stars out of five. This album truly deserves the maximum quantity of stars. I am hoping that this review will help to tip the balance and give it the five stars it deserves. This is one killer album and if you haven't got it then buy it NOW. Every song ROCKS especially classics like 'Number of the beast', 'Run to the hills', 'The prisoner' and 'Hallowed be thy name'. If you want to buy one maiden album I would say buy 'Live after Death' because it has most of the classics from their first five albums, but if you want a good maiden studio album, this is the one. This album, along with 'Powerslave' and 'Peice of mind' which are also excellent should go down as one of the finest examples of heavy metal mastery EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of it's genre","review":"Now, I'm not a very huge fan of power metal, but this release is amazing. Bruce Dickinson is the perfect match for their music. all the tracks are stunningly progressed and brilliant.

Danlgedo, Hank, where do the Cowboys play?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a classic","review":"This album has two of Iron Maiden's best songs, Hallowed be Thy Name, and Run to Hills. Those are great, but Gangland and Number of The Beast are not good at all. Still, this album defines a breakthrough in metal, and is a must buy for any fan of classic metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but their best?","review":"This is a great album, one of Maiden's best easily, but I don't understand quite why everyone thinks it's their best ever. The thing that confuses me most is the two hit songs, Number of the Beast and Run to the Hills. They're both great songs in their own right, but their hardly classic maiden songs, I mean seriously, they do not capture maidens epic style, and the majority of the songs on this album are good, but not nearly as good as what followed. I mean seriously, compare Invaders to Where Eagles Dare or Aces High, it's not even close, and Children of the Damned isn't one of Maiden's better songs, either. 22 Acacia Avenue is awesome, though, and I must say Hallowed be thy name is like the definitve metal song, an unbelievable song that no one else will ever top. However, it's the only superlative song on the album, and definately not enough to make it maiden's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy customer.","review":"I am very unhappy.

Although Larry's narrative is specifically applicable to Baby Boomers all catholics can relate to the events in his life, his disenchantment and rejection of the Church and his surprising return.

Odd. It threw me out of the narrative. The emotional stuff was a little clunky sometimes, and repetitive. Subtlety: C+Being from Arizona, I loved the way Jance wrote longingly about the rain, about how beautiful it was, how it promised respite from the heat.

I'm giving rating of 1 star soley because of the editing, which was awful. It should have been a fun read, but the errors took away from the enjoyment. I would like to compare the Kindle version with a print copy to see how the errors compare. Since this is the second Kindle version of Jance's novels with the same problem, I wonder if this common in Kindle versions?

I wonder how on earth it got published in the first place. The setting of Alaska and characters in law enforcement seemed intriguing. But, joy in this work was not to be. While this is billed as a mystery, the mystery is completely obscured by the fact that the characters slept with each other any time, any place, any situation, including some very implausible ones. Add to that amateurish writing, misplaced dialogue tags, Liam's preoccupation with his zipper and a dozen characters all introduced at the same time made this a slog instead of a read. Too bad, the potential for a good story is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"She just gets better and better","review":"This author is becoming one of my favorites. Her characters and settings are really engaging. I love both series and can't wait for more from Liam Campbell. The characters in this series are vulnerable and committed to their causes. Alaska is a great place to create the world that they live in and the author is careful to make it what it should be - beautiful and challenging.

As for the quality of the glider for the price you pay, well you get exactly what you pay for, this glider is not a bargan... It is made from small remenants of redwood dovetail jointed and glued together. Mine arrived in good condition and I was able to assemble it in about 1-1/2 hours. It glides quietly but it feels cheep. Could have used more sanding the finish in some areas is rough. Cushions are a must at least for the back, it hits you in the wrong place.

I was amazed at how light it was. It is very hard to put together. The holes don't line up well. The wood is very soft and easily damaged. The table came with a huge scratch and well dented. I spent about 4 hours sanding and re-staining it. The directions are not very clear. If you don't have a lot of experiance in putting together things, I wouldn't attempt it. Be prepared to drill out your own holes for the glider. The glider was the biggest disapointment for me as it is very tiny. I am 5.0, 110lbs and it is not big enough or comfortable to me. The legs on the tables are to short, they look out of proportion. Universal size cusions don't even come close to fitting them! The worst part was that it took over a month for all the pieces to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look but don't touch (or buy!).

This might be a better product for someone who specializes in Garden Decoration, since it is completely not functional. This bench fell apart after just two months of use. The seat collapsed with one of our customers on it. While it *is* made out of red cedar which gives the impression of durability, the slats are quite thin, and the construction is flimsy. This bench comes ready to assemble - have you got a few hours? The finish does not hold up beyond maybe 30 days, and it is now sitting in a heap behind our store, waiting to be thrown out or repaired.

The lyrics are cheesy - hey they are based on chessy sci fi material like Star Trek 4.Russell Allen and Damian sound really good. Dan Swano and Robert sing the low parts, which are not as good, but Dan Swano is better than Robert's low vocals on the live album. Floor does okay on the vocals but often she is lost in the mix. Floor's voice also doesn't layer and fill out well. Not bad, but not as good as her vocals with sister Irene on Star One live, which are simply awesome.Guitar tone is very good.

Q is for Quarry wasn't as good as I had hoped. I felt the pace was rather slow moving, between her \\"partners\\" illnesses and hospitalizations and the never ending saga of Kinsey and her new found, wealthy extended family, which I feel is being dragged out too slowly. I couldn't wait to finish the book, it seemed too long, and then all of a sudden, it was over.

Perhaps, because it is based on an actual event. The reader will guess the culprits before Kinsey does, but she is busy learning about her own family back ground and maybe not paying enough attention to the investigation. She seems very trusting of the female characters she encounters which seems out of character for her.The two older policemen are an intersting addition to the book and very believable in their quest to close the file on this case. The book does not move as fast as other Grafton books, there is a lot of information about desert area in which the story is set, which is immaterial to the story; but interesting to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quitting Q is for Quarry","review":"I have read all of Sue Grafton's alphabet series and have enjoyed reading most. However, my money was totally wasted on this one. I am halfway through Q is for Quarry and fall asleep everytime I read it due to boredom. The plot and characters are uninteresting, and the narrative is marred by constant, unnecessary repetition. This is a miss for Sue Grafton. I am going to cut my losses and go on to a more interesting book. Life is too short to spend it reading boring and unimaginative books. I hope the next in the series will find Sue Grafton and Kinsey back on track"},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite \\"letter\\" so far","review":"Sue Grafton can usually be counted on for a good read, but in this 17th. book of the series, she stumbles a bit. She uses a true story as the basis of her book, and while this sounds like a good idea, somehow it just doesn't work. Kinsey is asked by her friend Lieutenant Dolan to help solve an old murder in which he and his friend Stacey Oliphant discovered a body which had never been identified by any name other than Jane Doe. Stacey is having health problems and Dolan figures that a little police work is all it will take to pull him out of the doldrums. (Where's the reasoning there?) Grafton throws in a few scenes with the estranged members of Kinsey's family, but nothing seems to work in this slow-moving book. The characters are shallow and I never really cared whether Jane Doe or her murderer was ever revealed. I live in hope that Grafton will do better on \\"R\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, Flat, Plodding","review":"I enjoyed Grafton's earlier books immensely, but the last few have been kind of iffy.... some good and some bad. I was hesitant to invest in this one, but the premise sounded interesting. It could have been a good story, but I found myself struggling to get through it. I thought it was just me...maybe too many distractions just now. But after reading some of the other customer reviews, I see that I was not alone. There are the usual tedious descriptions of life's minutia common to Grafton's books, but what is worse, the entire story is flat and plodding without any spark. If this was a debut novel by an unknown author, it would go straight to the discount table in the bookstore.

Is she running out of material or trying to find a way to quickly reach her book quota? I kept wondering what happened to the Kinsey I fell in love with in A through M. She's become dull, boring and so damn well...good. Where's the Kinsey that had gumption, broke the rules and dusted her banister with her underwear? Not only was there no clean ending, no closure or case solved but the plot was boring and predictable. With this, we had to put up with two old bickering men.Sue, please oh please bring back the old \\"fun\\" Kinsey that we all miss!

I was quite disappointed to find it not nearly as entertaining as any of the previous entries. I have to agree with the other reviewers voicing the opinion that the author is feeling pressed to keep churning out these books.I thought the characters were one-dimensional and I couldn't get into the story. I read all of the other books in a day or so, but it took me two weeks to get through this one. Definitely not a page-turner. There was little involvement of Kinsey's landlord (Henry) and his sister-in-law Rosie, who I particularly like. To me, the book was flat and I got the impression that the author was just \\"phoning it in.\\" I will continue to read Grafton to see if the next effort is better, as I have liked her work a lot up til now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on details; short on plot","review":"A body is found in a Quarry (Q, right), and is linked to a disappearance of a teenage girl 18 years previously. Kinsey Milhone links up with 2 retired police officers to track down the killer. The book is full of details that detracted, rather than helped, me as I read along. There are too many characters in the story, many of of them interlinked to each other in really complex ways. At one point, I almost had the urge to make a chart of them all and draw arrows, etc to make sense of who was who. In any event, when the identity of the killer is revealed, I was relieved....this book was beginning to sap my patience, and I was about to put it down and give up on it. This is the first Sue Grafton/Kinsey Milhone book I have read. I may just try one more book of hers, before I give up on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Different Kinsey!","review":"This was quite a different Kinsey book, but I too enjoyed it. I liked the idea that is was based on a real unsolved crime, and I just hope that that crime is solved as a result of this book. Kinsey is very likeable in this book. She is much softer and more friendly. Heavens, we see her friends with her nemesis Dolan in this book, and it seems to work. There may not have been as much as non-stop excitement in this book as we've seen in others, but let's be fair - it's good to give Kinsey a little rest from bad people and life threats. Besides, she is working on solving a twenty year old crime, so how dangerous could that be? It was also good to get a good glimpse of small town America, the setting for this book. I missed her neighbour Henry and Rosie the owner of her neighbourhood restaurant in this book, but I'm sure they'll be back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinsey Is Back!","review":"And so is Sue Grafton after her last two books didn't seem worthy of their predecessors. Here she seems back in the swing of things and reinvigorated. Perhaps it's because the story revolves around an actual unsolved 1969 Jane Doe murder in Santa Barbara, that has haunted the author. Whatever is was, she's created an interesting and engaging case, while introducing two new detectives who seem to serve up comic relief more than anything else. No matter, the book felt familiar again and for people who felt like I have that the last couple of letters weren't the best, you might want to try this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Q' is Quizzically Amazing","review":"This was my first Kinsey (and Grafton) novel and just reading the summary convinced me to give it a try. And I was unable to put the book down (I went through the whole thing in just little over 2 days)! I have read two more Kinsey novels (N and P) since and, tho I enjoyed them greatly as well, I still deem Q to be my fave. It is so much different than many of the other mysteries I've read-- for one, you don't even know who the victim is--let alone the murderer(s). Another is its basis upon a true unsolved murder (and Grafton's close work with the real detectives of that murder), which made a novel that's believable--not absurdly farfetched.I was only mildly disappointed in the part where Kinsey's family history was involved--it didn't seemed to be adequately tied in enough with the main plot, and I find myself thinking \\"C'mon already, get over this, so I can continue figuring out whodunit!\\" But otherwise an outstanding read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...this was a terrible book.","review":"Books like this make me think \\"If this is all it takes to become a successful writer, I am in the WROOOONG business!\\"Plot is horrible.

It never was resolved. It was the only interesting aspect of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off with something else.","review":"I have read all of the Kinsey Millhone novels, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth. I think Sue Grafton needs to recharge and get back to the Kinsey we all know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the paperback","review":"I am generally an avid Kinsey fan, eagerly awaiting her next adventure. Unfortunately, she has very little adventure in this plodding, time wasting effort. The book never drew me in, and took far too much effort to describe every little detail of every place the characters were. The fact that it was inspired by a true story is not enough to make this a worthwhile investment of your time. I am a detective book freak, and have read thousands of novels, this is one that I should have skipped. However, given her track record, I am still going to give the next Kinsey novel a try, but that's a fan for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description","review":"This book took me 4 days to plough through. Of over 380 pages don't think there was dialogue on 200. I felt it was a history of a lot of small towns in southern California and certainly didn't need the information about all the bars and restaurants.The same goes for the description of the characters, i.e. facial hair, etc as well as clothing and the conditons in their living quarters. The story line was weak and certainly not of the caliber of previous books. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sue Grafton has lost her touch","review":"I've read and enjoyed all of Sue Grafton's alphabet series until now, but this one has broken the string. It's just plain poorly written. The plot and characters strike a totally false note, and the story never gets going. This book is simply unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Case","review":"It's a cold case that Kinsey gets involved in this time. Lt. Dolan who is suffering from heart issues and is retired now takes it as his mission to help his friend, former sheriff Stacy Oliphant who could be dying of cancer solve the one case that has haunted him, a murder that happened years ago. A young woman remains unidentified and they are determined to give her a name and catch her killer. This story is based on a real life event. Though it drags at times, it is still a good book. We find out more about Kinsey's long lost relatives too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Q IS FOR QUARRY","review":"I think this is one of her better books.Have read the series up to this one, and like them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Q is for questionable: this series is fading","review":"While \\"Q\\" doesn't have the blatant inconsistencies, dangling plot lines, and poor writing of \\"P,\\" the writing in this book simply isn't up to the previous standard of this series. This story could have been well-told in roughly half its 380 pages. While I don't object to scene-setting and description, Grafton's style here is too predictable: EVERY time Kinsey meets someone, there will immediately follow one or two paragraphs on what the person is wearing. The repeated health problems of her police buddies -- and the junk food ecstasies -- get old with constant repetition.Virtually every time Kinsey knocks on a door, or makes a phone call, she gets solid information from someone willing to talk with her. In real life, investigators -- much less non-police investigators -- much more frequently knock on doors and make phone calls when folks aren't home, or won't talk.This book is a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Addiiton to the Alphabet Series","review":"A worthy addition to Grafton's series and an interesting change of pace. Although it starts out slow, by the end of the book I was fascinated with the plot and characters and was sorry to see it end. I would not recommend this one to an uninitiated Grafton reader, but \\"A is for Alias\\" is the natural starting point anyway. The sideshow parts of the these novels such as Henry, Rosie, Diehl (when will he come back?), and Kinsey's lost family add a lot of charm and familiarity for the return reader. Kinsey Millhone continues to be an enigma that I enjoy getting to know better with each installment. I also find the historical timeline of the series very appealing. My being almost the same age as Kinsey makes the mid-eighties setting of the books and her late sixties coming of age a sentimental trip down memory lane for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in form.","review":"Grafton has done it again. And her style is still refreshing. Kinsey not only demonstrates she is capable of helping out someone she has a professional relationship with, she gets a little closer to her estranged family as well. Read on, you will like this one. Lets just hope Grafton doesn't fissile out before she finishes the alphabet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book in the Series","review":"I appreciate the fact that Sue Grafton was motivated by a REAL case, to write this book. It was, however, the most boring, slow paced one of the series. Grafton has been filling her latest books with lots of extraneous fluff, but this was completly over the edge. The basic premise is too far fetched as well. Reminded me of my college term papers that had to be 2000 words....so you just kept adding stuff! Also, it's nice to see a main character who isn't a perfect Yuppie....but Kinsey is turning into a SLOB.... food wise, clothes wise and personal hygiene....ICK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Kinsey Milhone!","review":"I'm not into mysteries! I don't care for overly-complicated plot constructions. But from the first ABC mystery, I became a fan of Sue Grafton. Her work is uncomplicated, straight-forward and easy to follow as she limits her characters and slowly introduces new ones to the reader. Kinsey is my pal and whatever she does and wherever she goes, I'm right there with her.Great read!Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three"},{"rating":"1","title":"Q is for Quarry","review":"I am such a fan of Sue Graftons, but this story Q is for QUARRY,was so bland and boring that I never finished it which is a first for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Q is for quick read","review":"As Sue Grafton winds her way through the alphabet, her stories are getting better and better. I have read up to \\"V\\", her latest, and can't wait to read the rest. It was so good I was able to read it very quickly. I hate when a good book comes to an end, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Oh my, I am on book number 17 of the Kinsey Milhone series but I don't recognize where I am. I have left the land of mischieveous, tantalizing and light-amusement to a libre-noir. Toto, we've left Kansas! I have loved each and every one of the first 16 of Grafton's alphabet but Q is for Quarry is just plain painful. Grafton describes each character's very breath with excruciating agony. Let's hope R stands for \\"I Got it Right\\" once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book; the mystery is....umm boring.","review":"I'm a big fan of the series, but I think it ran out of gas after \\"H.\\" I've struggled through all of the books from \\"I\\" and beyond, but this one was the worst. Why? For 350 pages, it's a thin book - thin on plot, thin on story, and thin on characters. I can't figure out why the book needed 350 pages to tell this story. Maybe if she had a better editor (or better story)?By the end of the book, I could not have cared less about the unfortunate victim or any of the characters. Kinsey is the same (which is fine), but the mystery was so uninvolving, it took me three weeks to read this book. I have no idea where this series is going, but after all these years, it can only get better. Right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Q is for Quit","review":"I am fan of Sue Grafton. However, her latest offering was so plodding, so unbearably slow that I did the unthinkable--I quit reading before the end. The book lost me, was an agony to read, and 50 pages from the end I no longer cared who killed Jane Doe. I think G was Grafton's best offering, probably because Kinsey had some real relationships going (and some romance). Give Kinsey a life! Please. She, and this fan's interest, are both dying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Q is Quit Reading NOW","review":"I tried, I really tried to enjoy this book. I am very glad that I did not rush out and spend my money on the hardback book, I had it reserved at the library. The story based on a real life unsolved murder had the potential to grab your attention, but with the slow paced, overly detailed, boring story Grafton turned it into I was sadly dissapointed. \\"P\\" is for Peril was not up to standards either, so I'm hoping the next book in the series can get back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"B\\" is for Boring","review":"You'd think by the time Ms. Grafton got to the letter 'Q' in her series, she would have sharpened her craft. Earlier books in the series were much better. In this one, Kinsey tags along with a couple of old, sick and washed-up detectives on a cold case. However, she spends way too much time talking about the minutia of her daily routine. \\"I went here, did this, went there, did that, had a diet Pepsi, and . . . yada, yada, yada.\\" This book really drags, and by the time the case starts to unfold, you're practically asleep and could care less. To make things even worse, the metaphors and similes just don't work. Describing someone's tone of voice as \\"flat as a two day old can of soda\\" doesn't quite rise to her usual. And although she's going for a laugh out loud moment here and there, she never quite clears the bar. Maybe Ms. Grafton is getting tired of the whole shtick; if that's the case, she should just let us know and give it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darker and Darker","review":"I've mostly enjoyed the Alphabet series, but Sue Grafton's last few books have been darker and darker. I'm tired of the same old whining about her love life, her family, and her relationships in general. Her writing has become contrived, predictable, and frankly down right boring. I usually keep all my books, hardbound or paperback, but Q is for Quarry is going straight to my public library as a donation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Q is for Quite Possibly Sue Grafton's Worst Book","review":"I know in keeping with the Alphabet, Sue had to think long and hard to come up with a story to revolve around a word beginning with Q. Well Q is for Quarry, is totally substandard. If you have EVER read one of Sue's Alphabet books, then usually there is humor, mystery, a little danger, and of course Kinsey having conflicts. But this book was slow, and when it did take off, it was still downhill. I look forward to the next book, because one bad book is not going to turn me sour on the alphabet books."},{"rating":"1","title":"C is for crappy","review":"I read a lot. I enjoy mysteries. After finally getting around to reading a book by Sue Grafton, I have to say that I'm utterly disappointed. This was my first, (and last, thank you very much), Sue Grafton novel. It was boring, contrived, and PREDICTABLE. At some point, (I'm not exactly sure, but it could have been when Grafton was trying in vain to make Kinsey's estrangement from her family a viable sub-plot), I started rooting for all of the main characters to be killed. I have never disliked 'the good guys' as much as I did when reading this novel. Hey, here's a cop that drinks and smokes too much. Naw, shucks ma'm - that's not cliche! In fact, the entire book was one, long, ridiculous cliche. Ah, but enough of this. I've wasted too much time reading this horrible book to write any more. Do yourself a favor - don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Yawner","review":"It took me approximately 3 weeks to get through this 350-page novel. That's because my only incentive to return to the book was to complete it.The setting is as desolate as the plot and characters. The plot is a series of back-and-forths between Kinsey's hotel room and the location of her next interview, with a too-frequent reference to a fast-food detour in between for humor (and this attempt at levity missed the mark by the third or fourth mention).Reading this book reminded me of returning to jogging after a long stretch off: it was dull and arduous and I wanted to cut it short after every 50 steps or so and in the end, I was just satisfied that I finally finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book did not meet my admittedly high expectations. The author overpromised and underdelivered, failing to cover any subject attemptd in depth. After reading a couple of these guides I realized that most of what you need to know to succeed in business school is just common sense. Keep doing whatever you did to be successful before you got to business school and don't listen to so-called pundits, who all give conflicting information anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick, fun and informative read!","review":"I read the MBA Jungle, B-School Survival Guide and found it to be an excellent resource. If I was reading this with the eyes of a prospective student, this book would have accurately addressed what I'd need to know. As an administrator/educatior who works with the MBA program at our institution, I can say the information I read was right on target! You did a great job. It was easy and fun to read and I plan to recommend this book to prospective students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid advice and fun to read","review":"I had been looking for a book like this to give to my sister, who is starting an MBA program in a few weeks. Skimmed through a few titles at a local store and this was by far the best - it rang very true to my own experience at business school a couple years back. Parts of it, like the international sections seemed less useful then others. However, on the whole, tons of solid, usable advice, and I laughed out loud at a couple of the jokes and top ten lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"I got turned on to Jungle Media Group through my sister's subscription to JD Jungle magazine. I looked through the MBA Jungle website, and was really excited when I got this book. This book contains little to no new content not offered in the magazine or on the website. Some of the sections are taken directly from the website (probably vice versa actually). It's not to say that the information itself is not useful (although it is presented a little simplistically), but it feels very stale. So if you are a regular reader of MBA jungle or MBAJungle.com save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I did not find it helpful in gaining any genuine insights about the MBA experience. I found it lacking in depth on any particular subject.

I am giving this a one-star rating because of Amazon's inexplicable decision to price this 4th set at essentially double what the first three sets cost.There is no plausible reason for this. It seems to be some kind of game-playing price test.Three first three collections are fine -- they contain the same programs I remember watching on television some years ago. I suspect this collection is fine, too, but there's nothing special about it compared to the other three. Therefore there's no legitimate reason to pay twice as much for it.If Amazon ever decides to put the price down to where the other three are being sold (and those prices, too, bounce around a lot) then I would buy this one. For now, however, I will pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"I love Poirot. I can go into another world and step into the movie. I won't answer the phone when I watch David Suchet.

The Hofmann selections are also wonderful, but I believe also available elsewhere, such as on the Nimbus series featuring piano rolls.I wouldn't pay the high price listed here...apparently it's out of print. I believe I found it used for a reasonable price.To sum up: piano roll performances, sound great, wonderful historical documents, don't pay too much though because you can probably find these performances elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"always good","review":"art is subjective so whether or not you'll like this depends entirely on your taste in art. if you're a viggo fan, then you'll have to have it. the book itself is good quality, not so huge like a lot of coffee table books."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY DOES IT LEAK/","review":"I BOUGHT THIS QUEEN SIZED RAISED PREMIER AEROBED ABOUT 1-1/2 YRS AGO.

We have purchased at least six single and three double Aerobeds over the last few years.

A guest goes to sleep on a fully inflated mattress, and wakes up in the middle of the night on a hard, or carpeted, floor! The product clearly has a design flaw.

They will not replace again because orginal purchase is over a year. The best they could do is give me free shipping on a $300 product that will not last a year NO THANKS, I can get free shipping at Amazon.

The leaking starts remarkably soon, especially considering the cost. After very careful use and storage, the mattress began slowly leaking immediately after the warranty expired.

Called customer service to discover that there is NO servicing this product's motor or valves. No parts, No service!! If the motor fails or the valve fails - NO REPLACEMENT PARTS!! It was suggested that I throw it out and purchase another!!!In a world that is taxed beyond it's capacity, you would think a company would manufacture a product that can be serviced instead of sitting in a landfill.

I've owned several over the last few years, and most end up leaking. Ironically, the leaks usually occur at the square impressions that are patterned over the surface, which are mostly for looks.

A serious student of systems thinking will find this book almost childlike. It looks like it was written based on the experiences of someone in a controlled lab instead of the real world. Some concepts are valid and worthwhile, such as the way in which position in the organization determine how people see the system affecting them. But most of the rest of the book is a struggle to get through, due to it's simplistic nature. The font used is almost cartoonish in nature, and the entire book probably could have taken up 40 pages if written in normal font type-spacing.Someone seriously interesting in systems thinking should read. Ackoff, Senge' or Gharajedaghi. Not this book.My favorite systems book is \\"Systems Thinking managing chaos and complexity\\" by Jamshid Gharajedaghi.

I felt so enthralled with the book, I called the number on the back of the book to inquire how I could explore, experience and learn the Seeing Systems concepts further. I have not done that before or since. 6 years later, I still feel Barry Oshry's teachings are one of real gems in understanding organizations and their behavior mysteries.

I opened mine up and tried to adjust the bulbs, even placing foil behind them to help with the reflection; it made it barely legible in a window at night.Ultimately, this could have been one of the BEST Halloween props I've ever seen, but the shoddy design makes it worth about $5 instead of the $25+ you usually see it priced at.

The next two tracks are instrumentals, \\"Foliorum Viridium\\" sounds similar to \\"The Misshapen Steed\\" on Pale Folklore and it's the oldest song on here. Next \\"Haunting Birds\\" is a very nice acoustic instrumental with sounds of the campfire. Then comes \\"Kneel to the Cross\\" which is a Sol Invictus cover. Very well done, but i've never heard the original and i've never even heard the band, However, now i'm very interested in checking them out, which i'm having a bit of trouble doing because i can barely find anything. Anything that inspires Agalloch is worth checking out. The last song is a good ending, very ambient.If you love the two Agalloch full lengths be sure to get this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for clinical practice","review":"Well presented excellent images.I use this book as an NP in critical Care.

I had some limitations on the size of the speakers I could use, so naturally I thought of Bose. After using these speakers for about 20 days I had returned these speakers because of the lack of sound, what I mean by lack of sound is that I could hear humps from the speakers to the base module and distortion it got very annoying. One thing a person will notice very quickly about Bose is that there speakers don't need a lot of watts to get loud, (loud does not mean they are good speakers). I end up going with Round Sound (aka. Anthony Gallo Acoustics) A' Diva speakers much cleaner sound. If you are in the market for small speakers I would highly recommend giving Round Sound a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Book","review":"Although this book is out of print, I would highly recommend checking library shelves for it.

I did like the next release from them but imo they never again reached the level of clarity is sound that they had maintained throughout the 80's.

This cd was the one that shed a whole new light on maidens music for me yes maidens first 5 cds sound sonically superior(mainly due to the lack of keyboards getting in the way) but they are also lyrically inferior. This cd combines classic maiden sonics with smarter lyrics and a lil more of a prog influence this truly adds to this bands legacy, for me more than any other release of their career. This was their last consistent album before they broke up (oringal line up, which eventually reunited) and although the cds to come haven't been as good overall they continued the trend of smarter lyrics and their has been at least an amazing song or 2 per release from here on out.

I bought three other \\"enhanced\\" Iron Maiden cd's and I got scammed on those as well. The packaging on the 1998 and 2002 are identical. Make sure you buy the 2002.

Granted, I LIKE Number of the Beast and Powerslave more, as they are easier to get into. But Seventh Son wraps it all together, the lyrics, the arrangements, the theme idea, and of course, the music! I hear those critisicms from people that claim it is too soft-core and uses synths too much,and they have a valid gripe, but I'm a guy that can just as easily go from listening to death metal to going soft-core into Supertramp, so it didn't bother me at all. Stand-out songs are \\"Infinite Dreams\\", \\"Evil That Men Do\\", \\"Seventh Son\\", and the crushing masterpiece, \\"Only the Good Die Young\\". If you're new to Maiden, go for \\"Number of the Beast\\" For fans that can appreciate a more melodic side of metal, you can't miss with \\"Seventh Son\\".

Compared to what they had produced before, this album is simply the pits. Aaargh! Just horrible in every department; lyrically and musically. The synthesized sound is just overdone and was already overdone in Somewhere in Time. 'Moonchild', 'Evil That Men Do', and 'Only the Good Die Young' are the best songs on this album. 'Infinite Dreams' is also fairly decent. The rest is pretty bad by Maiden standards and the lyrics are just bland. 'Can I Play With Madness?'

It is been praised to be the second highlight of their career ( Number Of The Beast being the first ), but personally I don't think it quite stands up to challenge it. It is quite as good as Piece Of Mind, and as a whole, better than Powerslave. Sometimes the synths disturb me, though, and every now and then the songs don't sound as heavy. Good example is \\"Can I Play With Madness\\", which is way too commercial, if you ask me. Still, \\"Seventh son...\\" is a very convincing effort, offering the best song material since The Number Of The beast."},{"rating":"2","title":"another maiden classic","review":"i see people giving this album 2 stars, 3 stars, and i have to wonder why.

Although the later option is an easy fix, it can be annoying if you play with friends or if you want to control the volume - it's a fixed rate.Despite these minor flaws, I would still highly recommend the XGA to anyone who has unreliable access to a TV or simply wishes to use their computer monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"gloves","review":"Year after year they never, EVER have an adult Spider-Man costume that includes gloves and boots.

Although leisurely written, the mystery itself is quite taunt and intriguing and the many complex characters that people the novel are exceptionally well-rounded and believable. Sayers clearly enjoyed creating this particular work, and her pleasure in it illuminates the book to an exceptional degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This is an enjoyable book. Why? There is no murder; but you expect one at any moment.We start with the \\"Gaudy Night\\" a reunion and meeting of female graduates and present students. First there are unsettling and obscene scrawlings. It escalates to a prank in the chapel; then vandalism in a student's apartment.There are many red herrings in this novel. When you think you've got it figured out, along comes another clue!This is not a traditional whodunit in the tradition of Agatha Christie. The novel has a romantic subplot and some polemics. This does not detract from the story.I loved the character of Lord Peter Wimsey. Many writers get stuck in the mode of putting the sleuth in the character of a Jane Marple or a Hercule Poirot. Lord Peter is a unique character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough slog","review":"This book was a real disappointment. I love period mysteries, but this one never really had any suspense.

However, I was very disappointed. Since a whodunit has to have many characters, the problem is that the female characters, of which there are many, are barely distinguishable from one another and are rather colorless. Even the protagonist, Harriet Vane, is insipid. The only one who is at all interesting is Lord Peter himself, but he is not around for much of the novel. In addition, Lord Peter is madly in love with Harriet, so that detracts from his attractiveness. The plot itself is fairly well thought out, but I knew the solution before the end. The other problem is Sayer's feminist agenda which is a bit shrill, overtaking both plot and characters. That agenda is also rather outdated and simplistic in this 1936 story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is great - typos are NOT","review":"This Kindle version is not worth the money, folks.

She seems to want to show that she is more than just a mystery writer, and to do this she fills the pages with many obscure references to that show that she is a scholar. She also gives us travel log of Oxford in case anyone doubted that she attend a college there.The pages of the novel a strewn with banal dialog that does not seem to have any purpose other than to show that the author is familiar with the banter (or is it blather) that occurred in a womans college in the 1930's.In the other Wimsey ofter makes literary quotes, uses some Latin and French, but you normally don't have to translate it to decide what is happening in the novel.==Spoiler==Even in the last paragraph Ms. Sayers rather than having Harriet say a simple \\"I will\\" has her and Peter quoting from some 12th century play.If I had to describe this novel is a single word it would be: pretentious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant but flawed","review":"\\"Gaudy Night\\" is one of my two favorite Sayers books. \\"Nine Tailors\\" is the other.

Still, it was too easy to get the different dons mixed up.Lastly, this is my first Sayers novel, and I don't think the reading experience was particularly marred by a lack of familiarity with the previous books.

I loved the way the university was described though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaudy Night - Dorothy L Sayers","review":"My first reading of this author's work, though her main character, Lord Peter Wimsey, was known to me. Written in an academic style, this book was both light, entertaining and full of poetical references. Set in Oxford, during the 1930s, when women were only just beginning to gain some recognition in their chosen careers, it is an interesting look back to that time, and contains a wonderful set of characters, not forgetting a clever little plot and mystery which finally presents itself. For those with an academic flair, this book will appeal.Christine Taylor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book but poorly formatted for kindle","review":"This is one of my favorite Wimsey stories, but I am finding it almost impossible to read because the margins are so wide that the reading area on my kindle fire is barely two inches wide with inch wide margins on each side. Since the book is formatted fully justified I am often left with only two long words to a line with a big gap between them. For example, on one line is space for only the two words:wretched newspaperIt's a great story, but this poorly formatted kindle book makes it very difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"I finally broke the binding on my paperback copy of Gaudy Night last April... and just now (September) realized I could replace it on Kindle. Perfect!! The Peter Wimsey books are some of my favorites, and definitely stand up to re-reading. I like to go through them chronologically, just because the characters really do grow up along the way. The Lord Peter of Whose Body and Clouds of Witness is not at all the Lord Peter of Gaudy Night and Busman's Honeymoon. You can see how he got there... but he's a very different person by the end of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaudy Night by Dorothy L. Sayers","review":"The third of Dorothy Sayer's Harriet Vane/Lord Peter Wimsey novels, Gaudy Night takes Harriet back to her Oxford college in the 1930's to help the female dons discover the identity of a potential murderer who is plaguing them with poison pen letters and vandalism. Peter Wimsey soon enters the plot of this fine novel that is part mystery, part love story, full of high drama and wry humor, and that also offers insight into the social issues of the day. At the heart of the novel is Oxford University itself with its ancient colleges, swaying towers and, not least, its tradition of intellectual integrity. This unabridged audio edition is brilliantly read by Ian Carmichael who has frequently played the part of Wimsey on radio and TV. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the cost?!","review":"Definitely the best of the Wimsey novels. Sharp of whit with well developed characters. Harriet finally is forced to face herself and give in to the fact that Peter will always treat her as an equal and she loves him for it. I was so happy to see this available for Kindle. As I can still pick up paperback editions at half the price, it will be a long time before I add this one to my beloved Kindle. Really people, $12 for a book written over 75 years ago?!It's a well written, popular novel that would probably have been out in paperback form since Roosevelt was President!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diabetics Beware","review":"It's over thirty years since I read GAUDY NIGHT and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. I don't suppose I'll ever read them again. By the time she wrote them, Sayers had lost whatever she had to offer as a mystery writer. She was taking herself seriously. In Harriet Vane, Sayers produced perhaps the most nauseating wish fulfilment figure in the whole of crime fiction. She makes Jemima Shore look like something out of Dostoyevsky. Avoid like the plague unless you wish to gross out on snobbery and sentimentality. And the murder method in BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON is singularly unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dithering Mess","review":"If you have enjoyed other Peter Winsey mysteries, you will be disappointed. The \\"crime\\" is a poison pen writer at (Harriet's alma mater, as if she is not competent to investigate anything more serious)Manners and language of another age form an intrusive barrier to following the germ of plot through many vagaries - a most unsatisfying foray, yet testament to the waning influence of the English upper class system, despite the author's clear snobbery regarding lower class persons and tiresome pontificating about the 'role of women' . Having enjoyed other Sayers works, this one is a big null set."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rating refers to the availability, NOT the book!!!","review":"I adore this book, but I'm far from home and would pay a surprising amount of money to be able to read it right now. Why on earth is it not available to customers in the United States? Seems like a poor business choice on Amazon's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorothy Sayers at her best - glad Amazon had the book","review":"This is a great book. It's one of the top 100 books written in the 20th century according to 3 different sources. Dorothy Sayers is one of my favorite authors and this book was wonderful.

I didn't and had to keep going back to look things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the fuss - this is dull","review":"I must say there are MANY TD albums I would recommend over this one.

I would have given it five stars except that it seems to lose some creative steam as it progresses. I love the references to the old Buck Rogers serials that are inserted into some of the pieces. Still it is a good toe-tapping musical romp across time and space. If you are an Orb fan you certainly should have this one in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Then Came Love","review":"By conceiving a child via artificial insemination, hip, modern and thoroughly independent magazine writer Julie Davidson managed to trim the messy nuptial relationship strings so often attached to starting a family. Imagine her shock, then, when her now-six-year-old son, Jason, demonstrates his growing need for a paternal role model by misbehaving in school. Julie soon sets out on a quest to find the original sperm donor youngish, self-effacing actor Paul, hoping he will take some responsibility for Jason's awry behavior. Father and son do indeed forge a strong relationship; but in Julie's wildest imagination, she never expected to fall in love with this new acquaintance. A fair number of halfway decent scenes and an overall feeling of goodwill, \\"And Then Came Love\\" is simply too slick, too contrived and too insubstantial to rank as anything more than just a negligible romantic comedy. I enjoyed watching the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predicatble to a Fault","review":"Weak storyline, lackluster acting. I can not recommend this film, even if you do Like Vanessa Williams. This was not her best film. She's a much better actress than this films allowed.

Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're so special why aren't you dead?","review":"Ok, so this isn't LAST SPLASH, but WTF do you expect after being absent 9 years? You get a cool set of personal songs. TITLE TK is more reminiscent of POD than LAST SPLASH. It may not be as catchy as LAST SPLASH but you still have that Breeders kick to it. If you're a long time fan, GET THIS! And if you're just getting into the band, try POD first. All in all, I think this rocks! They're even better live!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely disappointing","review":"All of the Breeders work before this I LOVE LOVE LOVE. I think they're one of the best bands of the past twenty plus years and are responsible for some of the atristic highpoints of that time. That being said this album is completely devoid of anything interesting, amusing, appealing or of any value whatsoever. I nearly trashed it after I first listened to it, but tried again about six weeks later, then six months later, and now at about a year or so I gave it one last shot and still haven't enjoyed a second of it. It sounds like a mediocre garage band slugging through a ho-hum rehearsal. Probably the most disappointed I've ever been by a CD purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I was expecting much less after reading the reviews on this... I would describe this album as being modern, warm, personal, and very creative. There's a wierdness and abstractness to the arrangements that is very human and natural. In fact, the songs I like least on this album are the ones most like the old breeder's sound.I like this very much. I would be very excited if Kim Deal and the rest would continue in this direction. Give us something new to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this album","review":"As a fan of old I miss the perfect pop of The Breeders. I waited a long time for this album only be disappointed by the first listen. To begin with, the production quality of this album was miserable. I love lo-fi for the authentic feel it gives to music but this recording did not do justice. The music sounds thin and miserable. I am also dissapointed that there are some songs on Title TK that were recorded in 1999. I find it shocking that someone as talented at Kim Deal could only write 12 new songs in the space of 9 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually 1/12 stars","review":"As an \\"Old School\\" Pixies/Breeders/FB fan, I am terribly disappointed by Kim Deals latest effort, Title TK. The CD is filled with dull lullabies and annoying attempts at weirdness. With the exception of tracks 4 and 12, the CD stinks. Frank Black has proved to me that he is the truly what made the Pixies tick..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Hughes shame on you!","review":"If you liked Pod and you liked Last Splash then you will love this album. I agree, starting points for exploring The Breeders music wouldn't be Title TK, but if you have a taste for unpredictable catchy music you will end up buying Title TK.Sometimes I just don't know about amazon's editorial reviews. After all they did leave Modest Mouse's The Moon & Antarctica off their top 100 list for the year 2000, an injustice I will never forgive them for =). At times it would appear they cater to capitalistic America...If its different it can't be sold.This album definitely makes my top 100 for 2002, along with And You Will know us by the trail of Dead's Source Codes & Tags. Here's hoping there's more to add to my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the drugs wear off....","review":"The only two discs worth investing in are this groups first two, especially the accidentally brilliant Last Splash. After that, their releases became sheer bloated fuzz with rare guitar achievements, exploiting a slacker fanbase mistakenly equating laziness for edginess. There are perhaps a few tracks that mimic far superior outlines from LS, but the Deal's sloppy-as-witty playing and singing becomes off-putting in the face of such simple songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed... Sorry!","review":"I know there is a tendency for people to only review albums that they like, and I apologise if I offend any Breeders fan out there, but I didn't like this album at all.I am a Pixies fan and liked Pod and Last Splash. that's not to say I am a bitter Pixies fan blaming everything on Kim either.I just feel that this is an album that needed more work. It's like a rough draft that never got re-written but was published anyway.I think it's fair to say that if you are looking to buy your first Breeders album this is not the one to buy. I really was disappointed with this album.Perhaps I needed to play it a few times more but there's only so many times I can listen to an album before I say 'I really don't like it', and this is one of those times. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kim Deal, what's the deal?","review":"To say that I'm disappointed in \\"Title TK\\" is understatement. It's been 9 years since \\"Last Splash\\" and it's a fitting description of Breeder's history since this new release sinks straight to the bottom. The songs sound like they were improvised as the tape was running in the studio. What really annoys me is the fact that after such a long hiatus, Kim Deal had the audacity to rehash an Amps song (Full on Idle), which by the way, pales in comparison to the original. What's the matter Kim, suffering from a bit of writer's block these past 9 years? Luckily, \\"Huffer\\" is an outstanding track that gives me hope for the future (I just hope the wait isn't as long next time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"an achievment!

(and prolly don't care.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"lackluster","review":"This album has a few bright moments but on the whole it really comes up short. The Breeders have proven themselves of being able to produce top notch indie-rock. However, this record seems more like an attempt to just make a quick buck buy selling records to their dedicated fan base, selling out a few smaller venues and selling some t-shirts. We deserve more from these talented sisters.If you have always loved the Breeders, you might as well pick it up to complete your pixies/breeders collection, otherwise, go check out earlier material by them. You will be blown away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine years and this is it??","review":"What a disappointment this album is! Nine long years since their last album, and this is all we get? This sounds like a quickie album that was put together for contractual obligations, recorded in a basement while they were sitting on couches watching TV. It could be understandable if they had released another album just 6 months prior and wanted to break away from a bad contract. But this isn't the case here. This album is simply inexcusable. The vocals are drab, the music is plain, and the song writing is uninspired. If you want to hear some good Breeders music, I recommend the album Pacer from The Amps. That was Kim Deal's other group for 5 minutes, and was basically the follow-up album to Last Splash. It has far better material and sounds alive and vibrant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Breeders album. offers something other albums don't.","review":"If you have heard the Breeders before and not like them, maybe not thinking that they only give females a satisfaction you are wrong. the instruments in this album speak to eachother, especially the guitars in The She. the guiatrs talking to eachother are Space creature puppets talking, exploring the earth, philosophy of the earth blending. travelers of the earth. the sisters harmonies blend perfectly like no others. it works. little fury best representation of this. Off you amazing. wacthing sunset punch drunk in an unpretentious way, feeling the salt some out of your mouth, just washed up from the storm. this time the talking guitar is now more the background thoughts coming together of the memories that the lyrics unfield to whatever may pertain to you abstractly or directly. this song is completion and meant so much to me in certain times if was my onyl friend (I know that sounds cheasy) any suggestions. let me hear your music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great upgrade","review":"This was excatly what I needed for my wife's system which uses the older PATA HDD's.

I had to have more. This is the most compelling book about Jesus I have ever read. It actually takes you into reality of the life of Jesus and his teachings.This book is not a religious work so you gather who Jesus the man really was, how his life touched the people around him, and since I have always been curious about his life apart from the religious aspect it is a truly wonderful work.Again, Dolores Cannon has truly outdone herself. She is a pioneer. Her work is truly the best!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read Jesus and the Essenes prior to this.","review":"Reading these two books really made me realize that Jesus really wanted to have all of us work toward our own enlightenment and transend our physicality.

This is an unforgettable film that touches the heart and demostrates the power of love to heal. Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine are wonderful as the mon and dad who bravely struggle to raise their two adorable young daughters in their run-down tenement apartment in New York. There they meet a lonely, brooding and bitter artist from Africa, Mateo, who is dying of AIDS. Almost magically, Mateo changes theirs and his own life in unexpected ways. Although I feel that Sheridan sometimes tries a little too hard to tug at the heart strings, \\"In America\\" is a loving and touching film that truly moved me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"This is one of the few movies that I would repeatedly watch. It is so moving, the acting is so great, and the story is truly wonderful. If you haven't seen this, I envy you, and wish you would buy it and watch it so it would make you feel the way I did when I watched it. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie but get out the kleenex.","review":"In the old days this movie would have been called a \\"chick flick\\". Sheridan does a good job of showing familial relationships in the cultural melting pot of modern day NYC. The family consists of a husband and wife with two young daughters who are trying to make it in America as poor Irish emigrants. Throw in the fact that the family has just experienced the death of another child, a young brother. One of the daughters is the narrator of this movie and wise beyond her years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is America really like this?","review":"One of the best films of the year comes by way of an Irish immigrant family. They come to New York City to escape the memories of their youngest son Frankie's death. Johnny, the father and struggling actor, does his best to support his family, which includes his wife Sarah, (Samantha Morton), and two adorable girls. We learn throughout the film that Johnny has still not gotten over the death of his son, causing him to have trouble finding success doing just about anything. His girls, however, see everything in the world as magical, even the \\"crazed\\" African man who lives in the druggie-ridden tenement they are forced to live in. It is a wonderful film that is sure to bring some water to the eyes as you see the story unfold, and the power of hope acted out."},{"rating":"1","title":"in america","review":"The audio was poor and the quality of the DVD not good. The story line was interesting but not enjoyable to watch because of the poor quality of the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it as it comes","review":"I read in an interview that Jim Sheridan started off writing the father as the protagonist for this film but eventually gave up because it was too difficult and awkward to make himself the main focus (it's no secret this is autobiographical). So he phoned up his daughters, grown up, and asked for their recollections of the family's move to the States when they were children. This is the narrative he used in crafting his film, which may in part explain the fantastical nature of much of the plot. To those who want more gritty realism from the film -- look back to your own childhood memories and ask yourself if you actually remember everything factually the way it happened. Film is art. In this case it's dreamy, magnificent art, and remembering the way things felt is every bit as valuable as remembering the way things were."},{"rating":"2","title":"magical film","review":"This is a lovely film; happy and sad. \\"Do you believe in magic?\\" Magic becomes reality in this film as it equates to love, friendship, perserverance, and the optimism of young hearts. Sometimes magical miracles happen with the help of love from heaven and on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye Frankie","review":"An Irish family moves illegally to New York to escape the tragedy of losing Frankie, their only son. Once you know that the character of Frankie was based on, and dedicated to, the Director's late brother, it becomes all the more poignant. Christy and Ariel, the couples two remaining children, are sisters in real life, and treat each other with an amazing tenderness in the movie. The acting that the children do is incredible.This is a movie about carrying on despite being in the darkest place you've ever been in. These characters don't HAVE a choice, they must keep breathing, must find jobs, must comfort each other.I adored this movie. It was very sad, but so is life sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Coming all the way to America to trick or Treat\\"","review":"That one-liner came from the Screaming Afro-American who played the key role of Mateo.

I had hoped to see a film that is observant and critical. A film that shows the fears, hopes and challenges to immigrate to the US. Yet I found that the film that was full of cliches. It was predictable like most of the Hollywood movies. Evil looking black guy who ends up to be loving and wonderful when he meets the two cute girls.A poor family who can not afford health insurance in American, ends up having a third child who is born premature.

Sheridan has terrific talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stronger, more pwerful 2nd time viewed","review":"I fought this movie, the first time I watched it. Today, at a re-viewing, backed up by playing the director's commentary, I have come to support it 100%.Although commentaries are not always useful, Sheridan's is completely informal, personal, and authentic. Some of the quieter voices are hard to catch from surrounding noise, which is a shame. The performance of the young actor Emma Bolger is enough to make adults sit up straight and re-think; her script is Sheridan's, but her assumption of the role, done bravely, is all her own. Paddy Considine is such a charmer, but this story squeezes him until the pips squeak, and a person behind the charm can emerge. Samantha Morton too is excellent. Altogether a rewarding movie. Then just now I read, above, the fatuous one-line dismissal by the almighty \\"Observer\\" critic who tossed the whole thing out of the window. Well, good luck to him and his sad career. I recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disagree with any review under 3 stars","review":"This movie was great. The acting was great, the ideas were great. I have some very specific bones to pick with other reviews.1. Yes, I do believe a 10 yr old would say something like \\"I've been carrying this family on my back for over a year.\\" If you've never known a precocious 10 yr old who repeats what they've heard adults say then I feel sorry for you.2. Living in poverty is not \\"bad parenting.\\" You are basically saying every poor family has negligent parents. That's a horrible prejudice. Not everyone can be well off and raised as such.3. Unless you lived in New York in the 80's you don't really understand all the things in the movie, the good or the bad.Yes I agree the little girl's camera is way off. Yes, they bring up Frankie at odd times, but it still makes for a very entertaining, heartfelt movie. I recommend it to anyone not looking for a Hollywood Blockbuster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming true story","review":"Excellent visual story telling.

And that is something that has not happened to me in almost 20 years! I wear them all the time, and just take them off to hand wash them, and put them back on when they are dry.

Unfortunately, after that it became repetitive and formulaic: travel to a new town/planet, encounter bad guys, beat bad guys, rinse, repeat. It felt as though Dietz was trying to rewrite Jack Vance'sBig PlanetorTales of the Dying Earth, but instead of fresh and strange, each new location was merely a variation on a theme. In the end, the book came across as a personal inner journey for the author which didn't translate well to novel form.

I'm sure many authors make such errors, but ordinarily they are caught in editing. Not this time, they weren't. Dietz is in love with sentence fragments. One or two of those might be artistically meaningful, but there are closer to a hundred of them in the book. Twice he uses the word \\"perspective\\" when he means \\"prospective\\".

There is no name for the orchestra that played the Bolero, you are not sure whether Ravel was the conductor to this anonymous orchestra or he was just a cymbals player sitting in the back of orchestra. For the solo piano pieces, it didn't say it was from live recordings or piano rolls. All the accompanying pamphlet said is just a brief generic biography of Ravel. Only two out of the seven works mentioned are actually on the CD.The copyright of this recording is \\"1995 Delta Music\\", Delta Music is a seldem heard name.

I cannot fairly pick highlights, as all songs are outstanding. However, if I were to be biased, I would have to say the title track is the best song the band has ever recorded.

Its commentary is thought provoking and concise. I would say, however, that this version is not for the casual reader of the Bible. A grasp of basic theology is needed to get into the commentary. As with most Study Bibles, I understand that the remarks are someone else's opinion. I purchased this Bible specifically for an Education for Ministry course I'm starting.If someone is looking for an easier to understand Bible, \\"The Message\\" should be more to your liking.

That was over 30 years ago. Although I've had a lot of other study Bibles in various translations since then, this edition is what I now use. The notes reflect reliable, mainstream, scholarship. Without being overtly exclusive, they also tend to provide a more overtly traditional Christian perspective than the successor editions with the NRSV text. As someone else wrote, at times they even have a devotional quality. While its certainly more profitable for publishers to continually push out new editions, the question always arises as to whether they really add that much more value. As for the translation, given that it's only slightly older than I am, the RSV has held up remarkably well as both an accurate and readable version. It's no wonder major churches that have been around for more than a millennium continue to stick with it rather than \\"upgrade\\" to another every few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very worthy study Bible","review":"This is probably, at least at the time of this writing, the most useful study Bible. This copy of Holy Scripture contains all the books generally found in the Septuagint (LXX) Old Testament. This translation respects the traditional language, and usage of language, that is sadly lost with the earnest attempts of the NRSV to be \\"gender inclusive\\", but creates confusion rather than inclusiveness. The RSV is written with the scholar and student in mind, not the agenda (sincere as it is) that actually detracts from the later NRSV. The notes are useful, the language, while not the masterpiece of the English language that is the King James, is still reverential and appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presents a liberal perspective on the Bible","review":"The Bible commentaries included here are written from a generally liberal theological perspective. The authors discount traditional teachings regarding how the Bible originated and was preserved in favor of more modern theories, which include late dating of the books and questionable authorship. This tends to undermine the authority and credibility of the Bible.If you wish to explore liberal Christian theology, you may appreciate this study Bible. Otherwise, I would recommend you purchase the NIV Study Bible or the NKJV Study Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Oxford Annotated Bible Still Tops","review":"As a former seminarian and a very novice koine Greek translator, I prefer the Revised Standard Version as the closest to my Greek text and thus start with a sound base.

I have two previous versions of this bible that are extremely worn. I was glad to see it available again."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Oxford Annotated Bible/RSV","review":"This edition of the New Oxford Annotated Bible/RSV represents a more conservative/moderate perspective to questions of authorship/dating of the individual biblical books and in the study notes. (I own the 3rd augmented edition in NRSV as well, and while the notes & introductions are much more extensive, it is notably less conservative). The genuine leather edition is beautifully bound. An ecumenical evangelical by conviction, I favor the RSV as a superior translation in most respects to the NRSV, especially in the often awkward and excessively inclusive renderings of the NRSV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kasai River God Mask","review":"Absolutely beautiful mask and a special note was attached from the artist.

I opened a 2nd package, same thing and I can't understand why. I didn't shake it, I didn't over-tighten the ordage horn, but they only work sporadically and were a HUGE waste of money.

Thankfully, \\"Canonball\\" is not the only piece of perfect loud pop music on this record. Maybe it has to do with the fact that i remember when i got it, 6 or so years ago, and all of the things that were going on at that time. Sentimental value aside, \\"Last Splash\\" borrows from MBV-esque soundscapes, 60's Garage pop anthems, and Sonic Youth quirky noisiness. Although being a pixies fan is in no way a prerequisite to loving the breeders, it makes them extra special for me. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite \\"90's\\" album...","review":"After much debate, this one gets the crown. In the early-mid 90's there were tons of crap alt/pop bands out there to choose from. The sad thing is, The Breeders often get mixed into that sort of artsy fartsy chick rock thing, and they are anything but that.From beginning to end, this cd rocks. There are a few quick to the punch power jams, and a few you will recognize, (ie: Cannonball) but the best thing about this cd are the unknown songs like \\"I Just Wanna Get Along,\\" \\"Divine Hammer,\\" and\\"Driving on 9,\\" the last of which is a cajun-style country rock ballad that will blow your mind.In short, I don't recommend this cd to just anyone...but if you want to remember that aspect the 90's, Last Splash will take you back there in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shh! Grrl Power!","review":"Some groups, like the Breeders, don't need to yell out \\"Girl Power!\\" in order to assert it. Their hard, catchy guitar-pop is strong and confident, matching Kim Deal's vocals, which range from playful to smuggled-in-from-Eastern-Europe obscure. She sings \\"I am the sun, I am the New Year, I am the way home\\" as though she believes it, yet doesn't know any better than we do what it means. The unstoppable 4/4 makes this one of the best driving albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the yardstick of the Pixies haunts it","review":"I guess I'm not the popular guy at the coffee house here, but the Breeders and Frank Black on his own don't rock as hard as the Pixies used to. Maybe if Frank had given Kim Deal more singing parts this could have all been avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very listenable today","review":"Back in the day, this was very popular. Not many people are driving around with this in their cd player today. It sounds dated.However, \\"Cannonball\\" is a classic. This band just happened to stumble on a genuine, \\"Louie, Louie\\" type of song.\\"No Aloha\\" is interesting (sounds very Pixie ish), \\"Divine Hammer\\" is decent and \\"Driving on 9\\" is a cool, trucker vibe of a song.The rest of this is pretty unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alternative Rock","review":"This is the best CD by The Breeders in my humble opinion, and it probably was their most commercially successful. I bought it because of the song \\"Cannonball\\"~ Kim Deal and Co. really hit it with that tune! The driving, often loopy,ethereal bass lines by Kim are riveting. I appreciate every track on this CD, which is rare for me, but I remain absolutely mesmerized by early 90's alternative rock~ and the fact that Kurt Cobain supported this band doesn't hurt! Fun, driving, interesting music~ highly recommended by this fan, and for anyone who appreciates indie rock, and The Pixies."},{"rating":"2","title":"tracks I like","review":"Recommended singles to buy:New YearCannonballDivine HammerHagSaintsSolid songs:Invisible ManFlipsideDriving on 9And I like SOS even though it's clearly a filler song."},{"rating":"2","title":"best Breeders album to own","review":"If you want one album that captures what the Breeders were, this is it.

A lot of the songs on this album define \\"alternative\\". Many sound like song fragments rather than complete works; others are simply too uncommercial to appeal to the mainstream. Still, the album works its spell, and the more tuneful selections draw you in again and again so that eventually you come to appreciate the less accessible tracks. Kim Deal has a cutesy voice on many songs, but the band's fuzz guitar is a perfect counterpoint to this. Only the song \\"Divine Hammer\\" seems to be full cutesy, folkie overload. Still, it's wonderful.The band had many many problems after this album, and so \\"Last Splash\\" is pretty much the only studio document of this, the best lineup of the Breeders.Like the Pretenders, the Breeders will go down in history with the question \\"What the Heck Happened?\\" following them, but this album is excellent and worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still soaked","review":"4 1/2This is one of those lo-fi 90's gems where nearly every sonically-indie indulgence works to the band's favor, creating one of those masterpiece-by-accident recordings crammed with utterly compelling, eclectic alternative pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything about this album is good","review":"You know an album is good when you sing along with every single note, including the baselines and the drums and the guitars, and the background noises...no bye, no...a-lo-ha ba-ow no-ow wh-ow-wow-wow -weee-oww"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning. Life-changing.","review":"I never heard the Pixie's beyond \\"Where Is My Mind\\" and I don't care about \\"Cannonball\\" much. I bought this tape for a buck at a used record store in Campbell, California, and I can't really tell you when this album first hit me. The incredible genius of it. The beauty of the songs. The astounding progression of slow songs interspersed with fast ones. This album makes total sense. It expresses things I have felt but never said. Kim Deal is a fellow Ohioan and I can feel that. Only someone from Ohio could make this brilliant album. I would place it on the level of Belly's \\"Star\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" in terms of an album you can listen to the whole way through. What I really want to say, is that this is an incredibly rocking album, but it rocks in a way I cannot explain. The tone of the guitars is the rich and deep, the drums and bass are intense. But there's such a diversity in the songwriting. Hmmm. It's just astounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"dries soft, gummy, chewy","review":"Dries soft, gummy, chewy - not at all like any laquer I've used!!I was expecting acrylic laquer, this stuff is chalky, reminds meof interior house paint.

It is the same show only on a different stage. Michael Flatley and the others are like big, fat pigs. They hardly move, with heavy breathing etc. I have all Flatley's and Riverdance's records and considered myself a big fan of them, but now - Thanks! Riverdance is great, Flatley sucks! Do not buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake of Lord of the Dance","review":"There's one critical piece of information missing on this video's description -- this is a remake (a very bad one at that) of Lord of the Dance. I thought Flatley had produced a brand new show; little did I know. Having watched Lord of the Dance just a few months ago, the basic story line and choreography was still fresh in my mind. As soon as the first dancers came out on the stage I knew it looked familiar. Yes, the costumes are new (I didn't say better), the set is bigger (I didn't say better again), the music has been reworked, and the crowds are larger, but it is still basically Lord of the Dance. What happened? He had a good thing going and had to ruin it. I agree with others that this reminds me of a Las Vegas review, not a program highlighting traditional Irish dancing. Flatley's a good dancer, but has an ego that exceeds his talent. My recommendaton: Don't waste your money. See River Dance, see Lord of the Dance, and stop there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally, I don't care for it.","review":"As a competitive Irish dancer, I just can't get into this show. Michael Flatley, although he has brought some degree of awareness to Irish dancing (not without the help of others, however), has at the same time turned this wonderful art form into a slick, Las Vegas-type revue. The costumes (or lack thereof), the hairdos, new arm movements - it all makes for an interesting expedition into what Irish dancing could, but hopefully will not, become, but personally, I don't care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flatley shows his age","review":"Although the overall show is quite good it is obvious to those of us familiar with the original LOTD video that Michael has slowed down considerably over the last two years. If you study the two videos closely notice how more sure-footed he is in LOTD. In Feet of Flames there are times that he looks unsteady on his feet and can actually be seen taking rests while the other dancers are pounding away. It looks to me that he has put on a few pounds and his heart may not be in dancing anymore. The remaining dancers are as good or better as they were in the original video and the new numbers and restructuring of the old numbers are a noticeable improvement so the video is definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I've seen Riverdance, Lord of the Dance (many times) and now Feet of Flames, and all I can say is - It's AMAZING...and will be watching as often as I can...WTG Michael Flatley and the LOTD dancers!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"After seeing a live production of Riverdance, I bought videos of both Riverdance (at Madison Square Garden) and Feet of Flames.

In terms of the videos, I like Feet of Flames better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Bought this for my dad for Christmas since he loved Riverdance, Lord of the Dance. I was disappointed, it was very much like Lord of the Dance and the spirit of the Irish dance that was there for Riverdance was not there for me. Very showy. Michael Flatley had to have it be the biggest outdoor event EVER and in Hyde Park no less. So for me the focus seemed to be on how outrageously huge it could be with the set and the number of dancers. Most of the numbers we had seen before, some new ones added including the finale by Michael which frankly didn't wow me. Overall, felt like I had already seen it. Also did not appreciate the sexuality that has been added. The talented dancers carry the show, not the sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I would hope","review":"Ok, so I got this video, it was not at all like I had hoped. It was not in anyway IRISH dance. It might have been some kind dancing, but I can never call it Irish dance. Michael Flatly is making Irish dance way to Amercain and modern. If I wanted to buy some kind of Amercain dancing, thats what I would buy. If you are going to buy a Irish step dance movie, I highly suggest Riverdance: the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could do with a little less DRAMA","review":"I was very disapointed with this video... When I saw Riverdance I could not take my eyes off the TV....it was captivating. When viewing Feet of Flames I found myself forwarding the tape to get past the ridiculous drama that they seem to feel is necessary.... I found the eruptions of applause whenever FLatley appeared to be excessive... I wish they would stick to dancing w/minimal story plots that seem to be written to stroke Flatley's ego. Alot like watching the old silent movies with their exaggerated gestures. I never even finished the tape... I put it in with the other discards that goodwill is picking up this week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feet of Ashes!","review":"Hang it up Michael- you're not the best dancer that ever existed (as you proclaimed yourself).

I realize that Michael requires his women to look sexy, but these outfits are pretty hideous. They are not even becoming (in my opinion).

I think that's what bothers me the most... call it a Vegas show and I wouldn't have such a problem with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feet of Flames","review":"This was Michael Flatley's masterpiece. The man was told as a child he was too old to learn Irish step dancing. He fooled them. He had a dream and went on to win the Irish National Dance Championship. The program is well choreographed. The staging is beautiful. The plot is clever and the dancers are very talented. I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in any kind of percussive dance. Michael Flatley got his start in Video in a film called Riverdance. It also is a lovely DVD as are any of Flatley's dance video's. Yes, I'm a fan. I'm a flamenco dancer myself and enjoyed very much watching Maria Pages in Riverdance do a flamenco number. She has very beautiful arm and upper body movements. She is known as \\"Maria of the Endless Arms.\\" She is a very accomplished Flamenco dancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Another amazing event done by Michael Flatley.

Now imagine the same except with twice as many dancers on stage! And with more high-tech equipment. Fancier costumes. There are some extra scenes and some that changed since the Lord of the Dance but the story is basically the same. The quality of the dvd seems to be better too.And yet, if you ask me, I liked the original Lord of the Dance better. Flatley seems to care about all the sparkling and 3-level-stage and whatnot more than being on stage and dancing. He just seemed to enjoy himself more in Lord of the Dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most incredible thing I have EVER seen!","review":"Wow! Words cannot describe just how good FEET OF FLAMES is! Basically its a rehash of his LOTD show with added bells, whistles and more besides! Fantastic! Stunning! Again! Again! More!!!!

Wow! What a video! Buy it! NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet!","review":"If you thought Lord of the Dance couldn't be topped, you are in for a wonderful surprise. Michael Flatley and his troupe have outdone themselves. The entire production, from concept to execution, is superb. The only thing wrong with this video is that there isn't enough of it, or of Michael. But there never is! This historic performance may never be surpassed. The electricity generated by the audience and by Michael's obvious love for his production reaches out and grabs you. Michael - forever dancing in our hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"he needed to retire.","review":"Flatley looks tired and well past his prime in this version of LOTD. All the intrusive editing cannot hide the fact that he never once looks like the best dancer on the stage. His steps are sloppy, mushy, and flat-footed...when he's even dancing at all. Mostly he just hams it up in front while a stagefull of talented young dancers do what he just can't seem to manage anymore. He does play the flute in a couple of numbers, and he's not bad at all...but did you really buy this video to see him play the flute? The \\"Feet of Flames\\" solo near the end is just not worth the wait. It's just a few flurries of tapping in between \\"aw shucks\\" nods at the audience, and in it he does moves that were done far better by Maria Pages and Colin Dunne in the second Riverdance video. Flatley was great in the first LOTD, but I think you'll be disappointed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the, oh I mean Feet of Flames.","review":"This should be titled Lord of the Dance not feet of flames. The two shows are almost identical. If youv'e seen Lord of the dance then you have seen Feet Of Flames. There are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff. My biggest gripe is that Flatley seems way to full of himself in this one! I mean he is so in love with himself its anoying! I truely enjoyed his dancing in the original Riverdance filmed in Ireland, but id say after watching Feet of Flames he deserved getting bagged on by Mike Meyers!!! The sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show, and it reminds me more of Vegas show than anything else. Can someone please knock some sense into Flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door. That way I can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feet of Flames - not so much","review":"I have enjoyed all of Mr. Flatley's previous works but this one was just to boring to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feet of Flames goes down in Flames","review":"Did anyone else notice that he seemed to kiss and flirt more then he danced? Get a room already! Doesn't he have any other time to do that! Oh and also how come michael flathead gets all the money when he just waves his hands around tapes twice and then he goes kiss some one, those other people tap 100% more then him, so he should get way less money then them. The only reason i'm giving it two stars is because of the bad guys, kick ....!! I also think that the costumes for the bad guys were better and that is about it.

The new costumes and numbers were a wonderful addition. The encore was magnificent and energizing! Anyone who mounted this show, and the others, would never have been able to make them without great confidence in himself, which some attribute to an inflated ego.

It is simple. When her lips are not moving. In her first book, written in 1949, she tells of the time she met the Captain and the children for the first time. She describes a scene that is very similar to the scene in the play and in the movie. She even mentions that the Captain used a whistle to call the children.In this book, she states that the Captain was not at home when she arrived, and that Baroness Matilda introduced the children to her.Hoping that no one will notice her contradictory lies, she blames the producers of the play for (falsely) portraying her husband as a stern disciplinarian. Well, give me a break. It was her 1949 book, telling of the whistle, that gave them the idea. There is also a chapter in the 1949 book about \\"the baron doesn't want it.\\"So, she invents the story, and then blames us for believing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need","review":"I was going in circles for about 2 weeks comparing MP3 Players because I run and am so tired of burning CD's and holding the CD Player so it won't skip while running.

Cutting edge stuff, more accessible than other theorists.

Have things changed? We can hope so. For now this is a good read but the essays could be more carefully organized. Frankly it feels like the essays were collected first then the table of contents fitted around them leaving some a bit odd feeling. The quality of the essay varies with the author frankly. The best and most wide reaching essay is the very first: Greta Christina's look at the power of words.

He will be the \\"love interest\\" of Jesse Archer's character. So, truth be told, I was not expecting for it to be so nice, it was more a research work I was doing.And instead, Showboy is a very nice movie. At the beginning, Christian Taylor was so good, that I was almost believing that it was his real story I was looking at. He is a mix of innocence and reality, has a way to pass you his feelings without word.Adrian Armas' character is again, the dream date, he has two/three scenes, but everytime he is on the screen, he shines. He has not actually a nice character, he is selfish and uncaring, he doesn't realize Christian's feelings, but well, this is what most \\"dream date\\" are, unreachable, isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just unfunny enough to be believed","review":"With a brilliant comic premise that sounds like an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, this film fails to deliver laughs at any juncture.

That is missing here. What we get is a sniveling, unfunny little weasel, who is painful to watch, unlike Larry David or his Seinfeld ego, George Costanza. There is no character development here at all. The script meanders and just leaves one with the purposelessness of this production.To see a truly funny mocumentary, rent any of the Guest films, Guffman, Best in Show or Mighty Wind, for a funny and amusing gay oriented film, try Mambo Itialino.

This is largely because many kanji that are frequently-used don't often occur at the beginning of a compound.

This is the only dictionary to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful, but not portable","review":"I checked this book out of my local library, and kept renewing it until I couldn't renew it anymore. understanding how to look the kanji up is a little confusing at first, since the method is completly different from english dictionaries. instead of looking up kanji phonetically, you look the characters up by the base strokes used to create them. I have to admit, the first thing i started to translate was not from a textbook. it was a doujinshi, or japanese fan comic. i was able to find almost all of the kanji i looked for. it is a very comprehensive list of all the kanji you're likely to encounter. i highly recommend it to help you in translations and so forth. a drawback to this book is its size though. it's gargantuan. unless you have a very strong back or are slightly masochistic this is a reference book for home use only. it is also time consuming to search through all the entries to find the kanji you need to know. despite that, this is still a great kanji dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berlin Diary","review":"It is always insightful to read the impressions of those who were on scene during this time.

I wanted to judge the work for myself. I am sure that Mr. Shirer has embellished his deeds in the reworking, and some of it comes off like allied propaganda of the day. I think you can learn a great deal from actual accounts of what people thought and felt at the time. He makes some unflattering generalizations about the German people as a whole but he lived the frustration the time. I think that holding this book up as a book to be taught in history class is a mistake. Everyone has a window on the World and Mr. Shirer is letting us know what he saw from his. He does point out some British newscast that did not jive with what he saw. I enjoyed the book and would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should read this one.

In this book he describes the background and the little known detail about Hitler and those others involved in trying to conquer the world. He was a reporter in Germany for the US press and relates the frighteningly near defeat of the Western countries by Germany and their allies..It is a long book, but fully worth the time and effort to read and see how history really happened. It is a discussion by a famous reporter, during my younger years, just before the US and Briton fought Germany..

It is written by an honest, intelligent American who lived through Hitler and Germany's rise to World War II, literally sitting next to Hitler! Anyone who has never read it simply cannot understand why so many people in the world died opposing this nice little tramp (much like Charlie Chaplin!) from Austria, who took over Germany, and did not let go of it until Germany was all but blotted out.The only serious related details left out are the horrors of that war itself, and how other honest intelligent Americans supported the Marshal Plan, which was a major factor in resuscitating Germany....and Europe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different view of WWII","review":"A fasinating perspective of the how and why of WWII.

The book is not fascinating and lacks the personal warmth that one might expect from a journal, but I enjoyed the insider's view into German fanaticism in contrast to the near inept behaviors of American and the European nations in general. I would recommend it to a student of the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berlin Diary by William L. Shirer","review":"A well-written contemporaneous account of a correspondent's life in Nazi Germany up to 1940. Shirer is almost prescient in his assessment of Hitler's actions and their consequences. It is unfortunate that he could not continue his reporting after 1940, because an account of this caliber of the years when Germany was at war with America, made from inside Germany, would have been a valuable historical record. Shirer is a true journalist; while he offers opinions, they are clearly labeled as such, and do not get in the way of dispassionate reporting of the events he witnesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Fascinating view of Germany's rush to war from one who lived through and reported on it.

Beyond the battles, I wondered how a sane country could allow clowns and maniacs take over with an obvious agenda of hate. I also wondered how other countries were so afraid of war that they allowed Nazi Germany to thrive to a point where war was inevitable. This book doesn't answer everything, but it gives you a reporter's personal view on the ground as Hitler took over. You see how radio news reporting grew and covered these events through technological challenges and censorship. You need to know your pre-war history and not get frustrated by the lack of historical explanation, but it is worth the insights gained on how fragile the regime was if somebody had taken a strong stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye witness to History of WWII in Europe","review":"I remembered this book from my Father's Library and read it as a boy.

Its greatest virtue is that it makes Eragon look like Pulizer material. The writing can only be described as terrible. I've taught high school fiction writing and frankly, my students' products were less clunky, repetitive and difficult to track than this.

Surely there are better writers out there who can continue the legacy of Pern...anyone!? I am saddened to see how Todd McCaffrey is desecrating the world of Pern one book at a time.

It was so bad, I actually didn't finish it. At some point about half way through I could see where the whole plot was going, I felt no connection to any of the characters that managed to live more than 10 pages, and I was sick of the plot re-runs. Come on, is there anyone on Pern who has been able to speak to all dragons that hasn't lost their own? Lorana is an irritatingly naive character that I could see was going to kill her own dragon through stupidity. I just didn't want to have to read about it. It seemed that any character that had depth was soon to die and only the insipid or barely drawn ones were left. As others have said, there are way too many superflous characters named for no reason. The plot is a re-run of several previous dragon books. Mainly, there is no one to identify with and to like, not dragon or human.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonsblood","review":"All the dragons were saved by one word brought forward in time from nine turns to four hundred turns by the creator of aberrations.

I enjoyed this book very much having been a loyal Pern resident since the very beginning. The only problem I had with Todd's book is his tendency to over describe the scientific portions of the plot. A little less detail would have made for a tighter story. Altogether a delightful book and I am looking forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as his mother","review":"This book was pretty good; I am sure that Todd knows a lot about Pern, as his mother wrote the series. However, there were multiple characters, and many of these were barely developed. The incredibly lengthy details of the bioengineering processes were boring, and while I usually read books and never skim, I found myself skimming most of these passages. I don't know if his mother will write any more books for this series, but her son is a good substitute. I recommend this book to all those who love Pern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pern is dying and Todd is killing it","review":"I love the Pern books. Anne writes characters you care about. I have cried more than once at the death of one of them. Todd writes shallow boring characters impossible to be the least bit interested in. His plots are unintersting. I will never buy a book he has written again. I might keep reading to see if he improves, but i'll get them at the library. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I started reading Anne McCaffery when I was 12 when I picked up The White Dragon, and fell in love. I've read and re-read the series and have never lost my enjoyment or love for what she's created. When I heard that her son had continued the series I decided to give it a go and picked up Dragonsblood. The main character is a classic Mary Sue. She has no faults, amazing powers, and what not. The deaths of the dragons are treated in an offhand manner. It bends the rules and plot lines made by Anne McCaffery, it's poorly written in my opinion with the same phrases used and reused constantly. I actually couldn't finish it, and trust me I've read a LOT of horrible things before, but I couldn't. If you love Anne McCaffery's series, then read it and reread it. Don't pick these books up, they're not only a waste of money it genuinely makes me wince when compared to his mother's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"After a lifetime of picking up every Pern book I could find, I've finally reached the end. I started with DragonSinger when I was 9 years old, and even into the later books (which were somewhat irritating for me) I still was an avid reader.Todd McCaffrey has cured me of this. His books are inconsistent, boring, and have little bearing on the Pern I grew up with. If he cannot be bothered to read his mother's books, he shouldn't sit down to write in her universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is SERIOUSLY flawed.","review":"This book is SERIOUSLY flawed. Anne would have done better to have found an accomplished writer who was familiar with her world to continue the series. It is apparent that Todd had no practical experience writing fiction and it does not seem he is well versed in his mother's work.The book is rampant with inconsistencies, logic errors, and science flaws and in several points appears to contradict what his mother wrote back in the 70's and 80's. It is rough to read, switching scenes seemingly at random, with some of those scenes appearing to be completely pointless. There are plot elements that are abandon, never to be brought back up again. The use of \\"Timing\\" to solve dilemmas borders on \`Deus Ex Machina' and is repetitious of earlier books in the series.I would recommend that the older fans of Pern, the fans who grew up reading the series, avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, no likeable characters!","review":"I am so fond of a great many characters in the Pern books, but somehow, by page 120 in this book, I still had not warmed to anyone. No one seemed real. No one came alive. I just gave up on the book.It's such a contrast to Dragonseye, which I first read about the same time. THAT was one of the best of the Pern books. It may be that Todd cares more about plot and details of Pern and less about characters. I'll definitely flip through any further book by him before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pern Gone Bad","review":"This book was a disaster. Todd McCaffrey should not be allowed to play in his mother's world, because it's really quite sad what he's doing to it. Even putting aside the various canon violations that he gleefully writes into existence (Don't even get me started on the whers...I almost cried), he's just not a very good writer. His characters aren't very empathetic or realistic, and it's difficult to get immersed into the world. He jumps around like crazy between characters and the plot (such as it is) is very stale and stolen from various incarnations of previous books in the series.I am 100% sure that if his mother wasn't the writer who created this wonderful world, he would have never been published. This book and all the other Pern books by Todd are nepotism at its worst. I thoroughly enjoyed all of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books, but as far as I am concerned the series died as soon the moment her son attempted to take it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series is in good hands!","review":"Though I was at first apprehensive about another author taking over my favorite series, but having read this, I can simply say... Keep them coming Todd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good Book in Pern series","review":"After reading Dragonskin, I was worried how the new book, written entirely by Todd McCaffrey, would read. Dragonskin was a disappointing book, in my opinion the weakest in the Pern series. I attributed this to the input of Todd McCaffrey, since he was the new writer in the series. However I was pleasantly surprised by Dragonsblood. There are a few mistakes (or perhaps Todd McCaffrey simply wants to go in some different directions, so had to make a few changes to the history of dragons and watch whers). This was a very enjoyable read, with a good plot, which went back and forth between times very well. I look forward to his future books in the Pern universe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Living off his mother","review":"This was the most disappointing piece of fiction and really belittles what Anne McCaffrey created with her original series of books. After the Dragonrider and Harper series the only good book Ms. McCaffrey produced was Moreta. I've periodically read her other books and felt let down.

Hardly!Never again will I purchase one of the allegedly approved by Anne McCaffrey books."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing!!!","review":"I LOVE the Pern series, but this book was a big disappointment!Written by the son,and extremely depressing.

I'm not a huge fan of duets but \\"When Your Falling\\" is one of the best duets I've ever heard. Most music in recent years has sounded boring to me, but this song is, I would go far enough to say, better than alot of music from the 1980s.

Both Peter Gabriel and Afro Celt should be ashamed for putting out a piece of drek like this.My fault for not researching it more, it was a late night internet purchase and I must have been tired.

Yes, it's low-key, less on gadgets and more on world- and character-building, but I could not put it down. One of those books I looked forward to returning to again and again. The first half was more a coming-of-age tale, surreal in places, reminiscent of the early Dark Tower books by King. In the second half, everything comes together in a sort of pre-ordained destiny for the main character. The characters themselves were well-drawn, never stale, always interesting, and the many worlds and settings fascinating. The ending, I felt, was very satsifying. Russo's style is steady, and consistently good, reminding me very much of the writing of Ben Bova, another favorite of mine.

The orchestra and chorus do a capable job, so I can't fully fault them even if this isn't the most exciting account of this work. The \\"live\\" recording is also reasonable enough.

If parents are crying, a 5-year-old does not need to be burdened with this. In the book, the parents stayed at school, crying and watching, while the kids did about a dozen activities! That is totally not realistic. In fact, the crying parents (and the children setting THEM at ease with a final goodbye and hug and wave) seemed to occupy the bulk of the book, instead of focusing on how the child is getting bigger, and going to like school, etc., etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute","review":"I enjoyed reading this to my child.

That's how it seemed to me, at least.Instead of describing kindergarten as a fun, happy, loving place, it talks about how children are at first afraid, but then learn to like it. Why even suggest that your child should be afraid?Worse, in the book, all the parents stay in the classroom, outside the door watching. That's not how school works. The parents are not there, so why suggest that they are going to be at the door looking in during the day?Not recommended.

I heard this is a superior novel and much more profound so I decided to give it a whirl.Basically I couldn't stand it. I admit his writing is great, but I just can't get into this. Maybe it's the subject matter which is kind of strange, or maybe it's just personal taste, I don't know for sure. I am a great fan of literature of all kinds, but the period of writing from 1910-1925 I don't seem to enjoy.

H. Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers\\" should have been titled \\"Mother and Sons\\", since it is an unflinching, at times harsh, look at a mother's relationship with her two sons, especially with the younger son, Paul Morel, who suffers from an Oedipus complex with his mother. Mrs. Morel is portrayed by Lawrence as someone who tries to steer the lives of her sons, especially Paul, intervening in his choice of lovers and careers. Although her motives may be noble, her actions have unforseen consequences which affect adversely Paul's life. Lawrence's novel is said to be semiautobiographical, since the Morels are seen as fictitious counterparts of his own family. It surely is a literary classic, since it was the first to look at a dysfunctional family's affairs prior to the advent of Freud's psychological writings. It also remains memorable due to Lawrence's splendid, often lyrical, prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gutless, Dull and Pretentious Novel","review":"D.H Lawrence has obviously, with this book, created some kind of magical formula: rambling, wittering prose with no real direction can suddenly be accepted as an important novel. Why is this book taught in schools? It's style favours that of the long-winded, ill-thought-out mood-building, yet where Lawrence fails is in his descriptions of the characters within the book. They actually have very little depth. It has been said that this book is autobiographical. This suggests to me that Lawrence knows his characters so well, he expects the reader to simply know the characters, beyond the description of them as \\"happy\\" or \\"sad\\".It occurs to me that Lawrence simply spewed his thoughts out on to the page when writing this book, and what dull thoughts they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great study of human emotions","review":"This is a perfect book for anyone who enjoys reading twentieth century British literature. I like the fact that D. H. Lawrence is able to realistically portray the emotions of the many characters in the book. I did not only learn Paul's side of the story, but I also gained insight into Gertrude's, Miriam's, and Clara's thoughts and feelings towards Paul and towards each other. This omniscient narration makes the story a more interesting study into human emotions. Lawrence deals very heavily with psychological motivations for each character's actions, making the characters more human and believable. This is a great story that goes far beneath the surface. Sons and Lovers is a thought-provoking tale of love, death, possession, vulnerability, and heartache. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Smutty as I Expected","review":"The man is an absolute master at relationships. I have not read any other writer that has his patience and skill at building complex, realistic relationships through the accumulation of minute detail. While the characters and plot are only adequate, the relationships between the characters, and the poetic prose, drove the novel and managed to keep me engaged the whole way through. I was surprised that this novel, at least, showed no indication of the smuttiness of which Lawrence has often been accused. Overall, a good introduction to a literary author who will get another look later."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatifying","review":"I read this book for my English class and I found it to be ultimately unsatifying. I think Lawrence's prose is incredible but I just could not empathize with Paul Morel - he''s so childish and weak. Paul is only charming during his love scenes with Clara when he affects the Welsh accent of Walter Morel. I thought Gertrude Morel was a despicable woman who treated her husband with undeserved contempt and emotionally suffocated her sons. In the book, Gertrude's death leaves Paul in a world of darkness, he's a broken man. However, it's interesting to note that as much as D.H.Lawrence (the book is semi-autobiographical) came to view his mother as a negative influence in his mature years. As an adult, it is D.H. Lawrence's father who is personified as Walter Morel, for whom he exhibited admiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taboo Love or Incest?","review":"Reading this book makes me want to have sex with my mother.

I am sure they will grow to love it just as much as I did! Huge Harold is one of the greatest children's books out there - it is very easy reading and very easy to listen to. The illustrations are wonderful. A double thumbs up to Bill Peet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Harold","review":"Bill Peet is a fabulous writer. His rhyming technique makes his books easy to read. Huge Harold is my favorite book of Bill Peets by far.... You'll fall in love with Huge Harold. I did. In most of his books you start out feeling sorry for main character, but they all end up on top in the end. It really give you a good feeling inside. There are good morals to his stories, and I enjoy reading every one of them over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will be a bible for every economics PhD student","review":"It is a classical!

What grabbed me was the cover photo - I had never heard of the band, but they looked like they were a no-nonsense gritty garage band. I had no idea what to expect.I was initially surprised at variety of music they played, from rock to blues to rockabilly to Elvis-esque to mellow acoustic. (The disc also has bonus tracks, cover tunes, and live stuff). After listening to it the first time, I thought it was merely OK. After listening to it again, I started to hear the raw straight-to-the-amp guitar, the extended jams, and it's grown on me ever since. Liner notes make reference to Mick Jagger allegedly saying this album is better than the Stones' \\"Sticky Fingers\\" - I wouldn't go quite that far - but it's pretty darn close. (The piano player from the \\"Fingers\\" sessions even plays on 3 of the tracks.)It was a lucky find for me - I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Time Classic!","review":"One of my personal favorites, and an album whose influence far exceeds its sales figures. I've owned this album over the last thirty years in several formats, but this latest reissue just sounds massive, and reveals subtleties that the earlier versions didn't. The bonus tracks (10-16) reveal a killer bar band in their prime and core sound that lies underneath the overdubs of the finished tracks. If you don't love this album, you really don't like rock n' roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Nice Rootsy Mix","review":".....And if you know what that means...you will definitely dig this album. Wow...what can I say about this album,well I don't think it is unbalanced as some reviewers have said. Actually, I think it is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I wouldn't label this as proto-punk(as it often is),to me it represents a love of rock music and the music that gave birth to rock. The proto-punkers represent that too, but this band goes into different territory...like country, blues,rockabilly,and good old boogie woogie type stuff.So,in this regard I think it would appeal to someone who is more \\"roots rock\\" minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Groovies","review":"I like the name of this San Francisco band Flamin Groovies and their history is quite interesting but this CD provides very little interesting tracks.

Couldn't beat the $15.89 deal. First of all, perfect fit! I am a size 9, lean a little towards the W size, and the comfortable fabric cross straps in the front do not rub or cut into the skin of the feet. That's one of my biggest pet peeves when I buy shoes. I do not like the straps to cut into my feet, but these shoes are very comfortable, and dressy too. The pictures don't do the shoe justice. In real life, the shoes have a little \\"glitz and glam\\" to the fabric heel. I thought it was real gemstones sewn into the fabric, but it's not. Beautiful, perfect for that nice dress or when you feel like pairing your wardrobe with a dressy shoe. It has a nice, comfortable in-sole.

Jim Marcotte's walking bass underlies some brass riffs that'll knock your socks off. Dennis Geyer's guitar makes you want to get up an dance. Terry Anderson's drum work is solid and lays a great foundation for the rest of the band. Howard Wales makes the Hammond sing, and combines with the rest of the group to make you wish every song was longer. The horns are this album were arranged by Dave Roberts, and it's evident that he knows what he's doing. From the first blast, until the last note, they hit you and hold you. This is a solid buy, and it belongs in the collection of every fan of good jazz. blues, or rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"awesome pillow, i'd wish i would have bought it a LONG time ago before i was pregnant. this pillow helps me not only to sleep, but to stay sleep"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves it","review":"My wife loves this pillow she I'd pregnant and this helps her find a comfortable position to sleep in.

I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying. I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'. Instead, I found my patience was being tested!

When it comes time to sharpen you can't really even do that, your basically just sharpening the point of the serrations. Even when freshly sharpened the blade is vary thick which makes it hard to move though the food your cutting. On top of this, one side is totally flat making a straight cut in fibrous or dense things difficult because it wants to follows the arc of the side that's curved.I could see it being vary useful if your carving up a kill in the woods, but not so much for efficient food prep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The knife dulls immediately.

From classic tunes like 'Days of Wine and Roses' to 'that's all' from Merle Travis Lenny covers the full spectrum of music that flooded the universe during the sixties. Being able to play multiple fingered solos with his left hand, comping chords and playing single line solos at the same time is still an incredible feat of playing that Lenny displays here. On the trio outings Reg Kelln and Ronnie Halldorson push the music along as probably the best trio you'll ever hear. This is Lenny at his best.

There are no weak links here: each player is the 20th century master of his instrument. Listen to the educated brush work and sheer energy of a young Buddy Rich.

And who can refrain from moaning right along with Lionel Hampton as he streams his waterfalls of notes from the vibraharp?

The book is also good for student learning because the subject matter appeals to them.I found the approach of the book to be refreshing. It had you build your first game in a straight forward but not OOP manner. In my opinion it would be how most novice programmers would build the game. Nothing was resuable. Then it shows you how to rebuild the same application by making classes so the code is reusable.I was extrememly pleases with the book, but would have liked to seen the code snipet be complete or have a CD with the code sample included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make this your first choice","review":"I've studied from tons of books over the years and this is my least favourite ever. The subject matter is presented in what I feel is mostly a haphazard way. The author uses games to illustrate concepts about vb.net. However, if you wanted to search the book for a particular subject for reference, it would be hard to do. It does sort of build on topics, but not like a book should. The worst problem is that the first program, a cheesy dice rolling program is packed with coding errors. The errors weren't bad, but they were numerous. I did find the coding example interesting, but it did seem more like random mixture of stuff than an organized explanation. I guess my biggest complaint is that I shouldn't have to debug the code examples in the book this much. Overall, I am unhappy with the book and I'll not buy another APress book again. It seems to me that this book suffered from bad editing and rushed production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"The reason I'm giving this book a low score is because I don't think it does what it promises.

I, however, am a newbie to game programming, and after reading through the first few chapters and finding the text confusing and having to frequently read lines over and over because it doesn't explain itself in a fasion it should to it's target audience, still don't know how to program a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"And interesting read, but not really helpful","review":"I bought this book on a few reviews and the price of the book.

However, it continues to give me an error on something that already has a value, and it reports it as having a 'null' value.And this is just the first program in the first chapter of the book. I'm sorry, but if you are going to put code in a book, please make it ALL consistent with every other part, there were a few places where the compiler warned me about some names not being defined because the author got lazy and put an abbriviated name in for another variable or procedure.I will continue to read this book and try to code it, but I will be wary of other programming books that come from this publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pressure cooker advice","review":"Very informative, I just startarted using mr pressure cooking and I needed how to information.

My keyboard has little nubby stand things but they fit on the top of the piano stand ok and it doesn't want to slip off or anything. The stand IS kinda tall, I'm going to look for a tallish stool to go with it. Right now I'm using a folding chair and it's a little too low (though it's fine for now).The stand shipped quickly and was simple to set up, took 5 minutes maybe to get it out of the box and put my keyboard on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese quality","review":"One leg's interior plastic cap that the steel levelling screw goes in was pushed in too far during factory assembly. This makes the stand wobble since one leg is always shorter than the other 3. The folding supports don't have a stopping point and easily hyper-extend when unfolding them. This makes support very questionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good keyboard stand","review":"We bought this for our son's electronic keyboard.

I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for tall people","review":"I am tall and have struggled with trying to get a right-sized keyboard stand with a right-sized stool. This is perfect for me and my heavy Roland keyboard. I have set it up so that it is tall enough to use a counter height stool with it. I will note that I am not moving either the stand or the keyboard around so I don't know how it would hold up to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"solid but not great","review":"This thing weights a ton, but aside from that fact it simply looks more and acts more like a workbench for your DYI projects than to hold a keyboard.

It's sturdy and has a clean design and I love that it's open underneath to accommodate sitting. The fact that it ships with no instructions tells you all you need to know: just unfold it and adjust the width and height with thumbscrews--no tools needed. It has a very urban chic aesthetic which fits in perfectly in my home studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stand for the price.","review":"This infinitely adjustable stand is perfect for keyboards of many sizes. The legs spread far enough for even the most lively of legs. The top portion can adjust for the smallest keyboard to an 88 key instrument. Each leg can adjust in height so that if the floor is uneven (outdoor venue, etc.) you can make it level. It can also be fully collapsible which makes for easy travel. All in all, a great little stand which doesn't cost a fortune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Order arrived damaged. Received discount.","review":"The original box had a section torn out. Scratches on the legs where the box was damaged. The shipping box that held the original item was undamaged which means the unit was shipped in a damaged condition.

This is the best inexpensive, but solid, platform for the lap steel. Will add velcro to keep the lap steel from sliding.Would have given 5 stars if not for the damages found.Addition: Asked for and received a discount from Amazon for the slight damage (scratches on legs} will not return item."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stand","review":"I needed a different stand than the X one that my son had originally purchased for his keyboard. I could not get my legs under the keyboard because I am used to playing a regular piano and that is how I use the keyboard. This stand works perfectly for putting the keyboard at piano height and plenty of room underneath for my legs. If you use this standing up it would also work because the height is adjustable. Also, this is very sturdy stand. Does not wobble around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"This product was not as expected. The bristles are very stiff and not workable.

The male protagonists are always finding love in weird, unorthodox situations. In one story, a recluse young man courts a maimed female celebrity. He's the only one, it seems, who doesn't know her celebrity status under the facade of her scars. The story unfolds from there. In another story, a successful yuppie gives his life away to move to Florida and find a new love. The way Snyder deals with this protagonist's inner consciousness, is gratifying, and it makes the reader feel sympathy in the end.These stories aren't fancy, but the prose is well-worked out. Snyder knows his metaphors; he knows his style. I recmmend this book to anybody interested in reading the stories of a new, young talent: Scott Snyder."},{"rating":"1","title":"The boys who cannot even sing","review":"Bla, bla, bla, all the girls who reviewed this unfortunate album are completely \\"off\\".

I usually like long movies with a lot of story in them but this one just bored me the whole way through. There wasn't enough suspense or enough action to make it a thrilling or even a half way good film. I'm glad I only paid four bucks to see it because I won't be buying it at all. Chris Evans was definitely not the right choice for Captain America, he just didn't make it believable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad superhero film","review":"I was so amped to see this film; so much, that I decided to attend a drive-in to watch it. What a waste of time and money. This movie has to be the most horribly produced superhero pic in history, aside from it predecessor. Captain America desperately lacks action, action....action! This is a primary requirement for superheroes, especially ones that debut in the summer. Whoever gives this movie a four or five star rating was likely watching this film with sleeping masks on. I recently viewed Thor and it was much better viewing than this pic. We could have done without this film, altogether. It just felt rushed, rammed together for the Avengers movie. Sad outing for a well-loved hero. Doesn't deserve a sequel. Joe Johnston(The Rocketeer) was definitely the wrong director for this movie...he's known for idiotic blunders like this one. Make it a Redbox night for this one if you want to take a chance on it. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst Marvel movie.","review":"Let's start with the good acting. There is little to none. The dialogue is kinda like something a bunch of high end science fiction nerds would write, but they have no clue how anyone talks. The lead character is corny and a boy scout, the lead female has more stones than this guy. The villain is laughable, Mr. Smith cannot do a German accent, schedule=shedge-ule in his accent. The dialogue is bad, the acting is worse, the plot is worse than either one, and its overall a boring mess. IF you're curious, rent it. But don't buy it.On a side note, that no-name actor from \\"Walking Tall\\" wears a bowler hat constantly. I mean everywhere, he wears it in prison, at the bar, in BATTLE WITH BULLETS FLYING, when they are rappelling, everywhere. It's hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst,so far","review":"Please Hollywood,no more boring comic movies without a soul.A good comic book does not neccesarily make a good movie.After torturing us with films like Daredevil,Ghostrider,Elektra,Spiderman (Sam Raimi what happened to you?) and so on,they still did not realize,they made a big mistake.The Captain America movie looks like a giant Teaser for the second part,which undoubtfully is coming to us in the near future.The film itself is so damn slow,the first 45 min are wasted with the desperate attempt to build up a connection to its cast.The main character is probably one of the worst actors ever seen on screen.And again it is the mighty american hero against the evil villain nazi,let me guess....the next enemy is russian? For those who wear stars&stripes pajamas this movie might be something.For people wtih a taste for anarchy this movie is just one long and boring joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took too long to ship!!","review":"I ordered from 3 different company's online on a Thurday, 2 of the company's shipped out my order the next day-Friday, buy YOU guys didn't ship out my order-(even though it was in stock) until Monday!

This is worse than Fantastic Four and even the terrible Green Lantern.I find myself cannot help fast forwarding in order not to fall asleep. The story is extremely predictable -- and I'm not talking about by the standard of suspense movies but rather action movies. The characters are unsophisticated black and white. The development has been very slow, with too many unimportant, boring events chained together. Even the computer generated scenes look terribly unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dollar rental at best","review":"We rented this for a dollar. What a terrible movie, acting and story. I think they are beating a dead horse with the wave of movies geared towards past comic book heros. Save yourself some money, wait until this is on HBO if you still want to watch it. Horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plot, Overly Simplistic; Dumb","review":"Much like the Thor movie, I worry that my IQ has dropped several points after watching this. The plot is overly simplistic and the movie is more a montage of action scenes than anything else. The movie experience of today would be much more fun if only writers would start adding some depth and complexity to their plots. Great movie for the kids, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good.","review":"The first Spider-man film was much better then all the Marvel films that came after. The story pace was terrible, Capt. America starts out slow and about half way through speeds up as if the director ran out of time. So, plenty of action towards the end. Some of the special effects of Steve as a skinny weakling were terrible. Most noticeably when he is in the back seat of the car, his head was way to big, then he looked like a hobbit and then almost normal. It seems there is a mad rush to release these Marvel character films before the \\"Avengers\\" film release later this year. So, they are sacrificing quality, details, good writing, good editing and good acting for a quick buck. Thor and the Hulk were other examples of weak films. Chris Evans played Johnny (the human torch) in the Fantastic Four and now Capt. America??! There are ten thousand other actors to choose from!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, dumb, flashy, not well written at all.","review":"I was so excited to see this, but was SO disappointed. The writing and plot are just terrible. The story isn't well-told, so you end up not caring about Captain America or the Red Skull or ANYTHING at all!!! I LOOKS good - good effects and some action and stuff. And I liked the touches of the old Captain suit and good ol' Stan Lee's cameo. But for the most part, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I thought it was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate 3 disc combos!!!!","review":"Stupid pig idiots!! Why can't I hardly ever just buy a single blu-ray release?

And how did the director, Joe Johnston not know that the army was not integrated in those days?But then again one shouldn't expect relevance or getting history right these days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish and Boring","review":"A movie of this kind should be 60 to 90 minutes and not 120.

I'm so angry that I actually paid so much for the DVD. My wife and I enjoy comic book movies, but this one was a stinker. We were so bored that we thought the movie lasted three hours.It's not like the actors did a poor job, I think it was the plot and/or the writing. Maybe I should view it again, which I'm sure I will. This could have the same effect on me as did The Fifth Element. Hated it the first time I seen it, but liked it after watching it a couple more times. I'm slow like that. LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I keep trying to watch it and I honestly have fallen asleep each time. The first hour won 3 stars, then I keep falling asleep.

But I was disappointed rather quickly...I'm not sure if this is just me but I felt like the movie was rushed after the first 30 minutes of the movie, that the plot moved faster and did less to captivate the audience. The biggest disappointment has to be the end fight that the movie builds up immensely only to have it be very brief. What a terrible ending! I honestly could not understand people's obsession with this movie. I realize it is Cpt. America and it is somewhat patriotic but if you make that argument then our country deserves better. Do yourself a favor and rent this or wait till it is dirt cheap to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain America movie","review":"I think this movie deserves an award...it has great acting, a totally unrealistic premise, but who cares...it will allow you to think patriotically again in spite of our corrupt government officials..it's fun to watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain America - Blue Ray","review":"Bought this for my Dad for Christmas and it was a smashing hit.

If you dont have it ur late"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain America Rocks","review":"Movie is a good tribute to World War II, although one would think 'nobody' smoked or drank back then-I so detest political correctness and revisionist history in Movies these days. Some hidden details in the movie if you keep a careful eye out, aka, encased 'Human Torch' body in the 'World of Tomorrow display. I do like how this movie uses the costume of the 40s serial as well as the redesigned one later.Great supporting actors, actresses, Tommy Lee Jones is awesome as the hard nosed Officer and Peggy was captain America's love interest. The actor for 'Bucky' was spot on as well as Dum Dum Dugan. The Red Skull actor was brilliant. I hope they find a way to have him return sometime.Very patriotic movie if you are an American,go see this. If not, then liberals can enjoy Harry Potter films or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good movie","review":"A really good movie in the Marvel Avenger movie series.

I seen this movie in theaters and it was a complete waste of my time. I felt like it was rushed, the movies had little action, the story-line was terrible. I got bored and wanted to leave the theater. So happy I did not pay money to see this movie. I honestly don't understand why people gave this movie 5 Stars. Ridiculous. If I could give it no stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want that wasted time back","review":"The action in this movie is pretty good, but isn't that the case with most action movies?? The movie is supposed to be set back in WWII time frame but if it wasn't for the costume design you'd never know it. Frequent occurances of out of place dialogue and casting for the time frame, I understand the \\"it's a movie about a superhero so how real should it be?\\" argument but that shouldn't be an excuse for not even making an attempt to be in context. Also I'm not sure if anyone else noticed but the special effects to me looked awful at best. I actually laughed audibly during the scene where steve rogers chases (and catches) a vehicle. Unfortunately, as if that wasn't enough, this movie is on rails. No plot twist and turns, you know exactly what's going to happen and right when it's going to happen. Characters are super shallow even for an action film. There are far better movies out there, even if the goal is to just waste time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Superhero movie","review":"In spite of the high quality of recent superhero films, this movie seems rushed. The visuals and effects are not up to modern standards. Chris Evans only has one memorable scene and it is his very last one in the movie. The editing is sloppy (see the hangar chase), which is totally unacceptable for something with this budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor movie","review":"What a disapointing movie. From the super Nazi to the Captain himself. The effects in the movie were quite good but the story and the acting was terrible. Even Tommy Lee Jones was a disapointment. That in itself says something about the screen play. What a weak tie in to Ironman with SL Jackson showing up in the end. So I am guessing there is an Ironman Captain America and the Hulk meet Captain jack Sparrow and harry Potter sequel heading our way, with a cameo appearance by Shrek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok as Comedies go","review":"The jokes were too few for a 2 hour movie and you have to wait until the end for the funniest scene where the names of the cities are painted on the bombs.Going on a stealth operation into German occupied territory under cover of darkness carrying a shiny shield with the American flag painted on it was hilarious too.Most of the movie repeated the same jokes over again.Not recommended .. what do you mean; it wasn't meant to be a comedy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"It was just a terrible movie.

The cinematography was done very well giving it that WWII feel. The action was very entertaining but the only bad thing about it was it was rushed into. There isn't any build up to it at all and when they reveal the shield, it didn't have that spark to the crowd like it should. Overall though I give the movie a B and recommend it to anyone who likes Super Hero Films. Definitely stay past the credits...you won't regret it at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"Of the hundreds and hundreds of movies I've watched, ranging from Criterion Collection and AFI lists to campy fun like Army of Darkness, this movie has the terrible distinction of being the second movie that I could not bear to complete.

Even as a fan of Super-Hero movies, this wasn't good at all. The action scenes were brief and predictable. No good fight scenes, predictable and uninteresting plot, my friend even fell asleep!

The plot (if you can find one) is banal, but even worse is the 3D presentation. The 3D presentation is bizarre. Imagery: it's completely out of perspective. It's like characters are digitally 'pasted' on to backgrounds, apparently many feet apart, when the perspective should be a fraction of that. Weird and amateurish. Software gone mad, no human control or common sense. There are scenes with a long arm or other object pointing right out of the screen, for no reason. Its sepia colors, no doubt to give the impression of the 1940s WWII, are odd. In comparison to other Blu Ray 3D releases recently, this doesn't hack it - at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure pap","review":"Vapid empty headed pap. Paid $3.99 to rent this while home sick and bored with everything I had on Netflix streaming. Now I feel embarrassed for contributing to this movie's success. I'm also embarrassed for the 124 people (as of writing this) that gave the movie 5 stars (4 star average with 277 reviews?).

It was too slow and boring.After having to adjust the volume AT LEAST TEN TIMES, because the dialogs were very hard to hear and the action was WAY TOO LOUD (no matter what settings I used), I gave up and took a nap. BTW, i don't regularly take naps during the day, but this movie sure made me sleepy.NOT RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing","review":"Jingoistic, sanitized (total racial harmony in the 1940s...), militaristic, unrealistic (even for a cartoon, and that's saying something), idiotic schmalz. Every character and setting is completely unbelievable. Even as far as comic book movies go, this one's a dud. Captain America has a stupid costume and lame powers. I wish the Germans had shot at him instead of his shield. Would've made the movie shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"What a bore this was. Even ignoring the fact that a single .50 cal machine gun would take the Captain in about 3 seconds, his only defense is a trash can lid sized shield, the only thing super was the goofiness of the idea that this would be a good movie.At the end they find him frozen in ice, he's been there for 60 year too, and they thaw him out. The mistake was not placing this turkey film into the ice with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Boring!","review":"It's just boring and sort of silly. The story is pretty random.RENT IT FIRST!I rent movies from Netflix before I buy since 3D Blu-rays can be more expensive.For some reason Hollywood seems to think that a better image, sound, or 3D make up for bad movies...they don't.Also, don't buy the first edition of anything, there is always an \\"Extended\\", \\"Super\\", \\"Ultimate\\", \\"Collectors\\" version of whatever movie at some point.I used to do it but I'm sick of the double, triple dipping...hear me Disney and your \\"Ultimate\\", \\"Platinum\\", \\"Gold\\", \\"Silver\\", \\"Special Anniversary\\" 3D, DVD ,Blu-ray versions of all of your movies. I will no longer buy anything from any distributor until it's been out for at least a year. Even them I will buy one version of your movie and no more.Oh, and flixster.com sucks!

Chris Evans must be a witch because he's certainly made of wood and the normally-terrific Hugo Weaving was too campy in his portrayal of Red Skull. This movie was so close to being very good, but those two really dragged it down for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good, almost!","review":"It was a bit nice to see how they incorporated the original story line into this. The acting was pretty good. The almost comment was made in reference to the ending chapter. But, sometimes I'm just cranky. Good film for most family members, no gratuitous sex or profanity. Some of the action shots were really well done. There may be a time or two you will forget to eat the popcorn. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain America","review":"One of the best Avenger prequels. The actors take part in an amazing story. After watching this, you will want to watch all superhero movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"loved it! it was well done, entertaining and great acting. It also leaves room for a sequel, which is always good. Chris Evans was amazing a the captain, and Hugo Weaving was super scary, love him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"A cornball movie with childish ideas of patriotism and the idea that might makes right. A typical action movie. Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Family Fun","review":"We saw The Avengers first and then we had to go back and see all the other movies! We enjoyed it and I guess my family is just super hero oriented and we LOVE a good action packed movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want full screen movies","review":"I almost like this movie, but not worth buying if not in full screen. I paid way too much money on my tv to look at the black bar top and bottom to buy movies \\"Sorry Charlie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"I'm giving this film 2 stars because I simply couldn't sit through the second hour of the film and wanted to give it some benefit of the doubt.What forced me to choose not to finish the film:The film starts out ok, but after the experiment, the film just gets cheesy and stupid. You're greeted by dumb one-liners that aren't funny and the film gets tiring incredibly fast. If the dialogue had been predictable, that would have been fine, but it was unpredictably dumb.Frankly, it seems that whoever wrote the script just thought: \\"I've got to get all these different elements of CA in the film - how can I do that as quickly as possible.\\"I'll say this: if you have a child who has no concept of WW2, military matters, how to hold and fire a gun, and can't understand the English language: they very well might enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"To be perfectly honest I was expecting more. The action sequences were alright, but there was a total of literally maybe 10 minutes of action in the whole movie. I'm glad I only rented it for $1 at Redbox..."},{"rating":"1","title":"B'lech! Yet another pathetic attempt at a superhero movie","review":"There are so few good superhero movies out there that yet another pathetic one in Captain America simply waters down the genre even further. From the tacky CGI pasting of the hero's head onto a skinny actor's body, to the Xena Warrior Princess Army commander punching out soldiers and shooting up the set, to the Hulk-inspired action scenes, and the product tie-ins to the Avengers movie, yuck, we'll just seen it all before. Perhaps just sticking to the source material would suit a lot of these attempts at new superhero movies better. Not only is there a lot of wasted space in the movie (the opening sequence for one), but there are also a lot of sub-par actors in the movie. (I know, I know, people don't go to superhero movies to see acting, but still...). I guess for now I will have to stick to my superhero DVD collection (ie: the 1st X-Men, Casshern, The Incredibles, Watchmen, Storm Riders, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving. That said, this is a horrible movie. It was slow and predictable as well as cranking out a story that should have been filled out as much as Chris' chest was, unfortunately such was not the case and even Chris' fine physical attributes couldn't make this movie enjoyable. The last 10 minutes were by far the best part. I really wish I could have given this a better review, and if they do have a sequel here's hoping it turns out much better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype","review":"First of all, I'm a big superhero, comic book movie fan. I love Batman and Superman. I also like X-Men and Iron Man. I really thought this movie would be awesome, but the plot is thin. The action scenes become exhausting to watch and seem to make up the bulk of the movie. It also doesn't tie into modern day until the very end, which made it that much less interesting. I watched Thor after this and thought it was a way better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"movie was great but the video stopped a few times had to reset where it ended have not watch a single amazon movie that not a promblem have no promblem with you tube should went to red box amazon almost as bad as crackle movies i have a good internet connection amazon troubling quality bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie I have seen offlate","review":"fell for 5* hype and rented it (so glad didnt buy or see it in theaters)like other 1* reviewers have waited till 1/2 way of the movie to see if its gets interesting...so bad, no plot, average action....the GIJoe Cobra movie had better plot and visualsreturning it unfinished as its utter waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid script, pathetic acting, and horrible ending","review":"The only good thing about this movie is the special effects. The script and acting are horrible. Also, the ending is stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Snoozer","review":"I fell asleep on the movie. I just kept saying I know that this movie is going to get better. It never got better. What about the 3D. Even 3D can normally make a movie worth it. I wish I had saved the $26. Yes, I bought the 3D Combo at Amazon. If I could return it, I would. I love action and superhero movies in 3D. I even love the Final Destination series because of the 3D and I don't seem to mind the acting or the fact that I always know how it will turn out. This movie was a bit different. Since I got the 3D TV there is very little content. I have been collecting movies. After purchasing a few movies that I did not like (Sanctum and The Nightmare Before Christmas), I thought that maybe I should stick to action films. I really liked Drive Angry, Thor, and Green Lantern. This one was was not all that good (acting, action, and 3D). I would rent it if I could on Vudu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Evans was boring.","review":"The story was good, but the main actor (Chris Evans) was like a cardboard cut out. He was really boring and there was never a sparkle in his eye. He looked like a Ken doll that acted plastic. Boring, no charisma."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Avengers Movie Yet","review":"I've been amped for Marvel's tie-ins to The Avengers next year, but this one is a real stinker. Yeah Iron Man 2 wasn't the deepest movie, but the plot here is completely superfluous. They spend waay too much time showing what a wimp Steve Rogers is, then basically throw him into WWII with almost no exposition or real plot. Somehow the Red Skull has gotten a hold of the Cosmic Cube, but with no idea what to do with it, and Cap has even less idea what's going on. It's like a condensed version of what the movie should have been, but with just a beginning, and an end. The pay-off for the epilogue is almost it's only saving grace, which is basically another trailer for Avengers, then an actual teaser trailer for Avengers. Enough hype already, just bring on the main event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomniacs gather 'round!","review":"If you have trouble sleeping,....then try to watch this snooze bore fest. I LOVE COMIC BOOK MOVIES. This one is HORRIBLY boreing. Watch it, then get a good nights sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Disappointing","review":"There is no continuity in this movie, no explanations as to what is happening, just random action scenes. Add bad acting on top of that and very little character development aside from Captain America himself. The high ratings must be from fans of the comic book. Save your money and avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible laughable mess of a movie","review":"This is the first time i ever rented a film where i felt the need to write a negative review while watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plot spoils a great movie","review":"Aside from a perfect choice in a lead character Captain America falls very short of what are usually entertaining and enjoyable movies. This movie takes itself far to seriously and doesn't bother to provide any introduction to the characters and what role they play in the film. Hugo Weaving is exceptional as Red Skull but again he is underutilized.The movie spends far too much time to get going and when it does the action is disjointed and the characters are poorly developed and less than interesting. While I am sure the casting of Captain America was a good choice everything about the movie itself was weak. This is not must see TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain America: The Story of Underwhelming Theatrical Outcomes","review":"There was nothing but excitement as I waited in the midnight showing line for Captain America. It didn't matter if I had business in the morning (this movie would rock!). Unfortunately, that was not the case. In the end, I found myself trying to convince myself I didn't waste my time or money.In my opinion, the movie failed to capitalize on the great cast and instead went for a very safe route or what the movie executives perceived as 'safe'. The dialogue was quite boring and there was not enough time devoted to developing the characters. In the end it felt rushed and underdeveloped. There were little character I could relate to and Tommy Lee Jone was pretty much had the only memorable moments. There is no replay value. Very sad. I really wanted to like this movie. I could give a second movie a try but I will wait to after I read reviews this time. The Avengers movie doesn't have me too excited but hopefully it will rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rendition of the classic Marvel Superhero","review":"This is an enjoyable movie to watch. Great special effects, good acting, and a decent plot make it worthy. Could it have been done better? Only in the plot. I wont go into details since the plot has been told by many previous reviews, but the ending could of been done better. I understand Marvel wanted to bridge the gap into the 21st century and have Captain America be a part of The Avengers, but the ending was not as good as expected. That though is being picky on my part. I enjoy Superhero movies and Marvel and DC have done an overall good job on bringing their characters to the big screen. This movie is no exception. It is great fun to watch and I recommend it to any Superhero fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable!","review":"I don't have a long history of comic book fascination but I really enjoyed this movie. Chris Evans is a great hero figure and the female (Hailey ____) is stunningly beautiful and lights up the screen every time she appears. The action sequences are well done and Hugo Weaving plays a menacing villian. This has all the components of a great comic hero film and it delivers in my opinion. To be frank, I think the music score could have been more influencial in the film and is somewhat lacking in \\"bigness\\" for this type of movie. I saw the 3D version in theaters and I actually prefer the traditional 2D of the blu-ray. This is a great addition to the Marvel Comics films and I'm hoping for a sequel besides \\"The Avengers\\", which looks very promising!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is exactly as expected. A fun movie that will entertain and make you proud to be an American. It's not a classic or award worthy. It's just entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMMMM.....","review":"I know that this is America...but i obviously just dont like the spokes person to represent it. I did not like this movie. And everytime i tell people this they get their panties in a bunch saying how im suppose to like captain america because i live in america. NOT! This movie was as bad as i pictured it. I almost fell asleep. It has its slow moments where you just want to break the TV, then right before you fall asleep the action picks up and your like \\"OOOHHH interesting stuff....stay awake..\\" I have nothing against captain america, its just in my opinion it could have been WAAAYYY better than it turned out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"the great movie","review":"Captain America is arguably one of Marvel's best superhero movies. It contains a relatively historical background and scene compare with the setting of Iron Man, Hulk, and Spider Man. The effect and action are amazing though in addition to its great story. Also a great collection of marvel superhero movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain America: The First Avenger (Two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo+Digital copy)","review":"Our entire family really loved this movie! Great story and lots of fun!

So much hype is rarely lived upto and Captain America gave me the same feeling. Top movie with a great superhero cast in chris evans and possibly outdone by the smooth baddie in hugo weaving. In terms of the blu ray 3d it could have been better although the movie might be more 2d suited. You should enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but...","review":"Ok my dissappointment is you buy a used dvd/blu-ray only 1 disc shows up. Buyers beware on used dvds/bluray combos. Anyways the blu-ray is awsome, wanting the dvd to rip it to mp4 video using 123copydvd software..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hero Transformed","review":"My wife and sons saw this when it was in theaters and said I would enjoy it. \\"I'll see it when it comes out on video\\", was my reply. I realize now that I missed out not only on a tremendously fun theater experience, but also on an object lesson on the value of character. C.A. successfully transforms the comic book hero into a man. The defining moment for our superhero occurs just before he undergoes the treatment. Dr. Erskine asks, \\"You must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.\\"Other pluses: An array of well-developed characters in spite of its genre, a nascent love story effectively carried off by the actress Hayley Atwell, and the defeat of evil personified convincingly by Hugo Weaving.C.A. is an enjoyable reminder in our jaded age that honor and sacrificial love are \\"super-hero\\" values that do make a difference. May we all be so transformed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie!","review":"Hey all,I watched this movie last night through Amazon Instant on my Panasonic Blu Ray using Vierra. As usual the video and sound quality was amazing.The movie was very entertaining and I know it sounds strange but rather authentic. By authentic I am talking about the sets, characters, the era, etc. I do not know much about Captain America in general so I am not talking about it being authentic from that standpoint. it could be, I just do not know. It just appearred realistic to me considering the type of movie it is.The acting was great and the cgi was not over done. I really thought it was a fun, action packed movie though I tgend to like things a little darker. I would have loved for this movie to have been rated r but I guess you can't have everything.If you like this type of movie and if you liked Green Lantern you will love this.
