Unfortunately, however, I would give this coffeemaker a low rating because of the annoying bubble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected From Krups","review":"After purchasing three of these, I've decided to give up and purchase another brand.

All in all, I would not recommend purchasing this coffeemaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned this...","review":"I've always believed Krups was a very good, reliable brand. It may still be, but not as far as this coffee maker is concerned. I was very disappointed in this product.The carafe was the main reason I bought and returned it. It did not keep the coffee hot and it's a very awkward design. Very big & \\"bulky\\". When you get towards the bottom of the pot, you can tell there is still coffee in there, but you have to turn the pot upside down to make it come out.I have a $5.00 carafe from Walmart that keeps the coffee warmer than this one does. And keeps it hot overnight!Good things I can say about it is your coffee is done very quickly, tastes good and it's easy to program. But for this price, I'd go with another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced Coffee Maker","review":"In a sentence, this coffee maker is over priced and not recommended.Disadvantages:- Carafe dribbles when trying to get last cup out- Must tip carafe at a large angle to get all coffee/water out- This was a gift for Christmas and was opened defective.

The horrid single player mode with bad music is not recommended.

At that point, it was a totally bad game.Recommendation: Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"SVG Distribution made a bold attempt to invent a simple yet addicting puzzle game to bewitch and enthrall the likes of us who would sit and play Tetris or Dr. Mario for hours on end. Instead, they just made Mojo. Boasting frustrating controls, mediocre soundtrack, and ultra-repetitve gameplay, Mojo pushes the envelope of how crappy a game can be. Plus, you get the Mojo level editor, so you can make your own unholy soul-crushing levels, just like the other 200+ the game already makes you suffer through.

It definitely deserves 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad game at all; especially for the price!","review":"Picked this game up because of the price, and I'd have to say that I definitely won on that deal (over 60 hours of game time). The battle sequence is pretty neat as you tell your character what his/her moves are to be and then sit back and watch the fight. This game I felt to be very easy to play. You catch on to what needs to be done in no time at all. Yes I'll agree that you move at a snalls pace between towns but it don't take one very long to do it. I thought the story line was not so bad. The characters were good; however, Noa at times is too whiney. But at the same time her innocence is cute. Songi, by the end I wanted to strangle him, the bully. One other feature I liked about this game is that with the many, many hours of game play there were only a few instances when the characters swore. This is nothing in comparison to other games I have played. In the end I'd have to say that it was definitely worth the money payed for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The battle system rocks!","review":"This was the first game I played which utilized the \\"rumbling\\" effect built into the controller during battle and so well too! I love how new equipment and armor you buy shows up during the battle scenes. The monsters tend to repeat themselves but at higher levels and don't look like a lot of care was taken in their development.One annoying thing is the speed of the overworld movement, I felt like a snail! But compared with the rest of the game it's a minor annoyance, highly recommend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an incredible game","review":"I adore this game. While it may not have the deep stoyline of games like Xenogears or FFVII, it is definately a game that will keep you up playing for awhile. The graphics are, on average, well done, and the battles are beautiful. My only gripe is the music. While the tunes won't make you hit the mute button, there are no awe-inspiring scores. Other than that, this is a wonderful game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle for humanity falls short","review":"This game started out very good, good graphics, good plot, good storyline, but later it got somewhat repetitive.

The graphics, dialogue, battle system, and the characters. You start as a 14 year old boy named Vahn, who lives in Rim Elm, a town full of survivors from the Mist. You revive \\"Genesis Trees\\" that reflect the Mist and Seru. Other characters that play important parts are Noa, Gala, and Mei. THIS IS A MUST HAVE game.

I just ordered this game as my original copy was stolen long ago. I can't wait to play again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great RPG","review":"Legend of Legaia is not well known, and it deserves to be. The battle system is unique, and while still turn based, it has a fighting game feel. The story is by no means amazing, but it's still enjoyable, and the characters work well together even though they quite often act like morons. In short, RPG gamers should give it a look. It might surprise you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why games shouldn't be made/released so quickly!","review":"Though Legend of Legaia begins with an entertaining episode, it quickly falls apart after the first few minutes. The menace, an evil mist machine that launches monsters into the world, is uncreative and not very menacing at all. The characters have almost no personality, and Noa in particular is ridiculous. Though the combat system is new and kind of fun, the difficulty of the battles and tiny amount of experience and gold (combined with the incredible amounts that the player needs) are devices used to lengthen an otherwise tiny, unimaginative game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"As a very experienced rpg player, I can honestly say that this nearly the worst rpg i've played in my life. Nothing can describe it better than the word \\"horrible\\". The fmv's (whatever fmv's there were) were bad, storyline was bad, and the overall feeling in the game was bad. The only redeemable quality this game has (the reason for 2 stars) is the fighting system. Even in this horrible game, the fighting system shines through. However, it's not enough to make this a fun game. To save you hours of playing time, here's the entire game's story (beginning - end). You find out there's a bad mist and you must stop it. You find the source of the mist in the deep recesses of a dungeon of some kind and destroy it after fighting through hordes of random encounters, ending with a boss. Rinse, repeate, and be incredibly bored a few more times and you have played lengend of legaia. This game is almost as bad as Quest 64."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ridiculous...game","review":"My title says it all. How do I hte ths game? Let me count the ways. First, the player does absolutely no battle. He merely picks the moves and the computer fights. Also, the plot makes absolutely no sense. It is completely [sensless].

Which is unfair, given that what precedes the ending is thoughtful and insightful. Other reviewers have noted the unsatisfactory ending, so I don't feel I'm giving anything away by pointing out that there really isn't any ending. Is the reader to draw their own conclusions, or is there a followup in the wings? But the reader has to feel cheated since, unlike the serial works of Dickens or Thackery, the reader is led to believe this novel is a work in its entirety. The characters are given inner lives and divergent points of view, and there is almost a sensual quality to Raban's writing. But it is as if the publisher was on the phone with an insurmountable deadline to meet, and he had to leave the ending out in order to reach it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time...","review":"Some of the others have said this already, but here's my summary. There's no real plot, it's simply a few weeks in the life of a freelance author. Events happen that have no importance (for instance the car crash) to the story. The ending is worthless. My overall reaction is that I wasted several hours reading this when I could have been reading something interesting and/or fun. I guess it's true - you can't judge it by the cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cheap trick","review":"I certainly hope this style of ending doesn't catch on.Soon every murder mystery will end with an asteroid suddenly killing everyone, the love story that builds up to a climax only to have the lovers killed by aliens right before the proposal, sporting events that show the last second shot heading toward the goal and then cut to Disney :)Pathetic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"What a waste of my time and money.Raban's characters are marginally likeable, at best. The narrative is relatively dull and \\"surveillance\\" issues play only a background role in the novel, leaving me to feel misled by his title and multiple descriptions of the plot.Truth be told, there is no plot.

I don't begrudge this intelligent essayist and reporter a shot at some big bucks, but jeez Louise, a paperback orginal and a quick sale to Hollywood would do just fine. It seems that the abrubt ending bothered some readers and reviewers. Quite so if the question is plotting.

What is supposed to be near-future fiction about what could happen if government nosiness is allowed to run amok - turns out to be just another \\"Global Warming\\" scare tactic book... I suppose the author just put it out to appease his liberal buddies with oneupmanship in several \\"doom and gloom\\" categories. Anyone who believes that in the next few years, Seattle will need to outlaw watering the grass, or there will be no more snowfall in Washington state mountains because of \\"climate change\\", is a \\"few bricks short of a full load\\"... the text reminds me of the hour-long ramblings of a high school English teacher I was forced to endure in the 70's... only worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"What i was looking for","review":"This product is great for long cubans.

I like that it works either on batteries or with the AC adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"I purchased the Sound Therapy Radio to take on a trip. My roommate is a snorer, and I figured I needed the sound. I tried it out at home and liked it. It has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use.

It was a good buy for my purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but larger than expected","review":"The sound machine works well. The sleep timer is useful and easy to set. The utility for combining any two sounds is all but pointless, since an interesting and varied array of sounds is not the way most conducive to quick and profound sleep.

I couldn't wait to read the book. Each chapter was dissapointing with few, new thoughts. I think college students and those new to business may find this useful but those who have already spent much time in business or considering how business and the glory of God go together may not find much new to chew on here.

The Stiff version is different; this one isn't the worst thing I've ever heard, but sooooo close.The rest of the CD is even worse: it's like listening to a lounge band do \\"jive\\": there's no soul, no bottom, no feeling of any kind. Great elevator music. No wonder DD appealed to the masses who thought mainstream Reggae was too strong.

But trust me, this gory short film rules!Meatloaf makes fur coats out of the pelts of dead raccoons. But the little critters' ghosts hold a grudge and put a curse on all those involved.It's easy to overlook this weak storyline due to all the gore and nudity. Fright Master Dario Argento is the best with gruesome deaths, and he doesn't hold back here. There were a few disgusting self-mutilation scenes that looked way too realistic.Really, with all the vivid gore and hot naked chicks you don't get a chance to get annoyed by the plot. A must-see for horror buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgustingly Entertaining!","review":"I truly enjoyed this episode, although cringing through some of it. It has some of the worst (best?) gore scenes I have seen in a while. You've got people sticking their heads in steel traps, sewing their own nose and mouth shut, gutting themselves, and, of course, what Meat Loaf does at the end in EXCRUCIATINGLY slow detail.I guess it's all about what one man will do for a piece of pie, and what raccoons will do when you mess with them.Kudos to Dario Argento for finally having a good episode in this series!Very cool, very gross, very fun!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pelts... a little too gross","review":"While I love horror... Pelts in many ways was a little too \\"over the top\\" for my taste. I was extremely grossed out by some of the scenes.

I would not recommend this movie for the faint of heart ( though faint of stomache would be a better phrase)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of gore, nothing more","review":"I now watch these programs with a kind of perverse fascination. Despite an occasional success, they are almost uniformly disappointing. Here we have legendary director Dario Argento working from an adaptation of a short story by the well-regarded horror author F. Paul Wilson, and it is just terrible. The whole arc of the story is clear very early on (okay, everyone who encounters these furs is going to go mad and kill themselves and/or others), after which it just plods along to the end with no surprises, reversals, or interesting developments. By the way, I know a real raccoon will rip your face off if you surprise it while its going through your garbage, but as an antagonist in a horror film, it's just silly. One star for frequent nudity by the beautiful Ellen Ewusie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dario Argento-Master of the kill","review":"Ive always seen Master of Horror movies but never really bothered to watch any of them. I found a couple at a good price and I bought this one. Meat Loaf Aday is a great singer and a helluva good actor, he delivers a great performance in this film. Dario Argento is the master of a kill-ive seen his movies and they always have an awesome kill or two. This film has really, really, really excellent kills. The part where the guy cuts open his stomach looks fake but I still enjoyed it. I highly recommend this film to horror fans.

I have to pull the machine far forward on my countertop because the lid to the water reservoir lifts up so high. Controls are on the side so that requires turning it sideways to program that day's brew.

It's gotten better, but still not dependable. I find it only works properly if I poke the beans (to aid in feeding) while grinding, which makes the Auto feature unusable. Also, settings are not calibrated to my tastes. To make what I consider \\"strong\\" coffee, I have to grind enough beans for a 10-cup pot, but only put 7-8 cups of water in the reservoir.

It is still not as good as the old coffee maker made....The coffee is warm, but not hot. I'm not talking McDonald's sue frenzy hot, but normal coffee hot. It stays warm longer, and doesn't get that burned flavor the old coffeemaker could get, but freshly made, it is not hot enough.My husband and I love good coffee and are both incredibly disappointed at paying this hefty price for this lackluster coffee. The convenience is nice, but definitely not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"The unit worked well for about 2 weeks and then the valve which regulates the flow of cofee into the carafe began to stick,spewing coffee over the counter top. Attempts at cleaning the top corrected the situation for only one or two brewings. The coffee itself tends to be on the weak side. The rubber gasket supplied for the top of the carafe does not fit. All in all, an expensive and poorly designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad grinder, a great brewer!!!","review":"There is a design flaw in the grinder of this machine. The intake valve is not steep enough, so about a quarter of the time, no beans drop into the grinder. This means that if you are not watching the machine and checking that the beans drop (say if you have programed it for the morning) you may wake up to a nice freshly brewed cup of flavorless hot water.In addition, even at the darkest setting, the coffee is pretty weak, so you have to use less water if you like strong coffee. This isn't a problem if you only want a few cups, but if you want to fill the carafe, the coffee will be weak.The coffee brewing is great, when these obstacles are overcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A $300 disappointment!","review":"I was so excited to get this coffee maker. I had one just like it, except for the thermal carafe, for many years and it was terrific. The coffee this makes is weak! I don't require exceptionally strong coffee, but this is like tinted water. I have the flavor set to strong. When I talked to customer service, they told me to \\"trick\\" it into making stronger coffee; set it for 10 C. \\"strong\\" and then flip the basket back over again and reset it for 4 C. \\"strong\\". This is not only a serious bother each time I brew a pot, but it makes it completely impossible to use the \\"timer\\" function. The other problem is that the basket does not flip back by itself, even if I don't use their \\"trick.\\" I have to stand there and manually release the basket each time I brew a pot of coffee.

They also claim to have an unconditional 30 day money back return policy which is TOTALLY NOT TRUE. These people obviously only care about the 1st sale and are not in business for repeat customers. If you want a truly great brand like those sold at jl hufford, I would strongly suggest that you go through another dealer.

Could only utilize the coffee maker, and make the coffee right when you want it to brew. Then, the coffee maker just went DEAD....stopped working altogether.

I \\"weighed the evidence\\" and found that the grinder dispenses between .8 and .9 ounces of coffee (depending on the fine to coarse setting) for an eight-cup pot of coffee set on \\"strong\\". To make the proper strength, you need at least 1 ounce of grounds for eight cups. There is no way to adjust the amount of coffee dispensed (confirmed by calling Capresso). You can decrease the amount of water, but what if you need 10 cups? Weak coffee is a deal-breaker.

The various feautres of selecting brew strength as well as ground size don't seem to make much difference in the flavor/strength of the cup. In all fairness to the manufacturer, the machine I received quickly became defective so there is a chance that it was not brewing with the correct water temperature from the get go and I just didnt notice it until the heating unit began brewing luke warm coffee (within the first week). I returned the machine and ended up getting a different brand just because I had this sneaking suspicion that over the long haul it just wasnt going to be the right coffee maker for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for the same product you can get elsewhere","review":"These are not much different that Soothies (by Playtex?) and the cost a lot more ($25 for these vs. $15 for the pair of Soothies).

Add to the fact that you must use two (one for +, one for -) and you got yourself two pretty big boxes hanging from your speaker wires. Oh yea, another thing.

Buddy's chess recordings are of course top notch, but my favorite on this complition is the 7 minute extravaganza \\"Blues at My Baby's House\\", which in my opinion features some of Buddy's most soulful licks and vocals.

A lot of the exercises in Mr. Cooley's book are straight from Hatha yoga, although from what I understand the way Hatha yoga is taught today is much more physical, and outward than in the time I came to yoga.

All groupings of the exercises are numbered 1, etc...so if you are researching a specific problem area, it is impossible to figure out which #1,5,7 group to pick from. Also, the relationship to the meridians is interesting, but these stretches are not going to cure some of the ailments that are listed.

No explanation or details on which body part is the focus of the stretch. Some are fairly obvious but some stretches hit various parts of the body and there's nothing identifying these parts.3. Benefits write up - too granola. The Psychological benefits are a bit hokey for me. \\"This stretch can assist you in dismatling indifference and move you away from a feeling of martyrdom\\".... uhhhh, sorry, i don't think i'll be getting that from this stretch..4. p 255 which lists the stretch to the body part... doesn't say which series it is referring to. there are 3 series of stretches.

Paired with the Parties cookbook, they'd be a great gift.I do not understand why some customers give this and the other Barefoot Contessa notes cards a low rating just because they didn't bother to read the item's description which clearly states that these are NOTE CARDS and NOT recipe cards.

A significant omission is the data-related component category, which given the sparse documentation elsewhere, was a primary reason I purchased this book. I find myself reading the free Adobe Flash 8 PDF files instead of this book. Granted, I don't expect this book to rehash what's already available at Adobe's web site or in the help files, but I do expect a Wiley Bible book to provide a clear and thorough explanation of topics which augment and expand upon the program's free documentation, giving me valuable insight and examples.

Whether Gore would have done better than Bush after 9/11 as Commander in Chief is also unknown although it's not difficult to speculate. The US Supreme Court ordered the recount to stop and this has to go down in history as a monumental mistake.

Regardless if I wore the watch all day, or if it was stored in my automatic watch winder, it just kept stopping. Since the watch was still under the one year warranty, I sent it back to Invicta for repair. If you have to send your Invicta watch in for repair, even while under warranty, you have to enclose a check for $20 for the return postage. Also, be prepared to wait as long as 2 months to get your watch back, as they send all repairs under warranty to their home base in Switzerland. They replaced the movement, but after wearing it a couple days, the watch stopped again. Lastly, their customer service is bad and does not answer half of the time-- you just get stuck in a never-ending automated looping system.

Volz left the band (no offense to his replacement). \\"God Gave Rock 'n Roll to You\\" is, without a doubt, the best song on the album. It's a classic that ranks right up there with many of the legendary, secular songs of the 70's. As another reviewer mentioned, this album was particularly amazing when you considered the kind of \\"Christian Music\\" that had been put out up until that time. The late 70's was the the birth of true Christian rock (Larry Norman, Randy Stonehill, Keith Green and others were either exloding on to the scene or hitting their prime). This is a must-have for any die-hard Petra fan, and a great suggestion for anyone who loves classic rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come And Join Us - hints of things to come.","review":"After entering the scene in 1974 Petra returned three years later with a giant step away from their scattered, uneven and under produced self-titled debut. On Come And Join Us Petra gave us hints of things to come, including the debut of \\"guest vocalist\\" Greg X. Volz, who would go on to become the band's frontman for the next nine years. Most of the tracks on Come And Join Us lack the cohesiveness and punch of later efforts. The gem (unpolished as it is) on the project is \\"God Gave Rock And Roll To You.\\"This album is a worthy addition for true Petra fans and CCM music collectors. The casual fan who is familiar with Petra's later projects will not find much that is recognizable here. A better starting point would be 1979's breakthrough Washes Whiter Than.-Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very WEAK and also EARLY Petra rock album. For HARDCORE fans.","review":"I don't own Petra's first cd but I own all the rest up to \\"This Means War\\" and from there I lost interest in what the band created. I think from that point the band went downhill dramatically. Anyway, I'm not going to waste time on a real cd review of this album. The album has a mix of vocalists and at least one of the singers has no business singing in ANY band, especially a rock band. There are many BAD tracks on this cd and three to five decent songs. Some of the songs on this cd are simply embarrassing and I would most definitely turn the cd down very low when another car was beside me. This cd is for HARDCORE Petra fans ONLY. Washes Whiter Than, which I think came NEXT, is LEAPS and BOUNDS above this effort. This cd doesn't show a lot of talent or promise. Good thing the band got it together rather QUICKLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke","review":"This book displays a truly colossal ignorance of its subject. That might sound unfairly negative, but put the book to the test. Just open to any given page and you will see error after error. Ok, I've just done that myself to demonstrate: I've opened the book to the page on tanks in this theater. What did I find? The description of the Pershing and Sherman tanks available to the UN forces (US troops). What does it say? That the Sherman was the more effective of the two tanks! Read on ... we soon discover that APC ammo for tank guns is short for \\"Armored Personnel Carrier!\\"Obviously a hack job.

An excellent jazz recording for non-jazz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi genre-ational","review":"It's difficult to peg this record into any particular genre. \\"Jazz\\" might be the first category that comes to mind, but on this album, Cassandra Wilson taps into a lot of different musical styles. Obviously, the main influence is Miles Davis. Davis had himself covered Cyndi Lauper's \\"time after time\\" back in the 80s. I'm not sure that was Davis's finest moment, but Wilson gives the song a sultry flavor here with her smoke filled voice. The musicianship and recording clarity are spectacular, and the CD really shines on a great stereo. Wilson is also heavily informed by candomble/santeria, which emerges throughout the disc. Davis had also tapped into that magical Afro Brazilian rhythm, most famously on \\"Bitches Brew\\".

Cassandra's vocals come out of the right surround (or rear) channel, and there is no sound at all in the left surround or center channels. You can switch to play it in DTS which has a very nice and full mix, but you lose the higher resolution, of course. Consquently, I am indicating one star for this problem in this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cassandra has done Miles proud","review":"This album is a wonderful tribute to the late great Miles Davis. Whether they be songs that were written by Miles (to which Cassandra has written lyrics), or songs that Miles covered himself, or the 3 songs completely written by Cassandra, I think, no, I know, that Miles would be very happy with this album. She has a knack of creating a beautiful jazz atmosphere, using instruments that are not traditionally associated with jazz, like the greek bazouki and mandocello. This album will transport you to a small, intimate, after hours jazz club. Close your eyes, relax, and let your mind wander.

One of the best things about Hoover's books is her ability to pull a reader into the story.

One claims to be from the outside, and they attempt to escape. I really enjoyed it, but it was weak on backround. The city and the outside villages are not fleshed out fully. It gave hints of something that it never revealed. How the villages got some foods was beyond me, and parts were too implausable. Still, Hoover has written a fine story that just should have been longer.

The user interface is good and it played MP3's without problem. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 1-1/2 years before dying. This is with moderate use in an office environment. Absolutely no harsh handling at all. I guess it is a testament to the quality Aiwa puts into their products. Needless to say, I won't buy another Aiwa product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good except that it is very sensitive to mp3 burn","review":"This unit does all that I wanted from my MP3-CD player; search capabilty within a mp3 file, resume play, restart exactly where I left, album & track names display etc, which my other mp3 player (Philips exp 101) was not doing all that well. No shock resistance for mp3, but it hasn't really skipped alot and I am happy with it. But my only complaint is this unit is so sensitive to the way the burner has burnt. I had to make several tries before it could understand the files in it. But with my Philips it is a breeze. For the price and performance this one is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This product is not a good cd-mp3 player. When you burn mp3's the player has very bad quality sound.

Performance is flawless, plays my whole collection of MP3's without a problem. The only complaints I have about the XPMP3C is the fact that there is _no_ EASS function with MP3 CD's! Why not? Also, the unit has a cheap feel to it; it feels too light! Not at all like Aiwa's MD line... For 180 I'd expect a remote.. Aiwa: replace the \\"car kit\\" with a simple corded in-line remote!!Buy Aiwa though, it is superior to the no name brands out there.."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing speaker and author","review":"I just had the privalege of seeing Dr. Eisenstein lecture at an annual women's symposium at my college.

I figured out how the book was going to end after I finished reading chapter 1.I really wish author's would put more thought into their work. Author's are not merely writers, they're business people.

I bought this believing that the Emmy bestowers would actually have some sense of taste when awarding their prizes, but in this case, I simply ended up tossing my set away. (I only am posting this as a warning to anyone who might be hoping to find some flavor of the original works in this adaptation; contemporary kids might like this on its own terms, which is \\"the way things are\\" -but this is not Crockett Johnson's \\"Harold.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both versions are wonderful for toddlers","review":"My now 3 1/2 yr old son began watching this version on HBO in Demand and loved it. It was the only thing he asked to watch over and over. It has not been available for the past month on In Demand so we went to the library and borrowed the original (1974 I think) Scholastic version. My son enjoyed it just as much as the Sharon Stone-narrated version. Both versions stimulate the creative mind and I feel that these series are overall so much better than much of the programming available for the preschool set. Overall a wonderful purchase....only one episode I had a hard time with (when Harold's pet fish dies) as it was too much for my son to understand and too much for me to stay dry-eyed due to the recent death of our dog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedtime wonder","review":"This is the second purchase of the same DVD; great little stories before bedtime.

It has a large number of episodes, and so for the price you are getting a fantastic amount of playing time. Sharon Stone does an excellent job at narration, and has a soothing voice that my son doesn't have to strain to understand.

For 40 minutes, you don't know where it is going, it's a slow introduction. So half-way through the movie, you still don't have a clue what it will be about. The acting was good but the story was just a long slow day in the life of a woman. Sometimes the characters are nice, sometimes they are awful, so you never know if you like them, and you can never relate to any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, cheerful music","review":"A surprisingly powerful piece, combining Spanish classical guitar riffs with the power of an orchestra.Strongly recommendedIf you liked the melodic Mahavishnu orchestra works of Mclaughlins earlier work, you will love this.

One retailer made me wait for 7 month without any success. One day I ended up in a little bookstore called Shelly Leishman Books in Ottawa and the owner managed to get it for me within 2 weeks. Thank you.Lady of Hay continues in Child of the Phoenix and Child of the Phoenix goes on in Kingdom of Shadows. Each book is independent of course. What a read. Obviously if people loved the first two books they will go after this one too. It was worth waiting 7.5 months to end up reading in within 2 days.This book is a must read. I hope that Barbara Erskine will publish a new book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom Of Shadows One of Her best","review":"I really got hooked on this book, great plot and well written.I wasn't all that anxious to read the modern parts of the novel as I find with Barbara Erskine she tends to write excellent \\"past\\" stories but the \\"present\\" storyline aren't as interesting to read. However even the \\"present\\" storline in this book wasn't half bad. One of her best infact.I just love how she can bring the characters and scenery to life and she does it very, very well in this novel as she did in Lady of Hay.It seems this novel isn't easy to get, but I recommend you try because it's worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Unlike the similarly-themed (we won't say cookie cutter) _Lady of Hay_, in this one the historical sections of the book do not save the boring modern sections. Isobel, Countess of Fife fulfilled her family's destiny and crowned Robert the Bruce King of Scotland. For that, she was captured by the English and forced to spend years living in a cage.

The character of Irina, the assassin with a heart of gold, too beautiful to be true, with a \\"secret tragedy\\"... I don't know, it just got dumber and dumber, more and more sentimental, until I only finished it because such is my invariable practice.

It seems as if the orchestra had played this music so often that they were bored with it & were just going through the motions. It plods along with no joy, life or excitment. I was so turned off that I studied the other available sets of the Schumann symphonies & ended by ordering the Levine & Philadelphia and the David Zinman & Zurich orchestra.

The truth is very different, of course. As a long standing fan, Head Games is a truly remarkable book. It was un-put-downable, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone.

Why? Because the film reveals to the viewer the beauty, dignity, of those people in Rio's rubbish tips who earn a living as pickers - picking out recyclable items or that which can be sold. The rubbish is classless, but Rio is not classless because the \\"filthy\\" rich display themselves on the boulevardes and beaches of the city whilst the slums of the poor cling to the surrounding hills. Vanity Fair on the other hand is a peek into the lives of the rich and wannabe rich. One Rio class is connected to the other through the rubbish, but the syzygy is also the contrast between the two. The shameful side of capitalism. The film shows the process of creation of quite a stunning art project. The transformative power of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure inspiration","review":"There's no shortage of movies to numb out to, but if you're anything like me you like to be educated and uplifted about some aspect of the human condition when so much of it is circling the drain.

I hope that his workshop is good--however, the book leaves quite a bit to be desired.

But this book inspired me to research all Gods, long buried or still alive, so I might beseech them to give me the two hours back that I decimated reading this book.It might give you the inkling of the environment of the pitch, but otherwise the book doesn't help you develop, write, work on a physical or verbal pitch on any level worth taking to a meeting. I've seen professional writers (eg. working writers) talk about pitching, and what's offered here is, at best, passing opinions. That, linked with the constant dropping of the Rotcop?s accomplishments like ?pitchmart?, buries this book?s credibility, and seals it with an iron lid.Spend your money on one of the other books on pitching.

It actually has several mysteries going on at once, and Le Queux does well at intertwining them throughout the story. Definitely not a 5-star book, though, for a few reasons- The ending is just too simple, but I can't explain why without spoiling the story for you. The author will tell you something 5 or 6 times, like a person's true identity, when twice would have been plenty. The story takes place in 6 locations around Europe, but the author rarely describes the countries and cities. The title character is only in about 2% of the book, so I would have preferred a better title.

The installation was trivial, and has meant this vice simply does not budge or tilt over. It also raises the vice so that the head can be positioned handle-up while the jaws are horizontal.One relatively simple modification I would like to make to the vice would be to add a thumbscrew that would keep the head's handle from sliding around, but the vice is perfectly usable without such a change.Overall, a great tool to have on hand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stout little vise.","review":"Very cool.

As the extremes in response among the reviews show, it's not a work for the Saturday afternoon speed reader, but then I wouldn't expect that from someone who studied with Gardner, who in addition to the better known of his writings, was so astute in medieval and renaissance works he is renowned for having written Cliff notes for Chaucer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Father of the Man","review":"Father of the Man has some of the most engaging characters I've ever read.

The can placement was critical for it to work and the paper label always tore. Our no-name 25 year can opener worked much better, however we gave it to our son so my wife could \\"upgrade\\" our electric can opener - what a disappointment the Cuisinart turned out to be.We have since then purchased a West Bend electric can opener.

I read the instructions and watched the video. The first few pots of coffee were great. Better than the drip machine I was using at the time. By the third day of use the coffee started to taste weak. I discovered the coffee wasn't staying in the upper chamber as long as it had when I started using it. At first I thought this was just a fluke. Subsequent attempts resulted in the same weak brew. The water was staying in the upper chamber for less than a minute before the heating element would shut off and cause it to fall back into the pot.I ended up returning the unit to Starbucks for a refund and bought a Braun drip machine. Since then I've noticed Starbucks no longer carries this coffee maker.Perhaps Bodum has fixed the problems by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great action - Poor flavor","review":"When I first saw this coffee maker, I was assured that the quality of the coffee was similar to a French press.

This may not be noticable to those who are not serious about their coffee, or to those who like a weak cup of coffee. At our house, we grind our beans, filter our water and always make our coffee fresh. We returned the pot after using it for one day. I was very disappointed, since this was the first automatic vacuum pot I had ever seen and the first vacuum pot I had ever used.

Poor function and customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"If you read Amazon's introductory paragraph on this coffeemaker, it challenges the ad copy of many products claiming to be revolutionary, or really different. Well, the Bodum electric Santos really is different -- but is it any better than a standard drip coffee maker? In my experience, not at all. In fact, using the same blend of 8 O' Clock coffee, a friend made a tastier cup using a cheap Procter-Silex drip coffee maker. The only thing one can say positive about the Bodum is that it looks cool, and it is fun to watch. Otherwise it is harder to clean, it requires more coffee than equivalent drip coffee makers, and it costs about three times as much. In short, if you're the CEO of an oil company looking to spend your holiday bonus, the Bodum is your coffee maker. The rest of us can do much better for much less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this machine after researching it for a long time.

Unfortunately they were not. I tried brewing with the machine a half dozen times and it consistently resulting in weak, tasteless coffee regardless of the type and amount used. The apparent problem is that the water just doesn't stay in the brewing chamber long enough to really get the flavor - on some of my tries some of the grounds just stayed dry!I assume that some machines actually work well, because there are some good reviews, but it's a sad state when whether the one you buy is hit or miss.

I've had requests from dinner guests to tell them when I'm brewing coffee so that they could see 'it' in action.And what of the quality of the brew? For me it's flawless. I have an attitude about coffee and a reputation too. I often mix my own blends of beans and grind my own too. This means that the machine has an obligation: Perform or Be Gone.The reason for 4, not 5 stars: Cleaning. Coffee oils seem to love the plastic parts and nylon filter of this showpiece.

We tried three different kinds of beans (all from Starbucks) and varied the amount (yes, you do need at least 2 scoops per cup, not 1 as suggested). If you do need a simple drip machine, ....

Of course we all know of people who never received the benefit of corporal punishment who suffer from those problems. And we all know of people who were raised with little or no discipline who have succeeded in life.

Namely, a woman who professses moral accountability but when life throws her curveball she hides and denies (i.e. her false denial that a set of nude photographs depicted her in very imtimate detail.)

NO other book I've found describes the wonderful way that a child can be involved in the adoptive process. It reinforces the importance that all siblings have, epecially to an adopted child. I recommend this book for anyone with a child, who is adopting another. It is a great start for avoiding rivalry and fostering a new role as a loving older sibling.

It is a sort of coming of age type story, as the hero is young and has to grow into the role, but it is really and adventure type story. It is so odd that, like in the \\"Dune\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" series, there are swords and other simple weapons, along with high tech weapons and weird creatures. In this story, there is a reason for the lack of high tech weapons, space warpage, so it is a bit more believable. The cover shows this hero with his soon to be known connection to the universe, in a sort of zen or lotus pose. This fits with what happens, but it is a bit misleading, because there is really no point where he gets to actually put himself into that position. There is a point where he is communing with the greater beings and what not, saving the planet, but it does not seem that he sitting down or anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend for Mozart lovers, but for Gould lovers","review":"I do not feel that this CD set deserves a good recommendation because I believe Gould's rendition of Mozart borders on the idiotic.Each note is clear, but the pacing and distinct pauses between phrases seem completely at odds with what Mozart would have intended.I would give this set away except I worry about wrongly influencing someone else with it, that this represents \\"good Mozart\\".Instead this is technically precise piano playing but still \\"bad Mozart\\".I would recommend this set if you are more of a Glenn Gould fan, than a fan of Mozart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dub out the vocal chords, keep the piano ones","review":"If you're looking for unadulterated Mozart look elsewhere.

Unfortunately, Americans have become accustomed to glaring grammatical errors in advertising, even in newspapers, but in a book? A work of this magnitude deserved more (or even some) attention to grammar and spelling. (For example, \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\" are used interchangeably with no regard to their meanings--very rudimentary knowledge.)

Only one time when I made the coffee has it come out equally distributed between the cups, I wondered if the end times were near. Usually one is half full, and the other is overflowing.The construction of it is not very sturdy, so much so I have to pin it down just to turn it on. Otherwise the force needed to turn it on will push it off the table.Finally, it often overflows the filter. If I place the appropriate amount of grinds in the filter to make an acceptably dark coffee, the water flow is choked until it overflows the sides of the filter, sending grinds and water down into and around the coffee mugs. VERY messy and VERY annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"The Cuisinart name speaks for itself once again.Great coffee taste, however a device to stop the flow oncethe cup is removed (after it shuts off) would have been a nice feature.

I grind the coffee and fill the filter up outside of the basket so I do not wind up spilling grinds. NOTHING WORKS. It spills over when it wants to.I like the concept. I used to like the brand. I strongly dislike this product.Apparently you have to spend hundreds to get a good coffee maker. I have been searching for one for a long time. I still have not found it.

Unfortunately, my experience with two of these machines was not good. Both were defective.I returned the first machine because it would not hold water. It gushed OUT of the bottom of the unit. I returned the replacement machine because it had the opposite problem -- the water stayed IN the unit. I was not inclined to try it a third time so I opted for a different brand & model.I do think this was a fluke. Cuisinart is usually a very reliable brand.

I handwashed these but they still leaked.The drip is sometimes uneven and you have one mug filled too quickly.There isn't a timer to auto brew.

Their other kitchen appliances seem to work well just not their coffee makers!This particular one is a complete piece of junk. The filter is a pain to put in. The coffee either comes out hot (when it works!) or messy (when it bombs!). Does not distribute well between two cups. Everything on it feels so flimsy and cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found it!","review":"This coffeemaker is ideal for me being the only coffee drinker in our house. I like the convenience of only making 1 or 2 cups at a time. One review I read said it leaked if you didn't get the cup in correctly. That should not be a problem at all. There are indented places to easily slide the cup in for 1 or 2 cups. It is easy to clean and I love the convenience of it turning off automatically after the brewing is complete. I don't have to worry about leaving the house and not unplugging it. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"We purchased this item and the idea is great two working people getting ready for work.

Could not get my money back but got store credit. It'sa shame because we liked the idea and would have kept it if it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the job!","review":"This is a great coffee maker! I am the only one in my house who drinks coffee, and I like to make it and take it with me for my commute. It is the perfect coffee maker for this. As others have mentioned, this is NOT the coffee maker best suited for large quantities of coffee, or those who need programmable functions. The mugs are heavy and sturdy, and keep the coffee warm for 30-45 minutes, easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love coffee, don't buy this one!","review":"This coffeemaker is compact and handy for making fresh single cups of coffee. However, I had one for about a year at work and it always added a very bad plastic taste to the coffee. I cleaned it several times and used my own mug, and the taste got a little better over time. But it still made the coffee \\"plastic\\". I finally got a basically free brewer from Gevalia and my coffee tastes great again."},{"rating":"1","title":"On/Off switch did not work","review":"I was not able to brew my first cup of coffee as the on/off switch did not work. I returned the product and am now waiting for credit from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big mess","review":"My husband and I received this coffee maker a little over a week ago. Tried it 4 times. Of the 4 times we used it, it leaked all over the counter and floor twice. A hot mess to clean up. Disaster of a coffee maker. Never seen anything like it, and we've made alot of coffee in our lives, it's not like we're new to making coffee. The travel mugs aren't bad but a bit of a steep price to pay for two travel mugs. Will try to find another brand with a better design. Shocked at how bad this Cuisinart performed. They usually do a much better job than this. I would keep shopping and locate another model. Unless you like hot coffee squirted all over your kitchen first thing in the morning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice mugs, bad coffee maker","review":"I bought this item because it didn't have an external burner, and I wanted a machine that would be safe for my desk at work. It was on sale for $20 at the time, which is actually a deal for the thermal mugs. As expected, the coffee maker was not very good, but it did the job. Until it broke, three weeks after I bought it. The water no longer moved through the chamber, so I wound up with a lot of noise and steam and very little coffee. I returned it to the store. I think I will have to switch back to a (nearly unbreakable) Bodum french press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we expected","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. It now sits unused, taking up counter space. The pluses are that it makes tolerable coffee, it is fairly easy to use, and the two cups fill up almost equally. The down side, that makes it unusable for us, is that there is no keep warm function (not possible with this design), the plastic coffee mugs (no handles) are clad in stainless sheet metal thus obviating putting them in the microwave to reheat, and lastly, there is a propensity to \\"dribble\\" when drinking from these mugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt work","review":"we purchased this coffee for two at a discount store, no box or instructions. the water gets hot but does not come down to the cups. since i lost the reciept i cant take it back. did anyone else have a problem with theirs not working?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked twice","review":"I received this as a gift and LOVED it -- for 2 days. The third time I tried to use it, the Power light didn't come on and I noticed that the \\"on\\" button was stuck in the depressed position. I tried plugging it in to different outlets with no luck. I tried to get the power button unstuck, and that didn't work either."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy coffee","review":"This is a great cofee maker. I bought one when my children were babies for safety reasons (no hot spills) and now I'm getting another. Great for us because there is only one coffee drinker in the family-I can make one hot delicious cup, or 2 if we have company. Mug really keeps it hot. Good buy in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Meet My Expectations","review":"The Two-to-Go Coffeemaker worked fine for the first few weeks of heavy use but by the third week, the machine was only making about enough coffee to fill one of the containers. We believe that grounds may have gotten in the drip device which lays right ontop of the grounds and is part and parcel of what I believe to be a bad design. When it was working right, it produced a great cup of coffee, but now it will soon be replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"coffer to go","review":"LOVE this coffee maker. No clean up, filter comes out, wipe clean, simple as that.I have one at home and one at office, use the same mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"ON/OFF Switch goes defective after return period","review":"Hey, this Cuisinart appeared to be just the ticket for two people who needed coffee at the same time, and on the go. But as someone else noted, the ON/OFF switch went south and would stop brewing. Only after repeatedly hitting the switch approximately 5 times could I get some coffee brewed. I could live with the cup on the right filling up sooner than the left; I ended up transferring the excess coffee from one to the other. At least I got 90 days of use out of it, twice as much as another reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"Love this coffeemaker. It brews quickly and makes one or two wonderful cups (cups at 14 ounces each.....) I have actually unplugged my \\"big\\" and expensive coffeemaker. Have used this twice to three times a day and so far no problems. I am very picky about the taste of my coffee, want a flavorable coffeehouse brew and this little Two To Go unit delivers consistently. I like this so much I just ordered another unit for my son-in-law for his birthday!Hopefully this little coffeemaker stands the test of time and holds up because I really like it! The cups hold the java at a warm temp for longer than I expected and have been very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power on switch failed","review":"After having the unit less than a year the power on button no longer works.

I also own a very nice Braun Aromatic coffee maker and it is now a dust collector. The Two-to-Go makes a nice hot cup of coffee and does so quickly. I like this machine so much that I just ordered another one to store away for the day this item is no longer available.....I think that says pretty well how much I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality Mugs","review":"The coffee brewer works as advertised and does the job. However, the mugs are of very low quality. Within a few weeks of using the mugs, they had broken from their plastic mounts within the housing and made the mugs useless. I cannot recommend based on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work....","review":"I bought the Cuisinart coffemaker as a gift for my parents - I thought they could take it on their road trips. I've used many coffeemakers in my time, and so have my parents. After at least three attempts we gave up. We had to mop up coffee off the counter top and floor, because it ran over every time. It was as if the water was going through faster than the basket could handle, so it just overflowed all over the place, grounds and all. Oh well, seemed like a good idea when I bought it. Not. Maybe it was just a dud. It's sitting in my garage right now back in the box.Good thing my folks have a sense of humor. We laughed our heads off...then made coffee in their old, old under-the-counter GE pot that I gave then about 20 years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only for about 9 months!","review":"Reecived this as a Christmas present last year, but it took two months of moving before I could actually use it. Once I did, the travel mugs lasted about a week before the bottoms came off and they had to be thrown away due to rough bottom edges. No big deal I thought, I will just use other travel mugs. That lasted for about six months. The coffee it brews is HORRIBLE tasting! I have ran the \\"residue cleaners\\" through it, like all my past coffeemakers, and it just won't come back to its days of making a decent cup of coffee. Too bad I had a convenient coffeemaker for about 9 months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift and I have tried my best to make a decent cup of coffee out of this thing. I have tried different brands of coffee, different sweetner, cream, more cream, less cream, any combination - you name it, I've tried it and it always comes out the same: watery and bitter. So, 7 months later I have finally called it quits. I just ordered a Braun KF180-BLK FlavorSelect 12-Cup Coffeemaker through Amazon and I have my fingers crossed. All I ask is for a decent cup of coffee in the morning! Once this new machine comes in I'll rate it and give you my view...hopefully it's positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 2 months","review":"I would've given it 4 stars. 5 had the on button not been really hard to push when I got it.

It have problem some time, like brew cold coffee, not working and don't drip coffee from filter. I am about to say bye to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This looked like a good idea for coffee making. It arrived and did not work at all. The switch-button to turn it on is very flimsy and would not turn the machine on. I had to call Amazon (always very cooperative) and pack it all back up and send it back. I would not order this machine again because of the poor design of the on/off button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"SO I got it and started using it, more often then not it would not work. First the coffee grinds went everywhere, then it refused to let water out of the filter. Instead of a quick and easy option in the morning, I had to babysit it. The regular coffee maker I bought after even though it makes more cups is easier and quicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this coffee maker!","review":"This product is amazing! Very convenient!!

Bluetooth is flawless. Sound quality is amazing, compared to my stock Harman Kardon BMW radio.There are just a couple cons.1.) To make calls through radio, you have to dial the number directly. The radio will not scroll through your contacts. However, with new phones, voice dialing, or dialing through the phone is just as easy.2.) There are no other display color options, only blue. This is very minor, but the other one I was looking at could.It boils down to I could not justify paying $70 more for another radio that did have the above minor features. Everything else is still there. I would recommend this radio to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for....","review":"So my sister was looking for a new head unit but didn't want to spend any money so I found this one and had all the features she wanted and I told her to be careful with it and it would feel cheap... About a week after it was installed she said something wasn't working right with the CD player... Thinking she had done something I told her I would look at it... The CD player skips and doesn't play all the songs on the CD, the USB when playing off of it (mp3 tracks) you hit the skip and it skips 2-3 tracks instead of one...The bluetooth also is a little shoty and shouldn't be used to stream music which was my first plan for her....In the end the radio works well and the headphone jack works well.... the rest.... not so much..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this POS","review":"We bought this stereo because we wanted something cheap for my convertible.

Broken in three months","review":"I bought this Dual XDMA6415 less than three months ago. At first it worked fine but even after the first couple weeks, I started noticing problems. It became fuzzy sounding and the bluetooth stopped connecting. My iPod stopped charging and I replaced the chord twice with no results. After checking the wiring and the device, there is no connection problems. Now the radio does not function at all, nor does anything else for that matter.I emailed the company about the 1 year limited warranty and after three weeks, never received a response. I called the contact number listed and I can never speak with an actual person. I am really disappointed with amazon, because they should not be selling a product with such a sketchy service warranty. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have spent the extra cash instead of wasting it down the drain with this piece of crap.The warranty info if you are interested:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE product and service!","review":"This radio is awful.

Now it's just a glitching mess. It actually almost killed me. When I turn the volume knob down from say 15 to 10, it will randomly jump up all the way to 40! This is unbearably loud and probably has done damage to my ears as well as my speakers. It also glitches when you press the center button(on the knob) to access the audio controls; it will randomly just start jumping track if using a cd and if not using a cd, it will just switch the mode to radio or aux. I am contacting dual's warranty department as it has been a couple months shy of a year since I've owned it but this is just a cheaply made, not so cheap in cost, terrible product. Do not buy this product. If you do think that maybe you'll be lucky and get one that won't crap out on you in 6 months, be warned that you're taking a huge risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stereo good price","review":"Good price got it a couple of months ago no problems so far working good looks good too plays better than my old one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"It was pretty easy to install... luv the bluetooth capabilities... the only complaints r that it doesn't play AND charge my phone at the same time & there is a bit of background noise in auxiliary mode but, that could be something I did wrong in installing it...no problems with order & arrived quickly ...would purchase from this seller again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the Extra 20 Bucks to get a better brand name. . .","review":"Unit showed up, installed easily and powered up.

It does feel a little cheap, but that is expected with the price. It also doesn't get very loud, but again, for the price - it is great.

My brother has put in dozens of these before and this time was no different, we got everything working and the next day it just didn't work, we tried troubleshooting everything we could to fix it. It had some weird glitch where as soon as it was turned on, it would crank up the volume by itself. That went on for a week or so, then it stopped working all together. The few minutes I got to use it, it sounded fine but unfortunately I was unable to return it in time to get a replacement or a refund. My fault completely but still a little bit of a bummer. Now I have a metal brick in where a stereo should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt out in 1 week","review":"Worked right out of the box. Easy installation, and great features! Bluetooth syncing wasn't too bad either. I had a chance to test out just about all the features this stereo had to offer, and it all seemed to work just fine.About a week after installation and moderate use, I caught a whiff of burnt electrical components. I thought it might have someone burning trash as I drove past some houses. The next time I turned on my truck, no sound came out of the speakers. I checked all fuses, connections, and spent a few hours trying to find out anything that was wrong. Just as a sanity check, I plugged my old stereo back into the truck to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with the truck hardware. Sure enough, the old device worked fine. The Dual stereo system was defective. Returning to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"Easy, basic install.

However, when placing a flash-drive, the radio will read it and play it; however the name of the file will not appear on the radio screen; instead, the tracks will be labeled as \\"Track-1, track-2, track-3 and so on.

It's not the most beautiful thing to look at, but there are so many great things are this stereo that I don't care too much about what it looks like. Oh, and one of the things I really like is that it automatically connects via bluetooth when I get in my car.

The smooth professional full-orchestra sound of the Mozart seems to clash with the nature sounds. Moreover, the nature sounds seem to be tacked on top of the music without any harmony; it just didn't sound 'natural'. Most of the music was too fast-paced to be soothing. The nature sounds consist mostly of birds tweeting, which I found high pitched and stressful, and flowing water, which I thought was static on my stereo the first few times I heard it. My dogs get up and pace around when it plays and my room-mate, who has never complained about my music before, asked me to turn it off. There is a lot of better music available to soothe dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs, shoddy collection","review":"What's missing: 'Mama Kin', 'Train Kept A-Rollin', 'Seasons Of Wither', 'Toys In The Attic', 'Chip Away The Stone', 'No Suprise'. What's annoying: some songs, like 'Sweet Emotion', 'Same Old Song And Dance', and a few others, are edited for time. I hate that! So in effect, these aren't even the songs we've come to know and love. Get the recent double-disc Oh Yeah! compilation instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest From The Greatest, Indeed","review":"Well this is the Greatest Hits album, that pretty much says it all. All the hits from 72-79 are here. This is probably the definitive single-disc Aerosmith collection, start here! The only gripe I have with this great album is that for some reason some of the songs have been shortened from their original album versions. \\"Same Old Song And Dance\\" is almost a minute shorter, as is \\"Sweet Emotion\\", but nonetheless this is a great album that belongs in everyone's collection, unless of course, you already own all these songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off - Do Not Buy","review":"Imagine somebody took your favorite album and cut out parts of the music and altered it, so that it no longer resembled the original. That is what they have done here.I don't know why the band allowed the release of this collection. Maybe they had no control over it.All I can say is buy only the original recordings and don't trust collections like these.

I think the greatest years of aerosmith were the 70's. And these are all the hits of the 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Possibly the worst thing ever done to Aerosmith's music. A collection of their radio top forty songs. A lot of good music, but cut to fit on a lp. A lot of the songs are edited, and most tragic of these is Sweet emotion. The unique intro and the awesome outro jam are missing. When I converted my Asmith collection to cd I bought this just to say I have it. But in five years I have not even taken it out of the wrapper yet. If your an 'smith fan, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice To Get Single Mixes/Edits On CD","review":"A nice comp featuring the single mixes of these hits. This is the only place on cd to get the single mixes of Same Old Song And Dance, Sweet Emotion, Walk This Way, Kings And Queens, etc. They may be \\"butchered\\" as another reviewer mentioned, but they are the authentic single mixes that were on the radio and on the 45s. I prefer the album versions, but it's nice to have the single edits/mixes on cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so Greatest hits!","review":"Aerosmith is the greatest band of all time and this is suppost tp be their greatest hits of the 70's but it really isnt! While the songs they have on this collection a great they left some off. For example they forgot \\"Mama kin\\" \\"Seasons Of Wither\\" \\"Train Kep A Rollin'\\" \\"Toys In The Attic\\" \\"Big Ten Inch\\" and \\"No Surprize\\"Dont get my wrong the songs they used are awsome like I said but they forgot some of Aerosmiths best songs.Another reason why this is not a real greatest hits is because on the song \\"Sweet Emotion\\" they edited out the intro and the long jam at the end, and on the song \\"Kings And Queens\\" they also edited ouy the cool intro! now all the songs they used are great and every Aero fn sould own this for the sake of owning this and if you are a new Aerosmith fan get this!, and if you have enough get \\"oh, Yeah Ultamate Hits\\". But be sure to get the albums because thats were they real magic is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs, but...","review":"Great songs, but, come on! this is a Greatest Hits CD, and theres 37 minutes of music... There should be at least 15 songs on here. Not 10.

Look for other Best Of Aerosmith's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing for a guy who like Aerosmith","review":"I have heard Aerosmith on the radio. I have heard Aerosmith on the \\"ARMAGEDDON\\" soundtrack. But those songs which caused me to actually LIKE Aerosmith have been butchered on this \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD. I don't know if the band members even approved of this album, because if I were in a band making great music, and somebody edited it to the nth degree, I don't think I'd like it too much.

You have to hand it to these guys, their stuff is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmithing","review":"This is a great collection of some of Aerosmith's better songs but it is flawed. They edited some part of Sweet Emotion and that [stinks]. They also left out some great songs, for example Mama Kin. A good CD but not as well rounded as it could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but missing a lot of songs","review":"The songs that made it to Aerosmith's Greatest Hits are awesome, but there are so many that didn't that should've. From Aerosmith: Make It, Movin' Out, and Seasons Of Wither. From Get Your Wings: Train Kept A Rollin', Lord Of The Thighs, and Pandora's Box. From Toys In The Attic: No More No More, Big Ten Inch Record, and Toys In The Attic. From Rocks: Sick As A Dog, Home Tonight, and Rats In The Cellar. They only left one out from Draw The Line, which was I Wanna Know Why. From Night In The Ruts: Three Mile Smile and Reefer Head Woman. If you're starting to collect Aerosmith, get Rocks and Toys In The Attic first. Maybe you could consider buying it after that. If you buy this first, then you'll get hits, but not all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money","review":"I have no problem with greatest hits packages, but when they butcher the songs with 45 editing, you get half-ass versions of songs that were meant to be heard in their entirety.Add to this poor decision that they included two songs that need not be here, Kings and Queens and the ridiculous Remember (Walking In The Sand). There are at least a dozen others songs that deserve to be included here.All that aside, if you really want to introduce yourself to this band, buy Toys In The Attic or Rocks or one of the other scads of hits packages they've greedily dumped on the consumer over the years.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money.","review":"The subject line says it all. Avoid this CD at all costs, especially if you're an Aerosmith fan.Don't get me wrong - the songs are great, but the album is a ripoff.Why?One simple word: butchering.Here are some examples: \\"Kings and Queens\\" and \\"Back in the Saddle\\" are both snipped slightly, while \\"Walk this Way\\" fades early.The most noticeable of the editing, however, is that the memorable intro and equally outstanding finale of \\"Sweet Emotion\\" are both gone.Columbia/Sony owes fans a better best of collection of the first Columbia Records tenure of Aerosmith, especially now that the band is back on the label.Again, if you're a fan of Aerosmith, don't get this album. You'll be better off getting the albums from whence these songs came."},{"rating":"1","title":"for completists only","review":"The original Aerosmith compilation has become nothing more than a relic for completists. Originally released as a single LP record in 1980, there are only 9 songs from their first six records (with two of them, \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and \\"Kings and Queens\\", substantially edited) and the Beatles cover, \\"Come Together\\" (originally featured on the 'Sgt. Pepper's' movie soundtrack - you know, the one with the Bee Gees). For the casual fan, you can get just as many unedited songs from that era on the newest compilation, 'Oh Yeah!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Get O, Yeah! Instead","review":"Just so you know, there are shortened versions of songs like \\"Same Old Song and Dance\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" on this disc. You absolutely should buy \\"O, Yeah Ultimate Aerosmith Hits\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, if you don't mind abridged versions","review":"If you like classic Aerosmith, listening to this cd is a little like reading the Cliff's Notes for--say--Catcher in the Rye, if you like J.D. Salinger. Intros to songs and some of the interludes and guitar riffs are abbreviated or cut out altogether. And they're not even cut out clean, so you can tell where the edits are. It's pretty annoying. Shame on you, Columbia. Buy the cds of the original albums if you really like and respect this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Hits too short!","review":"I am a big fan of Areosmith and the cd Aerosmith's Greatest Hits is very good but in my view too short. Many big hits are on here (Dream On,Walk this way etc...)but it only has 10 tracks they could at least put the full version of Sweet Emotion on the cd! But it is an overall good cd. Recommened if you have never have heard Areosmith before or haven't heard some of their classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWesome album","review":"This album is great. Most of the A-Side single releases from the early years. The bad thing is that Sweet Emotion and Kings & Queens is edited. Why? So they could put it on a record. Buy it. thats especially for those who aren't sure if they like Aerosmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite what others say, I really like this...","review":"This certainly isn't the only greatest hits album by Aerosmith, but it's the only one i have. I had most of their LP records years ago, but no longer have a turntable. This cd has some of my favorites by the band, as I like their older stuff better than the more recent. Everything from the late 80's on just is not as good in my opinion.IF you like the songs from their earlier works, you will appreciate this. I don't know about editting and how the music transferred to cd..i thought it sounded fine..especially with the volume turned way up!A good greatest hits, and an even better introduction to the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there's nothing better....","review":"This is definitely not a bad collection, but there are so many better ones out there, that this should not be your first choice. The song Sweet Emotion has been completely destroyed on this album. the entire bass intro has been cut out, and the song starts about an entire minute into it. There really is no reason to do this, as even on the radio, they play the entire thing, as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long. The song starts at a terrible place too. It sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song, then just stuck it on the cd that way. Again, not a terrible compilation, but definitely not a good first choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to see this title here","review":"Dr. McNamara was my Sociology teacher at Furman University in my senior year last year, and I had the opportunity to read this book then. He approaches the information contained in the book with objectivity as well as empathy, and his skills as a sociologist become strikingly evident in the course of the book as different boys are willing to talk to him about different issues dealing with their profession. I like the narrow focus he used. He was able to show a more detailed look into the lives of several young men, their daily routines, their prices, their typical clients, and the negative consequences that befell some. This to me is much better, the intimate view, then a bunch of statistics about a much larger piece of the pie. Dr. McNamara's research was conducted with accuracy, patience, interest, and heart, and it shows in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment as a graduate level resource.","review":"This book was purchased as a reference work for a research paper in a Master in Social Work program.

The inner trays are a flimsy plastic; not really suitable for displaying. In addition, the rock and mineral samples are soooo tiny, almost like pebbles. That was really disappointing.

By Thursday evening I had finished it and purchased this one. By Friday I had gone back out and purchased Why Good People Do Bad Things. I read a lot of books in this genre and these books stand out as the penultimate. Ms. Ford is not preachy and she refrains from invoking religion except in a passing way. Her writing style is enormously readable and, most importantly, what she has to say bespeaks insight and relate-ability. My only regret is that I didn't come across her works sooner. I think The Right Questions is a great one to have because it breaks the material down into 10 questions; in that way, you can digest the content and apply it en toto, or in logical bits.

I found this boring and tedious. It's like she had ten questions in mind, but she had trouble finding enough to say about them to fill a whole book.On a different note, some Christians may have a problem with Ford's last question, \\"Am I choosing from my Divinity or am I choosing from my humanity?\\" However, other Christians may interpret \\"my Divinity\\" to mean the Holy Spirit which resides in followers of Christ, rather than meaning that we are actually God/gods.

It's packaged nicely so that you can only take out the paper that you need and wo can't use an extra set of ink when printing photos?There probably is fancier paper out there, but I found this stock nice for every day photos that are going into albums anyway.There is a mark on the back to let you knwo which way to feed it into the printer, but that does look cheesy when you look at it aftet the picture is printed.

I saw two ways: 1) the combination pack with 4x6 paper, and b) the color combo pack plus a separate black cartridge. It seemed that the combination pack was a good value.

It's easy to set the alarm time with the front bezel. A little night light turns on while you push the snooze button to allow you to see the time in the dark. The radio has decent reception and acceptable sound clarity (like an old AM radio). The only minus is that it is very difficult to distinquish if the the alarm is turned on by the yellow green color indicator (not an lit indicator).

Prep times are lengthy and sometimes require what appears to be the use of every pot in the house; perhaps Ms. Thomas's target audience has become those familiar from her primary career as a film producer, who can pay someone else to do the washing up?While I commend Ms. Thomas's husband's desire to be accommodating to guests, presumably those accepting an invitation to dinner at the home of someone who has made a reputation by publishing cookbooks aimed at vegetarians would not be expecting to be served turkey?Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone would be a better -- and more accurately marketed -- investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cookbook!","review":"This is a great book I've been using for several years and I can say that I love Anna Thomas' style and diverse approach.

This problem alone would keep me from buying or recommending the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing experience","review":"You would think the author of a vegetarian cookbook would understand the definition of \\"vegetarian,\\" but Anna Thomas doesn't seem to. I was happily thumbing through my copy, when in the middle I had a rude discovery: a spread on how to carve a turkey. The author explains its presence away by asserting that even vegetarians won't want to pass up a turkey now and then! Um, what?It's pretty off-putting to people who are vegetarian for ethical reasons, myself included, to come across a turkey-carving spread when any reasonable reader would assume we're on on meat-free turf (having been lulled into this belief by the title). Turkey carving instructions have no place in a vegetarian cookbook, and the spread ruined the book for me, turning it into something I never would have wanted had I been afforded full knowledge of its contents before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite cookbook that just HAPPENS to be vegetarian","review":"For those of us who enjoy vegetarian cooking for health reasons (or for simply a change of pace) this book is a dream come true. Some might take issue with a one page addendum about roasting a turkey but they are missing out on some of the tastiest vegetarian dishes I've ever made. If you have ethical objections, there are have plenty of other cookbooks to choose from.But for the rest of us who just want great recipes with a bit of gourmet flair this book really fills a void. So many other vegetarian cookbooks are far too \\"earthy\\" for my tastes, filled with one too many bland, pensive recipes involving wheat gluten,lentils, soy milk, etc (yuck! is this supposed to be food or self flagelation?). This book takes tasty classic recipes from all over the globe (Italian, Indian, French, Thai, etc) that HAPPEN to be vegetarian and updates them for modern tastes.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate","review":"Hadn't seen this cookbook for a while, but got lucky while doing some fall cleaning of the kitchen.

Italian risotto? Beat it with garlic! Mexican bean soup? Garlic!It's like reading the recipes of the Ugly Duchess's cook from Alice in Wonderland, but instead of yelling \\"Pepper!\\" this author yells \\"Garlic!\\"It's one of the hallmarks of a bad cook to always rely on the same flavors for every recipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A VEGETARIAN BOOK!!!","review":"Vegetarians DO NOT eat turkeys or eat gelatin.

I loved (and all of my dinner guests raved about) the Corn & Cheddar Cheese Chowder, for example.I mean, just because we're vegetarians it doesn't mean we've lost our taste for rich food or bold flavors!The new version is a disappointment because it focuses on, for want of a better phrase, \\"health food.\\" Anna Thomas celebrates the abandonment of butter, cream, cheese.

Also, this book has an updated cooking style compared to her older cookbooks.The recipes are original and fresh. I particularly recommend the Tomatillo and Squash soup.

I have learned to enjoy the violin sonatas with this CD, but I do think that they could be performed better. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, it does seem that Barenboim is somewhat timid in his approach. The violin sound is somewhat thin too. The tempos might be a problem with some, though I can't compare them with other recordings. However, these performances are enjoyable, and the CD is not expensive. This CD was recorded live in 1989. The sound quality is fairly good. There is applause at the beginning of the first track, as well as after the last movement of every sonata. This is not a bad CD, but it is probably not the best choice.Violin Sonata No. 1 in G Major1st Mov. - 10:082nd Mov. - 7:243rd Mov. - 8:04Violin Sonata No. 2 in A Major1st Mov. - 7:442nd Mov. - 6:083rd Mov. - 4:59Violin Sonata No. 3 in D Minor1st Mov. - 7:222nd Mov. - 4:383rd Mov. - 3:014th Mov. - 5:45"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORDERLINE BRAHMS AT BEST","review":"If you can get past Perlman's swooning, vibrato-immersed violin playing, the rather thin sound of this live recording (which, by the way, is noted nowhere in the liner notes, on the CD, or on the back of the jewel box), and the intrusive applause, then, well, you might enjoy these performances. Perhaps not. Of course, since these ARE live performances, a certain latitude must be given; however, that said, I still find this Brahms wanting... too often. If anything, Barenboim pulls more interesting detail from this music than does Perlman, whose closely-miked violin tends to constantly overshadow his partner's piano. These artists try admirably, but there are simply too many moments of sloppy, stilted ensemble work, too much \\"pointing,\\" and an overall sense that an imbalance exists in more than just the recording itself.[Running time: 65:50]"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH STATIC","review":"I purchased this for school, tested this out at home and I was very disappointed by the static.

I had fun setting up the tank because I was able to use it when it was wet and make hills and valleys and such. My \\"Spidey\\" as we call her has become much more active and no longer perches on her log to avoid substrate that is too wet or dry. She also has a lot more fun digging.

If you have outdoor cats (or your neighbors do), you might want to watch where you dump it out, as they like to use it as an outdoor litter box.I previously used the coconut fiber that was fluffy, in bags. It is the same stuff, but about 3x more expensive to buy it that way. The compressed bricks are a much better deal. I thought I was paying more for convenience, but these are not really more difficult to use. You just put a brick into a bucket, add water, and wait 20-30 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Front Wheel","review":"I cycle around the neighborhood twice daily on asphalt roads. An accident mangled my front wheel.Shopping at my local bike stores for a replacement wheel for my Huffy bicycle I decided that the wheels were too expensive for my modest needs - these may well have been worth the price for a serious bike. I came across this wheel on Amazon. It arrived within a week. Thjere were no instructions on how to assemble the quick release mechanism so I brought it to a bike shop.It took the owner literally minutes to assemble.I installed the wheel on my bike and have been biking without incident for about a month now.I would recommend this wheel as a low cost replacement for recreational cycling.

The CD is thoughtful, well produced, but restrained. Her live show is pure entertainment.

The author has cleverly chosen to write her poems in free form -- her form -- to express the love she has for her late husband, as well as for her country. I think she achieved success as a writer since she was able to stir a range of emotions as seen from the earlier customer reviews.I was VERY moved to read of how much love she has for her late husband, Major Florenz John Mansmann. This was evident in her strategic placement of \\"How Can I Find My Husband\\" at the beginning and ending with her last poem \\"Our Love Forever, We Promised\\" in letting us know how much she treasured the love of her life, whom she also referred to as one of her \\"special angles\\" in \\"God Is Great.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Protect Our Homeland by Thuy Troung Mansmann","review":"I don't know how some people can relate to her.

Like they say you can't judge a book by it's cover. I've heard and know plenty about her because I only live in the same town and she is nearly nothing like how she describes and represented herself in the book. If I were you...this book isn't work that $8.00. I worked a whole hour to purchased this book and I wished I could've returned it. And...yes I've met her, I think she's the meanest old lady in the world. What a waste of time reading this pathetic book that was pretty much made up by her and whomever wrote this book for her.

I made it through the whole tape, but I will never do it again. The timing is totally off, and the cueing is awful. At the final \\"heart rate check\\" I couldn't even find my pulse! I wasn't sure if I had failed to reach my target heart rate or if I was simply dead from boredom and frustration. Sorry to be so negative, but this is a total waste of money. I really enjoyed the Kathy Smith, Denise Austin & Buns of Steel-they will see me through my entire pregnancy & are a much better investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a workout","review":"I was very disappointed with this video. The instuctor does a horrible job, not giving proper cueing before each new set of moves. The aerobics did nothing for me, I was never in the target heart rate zone during the checks. The leg work at the end was okay, but the entire stretching section was done on the back, which we all know you should avoid after your first trimester. I may continue to use the tape for VERY low energy days, only because I feel like it was such a waste of my money, I want to try and get something out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncoordinated workout","review":"This tape was not worth the money.

The steps are not creative or well arranged at all. They go back to the same couple of little steps over and over through all the sections. I would complain that they didn't que the moves, but they were so simplistic and repititious that I really didn't have trouble picking them up. Overall, the video was just bland! The workout itself, the music, and the demeanor of the participants were all boring.

The track is shorthand in films for wild soul partying. Those cheers in the background could be at a '67 bogaloo dance hall or a 2010 techno rave. I even think the blasting fire siren horns and stomping beat are a precursor to 1990s house music.If you are reading, you probably know the Bar Keys were the Stax backing band and a lot of them died on the same plane as Otis Redding, though they did reform\\"What you may not know is that \\"Soul Finger\\" is by far not the only selling point of this album. At a half hour, this is a concentrated tablet of the bluesy romps that were dance music all over the US, particularly the old south.With the gleaming exception of \\"With A Child's Heart,\\" simply one of the most beautiful ballads you may have never heard, this is essential soul and dance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Annoying Audiotape","review":"This is a great book, my 4YO son loves it.

This album proves that even Burt's \\"throwaway\\" or \\"album filler\\" songs are brilliant, memorable tour-de-forces in themselves.

I really enjoyed Goethe's Faust and thought that this book would be a great follow up. I've never read any of Mann's books but I took a shot on this one and wish I didn't.I found the text to be far too complex and verbose. Way too many charachters to keep track of and very and I mean very little action. It takes halfway into the book before the conversation with Adrian and the Devil takes place and I was hoping that this would make the mostly arduous journey of reading (although the discussions of religion in the fraternity was interesting) the book worth it. But the conversation with the Devil was boring and in my estimation difficult to understand why Adrian was lured.I read the next chapter and then I realized I don't like this book, I haven't liked this book and drudging through another 200+ pages just to finish it isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY WE SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS GUY","review":"The marketing and publicity for this doc presume you've never heard of Josh Harris, but I have. I was a ( very occasional) viewer of the We live in public website, and not too long ago wondered whatever happened to that guy? Now I know.What I didn't know about was his adventures ( and fortune making) in the dot-com boom, and his social experiment project \\" Quiet\\". But what is really interesting about this doc is Josh Harris as a person- trying to tease out the truth from his statements, interviews with those who know him, and his work. Who is he? Prescient predictor of the future? Artist? Businessman? Bad Businessman? Brilliant? Misunderstood? Deluded? Watch this and come to your own conclusion.I would have watched this DVD even if I weren't slightly familiar with the man, as I like the director's work, but even if you've never heard of her or Josh Harris, this is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting social Experiment.","review":"This documentary was quite chilling and while I might not go as far as to say that the web is creating slavery, some of the points made in the movie from Josh Harris are compelling. Think of this movie as a physical representation of the Internet (Or TV, a little bit of both). People are put in pods (their rooms) where everything they do is on a channel. People had no privacy and in a short time their personalities changed, this aspect of constant surveillance (anybody can watch anybody) creates problems for the human brain and how we deal with our own social problems. If that one aspect of the technology was removed though, would it be slavery? Who knows, it's really up to you. ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"As someone who lived and worked all the way through the entire rise of the Internet, in the heart of the whole thing (Silicon Valley), I can say without any doubt that the only thing this \\"documentary\\" shows is how little NYC had to do with anything related to the Internet.This terrible waste of time has just about the most horrendous editing you will ever see, made worse by the fact that the creators probably thought they were being artistic, when in fact it's just embarrassingly bad attempt.The content and subjects of the movie can be described in the same way.The movie in 50 words or less:Guy makes money selling an IRC client in the 90s. Noobs call him genius. No one else notices. Some time passes. A warehouse is filled with attention whore do-anything-for-fame types. They have sex and poop in front of cameras.

I was really disappointed in this one, however, because large chunks of the plot are borrowed wholesale from Georgetter Heyer's The Unknown Ajax. Although Camp is good, Heyer is great. If you want to read a *really* good yarn about that includes a young man over his head in a local smuggling ring, try The Unknown Ajax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the heroine in Indiscreet","review":"The plot of Indiscreet was interesting, but the heroine was hard to like-- too disagreeable, too petulant, too distrusting, too argumentative. All the while I was reading, I felt so sorry for the hero, thinking that I wish he could find a better mate than this woman, that he could find someone who would be more enjoyable to be around than this heroine was. Yikes, she was terrible. The only time I liked her was at the beginning of the book when she was drunk .At that time she was humorous, witty, clever, easy to get along with--very likeable. Too bad she didn't stay sloshed throughout the book; that way at least then I could understand why the hero would fall in love with her. Sober, she is just too hard to get along with. I enjoyed the heroine in my favorite Candace Camp book, Suddenly, more than this one because even though the heroine in Suddenly is much younger, she is much more mature and much more kindhearted than this one in Indiscreet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to elementary","review":"Perhaps this would be a good book for a first-time programmer, I don't know.

This book was made for \\"programmers\\" who are beginner in C# programming. Do you guys get the nuance? If you are TOTALLY new in programming trust me this book is not worth at all.

I only found Destroying Constructors and Delegates, Events chapter to be a bit more difficult but on the whole the book is a treat. I have already bought his book Programming C# third edition also for adavanced programming. Best part I forgot to say is that Jesse personally answers to all your queries which is really handful.

In fact, they did a beautiful version of Uncle Tupelo's \\"Gun\\" on the the Uncle Tupelo Tribute Album, FOR ANYONE THATS LISTENING.The bonus tracks are a welcomed addition. These songs are of the same high caliber as the original album, full of insightful lyrics and gorgeous melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find","review":"Why has no one heard of Sixty Acres? They sure could have used better promotion! I found them here on Amazon and took a chance and bought Banjos and Sunshine. This is one great CD. I am a big fan of Uncle Tupelo, Sun Volt, Drive-by Truckers, Bottle Rockets, Alejandro Escovedo, etc. This album by Sixty Acres ranks right up there with some of the best alt. country albums I've heard. Almost every song here is good stuff.

As far as I'm concerned, that's pretty high praise! This is particularly evident in song #2 on the disk, \\"Me or Him\\" but can also be heard on other songs.. The lyrics and sound are catchy, the more you listen to this CD the more you appreciate it. I think that their sound is still developing but it's definately going in the right direction. This type of sound is poised to explode this summer with Wilco and Sun Volt both signed on as opening bands for major tours. Sixty Acres could find themselves gaining quite a bit of exposure in a realitivly short time. I also recommend seeing this band live if you have the chance! They have developed some outstanding songs since this CD was released so you won't simply find yourself listening to a regurgitation of this CD.

The sellers obviously think it is intuitive, it isn't. The simple instructions are \\"Before putting your pants on, fasten this belt around your waist and over your shirt.\\" Now when you first look at it you think, how the heck does this fasten? Take my word for it, you won't be happy with the instructions. It seems the small ends of the metal pieces get forced through a hole on the opposing ends and both metal pieces should be secured as just one slips off easily. The 2 cents that it would have taken to confirm this by including a brief diagram would have been nice. If you try to stretch the hole over one of the large ends, you will damage the belt. It does work reasonably well but it does feel odd at first.Now lets talk about $7.95 shipping which is a total rip off.

Starting with an engaging premise - the author worked with the Chair of the Psychology Dept. at Sonoma State University to create a profile based on Zodiac's letters to various newspapers - Michael Kelleher proceeds to swamp his book with potboiler-level prose. The psychologist, David Van Nuys' analyses maintain a degree of detachment that I appreciate with this sort of book, but his conclusions don't aid in understanding of the case or its perpetrator. Most of Van Nuys' conclusions seem facile, on the order of \\"He must have had a terrible childhood. Perhaps he was abused. He had great rage toward women and fear of male authority figures\\". In the end, though interesting, the book doesn't add anything to the literature about the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculation vs. Insight","review":"Although this book does a fair job of representing the facts in the case, it is still filled with glaring errors that any real Zodiac investigator can spot in a heartbeat.

The author labors a little too hard to immitate Hunter Thompson's Gonzo Journalism style. I simply don't believe some of his escapades. Most disturbing is the author's comparison of Israelis to Nazis while he discusses Iraq's raining of scud missles on civilians in Tel Aviv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and void of history","review":"Mr. Roberts, for a man who supposedly spend time in Iraq, seems to be oblivious to historical facts all for the sake of being cynical and cute. I found his writing absolutely on a very low level. His writing ability reminds me of some of the pathetic attempts by some of our great authors of the 60's. They were so engrossed in smashing people in the mouth with their political beliefs and disgust with America that the rest of the sheep on our campuses would embrace such nonsense as being scholarly and thought provoking. Roberts wants to review this very serious situation in Iraq as sort of a \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" while discussing butchery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Somewhat Funny Leftist Screed","review":"This is my second attempt to review this book. The first was never posted. I don't know why because I didn't violate any of Amazon's guidelines.Anyway, the Demonic Comedy is at times a witty book. Unfortunately, it is also a flat out screaming attack against the \\"evil\\" West with the United States standing above the pack as villain number one.I was very disappointed with this book. I felt the author made excessive fun of the difficulty his Arab friends had with English to the point where it was difficult to read parts of the book. I was also put off by his use of bizarre anti-Gulf War quotations (most by extrremist feminists with a rather peculiar outlook on life).Don't buy this book. I returned my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterstroke of gonzo-wartime journalism.","review":"Robert's gem is a rare look at a horrific world that most of us have only glimpsed behind the muted green lens of night vision camera work. Instead of the usual talking heads who have been regulated to a rooftop to photograph anti-aircraft fire, we are privy to some of the cruel and ridiculous inner workings of Iraq. Combining humor with raw fact, Roberts is also adept at giving names, and personalities to a people who usually end up as faceless statistics. Next time though, sombody better get this guy a flack vest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cause for laughter; cause for tears. An excellent read.","review":"Roberts takes an approach to Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi political structure similar to the way Hunter S. Thompson went after Nixon. A definitive compliment. However, he wrongly treats Hussein, his secret police and military like a bunch of largely inept, malicious buffoons. This is a dangerous impression to leave the reader with. While undeniably funny and thereby enjoyable, Roberts appears to avoid taking into account Saddam's not inconsiderable intelligence. He may not have been a soldier but he is a crafty SOB, cold-hearted and utterly ruthless. The work gives a winning account of a general Arab mindset, while showing how distressingly uninformed the Iraqi people are about the world beyond their borders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy reading, but worth it","review":"For anyone who seeks to live a more spiritual life, to evolve their soul on the path to the one, I'd recommend you read The Twelve Blessings.

When you do, you will understand why we are here in this life in this dimension."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best...","review":"After reading this e-version, you may end up wanting to get a hard copy for your library! By far, hands down, this is one of the greatest spiritual texts I have ever read, and re-read, and re-read. I've spent many years searching for spiritual truths through different tradition and religions, coming across great texts like the Tao Te Ching, the Bhaghavad Gita, the Upanishads, the Dhammapada, etc. But there's something very unique about this book... And not only does it contain great teaching, written in a beautifulyl poetic way, it contains a powerful spiritual practice that anyone can use to be of service to others. Highly recommend this book to any sincere spiritual seeker of any or no particular faith (this book transcends all religions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Very Disappointed it was way smaller then you would think, I wouldnt even give it one star. :( The entire thing not just the size is disappointing, cant see one thing I would give it a star for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile!","review":"I bought a pair of these a while back and was disapointed.

Wambaugh's strength lies in his sharp, cynical, sarcastic and blackly humerous use of language. I laughed out loud at his witty and dark brand of humor. His command of the English language and cynical look at Americana seen through the eyes of cops and robbers is worth the price of admission alone. This novel works mostly through his style, and the plot is greatly enhanced through his wordplay. I learned more about Americas Cup racing than I ever wanted to know, yet was never bored throughout \\"Floaters\\". A lesser writer might not have been able to make such a plot work, since the finale is laced with coincedence and irony, yet Wambaugh's style more than makes up for any potentially lame plot twists. This is not to say that the plot is poor or predictable; it's neither. But the fact is that few writers would be able to pull off such a tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit for Wambaugh!","review":"As an avid Wambaugh fan, I was again drawn into this book.

Alice suddenly finds herself transported to 1998 Manchester and becomes the prime suspect in the Jigsaw Murders, as she tries to gather the pieces and find her way back home to her own time and reality. As she is escorted on her journey by Celia, an automated version of herself, she makes the acquaintance of many strange creatures, all suffering from Newmonia (not to be mistaken for pneumonia). In true Carroll fashion, Noon uses crazy wordplay throughout often confusing not only the fictitious characters, but the unsuspecting reader as well.

On this CD however, the approach taken on many of these pieces seems to defy the spirit of the youthful Beethoven. Beethoven was a virtuoso in his early days and it is hard to imagine the young fiery pianist taking the pieces of Opus 2 at the extremely slow tempo's Gould selects here. Any other performer (Brendel, Goode, A. Fischer) will give you a better representative performance of these pieces. Too make matters worse, when playing the Moonlight sonata Movement one, Gould decides to rush things! I must state again, I love Gould overall but he does not do these pieces justice here in regards to the composers intentions. Also, there are no liner notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gould should stick with Bach","review":"Glenn Gould's rendition of these great works are, to say the least, unconventional.

If you want a good recording of the beethoven piano sonatas this one isn't it. Try Alfred Brendel, Wilhelm Kempff, Daniel Barenboim, or get Jeno Jando's recording with Naxos for a great deal.

It can be used to transfer data, as well as play music, and it has voice recording and an FM tuner. My one complaint is the lack of playlists; to group songs, they must be in folders on the file system, making putting a song in multiple playlists a pain. Although the screen is small, it can still display all the essential information. It can hold a lot of music if you use the included Creative Audio Converter to convert to a lower bit rate (I use 64 kbps MP3). Oh, and it can't read ID3v2.2 tags (what iTunes uses) so if you use iTunes, your song titles may not display correctly; instead, the filenames will be displayed. Also, the limited file format support is a downside (supports MP3, WAV (not a good idea), and some WMA (not protected)). Overall, a great player, but definately not in the same class as the Apple iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I regret to say that this \\"slim stylish player\\" is the most disappointing electronic purchase I have ever made (and I've made a lot, trust me). In the two days I've had this, the file system has become corrupted twice, requiring me to re-install the drivers and update the firmware multiple times. Unfortunately, nothing has worked, and Creative's Support Site is worthless, since this item has not yet been added to the knowledge base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"Didn't work when I got it. The files sytem is fine so can be used as an expensive flash memory. The lithium battery is changed so it is not the battery.

This MuVo goes on the bone pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even one full song!","review":"I boght this a month ago and it was horrible! After i listened to one song it just crashed!

It was a waste of $150 dollars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give zero stars I would","review":"I am a long-time listener/viewer/collector of all things jazz. This is, by far , the worst jazz video out there. I am not going to waste my time even giving you the details on this why I think this way. I was suckered in on this video -hoping for the best. Don't make the same mistake that I did. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alerted Too Late","review":"Wish I read the customer reviews before I wasted money on this dawg!

There are no musical performances on this disc. Just a bunch of people talking about the history of the festival.

This was a true disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOCUMENTARY WITHOUT JAZZ MUSIC","review":"Seeing this documentary was a complete disapoitment.I was expecting to see live performances of the jazz artists that are shown in the dvd cover, but felt like a complete idiot when I didn't hear a single note of music. I think that they should mention that there's no music in the disc.It was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste Of Money","review":"This disc was a monumental disappointment. I was expecting not only great live clips, but also some good structured commentary. Instead, this disc is packed with short, unrevealing clips and weak, poorly scripted commentary. This is one DVD I really regret buying--and that says a lot for me. Seeing Jon Hendricks as a guest lecturer in a jazz history class at my University was more interesting than the footage they provided of him on this disc. What a TOTAL waste of money and time. Stay away from this DVD if you can help it. For a much better example of what a jazz performance/documentary should be like, check out Monk's \\"Straight No Chaser\\", available on both VHS and DVD. Cheaper and a much better way to spend your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let me rate this ZERO!","review":"Just want to add my two bits as a warning to anyone who may not have got the point from the other reviewers (unlikely). Thia can only have been some kind of ego trip for Clint - it doesn't score as either a jazz performance compilation or as a documentary of the festival.What hurts - heartbreakingly, gutbustingly hurts - is that there ARE hours of performance footage extant from Monterey (and, no, I don't mean 2 minutes of Cannonball in \\"Play Misty For Me\\"). Surely someone could buy the rights to this stuff and make a REAL Monterey DVD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL JIVE (...)","review":"NO STARS!!This review will be totally redundant as it's all been said but I'm actually enjoying joining in trashing this bogus pomp more than watching it! Sure wish I had read just a couple of these reviews (the first all negative reviews I've seen on a topic I'm interested in)before I picked this turkey up. A lot of very uninteresting, boring, behind the scenes stuff that drags on forever! It says \\"vintage performances\\" HA! A few seconds of footage with elevator \\"jazz\\" instead of what you're glimpsing. It also says \\"And What about Ella, Louis, Dizzy, Sarah, Dave, Monk, Clark Terry even Lady Day?\\" THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW CLINT.

It happened to be the first DVD I ever bought - what a nightmare! Not how one should start off their collection. It's trash. Not worth the money it's printed on. To be honest, it sounds more like a sales pitch for the festival than an actual documentary - it tries to get you \\"excited\\" about what you'll watch. I ended up FF through it waiting to see some live songs - nothing....AVOID at all costs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint Eastwood should be ashamed!","review":"Clint Eastwood should be ashamed to have executive produced such a piece of garbage. The other reviews are on the money.

If you're looking to hear some good Jazz, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it were possible to give this DVD 0 stars","review":"I echo everyone else's sentiments about this DVD. It's notfor Jazz fans. I don't know who the intended audience is. But ifyou're expecting to see some complete performances from this legendary festival, look elsewhere. If you want informative commentary about the music, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception at it's best","review":"The title is very misleading.

The surface is soft enough to protect my cutlery, and after hundreds of trips through the dishwasher, the rubber is still tacky and no worse for wear. My only complaint is that the large handles make the board harder to store and wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control","review":"I bought two of these and they were both warped.Here's why the warp matters...If you lay it warp up, juices run off of it. If you lay it warp down so juices don't run off, the rubber ends don't contact the counter and it just slips and spins.I would say buying one and expecting it to be made right is a gamble."},{"rating":"2","title":"My go-to cutting boards","review":"I have several of the Oneida cutting boards, including the tiny one. They are so handy, I use one and when/if necessary I put it in the dishwasher and get a clean one. Both sides can be used, the soft handles prevent slipping, they are soft enough for knives, but no deep gouges (but then, I don't use a cleaver). I have a set of flexible mat cutting surfaces that are nice for various things besides cutting, but they move around and the Oneida are easier to handle. I have a magazine file storage box that I keep them in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Size","review":"This is the perfect size cutting board for small projects like salads when slicing tomatoes and cucumbers.

I don't care what anyone tells me, what name brand is supposed to be the best/most comfortable - I have NOT found ANY shoe with a heel (regardless of height) that is comfortable when standing all day.(I am only 5 foot tall so I really want shoe with a heel if possible) These pads did make one pair of boots \\"less\\" painful but I still couldn't wear them all day.

Their website advises you to \\"Place in shoes, green side up just behind the ball of foot. Trim with scissors if necessary.\\" That's it. If that's enough info for you to use this product correctly then maybe these are for you. Spenco, would putting a simple diagram up on your website kill you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"was not pleased with the Spenco pads","review":"I wasn't real pleased with these pads. There were no instructions as to how they were to be inserted in the shoe and in fact I felt the pain in my foot was worse. When I took my 4 mile walk, I had to stop twice, once to adjust the pad and after about 3 miles, had to finally remove the pad.

These things are a godsend. They are well built, they stay in my Red Wing boots without moving and you can tell they will last a long time. I no longer have the ball of foot pain that I had, now its just my back pain I have to deal with :).I am getting a second pair for my tennis shoes for the long walks in the mall.

His music finds a way into your heart and carries you off on a romantic and sweet journey of the mind. Each song on this album is deeply moving and seems to be able to affect the senses. My favorite piece off this album is Rocky Mountain Peace. With his amazing ability, Richard Carr managed to capture and put to music, the serene feeling of being in the Rocky Mountains.

She soon discovers her true identity and the love she has longed for, although he's not exactly what she planed seeing as he's a little dead. She also finds out a little more about Robert, her boyfriend of more than three years, and his family's gruesome history.This story has more mystery and suspense in it than a Ouija board. It's suited for readers, who liked the movie Ghost, seeing as it's in that haunting love format. Overall I loved this book, and I hope you will to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give negative stars for my rating","review":"I can't believe that there are two high reviews for this mess. At first I thought that it couldn't be the same book, but then I read the reviews and realized that it was the same. I am now dumber for having read this. It is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. The plot was lame, the ghost wasn't scary, and the main character was so annoying I was wishing the ghost would throw her out of the third floor window and put us all out of our misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks plot and depth","review":"This book was highly rated so I got it. I was disappointed in the fact it was a short read first of all. Secondly, the plot is truly lacking when you never really experience any true paranormal romance. There is no interaction in this book that spells L O V E. The encounters between the leading female and the paranormal male just do not exist. Thirdly, the ending was horrible. The book left me asking why did I get this and where is the actual book I bought? This is more like a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful and handy","review":"It's great to carry around and study. Also awesome for reviewing if you don't want to go through your piles of notes and books. Just pull this out and flip it open to what you want to look at.

Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaplans are better","review":"I just got these and they are so confusing. Our Anatomy class book's chapters are broken down by system. These cards are broken down by location, i.e. head, neck, etc. Even The Anatomy Coloring book is better since it's also broken down by system, i.e. muscles, nerves, etc. The Netter flash cards don't even have anything on anatomical planes, sections or directions. That stuff is the most basic stuff that is taught in every beginning anatomy class!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good investment","review":"If you have a gross anatomy lab where you are identifying prosected cadavers there is no better way to study than sight recognition. The cards were however slightly incomplete with some of the more specific structures mentioned in the text, not specifically mentioned in the note cards.

Sufficient for first year of medical/graduate school anatomy but probably not beyond.Blessings!Joshua"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but missing some pieces","review":"Good for visual breakdown of regions and layers.

It was a year's worth of A&P; in one semester. Each half (A&P; I and A&P; II) was 8 weeks, so you can imagine how quickly it went. I did very well in the class, and these cards helped a lot. The detail of the drawings is exquisite. We had a cadaver lab and I had no problem identifying things on the cadaver even though I primarily studied the Netter cards. We also used models and our table had a terrible time getting a hold of the good models--as in, half the models we never even got a chance to see before the test--and I was able to get through without a problem using the cards.I highly recommend these cards. I purchased a couple other references--a coloring book and an atlas--and I ended up using only these."},{"rating":"2","title":"great flashcards","review":"great flashcards. nice way to review pictures from netter's atlas when you are on the road. not comprehensive (not all the plates/structures included) but includes a pretty decent selection from the netter's atlas. also, the online student consult makes it easy to study flash cards when you want to use just your computer to study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy Flash Cards","review":"These are very good cards to have for human physiology as well as anatomy. Very detailed though. Maybe more detail than needed but still a very handy thing to have for memorization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Study Tool","review":"These flash cards are so great in studying for anatomy exams. Its easy enough to make flash cards about the functions of the organs of the body and say what they are near. However there just isn't enough time to draw notecards yourself, nor does any med student want to be carrying around a netter's text book with them all day if they get a moment to study. And the best part is it comes with this handy ring so can keep all the cards in order and so you can take them in an organized fashion wherever you go. I highly recommend this product to anyone who's a notecard studier. You will definitely get your money's worth with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gross Review","review":"These are great for review in Gross Anatomy. The back of the cards describe origins, insertions, actions, and innervation of muscles. The only problem is that they don't include blood supplies, but that's easy to write in. This is a great resource! I can throw them in my purse and study anytime I have a few extra minutes (yeah, I know, pretty dorky, but helpful)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must","review":"A copy of big Moore, the BRS Anatomy book, Netter's Flash Cards, and a photo atlas will see you through any med school anatomy class in good form. An actual atlas is optional. It's a good lifetime reference, but with Gray's Anatomy images on Wikipedia you can find answers to \\"where is it\\" questions faster than in a print atlas.The flash cards are very high yield. They are focused on the key points, but more importantly they are so easy to have with you all the time. They are a great way to turn 5 mins into productive time. Clear categorization and coding in the box makes selecting the relevant cards easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anatomy cards","review":"I didn't think this set was very informative.

A variety of attachments are available from multiple vendors. For years, this has been the one of the best personal masasgers and, today, remains so. Although the best, I do have a future wish list for this venerable product: add additional variable speed settings; have a European / US automatic built in transformer; and make a rechargeable version to avoid getting tangled in cords and having to find an electric outlet. And, what happened to their small Hitachi Mini Massager, a mini unit, that does not appear to now be available?

I use it after I get back from the gym and it really helps relieve sore muscles. Also great for if I got a kink in my neck or back. Really strong and penetrates deep tissue. That being said...It is WAY too strong to be used a *coughs* vibrator. It feels like someone hooked up a car battery to your girly bits and then turned on the amps. It actually makes me go numb and itch terribly. The only passable way to enjoy that aspect of the wand is to put socks or something over the bulb. Too strong for me, but perhaps others like the electric voltage this thing pumps out. Rather unsexy and can make any romantic moment awkward if not properly introduced.Totally reccommend this massager as just that: a massager. If you buy it to massage sore muscles south of the boarder, beware. South of the boarder might become numb like the north pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be great, but not anymore","review":"I've always loved the Hitachi Magic Wand. After about 6 years of use, my old faithful died on me. I immediately over-nighted this puppy only to be greatly disappointed. It stopped working after the second use. Thankfully Amazon refunded me without the embarrassment of having to send it back. Then I ordered another one, thinking maybe I had just ordered a lemon the last time around but the new one lost power during use and didn't get the job done. I was greatly disappointed. The new wands were more light weight and they seemed cheaply made compared to my old, original wand. I will not use Hitachi anymore and I won't risk paying for another non working wand. Instead, I headed on over to the mall and stopped in at Brookstone and purchased the Brookstone personal massager. It was 80 bucks and ladies!!! OMG!! I found my new best friend. My husband is so relieved...Buy this instead:Personal Massager"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this product","review":"This product isn't worth the money.

Well, I've tried with it a few times, and usually I feel for a few seconds like something's happening, but then nothing happens beyond that (I sometimes get tense and that stops the feeling, or I pull away sometimes, to be fair...but sometimes I try to relax and it still stops).

We'll keep it, because we can use for neck massages."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 strikes, you're out","review":"Three times it worked. After the 2nd time, the slow speed stopped working.

I don't think amazon would post that, right? well, this is an awesome vibrator -- strong and fantastic, and it plugs in, so you'll never have to go running for batteries while working on your 13th consecutive O. It's got 2 speeds, both very powerful, just at different frequencies. I HIGHLY recommend it. An excellent birthday or Kwanzaa gift for that special lady in your life.

After purchasing two other sex enhancers totalling in the near $300 range without results matching the hype we decided to go with the less expensive alternative since it was so highly reviewed on amazon. We were not disappointed! It consistently made her body do things we never thought were possible, shocking both of us. She enjoys using it solo when I'm not available and it works great as for us during our more intimate activities because of its larger surface area. Clean up is easy and we never mind the length of the cord/noise. It's all more than worth it, especially for the price. Even if it died we would immediately order another. Take the risk! At the very least you'll have something for your sore back muscles right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"They weren't lying when they called this the \\"magic wand\\"! It is amazing and very fun for my fiance and I to use in the bedroom. Try this once, and you'll always want to have it. We've had it for over 2 years now, and it's as good as new. The vibrations are just as strong as they were when it came out of the box. Don't let the plug deter you from buying it. This is great to use with a partner or by yourself.

The packaging is a little different, the massager looks a little different, and as far as results--let me just say, the old one worked, but the new one WORKS WONDERS! It feels so much better, especially on the high setting. The high setting on Amazon's vibrator was just this teeth-rattling, annoying buzz. The high setting on my new one is this very smooth but intense hum, like the engine of a high-end sports car.Healthy and Active was selling these on Amazon when I bought mine. I have no clue who Vibratex is, but my suggestion would be, if you're going to pay this much for a vibrator, pay the extra 10, 15 bucks and get the real thing. It makes a difference![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and cheaply made","review":"This vibrator stopped working after less than 2 months.

It appears Hitachi has done a \\"bate and switch\\" on us !!!!Same model but with inferior parts !What a RIP OFF !!!! Please don't support companies that do things like this !They now want $54 for this piece of junk, they are barely worth 54 cents, OK maybe they are worth 54 cent if you buy like 10 of them,so as they wear out very quickly, you will have plenty of spears !

But when I put an attachment on it, the whole thing started rattling and got very loud. The motor in this thing is a beast and needs to be held down better. First I wrapped the whole thing in 3M tape, then installed two hose clamps an inch from the top of the wand and then wrapped 3M tape around them again. It tightend up the motor so it wouldn't vibrate in its cradle. This made the wand sound almost exactally the same as it did without the attachments. You can finish the entire wand and cord with tape for a better look as the white will eventually get dirty and fade to yellow anyways. The hose clamp knobs can act as finger grips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for my wife....","review":"and she couldn't be happier. It has plenty of power and never runs out of batteries.

It makes one wonder who's writing them and what their interest is in leading people like my wife and I to purchase this junk. We've bought two of the Hitachi Magic Wands in the last 6 months. They were used primarily for my wife to massage Biofreeze into my bad back. We've also bought some adult attachments to have some fun with.The first Magic Wand literally shorted out with a yellow electrical pop & flash and quit. The burn marks on the inside of the Magic Wand were visible from the outside. We've had the second Magic Wand about a month and a half. It quit today without any sign of a problem and won't work at all.So, we'll be looking elsewhere for a new massager that might last a while. We expected better from a company like Hitachi. Again, what a piece of junk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, it lasted a whole day.

After this I bought one that lasted a little over a year and in the last year I've bought two...each one failing in less time than the last. I don't use it heavily nor has my usage changed over this time. When I've turned them on the motor runs and you hear loud clanging but there is no motion. Considering that each one of these suckers costs half a grand, they aren't the cheapest things to replace and in this economy I can't afford to do so anymore. If they were still producing the quality product that they did a few years ago I would recommend it. As it is, I'd recommend that you spend your money on something built to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake magic wand -- ripoff alert","review":"Two clues right away alerted me that this device was not an actual Hitachi Magic Wand. First, the power switch itself is a three position switch with indicators for off, high and low debossed in the plastic. However, the taped on decal around the switch showed the middle position as off and high and low at opposite positions. Second, Hitachi Magic Wands are powerful vibrators. The vibrator I received was no more powerful than any other vibrator I have.But the deal killer -- and warning -- is that the product quite working after just four uses.

The attachment especially was a bit daunting. I took it out of the box and said to myself, \\"My God, it's HUGE.\\" But let me tell you, this bad boy gets the job done. It is hours (or minutes) of fun--depending on how long you have and it delivers in the power department.

The Hitachi gets me off, but I must admit I miss the perfect bumps. I must admit that I have been terribly spoiled by these two massagers. Sooo good.

I finally decided to pay a little extra for something that was supposed to be AMAZING! I saw how many 5-star reviews it got on Amazon, and I thought I couldn't go wrong. Wrong. I bought it almost 10 months ago, but found that it was numbing me b/c it was so powerful, so I stashed it away after a couple uses and went back to other toys. I decided to give it another go a couple months ago, and it didn't take too long 'til I figured out how to make it work for me. I enjoyed it, except that it would get hot. Eventually, it started to get really hot after just a few minutes of use. Yesterday, I turned it on after using it the day before, and it makes noise, but it doesn't vibrate. It's not worth it, and I'm not going to recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!","review":"This item broke after about 20 uses,but never worked good..If your wanting something for sore muscles, this isn't the one to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best massager ever","review":"This massager went beyond expectations in a very good way.

The massage head is hard and uncomfortable, and the cord is not long enough, unless you are going to sit right next to the plug, or use an extension cord. What a pain. Why not just make it longer?I tried it, and I had it running for about five minutes, and it got so hot that I had to turn it off.When I contacted Amazon, they said it was non-returnable, BUT they were going to refund my money given the circumstances. I can see why it's not returnable, but if there is an obvious defect that should be taken into account. Yay Amazon for seeing that! Thank you so much.

I would recomend to any woman who needs a REALY GOOD orgasim. It normaly takes me a while. This thing had me going in less than 8 mins, followed by 2 more, 3mins apart!! It only has hi and low. Hi is just way to strong, low is better for me. It is a bit loud, so make sure the house is empty! It is also a bit heavy compared to other sex toys i have. The money however, was well worth it, with free shipping! I debatied for a while if i should spend the money and get one. I am SOOOO happy i did!! Wow, what i have been missing!! Just buy one! It's FUN to have or use with a partner too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first but cord will fail","review":"I have used this massager extensively, and while it is high powered and works well the plastic around the cord always seems to break down, exposing the wires, which either leads to a blown circuit or small shocks to the skin.

But I really didn't want to get one off a toy site due to credit card statements (didn't want it to say what it was). Once I saw it was on Amazon, I decided to get it because it is packaged and charged as any other item would be. I received mine yesterday and had to write a review right away.On to the performance: OH. MY. GOSH. Having owned 2 other battery operated vibrators, I didn't think this would be much different. I was wrong. At the cost of a little more noise (not even that much louder), the orgasms are much more intense- stronger and longer-- and quicker- within minutes I had multiple orgasms. There are 2 speeds and I find even the low to be a bit strong but if you put a towel or something in between, it's absolutely perfect. I definitely recommend purchasing a Hitachi Magic Wand- all the reviews are right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitachi strives for perfection","review":"The weight of the product is just about right, it's easy to handle (and ideal length),and the motor isn't annoyingly loud.

For my it's usually 5 minutes tops. Amazing.However, it's frustrating that it's not more convenient in terms of design. It's big and clunky, and requires to be plugged in to an outlet. As a result, it can only be used in certain places in the home (near an outlet), it's bulky and not convenient for travel (although much needed for those long nights on the road), and it is quite large in size similar to a big microphone (so it doesn't hide very well in your bedside drawer!)I took one look at this and balked at the size/visual appearance and wanted to return it. My husband coaxed me to just try it once... so I did... and it was instantly my best friend (despite being an ugly, clunky best friend). So despite its visual flaws I would highly recommend it - it gets the job done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Very dissapointed.

Has anyone else felt it is not strong enough?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It kinda makes me itch like crazy","review":"My girl friend bought this cause she loves it. She let me try it but I don't have anything good to say about it. I really love strong vibrating toys and I can usually orgasm within a couple minutes with a strong vibrating toy.

I tried to fix it but couldn' t. The metal spring just out of the blue just snaps out of place and no longer the motor causes the head to vibrate.

Conical burr grinders are high performing grinders for true coffee connoisseurs.

We have had the Capresso for only about six months. It began jamming and failing to complete a grind cycle after two months. This was at middle grind settings. We have diassembled the Capresso numerous times for cleaning but the jamming has progressively become worse. Also, from the beginning it produced excess static which results in a cloud of coffee dust being ejected from the bin when the bin is removed after grinding. The Cuisinart worked much better for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply flawed grinder not worth the hassle","review":"This grinder is a piece of junk. Stainless exterior looks nice, but the rest is chintzy-feeling plastic. While grinding, makes an unappealing uneven noise. Worse, even when the hopper is mostly full, sometimes the beans stop falling through and the motor goes into a high whine. You have to bang the side to jostle beans to fall back into the chute, and by that time, you aren't ending up with your usual amount of grounds. Finally, the grounds fall not only into the cheap plastic container, but all over the exterior of it too! This means ground coffee gets all over your counter, no matter what. Every single time you remove the container of ground coffee, it strews some on your counter. Adding insult to injury, my motor broke after only four months. But I haven't gotten around to dealing with trying to get warranty service yet, since I am not really sure I even want this junky thing anymore. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clean Your Kitchen After Every Use","review":"While it grinds coffee decently, this is the messiest appliance in history, requiring me to pull out the vacuum every time I use it. Coffee particles literally spray across your counter as the grinder operates. After grinding, removal of the receptacle canister sets off a static explosion where grindings fly to every region of your kitchen. Seriously, it is almost like a bad joke every time I use this thing. Grinds go EVERYWHERE. I got this as a gift and it pains me to think that my friend spent so much on this thing. The company should be ashamed of the design flaws that cause it to operate the way it does. Oh yes, it will grind coffee... but the instant, substantial mess makes this thing unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only looks good","review":"IT only looks good! this thing has never worked right! On the first grind, the motor sounded like it was going into high gear, had to stand there and adjust the grinder switch so the beans would go into the grind wheel. Then, a couple weeks later, had to stand and hold the the lid as well as turn the grind switch back and forth. after the third week, it stopped working because the shoot clogged. found the little cleaning brush was a joke, I couldn't even get it in to the jamb-packed, clogged shoot. after 20 min of unsuccessful attempt I used my air compressor. Have to unclog it with my air compressor every three weeks. So if you don't mind blowing coffee all over you from you air compressor - buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot grind espresso to save it's life","review":"worked great on french press and drip coffee...but where the grind actually counts, on espresso, it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad...I returned it immediately","review":"This grinder is really nice looking and the price was right, so I was looking forward to incorporating it into my life. But it kept turning itself off until my husband figured out that you could stand over it, pushing the cover down to keep it going. It wasn't because we had not put the top on properly--it needed the extra pressure. I don't know if it was a defect in our unit or in the design but I suspect the design.And the grind settings were way off. We had to use the finest setting all the time and even then, the grind was a mix of crumbs and flakes. Sad! You might as well have a $19 blade grinder.After dropping it off at the post office we went to Starbucks and bought their burr grinder for $88.

What I didn't anticipate was that the grinder would clog at the shoot where the coffee goes into the plastic grind container below. Now this really sucks because there is no real easy way to clean the shoot. I usually resort to using a thin butterknife for a little while then when I get the major jam out, I use my can of compressed air to blow out the remaining grinds. This really is dirty because when you do that, grinds blow all over the place. Also, what I hate is that when you take out the container cup, when the grinder is working, static electricity makes the grinds blow all over your counter. I end up banging the container on my counter a few time just to minimize, not eliminate, this situation.I would never buy this or another product by this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Stainless or Straight-Through","review":"I bought this grinder for my wife who likes extra fine grind and she was tired of holding the button on our current burr grinder and wanted an automatic shutoff. The straight-through sounded good as our current Salton grinder would accumulate grinds on the side shoot and had to be cleaned regularly. Stainless sounded even better.When I received the grinder I looked at the parts and it looked like any other grinder. The stainless part is the BACK COVER and has nothing to do with performance. Then I pulled out the grind container and found that not only is it not straight through but has an extra bent tube that routes the grinds out the side of the grinder and down into the the container. If the direct side outlet clogs, this will clog even more.I never even tried it, but sent it back. Total misrepresentation by Capresso!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad grinder","review":"This is a badly designed machine. It clogs up and there is nothing more fun than spending 30 minutes first thing in the morning struggling to get it unclogged before I can make coffee. The design is such that I end up with coffee all over the place. The grind was uneven and bad. This machine finally stopped working at all, not that I really cared anymore at that point. I threw it away and got my old little grinder back out. Do not buy this - it is trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Performer","review":"The Model 556 unit is a great disappointment. Regardless of grind setting it spits out chuncks of bean 1/8 inch or larger as part of grind. No consistency and NO fine grind (for those who think I am unable to read directions, I do have a Masters in Physics!). Observing the effect of the 1 - 9 grind setting feature indicates it has NO effect on distance between the burr top or bottom burr grinder heads so there is no way it will change grind (perhaps mine is defective).

Well, I guess I spoke too early. Soon after writing the review, a problem showed up. I could watch movies in widescreen mode, but when I changed it to 4:3, there were vertical green lines all over the screen. Tried adjusting all settings, but no change. I could still watch movies in widescreen with no problems, but this unit wasn't worth keeping if it wasn't fully functioning. I tried e-mailing & calling AcomData... talk about customer service, or the lack of that is. And when they finally did respond, via e-mail, they said that they have never had such happen and they couldn't duplicate the problem. Oh well, I returned the unit anyways...

The first is that he doesn't take the time to explain key programming concepts in depth.

Now the romance side, well, I am a guy, but even I could see that the action between the two protagonists got a litte too mushy a bit too fast, especially considering their past relationship.

The genuine leather band is very comfortable, easy to put on and take off, and is adjustable to fit any wrist. The black leather with white stitching is also very nice looking. However, my favorite part of this watch is that it's made entirely of stainless-steel, very durable. I also love the design of the dial itself.

Ct.","review":"Fascinating account of the current make-up of the Supreme Court. Mr. Lazurus' perspective and ability to write make this a book I just could not put down. The most difficult aspect of this book is that many of our lofty ideals about the Court are destroyed as Mr. Lazurus uncovers the political agendas of the Justices and the ideological basis of their appointments. I fear for the future of Individual rights as clearly the Court's interpretation of Constitutional values is much narrower and less comprehensive as most of us have come to expect. A must read book for lawyers and other interested in the Constitution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice insider look at the Court.","review":"Lazarus breaks with tradition at substantial risk to his reputation to divuldge important insights about his time at the Court as a clerk to Justice Blackmun. The stories are well told and understandable, even for a non-lawyer, but the detail and seeming embellishment of some of the accounts leaves one wondering just how genuine Lazarus's insights might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"An expose' on how the \\"High Nine\\" dispense (in?)justice.","review":"While in law school, I spent a short time as an extern law clerk for the chief justice of a state supreme court. Contrary to David Garrow's (New York Times) debunking of Lazarus' experience, I found it to be right on point--at least as far as the basic operation of a supreme court goes. Readers will be appropriately shocked to learn that this \\"court of last resort\\" is not interested in the outcome of a case as it pertains to the individual parties' constitutional rights; rather, it's the legal principles that an individual's case might be used as a vehicle for the current court to make changes in the law. This book will accurately alert the reader to some \\"unhealthy\\" Court practices that ultimately can--and already have affected every individual's rights in the country. The book is easy to read, although the pace is somewhat slower than necessary in some parts.DO read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Informative","review":"The inside workings of perhaps one of the least understood branches of government is like a breath of fresh air. I just finished reading \\"From Trial Court to the United States Supreme Court\\" which should be a companion book for anyone reading this worthwhile work, because it demonstrates with the same chilling clarity how the disease of \\"judicial activism\\" has spread, literally throughout the judicial system. I don't see the fault as equally shared, however. I think liberals recklessly moved the courts toward dangerous activism, and that the conservative (albiet slim) majority now in control is doing what needs to be done, by bringing the court back to a more centrist position -- yes centrist. Anyway, Lazarus has done us all a favor with his marvelous work. I recommend it strongly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the substance?","review":"I was really surprised by the tone this book took after the first three chapters. I'm not a lawyer. Therefore I was not captivated by the tedious legalisms that the author got into. It's a shame. The first three chapters were very interesting and informative. I don't understand why Mr. Lazarus turned the theme of the book from his experiences as a clerk into an advocay piece. Too bad it missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, no content","review":"It was a good thing I didn't pay for my own copy. I would have felt a fool. This book fails to deliver any substance of the nature or causes of the compromises and/or non-compromises made by the Justices. The only thing this book does well is the one thing that it should not do, and that is to reveal the confidences to which the author was privy. The author seems to have forgotten that he received the confidences in his capacity as a lawyer. It is just as well that the author is now a prosecutor. No private corporation or individual would want to hire a lawyer who divulges information communicated in confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this book no stars if I could","review":"I thought the idea of this book was to reveal the inside workings of the court.

As a student myself, I've read some of the convulated reasoning and hypocrisy that substitutes for judgment by the court. But it's inevitable. These people may be brilliant, but they're still people.The one thing I missed from this book is more background on the justices. Knowing this might have helped me understand why they vote the way they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to deliver","review":"Over the course of Lazarus's 500 page tome, I'd guess that, at most, 50 pages are dedicated to the ostensible subject: the behind the scenes workings of the Court. Lazarus describes an extensive Supreme Court history of three divisive issues: capital punishment, race-based remedies, and abortion (the first and last issues covered more completely than race). While he does a fine job with this material, it was not what I expected to find in \\"Closed Chambers.\\" Those looking for the \\"inside scoop\\" are advised to stick with \\"The Brethren,\\" a book that actually delivers what was promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace","review":"One of the most sacred duties of a law clerk, from the Supreme Court or any other court, is to keep what he learns during his job secret. What Lazarus did, in the name of making a buck, is simply dishonest. He breached the trust placed on him by the justices of the court and his fellow clerks. What a shame. I believe that Lazarus should be forever banned fron supreme court practice. By the way, the book is dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Carville in the Supreme Court","review":"This book provides overwhelming evidence of how unelected, Leftists Supreme Court law clerks abuse their positions to make public policy. The author clerked for the late Justice Harry Blackmun who tried his best to incorporate Leftist values into the Constitution against the will of the vast majority of the American people. Lucky for us, Justices Scalia and Thimas have neutralized this vast left wing conspiracy. Like Carville, the author holds most Americans, including those reading this review, in utter contempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great look inside the Supreme Court from one who was there","review":"It amazes me that previous reviewers have said the Brethren by Bob Woodward, the noted reporter from the Washington Post, is a more accurate portrayal of the inner workings of the court than this fine volume by Mr. Lazarus. I am a lawyer and have studied the court as much as anyone. It must be noted for these naysayers that we have no idea where Woodward's stories came from, but Lazarus was a law clerk and at the center of the court's daily workings. This is not a book that seeks to entertain the naysayers like so much gossip, but as the author plainly states in his introduction, an effort to illustrate how the court has become so factious with primary focus on certain issues such as the death penalty. If you are looking for a soap opera, by all means, read the Bretheren.

The price is right and it is fast to recalculate a new route when you take a different turn.However, the database must be old as a 2 year old entrance on the Ohio turnpike is not recognized. It also failed to pick up US30 between Mansfield and Bucyrus whcih has been constructed for at least 4 years. It will also not recognize certain streets if you don't call them the same as they are labelled in the system. A case in point was using a postal address the NV-U70 couldn't find it, but when I arrived it had it shown as a county road #!Don't leave home without having a very good idea of the route you are taking. I use Microsoft Streets and Maps which is far more accurate than the NV-U70.I regret my purchase and am considering a Garmin product, which effectively says the price is not really right.ACAmherst, OH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor interface","review":"I had a Garmin Ique 3600 Palm OS PDA GPS which unfortunately decided to stop working with the car cradle before our move to CA. I bought this Sony GPS as a replacement. The Garmin had a much better interface. The Sony interface is extremely poor and takes an excessive amount of time to find things. For example, if you want to look for a certain store you have to search by city, not by nearest one (unless you have a GPS feed, which hinders you before you leave your house). Also, the map data is suspect as it lead me to the wrong location a couple of times. The only thing I like about it over my Garmin is it acquires the GPS signal much faster. I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone. Stick to a company which just does GPS and mapping such as Garmin or Magellan. Whomever Sony subcontracted to do the software for this device is obviously new to car navgiation."},{"rating":"2","title":"great piece of equipment","review":"I live in Europe, so I have to deal with traffic jams all day long. That is exactly the reason I decided for the Sony, it has TMC. And I must say it works excellent, when there is a traffic jam on my route, it warns me and giving me 2 choices; ignore or re calculate my route. And the re calculation is just great. The sound is good, I'm very pleased with this navigation system.The only thing is that Sony doesn't sell the DVD containing the maps of the USA and Canada separately. Because in Europe this item comes only with the DVD containing the maps of Europe, of course. But since I travel often to the US, my idea was to purchase the USA/Canada DVD separately. Costumer service from Sony, they can't help me, they doesn't know. But anyway, I will find a copy one of these days. Maybe a user in the US can make a copy for me.

Not aggressively violent, the assassin's theme is merely a subplot to accompany the anime's emotional journey. Although a bit older (2001), this anime features excellent music to accompany the critical moments throughout the series. Other qualities are the extra historical references and tactics used by the girls. Overall, Noir stylishly presents a mysterious drama shot by sexy assassins."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Anime ever","review":"Like others it is hard to build on the other excellent reviews. The music is just amazing and I have all three albums (the two sound tracks and blanc dans NOIR). The animation is also excellent and the series is a great (almost perfect) example of taking a premise that seems cliche (girls with guns) and turning it into so much more. Beyond the music and animation, the one other thing that really stands out is the level of character development. There are so many Anime out there where new aspects to a character just get written in. But for the main two characters in Noir (and even some of the supporting cast) the character development is woven in right before our eyes (though it can be very subtle). What is so great about this is the choices the characters make at the end actually feel \\"right\\". And it's this attention to detail and care that really sets this series apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Noir does some things good. There is some amount of character development that seems believable. Music is good and played appropriately. Lighting and animation is also good at times.Noir does a lot of things bad. There is a high body count in almost every episode. It's really tedious and makes every episode basically the same story. Sure there is some ebb and flow in the relationship between Mireille and Kirika, but the story is really predictable. The connection between Noir and the Italian mafia mob is largely pointless. Things really go downhill with the final confrontation.Noir is a nice wrapper with a good animation framework, but the plot is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this series.","review":"Between this and Madlax I lost over 600 + minutes of my life having to watch this crap. waste of a dub talented actors.

I'm open minded enough to amend this review should it turn out to be reliable, but for now 2 stars seems generous.Update: Still not sure how reliable it is--but after calibration, not with salt water, but with damp cloth wrapped around the instrument for 30 min, used the screw to set at 99-100%, seems to be tracking reasonably well and agrees with online weather reports +/- 5% when placed outside.

That is what I assumed I was purchasing because Amazon's and Adorama Camera's ads do NOT state how many pages are included w/ your kit. I was very upset to know that I paid this amount for a 25 page kit. IT IS VERY MISLEADING AND NOT HONEST at all in my opinion.

The publishers suggestion is that you study from the real Reference Manual, and then use this \\"quick reference\\" to work problems and take the exam. That's a very poor idea. Once you know a reference book, stick with it.One significant shortcoming of this book is that it is not \\"tabbed\\" like the real Reference Manual, so trying to find the section you're looking for takes longer than finding it in the comprehensive manual. Bottom line is that this Quick Refernce is nothing more than a list of formulas, and it will not be much help on the exam.

The resettable circuit breaker was so loose on mine it fell out inside the unit.

Agreeing with everyone else, this is a peculiar place to put them. HOWEVER, I use a podium setup and can put this unit on the lower shelf(with the toggle switches facing upwards) to plug in both my speakers, laptop, and monitor and it works just fine.

I bought this to replace a mismatched set that I'd had. It came quickly and look very nice in my kitchen. I ran into problems when I went to use the soup ladel, the pasta spoon and well ok, almost all of them. The problem? They are WAY too top-heavy. If I didn't it position exactly right against the side of the pot, the spoon/fork/whatever would tip right out, and usually fall to the floor to create a huge mess. I can't tell you how many times my husband has sworn and asked me why I replaced the old ones, before proceeding to tell me I HAD to get rid of the Oneida's.

She's all about her imaginative play, but this for some reason seemed to be lacking something. I just never felt there was much that the kids could really DO with it that would keep them entertained... There are other Little People pieces that were so much more well received, like the house, the farm/barn, the carnival stuff with ferris wheel, the playground... those all have gotten hours of play.

While the author says he could walk the battlefield blind folded, he must have been blindfolded when it was written. The Irish Brigade monument is on Sickles Ave. not Ayres. And it's obvious he does not like the park officials. The author comes off as an elitist. He talks about how there is so much more to the field than what was covered in a 'novel' and movie (which i agree) but he then goes over all the same points found in this 'novel'. Nothing new here, and with no maps inside and back tracking and going forward with no reference point, not a great book to use if you're walking the battlefield. Luckily i only borrowerd the copy i read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good tour guide...not a detailed history book","review":"It is important not to mistake this book as a detailed history of the battle. It is not intended as such. If you want a detailed history see the series of books by Harry W. Pfanz.

To this end, it is very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with info and insight","review":"This is a great little book...the title says it all, it is exactly what you get but with personality.

That battle helped shape and define our country, but the facts would be lost if not for writers like James Mcpherson. The book literally walks you thru each battlefront and adds personal touches to make it more than a history book. If you have never been to Gettysburg, this book will surely inspire you to visit the site. If you have been there, like me, it can only enhance your memories and provide detail that is easily overlooked.

That's exactly what you get here. I've been known to wander through cemetaries in search of famous people myself, so it's nice to know I'm not alone in my macabre interests. All the chapters are well-written, particularly the short epilogue to each as done by Richard Norton Smith. The concluding essay by Douglas Brinkley also hits home. I particularly thought it clever that, along with the photographs of each presidential gravesite (and future gravesites), the authors included photos from the graves of Jefferson Davis and David Rice Atcheson (reported to have been president of the U.S. for 1 day).

When I finished reading this book, cover to cover, I thought this is better than going to each birthplace! It is certainly a lot easier, and I found it extremely satisfying to see each gravesite, all in the course of a couple hours, and to learn so many interesting things, like: What state has the most Presidential graves?

Generally I am \\"throwing\\" 9 out of 10 photos away. The camera has serious exposure problems, the pictures always come out fuzzy and always a little \\"blue-ish\\". Recycling time is decent if the flash is off, if the flash is on (even if you did not use the flash - flash set to automatic) it takes *forever* to take the next shot.If you look for a snapshot camera which you can take anywhere, buy a disposable film camera, you will make much better pictures with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Work on Western Intellectual History","review":"Burgess Laughlin's *The Aristotle Adventure* provides an interesting and enlightening account of the transmission of Aristotle's treatises on logic.

This set of stands has an extremely wide base (15x12 3/4) which helps keep it from topping over. Also, it has rubber feet on both the base as well as the pedestal which help keep it from sliding. Lastly, the pedestal is wide enough that even if my daughter were able to rock the stands, the speakers aren't sliding off.Overall, great stands and great looking! My only complaint would be that there are only two screws that hold the posts into the base, which causes the post to slightly sway when my daughter pulls up on them. Nothing significant, but if they had added a third screw it would have prevented this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good stands.","review":"These stands are both aesthetically appealing and they enhance the sound of the 301, at least in my room. I guess Bose recommends the speakers stand 24\\" off the floor and they sound great. I used to have them mounted on a pair of Klipsch Forte II's, which are about 36\\" tall. dropping them down 12\\" and giving them a good sound stage made the difference. They are now an official replacement for a pair of Heresy II's. The Forte II's are now in the HT room.Funny thing is that I hated the acoustimass line but the 301 and the 901 have that goofy direct/reflecting thing which does give them a good sound stage.

They seemed good enough at first tho, so I kept them. I washed them and once washed however, they completely shrunk quite drastically. They also are so thin, so they curl up on all the ends and no longer lay flat. They are just for the floor where I house my aging dog for when he has an accident, so they will be good enough for this purpose I hope. He has not peed on them yet, so I can't comment on the absorbency level. Hopefully nothing goes through.UPDATEA few months later he has peed on them several times. They are lousy. You don't get a puddle on the other side, but you do get dampness bleeding through. Not worth the money. Tried to return them once I saw they didn't work as planned, but the company refused a refund.

I know nothing is perfect, but if you have someone that wakes a lot through the night, this can become a big problem, in that, each time the person wakes the bedding/pad have to be straightened back up and smoothed out flat.

She is using a bed alarm now and is almost finished with nighttime training but before, she had huge accidents and it held all of the liquid without anything seeping through to the sheet underneath. We now bring them with us when we go on vacation to prevent any embarrasing accidents at hotels or relatives homes (just in case); they fold up compactly and don't take much room in the suitcase. My daughter doesn't move around a lot at night, so there is no problem of her moving off of them and having an accident on another part of the bed. If your child or loved one moves around a lot, I would recommend getting the larger type that tuck under each side of the bed to hold it in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect, well almost","review":"The pad is great; good quality. I knew before I got it that it would not stay put, but I was so sick of changing my sons sheets from night training I had to figure out a way to use them. They do sell ones with straps and flaps, but to me that's the same amount of work as putting on new sheets. So, I got an area rug gripper and put it under the pad. It works pretty well. I still have to straighten it before bedtime, but it solved the problem of moving to the bottom of the bed each night. I also bought a more expensive pad, but it is pretty much the same as this cheaper one. I haven't needed to wash it yet, so I'll update if it falls apart :)*update* An easier way of keeping pad from slipping down is to put a large beach towel over it. The rug gripper was ok, but still did get kicked around and messed up.

I received the product and used it the first night I had it. In the morning the areas around the pad on side to middle of bed and at the head were soaked thru to the mattress pad. The blue pad did not leak but the material was not absorbent enough to contain the urine and it just channeled it to the sides and onto the extra pad I had placed underneath and also onto the sheet. Bottom line it may be fine if a person is only damp but I would not recommend it to anyone in a situation such as mine. I have been using a similar brand I was given. It is not quilted, is very soft, and very absorbent. Only problem I do not know the brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay put...","review":"The product is not non-slip and it is not very thick or heavy. It bunches up with every movement.

They are soft and not noisy. I have two young children (4 & 6) who are still unable to wake up dry. I have been trying to figure out a something I could have them use at night besides disposable pull ups. I wanted something that would encourage them to stay dry, but also not have a big mess to clean up.After much searching I found these and bought two (34x36) because the price was so good. It is so convenient to just toss this smaller pad in the wash instead of having to change the entire bed (a full size pad and the sheets). I am happy for this alternative. The kids have even woke up dry a few times and that is ultra promising. I just bought 2 more so I can switch them out for mid-night accidents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reusable Bedpads","review":"Very nice product - I do however find that they do slip & become uneven under you & wish that were not so. otherwise, seems to be quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"These are a great price and work well for potty training.

So far, this has proven to be the best pad for daily washing. I also have not had the problem of melting the pad due to leaving it the dryer too long, or having the washing agitator tear it up. Using two of these pads on the bed instead of relying on one twin size mattress pad has also cut down on the amount of laundry. This pad sits on top of the sheets which often means the only thing needing to be washed are the pads. I've been placing two pads on the bed since our child sometimes moves one in the middle of the night. I am also impressed with the affordability of these pads which makes it easy to purchase enough to last the whole week. I would recommend purchasing the pad with the flaps to help keep it in place during the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"comfortable but not very absorbent","review":"It's very comfortable, and washes well.

The CD provides the metal music fan with a variety of tempos and melodies.If you're a fan of uptempo metal music, it's on the Savant cd. If you're a fan of slow tempo metal music, it's on the Savant cd. Listening to this band for several years now, I see a great improvement in the songwriting. The songwriting and the musicianship mesh extremely well with each other. My favorite track on the cd is \\"Prayer\\" because I had a great friendship with the person it was written about. Look for Savant to make it's mark on the metal music scene in 1999, especially now that have enlisted the help of Al Cocchi as their promotions and booking manager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get what you pay for and more!","review":"I bought this camera for my 12 year old sister. I figured it would be a cool camera for her because of its size. When it arrived, I played around with it to make sure it worked and found that it took surprisingly great (for the price and megapixels) outdoor pictures. Indoor pictures, I found, were almost worthless because of the awful and grainy quality. Overall, for the $13 I paid for this camera, it was well worth it. It is ideal for every-day travel because you don't realize it is even in your pocket. I would reccomend this camera to anyone who took the time to read through the specs and customer reviews. You never known when you might find an \\"Outdoor Oregon Scientific\\" moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price","review":"I had a similar problem as a previous reviewer: my rechargeable battery petered out a few DAYS after the warranty ran out. Luckily, after a ridiculous dance with customer service, they sent me another one. Within a year, the new one would not hold a charge either.The pictures are really not very good - they're actually worse than my camera phone! The camera on its own holds very few pictures (like, 28 or something), and the flash is a cartridge-type thing that snaps on the camera. Only the camera fits in the case, so you have to find something to do with the flash.Unlike the previous reviewer, my camera did NOT cost $30 - it was more when I purchased it - but even at $30, it is not a good buy.

Seven short songs (side A of the record) range from a rocking opener (Golden Promises) to elegiac (Slow Time) to a spooky portrait of post-holocaust Jack-the-Rippersville (Fogwalking) to a tooth-grating ambient wash (the Wipe).

When I turned to the answer key, the word in the question should have been misspelled. This type of thing did not only happened in the grammar section, but also in Math and Social Studies.

The extra horns and backup singers don't make a better album, though and singer Howard Werth doesn't duplicate the full-throat commitment his singing had on previous songs such as Jackdaw. By this album, according to Wikipedia, the band was pretty much exhausted by non-stop touring and in the process of breaking up; this, their swan song, does indeed sound like a group at the end of their creative rope.

I was also disappointed that the propane bottle normally used on portable gas grills (short and fat) would not fit. I had to make a special trip to a hardware store to purchase a tall thin one that is normally used for torches.

The burner is a stainless steel tube. It looks like it will work well without the \\"erosion\\" that plagues most gas grille burners. The entire shell of the grille is made of heavy cast aluminum. The cooking grate is of cast iron. This makes the grate the heaviest part of the entire grille assembly. It makes the complete grille rather heavy to handle so it is best left off until ready to cook. It should, because of its robust material, last much longer than the typical steel-wire type grates on most grilles. On the first outing, it cooked hamburgers extremely well! The best grilled burgers I have had in a long time! I recommend an adapter hose to connect the grille to a larger propane tank, such as a 11 or 20 lb tank. The small gas bottles that are intended to be used are pretty small for serious cooking...of which the grille itself is fully capable."},{"rating":"2","title":"December 2007 - Still Works!

However, and this is a big HOWEVER, this past weekend, after using the grill to prepare two meals, I unscrewed a Coleman propane cartridge from the grill, and brass regulator nozzle parts remained in the cartridge, sticking the cartridge valve open, and thus causing propane to violently spew from the cartridge. This was a dangerous situation because the brass parts could have then acted as a projectile, or the propane could have ignited and become a fire hazard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little grill","review":"Lightweight and effective.

We were very pleased with the way it cooked. Then this spring the hose from the gas tank to the grill cracked. We purchased a new hose but it would not work. We brought the hose back to the dealer. The dealer tries everything, but could not figure out why the hose would not allow gas to get to the grill. They tried new Baby Webers in the Store and none of them worked. They tried new hoses off the shelf and none of them worked.So I called Weber and they basically told me if the dealer could not figure out the problem to go pound sand. So I am going to return the $40 hose and throw the Baby Weber Grill in the trash. Going back to the cheap off-brand grills that last at least two years or more.

Thirty minutes after finding it on our doorstep upon return from work, we were at Home Depot picking up propane cylinders and then the supermarket for a pair of round-eye steaks and corn. Thirty minutes after that, the meat was sizzling on the grill. I'm not an expert 'grill-man' by any stretch of the word, but I'm confident in saying that the result of my very first attempt at gas grilling would not have disappointed anyone. Six minutes on each side at medium heat was all it took to produce a memorable steak dinner complete with a perfectly grilled corn on the cob as a side (another twelve minutes).

More than enough room for the two of us, and the grill is so small, we keep it in the closet instead of on the deck, to prevent rust.The grill gets VERY hot. hotter than my mom's full size grill.

There is no way a 16oz bottle can fit without permanent modifications. Called Weber customer service, and all they could say was it should fit and I should push harder. Well with a 16oz bottle it's a good inch out of alignment, and if I forced it it would break. Even the user's manual says both bottle sizes should fit. It's a shame because it's an otherwise good quality looking grill. For $150 it should work as advertised without me forcing or modifying anything.

Never experiencing this before, I called up Weber and said that 3 years after my purchase the grill does not warranty grease fire damage (strange for a bbq?).

Its ease of use and the great cooking guide from Weber make for fail safe grilling. Buy a timer, read the guide for the type of food to be grilled, and you will experience the wonder of this product. First time out of the gate you will be a pro. I say this as one who has three functioning outdoor grills to include a large Jenair stainless grill. The Q performs far better and with less fuss than either.

It covers all the major topics you would wish to look at in your studies, has extensive charts, tables and graphs and is a great references book for anyone interested in politics. Well worth a look. Also check out 'Development is American Politics' edited by Gillian Peele, which also has some excellent information in a selection of essays form.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"Clearly this product does NOT work with most (maybe all) side flush toilets. No matter which of the 4 positions you set this up in, the arm is unable to create anything other than a rotational motion (i.e. it doesn't lift the chain/flap). Bending the arm in any direction you wish does not change this fact. Take \\"fits all styles of toilets\\" and then listing \\"side\\" off the product!!! What a waste of my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work - Manf Defect","review":"How hard is it to make a toilet lever? Must be hard. This handle has a defect where it sticks after flushing, if you don't push it up the toilet will run for hours. I won't buy another Danco product. Wife bought this online, did not return it in time so this thing has to go in the trash, good bye $15. Also wasted 2 months messing with this dumb thing. No more Danco products for my house.

I currently have one installed on an angle mount. It was super easy to install but the nut that attaches it to the toilet has come loose several times in the year that I have had it installed.

I got the old handle out and had just picked up this new handle to start installing it when it slipped from my hand about four feet onto a linoleum floor. It broke on impact. The handle snapped just inside the little collar where it goes into the spherical bit. From a four-foot fall onto linoleum! I couldn't believe it. This is swanky-looking junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install, looks very nice","review":"I'm still tinkering to try to get it to allow a quick complete flush. I have to hold down the handle a few moments, or the flapper will close too quickly, and I can't seem to get it tweaked just right. A small issue, but not one I've had to put up with before.

Is there a word that you do not know in the selected segment, and if so, can you guess at the meaning based on the sentence or paragraph? Find a word on the page and give a synonym.

It has a reddish-brown color, mild flavor, and is easy to dissolve in liquids.Unsweetened Cocoa:Has a complex chocolate flavor while the Dutch-process is darker and more mellow. Its intense flavor makes it well suited for use in brownies, cookies and some chocolate cakes.

Probably after 6 months of three times a week, I could probably do about 80 percent of each video without worrying about blowing out something in my midsection.So if your a fitness instructor you could probably join right in, but if your the average joe or jane blow, these workouts are waaaay tooo advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but does it work?","review":"I have to agree with one other reviewer, this instructor does have an ironically huge belly, especially apparent when she is doing exercises on all fours.This makes me question whether the flab is there because of her workout or in spite of it.Sure some of the moves are great.

I couldn't get past the mound of flesh hanging from the instructor's stomach when she was demonstrating in the push-up position. How in the world is she going to show me how to flatten my abs when she can't even flatten her own? This video reminded of something a friend of mine once said: You don't ask a homeless person how to obtain and maintain wealth. Granted, I didn't finish the video once I noticed her belly fat.

Suzanne Bowen is a great instructor who has a nice, calm voice (after different videos you realize how important this is) and who gives beginner modifications to moves that are more difficult. I like the pace of the routines and as with all 10-Minute Solution videos I really enjoy being able to mix and match different routines. My favorite thing about having the different segments is that I can use one ten minute segment a day in addition to my work out routine and then on my off day I do a 30 minute block.I have had this for a few months and have yet to tire of doing the routines and I even miss doing them when I do not have time to fit them into my regular work out routine.

I highly reccomend this ab workout. It is one of the best 10 minute solution workouts. I like all of the workouts on this dvd.

Mount Misery describes one year of residency training in a psychiatric hospital. While not remotely as funny as \\"House of God\\" this piece of work is more mature and goes much deeper.

First, I absolutely loved the House of God! It was an excellent book, and I really couldn't wait to run out and read the sequel. Unfortunately, Mount Misery is absolutely nothing like the HOG. It was actually a struggle to get through the book, and I had to suffer just to finish it. I know this will be hard to believe if you just finished HOG, but MM is really nothing like it! It is slow, dark, and lacks all the humor/morbid satire and huge issues HOG dealt with. Shem should have never wrote this book, it really disappoints as some of the other reviewers pointed out.

So much so why did she even need the hero? And why did I need to care about her?But then we were left hanging by the hero. His attraction to the heroine didn't seem all that defined. Of course she was different than anything he'd ever seen before but I didn't understand why he fell in love with her other than the fact that she was perfect.Considered how thick this book was there wasn't really any plot or conflict.

It was hard for me to get into the story because the main characters Kit and Marcus didn't have any chemistry whatsoever. Marcus is so boring and Kit is too outspoken.

Sadly this book was a considerable disappointment. Thin and lacking in detail, but surely most surprisingly discussion of Zukovs greatest battles and tactics are almost completely absent.For example the 'chapter' dedicated to the tank battle at Kursk, the most important tank battle of WWII, totals a mere 7 pages, five discuss the set up for the battle, and two discuss the aftermath. Details about the actual battle are completely ommitted. The battles for Stalingrad and Berlin are likewise passed over in cursory fashion. The author Axell may argue that his book is a biography not a military history, but Zhukov was a general, if his actions and decisions on the battlefield aren't relevant then what is?I would have loved this to be a great book, regretably it is a very poor attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marshall Zhukov","review":"Disjointed, incoherent, rarely deals with the subject at hand; namely Marshall Zhukov himself.

A brand new Duracell will only last a week with listening for 2-3 hours a day and it drains the battery in 2 weeks even when it has been turned off and inactive.

My daughter loved creating shapes, cutting out molds, and rolling designs and patterns into flattened playdough. The patterns for the molds are a bit limited and the square impression blocks serve little purpose. A lid for storage would be helpful. Educationally, there isn't much value added, but it does help with motor skills for a young one learning to do things with their hands. Overall, this set was a lot of fun and is better than comparable brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves this set!","review":"My son is almost 2, and absolutely LOVES this set. Everything is just the right size for him - but the rolling pins can't really be held by the handles and rolled like real ones, they're just too small for that. I think I may be in the minority here, but I actually really like the modeling clay that came with this. It smells great! It doesn't seem to be too texturally different from Play-Doh brand, and we've had no issues with it being difficult or less malleable. However, I do think that it dries out a bit faster than Play-Doh as the storage tubs do not seem to be entirely air-tight. We've only had the set for about 2 weeks, so no issues with paint coming off. If it holds up long-term I'd be willing to give it 5 stars, but we've only had it about 2 weeks so I just don't know yet :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Fun","review":"My son got lots of playdoh things this Christmas and this set was one of the items he received. The rolling pins and stampers are graet. We couldn't get the pizza cutter tool to work properly though. They made the radius of the wheel to small, so you would have to make the dough super thin in order for it to work (we never did). So, long story short, if you are looking to buy this because of the pizza cutter - DON'T!

I replaced only one of the sticks with the PNY to bring the total to 1.2G. The computer runs Windows XP and is much more responsive! A good upgrade for an older computer.I downloaded the user manual from dell and it included instructions on how to do the upgrade, it's a piece of cake for anyone who knows how to use a screwdriver.

I would recommend it to all women but especially to Christian women. As Christian women, we need to acknowledge that domestic violence happens in our church. The more we understand domestic abuse, the easier it will be to talk about it and find ways to help our sisters heal. It is also important that we come to a more balanced interpretation of the scriptures on marriage and relationship. The influence of faith on how Christian women deal with abuse is addressed -- this is a must read. The book provides good resource material for further study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought","review":"I liked the straight-forward writing style of the author but felt the title was misleading.

I don't know about you but I can't pack up and move to upstate New York or the rural area of Maine. (He stated there are no good antiques in the South since Sherman burned it down). This is basically a overview of the antiques business and how things are run. I don't agree with some of his list of things to buy and not to buy. It's an okay book and you can gleam a few gems out of it but I don't think you are going to double your money just by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This book may have been useful once upon a time, but it's definitely not anymore.

Enjoy this book - it is a guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leapin' Lizards Of Loony Laughter","review":"Mr. Moore's first book, published in 1992, is a well-crafted farce. Outrageous descriptions and comparisons are littered throughout his tale. For example, one chapter starts with this cute bon mot: Effrom Elliot awoke that morning eagerly anticipating his nap. The truism \\"do not judge a book by its cover\\" does not hold up in this case. With a title like \\"Practical Demonkeeping,\\" it's pretty obvious this story is not exactly going to be wallowing in Shakespearan territory. The author does a nice job of balancing believable characters and otherworldly nonsense. The sarcastic demon, Catch, has plenty of great one-liners and I found myself laughing even when the big lizard was about to eat someone. If you're looking for quirky, hilarious escapism, Mr. Moore may be just the ticket. At only 242 pages, \\"Practical Demonkeeping\\" is an easy-to-read, fast-paced amusement ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Moore","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Quick easy read that was funny! I laughed out loud a few times. I'm looking forward to getting more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Poore writes because he enjoys it.","review":"I first read this book when I was in the Navy four years ago. I was the first to read it and it got passed around the ship through many hands before I saw the tattered copy in eager hands on the mess decks some months later. I couldn't wait to get off watch to find out what was going to happen. When I got to the end I was truly satisfied. Since then I have read much on mythology and discovered that much of the Jewish tradition which Mr. Moore draws from was accurate! Catch may not have been one of the Demons which Solomon \\"employed\\" but it is a common belief that Solomon did use demons to build his Temple. I still have a copy of this book and pass it around. I have never heard an ill word said of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snarky demonic fun","review":"This is a quirky book about a young priest-in-training who unwittingly commands a demon into existence that gives him immortality but follows him around eating folks for, well, forever unless he can find a way to send the demon back to hell. Its snarky and I enjoyed it oh-so-much! Moore has a very twisted sense of humor and I hear his books only get better after this one (and I thought this one was pretty nifty so I'm excited!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun. Perfect for Terry Pratchett fans","review":"The only reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is so much like a Terry Pratchett book that I felt like I was reading a very good imitator in places.Strangely lighthearted for a book about a demon that eats people and the reluctant \\"master\\" that tries to keep him from it, this book has plenty to offer - strange characters, neat plot twists, and some great background mythology. The few drawbacks include the fact that the characters seem uniformly odd and that some of the more grim aspects of the story (spousal abuse, alcoholism, etc.) are glossed over as if they wandered in from another book.Besides that this book is highly entertaining. I loved the demon imitating The Exorcist because he was tired of imitating The Wizard of Oz and the sordid bar scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking wit","review":"I found this book extremely disappointing - maybe because I was used to the wild wit of Carl Hiaasen ( if you don't know him check out his \\"Stormy Weather\\" )- so I expected Practical Demonkeeping and the other books by C. Moore to be hilarious : just look at their titles ! But I found the humor \\"immature\\" , lacking substance , the plots of his books seemed always too weak and unconvincing , \\"kiddie\\" humor..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut","review":"I read an interview where Christopher Moore said that, with this novel, he wanted \\"to do for horror what Douglas Adams did for science-fiction.\\" He hasn't come far off the mark, although the Hitchhiker series was palpably science-fiction whereas this is hardly horror. It has all of the trappings but never produces a real scare. That is my only complaint.The other author I kept thinking of while reading this was Terry Pratchett, whose work I prefer over Adams'. In Adams' work, you could always see the joke coming, where Pratchett often sneaks up on you. Moore's humor is similarly situational. I especially like the description of the contents of Jenny's bathwater and its comparison to the contents of a lab experiment going on across town.It's a light, quick read, but well worth it. This is my first Moore book, and I will definitely be searching out the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Bloodsucking Fiends, but...","review":"still a lot of fun. The demon is a riot. Christopher Moore has an incredible flair for comedy; his writing is concise and witty, delivering its punch without being heavy-handed. I highly recommend any of Moore's books, though Island of the Sequined Love Nun is definitely the strangest of the lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Imagination...","review":"In this fantastic debut, Moore creates a group of hilarious characters, including the unlikely duo Travis and Catch. Travis is a svelte looking 100-year-old man and Catch is his invisible demon companion who can only be seen by others when he is eating. When the two arrive in the seaside town of Pine Cove, a local man known as The Breeze becomes Catch's first meal. Moore introduces you to the other bizarre inhabitants of Pine Cove who all become involved in trying to take control of Catch or send him back to the Netherworld. The only thing you know for sure is that none of their lives will ever be the same. Christopher Moore has secured his place among my favorite authors and I cannot wait to read more of his zany adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Moore never disapppoints!","review":"I really enjoyed this book but it was too short!!!

I really reccommend this album for those who want to explore the blues, as you will hear some of the first gritty blues recordings and the progression to today's artists and expression. Of course, any old blues hound will also love this album.

There is almost nonexistent individual packaging, just a thin cardboard band around the box like you would expect to see siting on a retail shelf. It should have been in a complete cardboard box.

This is not high security, just something to stash things that I don't want laying around where they could \\"grow legs\\". It would be good for smaller documents, jewelery, software, photos, etc. A medium frame revolver or semi-auto w/4\\" bbl easily fits with room to spare for a box of ammo and more. This is NOT a safe.

Believe me, I tried several strategies. It always seemed to be accurate for nickels and almost always for quarters. Unfortunately that's not accurate enough for the bank. After several tries with the coin tubes, and verifying the total by manually counting, I realized this tool was incapable of counting the value of coins in a jar.You can still use it to wrap coins in wrappers, but since many banks don't take them that way and will unpack them and recount them if they do, there's not really any purpose I can think of that is served by these plastic tubes."},{"rating":"2","title":"good perspective","review":"Steve takes a very positive approach to daaling with intimidating subjects, like having enough money in retirement. This book takes a step (or three) back and discusses quality life after the traditional working phase. Aside from providing perspective on the the role income and savings play during this time of life, there are concrete suggestions regarding investments, insurance and methods of generating income and cutting expenses. It's interesting to see how much income you can expect from your savings after retirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Readable Survey","review":"I've been trying to read a survey of World History for years, but found most of the commonly available titles too dry and slow to get trough. McNeill did an admirable job of combining the history of eastern and western civilizations chronologically, and I can say that it's a great place to start if you're looking for an overview. Of course, it's light on many subjects as is necessary due to its size, and yes it's somewhat dated. However, I don't think you'll find a more readable survey."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, well-written single volume world history.","review":"McNeil is an old-fashioned narrative historian whose most famous book is Rise of the West. This book adopts a similar broad approach to world history. It makes an excellent gift for college students and young adult who want to lay a base for historical understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be your \\"first buy\\"","review":"When I decided to go down the path of becoming an indepedent filmmaker, I knew I needed to read up on the subject. After reading various reviews, I decided to get Digital Filmmaking 101 by Dale Newton and John Gaspard. I'm SO glad I did. This book is amazing! It covers everything you need to know about independent digital filmmaking, all from the perspective of doing it on a shoe-string budget.Although it doesn't go into great detail on any one subject, it covers every aspect to at least a general level, making this a great introductory text. I've read it cover to cover at least three times and have re-read specific chapters several more times on top of that.Newton and Gaspard's writing style is humorous yet matter-of-fact and you always get the feeling they are in your corner. Most other books written by industry experts tend to have a \\"talking down to you\\" tone to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect book for you? I think so.","review":"I ordered Digital Filmmaking 101 a few days ago. Since then, I live in a well-isolated world where only this book exists. And of course snacks and pops close enough not having to get off the couch. Not only does it give you essential information but keep you entertained through the last page. It's a great pick for your first book about filmmaking just as well as your next one for your shelf. Thoroughly walks you through the development of your movie from picking the perfect script, budget building, recruiting your crew, find locations. Even what business forms you should consider. To pre-production, casting the cast, production and post-production. And finally: distribution. In a nutshell, I can highly recommend this book to anyone with the dream of making their first low-budget digital feature film. It's a must read.Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well-put together, not too dumbed down or techie","review":"Just loved this book. It covered everything, as in everything. If your knowledge or project is highly specialized, there may be parts you zip through, but this is an excellent read either cover to cover or to refer back to."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WAIST OF TIME AND MONEY.....DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This is not the first book I read on the subject, and although I'm not an expert, I don't need to be one to realized It failed to communicate the basics on independet film production. It lacks a lot of info on contacts for production and didn't even mention or reviewed any specific product that can be used in film making, wich its what most novice people intersted in the subject are looking for. The way the book was set up didn't help much either. Most of the reference, which is minumum and simplistic, is in the back of the book instead of in the same page. That make you having to go back and forth. If you want a better book on the subject stick to the Dummies' one....you will note the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!","review":"I purchased this item as a birthday gift for my nephew. While it arrived very quickly, I was very disappointed. The second hand was floating loose inside the face. Then we tested it and the alarm feature did not work. We tried several times with no luck. Also, this company does not refund shipping charges on returns and you have to pay to ship it back to them as well. They indicated the weight to be 7 pounds which is absurd. The entire package doesn't even weigh a pound!! I think they did this so they can tack on another $15.00 to ship it to you, as thought the $35.00 cost of the clock is not enough of a rip off ( a fair price would be around $20.00). I am very angry and will not be buying anything from this company again. UPDATE-after corresponding with the company they agreed to send me a replacement clock at no charge. In addition they did not make me return the broken clock. The new clock arrived promptly and worked okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popular Science DVD Slideshow Preview","review":"Length:: 5:38 MinsMy Classic Car: Jay Leno - Certified Car NutClassic Aviation Films: A National Archives CollectionEducational Archives: Limited Edition Lunchbox (4 DVD Box Set)NOVA - Genius: The Science of Einstein, Newton, Darwin, and GalileoA Science Odyssey - Bigger, Bette[[ASIN:6305941122 A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent contributon to relation of narrative to history","review":"Clear, wide ranging,synthetic, erudite, but never pedantic.

Overall I am very satisfied with the bracelet itself, although I cannot say how well it will wear over time as far as how easily it shows any scratches or scrapes. I believe this item to be of the highest quality so I can only speak for myself as far as the overall value that it offers. The only other thing is that it does feel slightly heavier than a true titanium item might weigh, but I am by no means complaining , but as I said earlier it looks very nice for the price that you pay and the fit and finish appear to be top notch.

The story told by Ted Power on missing the boating accident that claimed the lives of Steve Olin and Tim Crews and seriously injured Bob Ojeda and how it changed Power's life was the best one in the book.

Once I opened the package I knew it was cheaply made, as it was lighter weight and the handle was not as heavy. The plastic pins kept snagging my hair, again unlike my original Denman, leading me to believe it was just made differently. The telltale sign was one use with a blow dryer and almost 1/3 of the pins warped and melted to the side. I had never had this happen to my previous Denman brush or any other brush for that matter. I am actually returning this to Amazon as the quality is so poor I'm going to try and find a new paddle brush.

The bristles are a good distance apart and penetrate between hair to the scalp nicely making for a decent scalp massage when brushing. The air in the brush pushes out every time you brush so it makes a whistle/wheezy sound which can be slightly annoying.Overall I'm happy I have it but would I recommend it? Meh, a 3$ brush will do just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"About right for it's price","review":"It's a decent brush; light, inexpensive at around $10, and passes the gentle test (drag the bristles along your forearm; if it leaves scratches it's too rough for your hair). However I can't speak to its overall quality or longevity as I just received it. Someone said they had theirs 9 years but I don't know if the quality has stayed the same & if the brush you get now is the same brush they made a decade ago. All I know is that it emitted a strong plastic odor after it was removed from its wrapping and it feels really cheap. I wonder how it shall hold up against heat styling. My Conair brush feels much better in terms of materials quality though it isn't this gentle. It's surprising how hard it can be to find a really good paddle brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv this brush!","review":"Get this, you will not regret it. my hair feels so silky after using this brush.

The best thing about Stanislaw Lem's stories is that he will bring up some of the most absurd angles of how our lives can be altered by technology.

Embarrassing, trite, silly, with every bad-movie cliche as dialogue. It opens with a mock end-of-the-world scenario in a war room that just sounds goofy. Cut to the fictitious country of \\"Bonterre\\" (a fictitious country in a spy novel? Are you kidding?) standing in for Vietnam. In the field, a colonel lectures that \\"guerrillas are cowards\\", then they're ambushed, he panics and has to be slapped by a sergeant and thanks him for it, while the guy with the mangled leg cracks jokes.

Loved \\"Lamb\\" more, but if you're looking for a good comedic and entertaining novel, this is good for you. It's a short read and good to keep around instead of trash magazines. Great job Christopher Moore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"Despite the irritating typos in this edition, the story itself is a page-turner from the beginning until the end. It is an engaging account of a loser who lands himself (or is it fate?) in an extraordinary adventure. Mr. Moore captures his readers' interest by allowing his characters to be bizarre and nutty. Like all his other books, Mr. Moore injects utterly dry sense of humor everywhere possible in his conceptions. The creative talent and wacky imaginations of his, produce hilarious dialogues, out-of-this-world personalities, and a completely fictitious yarn with a twist of moral that every fairy tale seems to possess. Furthermore, a story that includes a wise cannibal with an eccentric drollness is always a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cargo Cult Classic","review":"Okay, it may not be deep, but Christopher Moore's stuff is both laugh-out-loud funny and supremely entertaining...this novel is no exception. The exploits of our hero,the stranded and disgraced pilot, Tucker Case (no he's not a jerk, even if he shares a first name with one) will have you grinning ear-to-ear, all the way through...Moore is like a lighter combination of Tom Robbins and Vonnegut, and despite all the naughty goings on, he always manages to tug the heartstrings a little bit, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite of Moore's.","review":"After having read Moore's other works, this has got to be my least favorite. While I was literally laughing out loud while reading the others, while reading ISLN I kept thinking to myself, \\"Okay, when does it get funny?\\" The plot was predictable, and the humor seemed forced, like Moore was trying too hard. Characters weren't as fleshed out as in the other novels.If you want a great Moore book, try Lamb, Stupidest Angel, or A Dirty Job instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a Chief can be a tampon.","review":"Chris Moore is a mad genius. He weaves together great storytelling with unique characters that are hip and funny. You can't pin down Moore to any genre. He mixes humor and action with supernatural elements.Where else can you find a talking fruit bat and South Sea village warriors who aspire to be tampons? Don't forget the transvestite navigator.Love Nun is his best book yet and if it's your first Moore book, you had better pick up his last three (otherwise you'll be making a lot of visits to amazon or your local book store, if you don't )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"While this book is certainly not Moore's best, it does not lack his creativity and hilarity. The story is about the complex relationships between god and follower, science and humanity, and American and native island cultures. Moore especially explores how individuals can use religion and faith to control other people with the Sky Priestess and her followers. The book is a little bit of a slow read at first but it really gets going after you get past some of the exposition. My only complaint is that some beloved characters seem to disappear for long periods of time and it would have been nice to see more of them (like Kimi and Roberto).If you like this novel, and want to read more of Christopher Moore's work, I recommend Lamb and A Dirty Job. I feel that those two represent his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like other Moore Novels - BETTER","review":"I found this story to be more capturing then any of the other Moore novels that I have read. The main character is a pilot named Tuck Case who is your run of the mill looser. He gets put into one crazy situation (which I am not going to tell you about) and he rises to the occasion in more than one manner. Not only is Tuck a great character, but there are TONS of wonderful people to read about. Kimi (a transvestite hooker) and his/her bat, the Shark people, the Sky Priestess a Sorcerer and Ninjas. These characters are well rounded and more three dimensional then most people I know. Moore's best novel to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacky, inventive, and well researched...","review":"In this quick, easy and fun read, Moore spins a wacky tale about a wayward pilot and a small isolated group of former cannibals on a South Pacific island whose religion is based on a WWII flyer who crashed his plane on their island.Throw in some zany Moore-esque literary devices such as the talking fruit bat and a mysterious ghost like character who appears periodically throughout the story and you've got a wacky, inventive, and well-researched tropical tale that is a much-welcomed breath of fresh air amidst the current glut of legal dramas and spy stuff that seem to fill up the pop literature charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever. Original. Outrageously funny!","review":"I read outloud to my husband every evening after dinner, and this book gave both of us laughing tears. He even did the dishes for me, so I could start reading sooner.After we were done reading the book, we didn't want to read another book for awhile. We didn't want to crowd the after glow and joy of rehashing it.We spent days trying to figure out how it could be filmed, and ended up laughing so hard again, we never did/could resolve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Title, a Greater Book","review":"Who would of thought a book about cargo cults would be entertaining? This is a laugh out loud funny book, but it is also a story of redemption. If Christopher Moore's is the author, you must read his books. They are all irreverant and funny beyond belief!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Just too Funny to put down","review":"Tucker Case was a pilot for the Mary Jean Cosmetics Corporation until he crashed the company jet during a drunken flight with a hooker. Now he's found a job flying shady secret missions for a medical missionary from a remote Micronesian island. But something is wrong on this island paradise full of barbed wire, ninjas and minefields where the doctor's wife has set herself up as a messenger from God who needs body parts as a sacrifice.All of a sudden Tucker the loser must foil international organ smugglers, save his girl and maybe find himself along the way in a tale full of lunacy and larceny that will leave you laughing for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Moore is a hoot.","review":"I've got all but one of his books and never been disappointed in any of them. I waited months for Lamb and laughed all the way through. Don't be put off and think it is against religion because it's not. It made me think of Jesus in another way and love him more. I love all Chris Moore's books. He is sly, one of the funniest writers I've read. You have to be careful and may go back and read something over and over again just for pleasure or to see if he really did say that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest book I've read in years!","review":"If you have a taste for darkish humor this may be just the book for you. Reminiscent of Early Vonnegut, it is a rip roaring adventure that features ghosts, sex, a talking bat, and multiple airplane thefts. One of the great endings in modern literature and a completely charming cast of characters...even if some of them are cannibals or cross dressers. This book is so much fun that it's a miracle that the conservatives haven't banned it!

After reading \\"Lamb\\", and enjoying it tremendously, I just had to read more of his works, and I selected this one because of the wierd title, and it turned out to be a good choice. Where else can you read a plot about a disgraced pilot, a cross-dressing Filipino with a talking fruitbat, a ghostly airman who is considered a god, a cannibal, Japanese ninjas, cargo cult natives, and a pseudo-goddess. These are only some of the more unusual aspects of this writer's odd mind, and they combine into a very entertaining read. Not great literature, I grant you, but a terrific way to spend some hours chuckling to yourself, and often laughing out loud, to the consternation of those around you. Of course, with the rather ribald cover, you don't necessarily want to call attention to yourself in public, but a brown paper book cover will do nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, not great","review":"not his best book , but still ok. its funny and exciting enough for non christopher moore fans (or fans in the making)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fun","review":"This book is total zaniness and definitely not to be taken seriously.

Unfortunately, I was very dissappointed. I read to about page 70 and just couldn't keep going. The plot was going nowhere, the story dragged and bored me. The Doctor is absent from most pages, and his new companions bored me to tears. This Dyson Sphere planet is a clever idea--almost too clever. The setting, the super-advanced world is dull and empty. In addition, the names of the natives are full of capital letters for some reason. What's more, there are exclamation points in the middle of their names. I found the names annoying, and the book tedious. I tried to finish it, but I couldn't waste my time.Instead, I would highly recommend The Festival of Death--a terrific Fourth Doctor story by Jonathan Morris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evergreen goddess","review":"Wow Haugen has blended beautiful songs to describe the Lenten season.

Fires of love surged through Clay's blood the instant his blue eyes locked with the violet of Sabrina's. He held her bound against him with iron-hard arms, crushing her soft, pliant curves to his body, claiming her honey-sweet mouth with his own. He had bought her, he would use her-but he'd never love her until the day she whispered...Tame My Wild Heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"Mr. Pelucir obviously has an obsession with FARSCAPE.

I agree that some of the episodes took some real negative swipes at women, which was disappointing since the show has such strong women characters. It's great that Pelucir calls them out on that because no one wants to see that on such a good show.Although a few photos would have been nice, I understand from my uncle who is an entertainment lawyer, that only official guides can have photographs and quotes. This was news to me, but it makes sense. Henson and CO probably wouldn't be too keen on critiques that aren't 100% positive, but that's what makes this book cool.Season 2 is generally better than season 1--in most shows--because everyone is hitting their groove and this book is a great way to experience the show, whether for the first time or for the hundreth time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Book","review":"As with the previous book in this series, you get nice episode recaps paired with thoughtful, careful analysis provided by someone who often does not really understand the show and is completely oblivious of this shortcoming.

Remember that without Herod the Great, this removes a good portion of \\"Christmas Story\\" narrative of the Bible. The magi wouldn't meet Herod asking him about the birth of the King of the Jews. They wouldn't have gone to Bethlehem and been warned in dream not to return to Herod. Then Herod wouldn't have gone into a frenzy and ordered the slaughter of all male children 2 years and under. Joseph wouldn't have been warned in a dream to take Mary and Jesus to Egypt.

He stays on topic, uses plain English that is neither pompous nor sophmoric and makes reading the bible a far more interesting experience.His thoughts are well researched, explained in detail and, I believe, based on a common sense approach.

It can be argued that the Nephilim were perhaps on the earth before the son's of God, who are described as 'Divine beings' in the original hebrew translation, saw the daughters of men. So if only another human can reproduce with a human woman, then who were the sons of God, as it clearly states in Gen. 6 that women had children to them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little leaven leavens the whole lump","review":"If people would simply stop using corrupt bible text, a lot of problems would be taken care of.

When if you would use the KJV bible based on a perfect Old testament Masoretic text in Isa:14:12: How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! There are tons of corruptions found in the corrupt version he is using; from a virgin will conceive to a maiden will, from David killed Goliath to Elhannon did, from gossip is a bad thing to it's choice morsels,Yahweh instead of Jesus and Jehovah, and etc.....

I normally read books on spiritual warfare and the fight against spirit beings in a personal way but this book and others like it give you history and background on these spirit beings.

Except for the initial introduction dealing with the measurements and other statistics on the Giza pyramid, nothing else within the book correlated the Nephilim with the pyramid except in the very last chapter.The author seemed to skip around and go off on tangents and did not remain focused on one point/topic at a time. Oftentimes he would repeat the same information over and over again.I did find some useful information (info which basically was the author's conjecture and not factual).

I really appreciate his efforts to render clear the many Old Testiment references to the giants - a subject seemingly avoided by traditional scholarship. This book fills many gaps in our understanding of the origins and histories of our world. I found Heron's approach of pulling information from multiple disciplines highly effective, and his arguments were, for the most part, quite solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply one man's opinion","review":"I can't recommend this book to anyone. It's simply the author's opinion, supported by absolutely no facts or objective material.In fact, even the title is misleading as there is very little material about the pyramids.The bulk of the text is reprinted from the author's previous work and documents his opinion of the coming apocalypse foretold in the bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating","review":"One of the most fascinating books I've read in a long time.

I'm sure it has to do with the publisher's here in America making sure their coffers are kept full. But seriously if I can by a book from the Uk site I think a kindle version should work as well.

I would say it is definitely on the PhD level."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use it often","review":"This is an interesting item that I use often but its a little expensive for what it is. It speeds up counting a little but not significantly so because while/after you're loading it you have to be sure that every slot is filled or its inaccurate. Sometimes when you put in a stack the slots are under/overfilled which you need to correct.This is useful for when counting a cashier drawer but if you're doing more you might as well get a coin sorter, if less then count by hand. I find its easiest to use this tray with 1 type of coin at a time so you can just flip the tray over to empty it out.As for the picture, the color is accurate but it actually looks more likePM Company SecurIT Counter Change Tray, 9.75 x 7.625 x 1.625 Inches, Beige, 1 per Box (05025)than the one provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works and it saves time","review":"Periodically I need to deposit a collection of coins. This tray has simplified the task. Since each segment only handles five coins it is easy to quickly verify the exact count of each type of coin.I discovered this tray after asking the teller at my bank what she used to keep track of coins. This is the exact same tray all the tellers at the branch use. In my opinion, that is a strong recommendation.Previous I tried a less expansive coin tray which used a marker on the side of each coin trough to indicate number of coins. I discovered that older coins wear to the point which rendered the indicators inaccurate on some coins. There was always a question in my mind if there really were 50 coins so I ended up counting them by hand anyway.This tray works well and is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the other same but much cheap book.

Especially the puzzles by Melissa and Doug that open and inside are hidden images or magnets.The latch puzzle that we purchased was terrible. The sliding latch door lock simply fell out of the latch when you moved the puzzle - thus was to easy and way to loose. The most disapointing is the window latch and trunck latch. Both these two required adult hand strength to open! I had to hold the puzzle flat with one hand and grip the window latch with the other in order to manipulate it open. And I have very strong hands and it was hard for me (an adult) to open!! Perhaps it was JUST our puzzle. So I returned it. The other puzzles are sold in tight plastic wrap and so we weren't able to TRY another latch to see if it is not so HARD. So that is 3 defunct out of 6 latches that my daughter wasn't able to play with.

Don't we lock our medicine cabinets? Then why would we want to teach our kids to open them?????!!!!!!!! I think there are many other items out there that can teach fine motor skills.

That being said, this movie was terrible in its attempt to be a \\"Bond movie\\". The reasons are numerous and I won't list them. If you want to see a pretty good action movie, then you will enjoy \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (though not nearly as much as any installment from the Bourne Trilogy).

It's not even coherent enough to make you dizzy...you just sit there completely clueless as to what's going on.What's more, I'm just not down with the whole Bond as a \\"blunt instrument\\" thing these last two movies are promoting. That is not Bond. Bond is a suave, subtle, nuanced instrument who uses brains and ingenuity, and when all else fails, cool, gee-whiz gadgets...always the polished gentleman, and the ultimate ladies man (one look and they swoon). Daniel Craig is none of those things. I didn't like him as a choice when he was first announced, but decided to withhold judgment. But after two films I'm decided: he's not Bond.

The camera angles and action sequences are reminiscent of \\"Crank\\" and \\"Ronin\\". I kept waiting for that classic Bond wit and nifty little gadgets, but they just never arrived. There really isn't even any acting in this movie accept for the stunt doubles. No memorable lines, scenes, etc. It is just one fast-paced roller-coaster ride.

Want to take a good look at one of the actors in this film - good luck. They are on the screen and then off in a flash. This director is pathetic. The actors don't have time to act before it's CUT to the next shot. Garbage. Worst James Bond film ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Action, but No Continuity for a James Bond thriller","review":"Being a James Bond fan, I was very disappointed with the editing, andlack of directing to develop a concrete thriller that James Bond movies normally provide. Scenes would cut mid sentence, then a blow-up scene,then back to another 10 second conversation, then another action scene.It lacked credibility, and seemed bent on minute to minute blow-up actionscenes that didn't make any sense.I should have saved my money, and watched it at the $2 theater instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Let Down","review":"From an objective point of view it was an ok action movie.From a Bond fan POV, where the hell was Bond?

No, all action and very lacking story. I feel they pumped so much action into this to cover such a slow, boring, story line.

I watched it three times trying to find some reason to rate it more highly. It is only Daniel Craig's excellence in portraying Bond that earns the movie a second star. The plot is non-existent, the characters unengaging, and the action is impossible to follow as the scenes shift all over the globe. Killing off Mathis and chucking his body into a dumpster was an incredibly pointless bit. As others have suggested, the film was more like a compilation of action sequences from the cutting room floor of Casino Royale, which, in my mind, may be the best Bond of all time. And I saw Dr. No in its theatrical release, so I have observed a lot of different treatments of Fleming's character within their generational context. I hope Craig is given better material to work with in the next one. This one crashed aand burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed, Casino Royale is 5stars!","review":"After watching Casino Royale... then this.. disapointed, it was just plain boring.. like watching a tv series.

Last summer, I read all the Bond novels in order. Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is more like the Ian Fleming vision than any of the previous actors', including, even, Sean Connery. This is easily the most sober of the Bond films. Lots of exciting action, only over-the-top in the same way as are the action scenes, in say, the Bourne movies. (And the fight scenes seem clearly to owe much to the Bourne films.)That said, to be successful, Craig is going to have to tweak it a bit. We can enjoy a more serious and realistic Bond, as an offset to the serial nonsense which are the Roger Moore films. But he can't be a total downer indefinitely. We're going to want to like the guy at some point and we're going to need at least a little of that Bond humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Picture and Sound Quality","review":"The audio quality is awesome even on my sub-par 800w surround sound system. The movie is exhilirating, what more can one say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excitement at a Very Fast Pace","review":"I like this Bond, and he is the epitome of the harshness and down and dirty attitude of what a Bond character should be. Not entirely lacking in the proper British procedure, this Bond is fully knowledgeable in the art of full departure of authourity. I liked the movie, but I was just a little annoyed by its super fast pace and the story line, which I felt could have been punched up with the magic that most of the Bonds acquired from Q division. Each Bond actor has given their all to this worthy character and Mr. Craig is definately a keeper. I look forward to well thought out plots, filled with the gadgetry and the confident and intelligent, \\"James Bond.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Craig--","review":"I haven't seen this, but it is for someone for Christmas who loves the movie so Glad that I was able to get it for under $10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good...ehh movie","review":"This movie picks up right after \\"Casino Royale\\" and much like most sequels, it is more action and less substance. It is different from the previous movie partly because there is a new director at the helm. The Blu-ray looked good for the most part, and there are a few extras that's worth looking at. If you are a true Bond fan, then you will eventually get this. Otherwise, wait till is around $12 then it might be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Bond movie, not a great Bond movie","review":"Among all the argument of the \\"best Bond\\" actors, Daniel Craig brings a grittiness that harkens back to Sean Connery's original portrayal. QOS picks up where Casino Royale leaves off, and while CR is among the very best of the 20+ Bond movies for action and plot depth, QOS begins just as strong but fizzles at the end. This is still a great action movie, if you can suffer through the final 15 minutes, and a good addition to the Bond series. The supporting cast is outstanding - Casting Judy Dench as M a few movies ago was a stroke of genius, and she continues to expand the role beyond any predecessor. The remaining cast of repeat and fly-by characters are well-cast and well-acted. The opening chase scenes are not to be missed. It's just unfortunate that the final scenes are filmed in a soundstage-turned amusement park ride that is a little too much in the vein of a debacle like Moonraker (which is the very worst Bond movie in the entire series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Bond film...","review":"This is going to be quick. This movie is really good. It is not however as good as Casino Royale. If you are a fan of good movies, you will like this. If you are holding onto the past wishing you could have the campy old Bond back, you will be disappointed. This movie was not made to make old James Bond fans happy. The movies themselves had slipped considerably and a reboot was needed. Please stop complaining that this isn't your daddy's James Bond. He, thankfully, has gone the way of the dinosaur..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond, Jane Bond","review":"The producers made a mistake casting Daniel Craig as Bond. I mean a BLONDE James Bond? Whatever happened to tall, DARK and handsome?Perhaps, it is not Craig's fault but more the producers' and directors'. Craig's Bond is kind of a perfunctory action figure. There are plenty of kicks and punches but he is strangely cold and lifeless, just like someone who's had a lobotomy. The previous characterizations by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan are full of British wit and humour to say the least.Finally, there was a shot of Craig in the earlier movie rising out of the sea in square trunks ala Ursula Andress and Halle Berry. What are the producers trying to do? Capture a slice of the pink market? I mean, Bond is as straight as hell. Jane Bond anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It keeps getting worse and worse.","review":"The James Bond series is not as interesting or quality since Pierce Brosnan left. Action scenes go too fast, and they are getting too stupid with the high-tech stuff. Familiar theme songs that used to be the hallmark of the series have all but fallen by the wayside, and the new artists whose songs are in the movie are anything but talent. This is the first time that my husband and I did not go to the movies to see a new James Bond film, and I am glad we rented instead of sat through this boring, disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, disappointing mess","review":"This film tries to cotninue on in the understated vein of is predecessor, the excellent Casino Royale. Instead it is a tremoundous bore, quite possibly the worst Bond film ever made. The fimmakers' attempt to be realistic backfires, as the villains are boring and the action is anitclimactic. Just acept that Bond fans want over the top escapism, and don't sacrifice a good time for dry storylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good combo pack","review":"Daniel Craig gets my vote as the best Bond (despite my wife's love for Connery).

Missing in this 'new bond' are any accessory gadgets, weapons or other, and I missed that aspect of this Bond. I mean, even the studliest stud Bond could use at least a machine gun watch, anti-gravity system, or something! This Bond, as in past episodes, enjoys the same questionable perks as previous Bonds; i.e., always given the chance to survive some gambit designed to 'kill' him instead of a quick bullet in the brain-housing-group as provided to others, without so much as a thank you for your interest, trying to undo the dastardly quack pursuing world domination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantum of Solace (purchase)","review":"Purchased this version on line and the quality is very poor.

I loved Casino Royale. And this movie feels like an extention of that movie. Craig is again awesome as James Bond. Pretty darn close to be the best James Bond of the whole series. (It's really tough to beat Sean Connery). The only thing that holds this movie back a little was the villian. James Bond has always had classic memorable villians. And the short guy in this movie was not scary or intimidating and not memorable. And James Bonds needs a challange. I'm already looking forward for the next Bond Movie. I hope Craig stays on for a long time. One thing that has stayed consistant is the beautiful women. Quantum of Solace definitely has hot women. But also another draw back is that there was no Female villian. There is nothing hotter than a dangerous Bond Girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond has a quantum amount of solace","review":"Although not as good as Casino Royale, this one is acceptable, following Bond from the anger of the woman who tricked him, to his conclusion that she indeed loved him and died for him, as Bond attempts to foil the plot of an unknown organization whose power reaches even MI-6 ranks. Action-packed and great stunts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Bond movie is good, but...","review":"I've been around since Doctor No was released, and had read all the books before that.

Of course, he'd probably only do one movie as the character, but what a Bond he would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst bond, rent before u buy","review":"Probably the worst bond film ever made. No plot, no story, mindless violence and action without any dramatic build up. I found it terribly boring.

Take a closer look at the artwork on the cover of this DVD and you'll see what I'm talking about. It pictures James Bond walking off into a vast wasteland while this ridiculous prop burns in the background. What a perfect metephor for this turkey.Has it come to this?

Not only does it bring in all the inaccuracies of Casino Royale i.e. cell phones and other modern technology as well as M being a woman, but there is no real storyline. It is not a Bond film, it is 102 minutes of explosions and gunfire. Bond films have always, until Casino Royale, had just the right amount of action and story. Hopefully this will be the last Bond movie with Daniel Craig. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace ruined James Bond.Do not buy this DVD unless you are 8 years old and all you care about is CGI and no story."},{"rating":"1","title":"quantum of solace","review":"In the tradition of doing a Bond film, you must follow in the long line of previous films to a certain degree, this film has totally lost the mark on that point.

The classy, clever Bond films have been annihilated by senseless action scenes supporting a weak plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"rating DVD quality not film","review":"I will buy my DVD's at the store from now on.

Everything else I\\"ve played lately has worked. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Craig rocks.","review":"To the many people who didn't like this movie... I don't know what to say. I think a major appeal of this movie for me is that it isn't the \\"normal\\" James bond. after watching Casino Royale and then going to see Quantum, I rented all the previous bonds. what a terrible mess! not a single one of them approached the level of movie goodness that Casino Royale or Quantum had. one of my favorite movies, and my second favorite bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quark of So-So","review":"Quantum of Solace does not live up to the promise of Casino Royale. Although director Marc Foster has done great work in the past with Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, and The Kite Runner, Foster's not an action director. Sorry, he's not. Character, story, and action are neither shaken nor stirred but scrambled. Daniel Craig can do so much more than jump from one stunt to the next as he does here - see Layer Cake, Defiance, and yes, Casino Royale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Step Backwards From Casino Royale","review":"I was not a Bond fan prior to Casino Royale. However I loved it and thought Daniel Craig was excellent. I was looking forward to QOS and boy was I disappointed. Weak script, lousy pacing, silly villains and mindless action sequence after mindless action sequence. What a letdown. This was a step backward in my opinion for the series. Casino Royale was a shot in the arm for an ailing franchise. If QOS is a sign of what's to come, I won't be along for the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely amazing...","review":"Not the movie. But the fact that a movie can be so great and entertaining and it's sequel is lamentable. Don't waste your time on this. Watch Casino Royale again. The plot of QOS makes absolutely no sense, the fighting scenes are brutal, the entire film is boring and dull, I can't understand what the villain is saying, and the Bond girls aren't particularly pretty. The lead has some weird scar or burn on her back (as the character) and it's ugly. Sexy Daniel Craig scowls throughout. He does his best; it's the script that's terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantum of Emptiness","review":"Sorrowfully, I watched approximately 30 minutes of this drivel, has the world gone mad? A movie needs a real plot, sheer violence, noise, blood and mind trash won't fill the bill. I feel sorry for those with a favorable review, for it means that they have settled for the very least in entertainment, flying bodies in chase scenes, which occur every few minutes, and moving so fast through the cameras lens that they are indiscernable as whether they are villian or ''secret agent''. A sensible reason for this mass slaughter escapes the movie, with a thin, and transparent story line. I can get pretty much the same line of entertainment in ''South Park'', and even that makes more sense. Hopefully, I wait for another ''Bourne'' movie, with a real plot, some human relationships, and violence where necessary, not as the main theme. Count this one out.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finishes the story","review":"Still the badass Bond of Daniel Craig - who is my new #1 007, with Connery as a very close second - but not near the excitement of Casino Royale.

After seeing this film twice (once in the theater and once in Blu-ray), I was a little disappointed. Granted, Craig is excellent as always as the newly re-invented Bond (quite a change from the silly Roger Moore Bonds!) and the action is plentiful--yet the ending of this sequel was unresolved--or else Paul Haggis just wanted us to imagine what happened to the agent Bond was stalking and holding responsible for Vesper Lind's death.

We see the evolution of Bond from man driven towards brutal revenge to a man driven to total revenge by crawling up the ladder of enemies.

Beautiful female agent? Check. M bugging him all the time? Check. Gadgets galore? Um...not so much other than the cool computer that projects on the wall. Ugly villains out to oppress the world? Check.All of the usual components of a Bond film are here with the addition of an angry 007 who is out to avenge the death of his girlfriend. This was done once before in the series when Bond's newly-wedded wife is killed, but a lot of time has passed since then. Also besides the car chase, there's a boat chase and an airplane chase thrown in for good measure. The action is constant from beginning to end and the special effects are at times breathtaking. Bond fans will surely enjoy this latest film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldfinger Got His Wish","review":"\\"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.\\" Well, he has. I detected serious illness in Casino Royale, and now he is gone. His replacement is a grim, humorless, unsophisticated thug who should be armed not with a PPK but with a spiked club. He shows no dedication to Queen, country, or right. He is quite repulsive. He goes, not to beautiful, exciting places, but to squalid collections of shacks and featureless deserts (which is a good place for him, I admit). His adversary is about as interesting as a bowl of porridge. Ah, well. We have The Twenty (or 21, if you, like me, rather like NSNA). Farewell, James.

But the movie itself? I'm having a problem with the last couple Bond flicks: with each subsequent movie, they become more and more difficult to understand or make sense of. This one left me completely in the dark. By the end of this film, I still didn't understand who the bad guy was or what he had done, or why, I couldn't make heads or tails of the bad guy's ultimate goal, who was working for who, or why anything was happening at all.

Quantum of Solace has a more interesting plot which picks up just minutes after the end of Casino Royale.

Surprisingly poor direction and a script that is confusing and non-engaging.Example: At the end, when Bond confronts the villain, \\"Green\\" states that he's told Bond everything he wanted to know about Quantum. Problem is, the viewer has never seen this scene in the film!! Incredible, and the fault of the director.The action scenes have nice set-up, but are also very poorly directed; with the viewer never really sure what's going on.The theme song by Jack White is the weakest ever for a Bond film, and completely absent is thetrademark Bond theme song.Even the sound quality is weak, with much of the dialogue incomprehensible.

All it does is convey movement and make you nauseous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst James Bond Movie!","review":"After watching this movie, I was left with a feeling of disapointment as it did not live up to the standard of a great or even a good James Bond Movie. It was the worst James Bond movie I had ever seen. It lacked the usual James \\"Bond features such as gimmicks and cars that were amazing and the acting was so unenthusiastic that it put me to sleep!. At times it was even hard to remember that this was a movie about the great 007 agent who outwitted so many great adversaries.

The downfall of this movie is the girl that plays Camille, Olga Kurylenko. She's a terrible actress. She's got a pretty nice body, and that's how she gets acting jobs I guess. There is also a lame bad guy in this film too.

I don't care what the original original intention of the Bond inventor was. Craig's predecessors created a character over decades. Some played him tougher, some with more irony, some with less. But Bond always had class, a sense of humor and charm - everything neither Craig nor the Craig-Bond scripts have. Just speed, pure action and graphic violence might be enough to make a good action movie, but it's not enough to make a good Bond movie, it's rather the contrary. There is simply no need to reinvent the Bond character, just as there is no need to reinvent Sherlock Holmes, Charlie Chan, Superman, Laurel and Hardy or any other classic character. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond movie ever","review":"No reason to belabor these comments - if you enjoyed the Connery/Bond movies, you will find this to be a deeply and excruciatingly painful degradation of the Ian Fleming novels.

And the acting was awful. I watched the whole thing hoping it would get better. It didn't. I remember James Bond from the past. I used to like these flicks. But I am now turned off completely.

No gadgets. No fun. No \\"Bond, James Bond\\". He doesn't even say \\"Shaken not stirred\\". The producers/directors decided instead of trying out their approach with their own creation, decided to steal someone else's creativity. Oh, by the way their creativity isn't their own either; Watch a Bourne Identy movie. Better story, better action, and filmed better too.Where's the Bond?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond Ever","review":"I would rate it as the worst Bond ever for at least two reasons. The first one for me was the opening title theme which is suppose to set the tone for the rest of the film. It was harsh, discordant, and unmelodic. Most Bond themes I remember would either become hit songs in their own right, or at least warrant airplay time as stand-alone pieces of worthwhile music. The theme for \\"Quantum of Solace\\" seems to be famous just for who performs it and not for any intrinsic value to the composition. In other words, It Sucks. The second reason is that the Bond humor is gone, and the plot is weak. I had no feelings at all for the characters and no desire to spend one hour and a half with them, and especially no feeling of danger from the bad guy, he didn't seem threatening; just annoying, and what is that with the exploding hotel? I would guess that this film may be just a stepping stone in Bond's further development and that a really good third movie with Daniel Craig is coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly tedious","review":"What a boring movie - I eventually fast forwarded it to get to the end. The only decent performance was by Dench, who could have done it inb her sleep. No tension. No plot. No nothing, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantum Bond","review":"I really like the new James Bond film. Lots of action and high drama. The only problem I have with this movie is the rating. There is a scene in the film where the girl who took the Colonel's beer to his room is being undressed by the colonel himself. That should be considered R-rated instead of PG-13 rated. All in All, a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond movie ever","review":"Daniel Craig lookinf so bored and disgusted playing his role should tell us right away what a bad movie this was going to be.

Aside from being convoluted, plodding, and confusing unless you watched the previous movie 5 minutes ago, it's missing all the trappings of what makes James Bond, well, James Bond.No gadets, no Q, no Moneypenny, etc.There have been James Bond movies before that I didn't love, but this is the first one I hated.If you haven't seen the previous film, check it out - it's pretty terrific. No idea what happened, but they really blew this sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"big drop off","review":"I am a fan of the 007 series. This movie however is a big drop off from the quality of Casino Royale. I really liked Craig in his first Bond role. I wanted to like this movie and was excited to see it, but sadly it was disappointing. I understood after seeing it why it was getting such bad reviews across the board. Just too boring for me, lacking cool 007 gadgets. Hopefully, the next one will improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"You only got one shot, make it count","review":"This is the worst Bond film I've ever seen. That said, the institution of such brings high expectations. Opening with an incredibly weak action sequence, the film segués from one action scene to the next with dialogue and context jammed awkwardly between. The pace was rushed. The chemistry between characters was pushed or simply not given time to develop in intimate scenes. Such sandwiching of detail resulted in the constant spewing of information in dialogue. Conversations didn't seem natural they were so laden with detail needed to advance the plot. Even Bond's trademark steamy sex scene was cropped of sensuality or intrigue. The witty humor of Bond, himself, was absent. The soundtrack was one of the few consistent points of interest. Had this film been stripped of the franchise and made under a different context it could have stood with some touch-up. As a Bond film it was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time For Bond to Retire","review":"The problem with QoS is that the villain is about as threatening as a Care Bear, and rather than getting his hands on nuclear missiles, he's attempting to corner 60% of the Bolivian water market. This would be weak enough if it affected somewhere in the US, but Bolivia? In an issue that would barely raise an eyebrow at the UN, Britain obviously decides to send its number one spy to fix the problem.In between a chain of over-the-top action sequences there's an InstantMix plot of no consequence. The plot points are TV-grade: in one 'pivotal' scene, Bond overhears the villain's master plans while hiding behind a fence. This is as much for the audience's benefit as for Bond's, in case we missed the over-signaled evil plan while being confused about the movie's title. Out-Bonded by True Lies and mercilessly parodied in Austin Powers, I think Bond's time may be over. It's really a shame since Casino Royale wasn't a good reboot of the franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Entry to the Series","review":"This may be the worst Bond Movie since the Lazenby fiasco.

I've never read one of Ian Fleming's books and this is only about the 4th Bond film I've watched. Unfortunately, Quantum of Solice reminded me why.I could only make it through about an hour of the movie. The non-stop violence got old very quickly. I saw Casino Royale, Mr. Craig's first Bond outing, and enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm not sure if it was because I thought Mr. Craig was a better Bond or what--but it certainly had more story. Quantum had minimal storyline used, solely it would appear, as a means of stringing together multiple chase scenes and shootings. With testosterone overflow, they were going for the lowest common denominator with this one.

This dour, humorless, James Bond is great at driving cars, boats, and killing people, but he's no hero to me or even interesting. The actions scenes go on forever, and the technique of overlapping and editing between some grand staged event and something terrible going on behind the scenes is cliche to me already and it's done at least twice in this movie for extended periods of time.

While flash editing has been used effectively before many times, it usually isn't combined with fast moving and deliberately over-shaky hand held camera work, and for good reason. Rather than impress, the action scenes in Quantum of Solace simply disorient the viewer.

Perhaps a lot of people were turned off by a Bond sequel, but I personally liked seeing a continuation of Casino Royale. Craig is, again, terrific as Bond, portraying the character with a newfound sense of revenge and hostility."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is so phony","review":"Didn't care for it like the rest of his movies. A man only out to make a name for himself I find it hard to swallow people actually believe his bull.

Showing free videos weeks before an election to try to sway votes? REMEMBER 2004!!!! LoL!!! I guess the desperation never stops!I guess this just proves how empty of a suit Obama really is and how scared the libs are about losing the election.I wonder what video editing Michael Moore did in this video? I know he edited that newspaper article in his last movie with a fake headline. Maybe he edited G. W. Bush in a Nazi uniform with his hurricane making machine!Sad, very sad that people consider him a \\"true\\" documentary film maker. However, he is a brilliant capitalist, he found a fringe group that he can cater to and make money off of.God Bless the U.S.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoluet dreck","review":"I went into this hoping to see some of the Roger & Me goodness, instead I got the bowling for columbine badness; the inept, heavy handed obvious fiction passed as fact.Don't waste your time, boring and poorly done fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is terrible","review":"I am not sure how anyone can stomach this. If you hate America, this might be the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great STORYTELLER!","review":"Despite what side of the aisle you fall on, you must admit that film maker Michael Moore is a gifted story teller. He manages to take documentary film to the next level and makes it all entertaining, while simultaneously making you think.Sure he pushes buttons but maybe that's the beauty of it all. Moore gets people, especially young people, excited and involved in the politics of the day.Watching SLACKER UPRISING was very entertaining and you see how Moore inspires people to get involved, whether or not they agree with him. Not only was the documentary entertaining, but it kept my interest. And I must admit that this is the FIRST feature length movie that I've watched on my computer ever! So that's saying a lot. And the fact that it was on Amazon VOD for free was even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No closed caption","review":"I saw this free online and it was worth watching but I won't buy it because it has no closed caption.

I fear for the next generation. I wish I could get back the time spent watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember when documentaries were worth something??","review":"Seriously, I really wish this guy would stop making these \\"documentaries\\". Roger and Me was brilliant, but since then it's been all about his agenda, they should be called \\"propaganda-mentaries\\" since all he edits so much of his material to make it fit his point.Films like this make me want to be a \\"slacker\\" because it shows just how much crap is going on. If a documentary film maker can't even make a documentary correctly the what's the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Uninteresting","review":"Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker capable of creating excellent documentaries (\\"Bowling For Columbine,\\" \\"Sicko\\") but his latest work feels more like a sloppy collection of out-of-date footage, complete with several full-length musical performances that serve only as filler. I have no problem with Moore's political views (in fact I am a Democrat proudly voting for Obama), and I appreciate that this video was available as a free download via his website and through Tivo/Amazon, but time is money and this film just isn't worth the time it takes to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connecting college and politics","review":"I knew Michael Moore liked to annoy Republicans, but I didn't know he went this far with it. I have major respect for his determination and power in politics. Regardless of the turnout overall in the 2004 election, his success with college students is something to applaud. The amount of pressure the organizers were under and the money being put up to ban him shows he's a threat...and influential. Giving out Ramen noodles and clean underwear was classic college supply needs. This was a great documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"cant recommend this enough! great movie! Michael Moore isn't usually one of my favorites but i fully enjoyed this one!To see someone like this doing good is refreshing!this is a must see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Amber!","review":"I not sure what to say about this movie but dont bother. The only reason I did see it was for Amber Benson. She must have done it to fund one of her own movies. Anyways the movie it about these two couple who go to the caves of Mexico to score some pot to sale. Well the caves are haunted by really stupid ghosts. They begin to kill them off one by one they must some how escape this cursed cave. There not much here for as a story line and the gore is just to cheesy. I will give it this at least they hired actors who can act but it really was not a origanal story or one worth watching. Thats why I say poor Amber because she is great actress in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Even if your a fan of hers it does not help this film not to mention they kill her off really early in the movie. Maybe she wanted it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda known better","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I wish that Amber had quit after she broke her foot, Cerina had passed it by and ridden on the dubious glory of \\"Cabin Fever\\" and poor, poor Ed Furlong had just stayed in rehab (from which he CLEARLY had just escaped). These folks are all lovely people and MUCH better actors than the drek they are stuck with in this film would indicate. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A forgettable movie...","review":"I had expected the film to be interesting, but this one failed in the emotion department. Don't expect to really feel anything. The film centers around two couples, who decide to go into a cavern along the Mexico to buy drugs. Little do they know that the caverns are hanted by ghosts, that are murdering people.If it hadn't for Amber Benson, I wouldn't have known or much less care about the film. Her acting in Buffy made me curious to see this. Well. It wasn't a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR!","review":"How could anyone in their right mind pay to see this. They should stop the sale of this dvd immediately! This movie makes no sense. These kids are running around in circles in this cave, Eddie Furlong is screeching at his friends. The lights in the cave flicker and go out in one scene, and it's complete darkness, at other times there is still light and shadows. When the girl gets cut in half, she is obviously buried in the dirt as you can see the ground moving. Another character, Wes gets sucked into the ground and comes out on the level below. He goes from wearing a backpack, to no backpack, and then it is back on again. Very poor acting and dialogue, as well as not so special effects.Don't waste your time, not even a good film to watch and make fun of, it's just that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermedio ( The Inbetween )","review":"So-So movie. I bought this movie because first, it looked interesting and secondly, I got the DVD at a good price. One of the reasons I wanted to see this film is because Steve Railsback ( Ed Gein ) stars in it. I think he's a great actor! In short, this is a movie that takes place in the caves of Mexico where the dead become alive...... evil dead. Four friends decide to take an expedition into the caves. They find the caverns a underground graveyard full of tortured ghosts who want them to be their prey. Some good moments, some not so good, some boring parts, but overall not a terrible movie. I just wish that Steve Railsback had a bigger starring role in this film. A little gore adds to the 2 star rating. A movie I'd suggest just renting before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost sad","review":"I was almost sad for Edward Furlong in this film. He has really gone down hill.

But no such luck.Like probably a lot of people, I saw this movie because I'm a fan of one of the cast, Amber Benson. Thank god for the quick turn-around of Netflix or I would've been mad about paying to see this instead of just highly disappointed. I can't speak for the rest of the cast, but I know Amber Benson is capable of much better than this. The so-called plot gave the cast nothing to work with, the direction stank, the sets were so obviously cheap, and the \\"special effects\\" were the lamest of the lame.I once heard Amber Benson spoke of one of her other films, Taboo, and told people not to pay to see it because it was so bad. If she said that about Taboo, I can't even imagine what she would say about Intermedio."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of the worst","review":"There is nothing good, or even okay, about this film. From the writing, which includes glaring errors like bloody corpses rotting in a cave smelling like fermaldihide, to jumpy camera angle changes, lighting jumping from blue-muted to daylight-natural in the same scene, to some of the worst dialog and acting, physical and emotional, ever displayed in a commercially distributed film. I should not forget mention the choppy and not interactive special effects, you see an effect, you see actors, you see an effect, you see bloody actors, but never does an effect and an actor meet. Again, this is the worst of the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Thomas the Train lover","review":"My 3 1/2 year old son loves Thomas and received his first oval track for Christmas last year from a relative. It was always one of his favorite toys, but he was getting a little bored with the same small track, so this year we bought him the Mountain Overpass set. He absolutely loves it, but does get frustrated because, like the other reviewers pointed out, the battery operated trains do not run well on this set. The twists and turns are very tight, and the trains constantly fall over. Also, before buying this set, be aware that the larger, plastic battery operated Thomas trains do not fit through the tunnel at all. My son was very upset about that when we first put the track together. Overall, it's a great set for any Thomas lover, and my son does love playing with his non-battery operated trains with this set, though it would be nice to find a set that's geared towards the battery operated trains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for push cars, but no good for battery powered","review":"The battery powered trains slip and slide going up the ramps. Very disappointing. I switched the ramps for my son with Brio track and the trains do a bit better. Have to set an incline with normal straight track going into the ramp for it to work.Other than that is is well built, but a bit too loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS IT...","review":"...the only map of the Chicago area you'll need. You can get rid of all those others lying around your car in various stages of disintegration.Published by venerable Rand McNally & Co of Skokie, IL, this conveniently spiral-bound street guide is clear, accurate, detailed, up-to-date, durable, easy to use, chock full of helpful information, and covers virtually all of the sprawling greater Chicago area. It's invaluable for drivers who sell or deliver, helpful to those who've driven here all their lives, and indispensable for those who, like me, are directionally challenged. It is where I turn (before leaving home) to verify local Mapquest information, which can be inaccurate and which frequently does not offer the most desirable route. In addition, this book is a great buy at the Amazon.com price.I have also used the Dallas (Texas) version, and these guides are even more helpful for unfamiliar territory because they don't leave anything out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single glove","review":"I didn't check the item closely enough to notice that the package only contains 1 glove - not a pair - which was disappointing to me. However, it would have cost me more money to return it, so I kept it. The material is somewhat flimsy and the material does not cover enough of the fingers for me. I would have preferred the glove to come up to the first knuckle or above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, backing comes unglued","review":"I completely agree with one of the other reviews. This is an expensive mat when you see that that the backing comes unglued. Our mat also is now warped. Yes, the kids do not know what the problem is, but they do realize that all of their cars do not run on the mat properly. This would be better if not a felt top, but rather an actual woven carpet with design. We barely used this carpet when the ungluing happened. Find a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I found this book fascinating. Okay, it's not a war story. But it offers some wonderful insights into American society as it was half a century ago. It's also a wonderful reminder for Americans of just how free we are, and how precious our freedom is.My only complaints about this book are (1) that my copy lacked the listed illustrations, and (2) that it didn't have an epilogue. I'd love to hear the rest of Gaertner's story, i.e., what happened to him after 1985.One other thing about the story that I found remarkable is its resemblance to another one. Fugitive enters the U.S. surreptitiously, gets job as a draftsman, puts down roots on the West Coast. Bit of an inventor, but his ideas get him nowhere. He marries and adopts a family. Quite the outdoorsman. His greatest fear is being recognized, as he occasionally is. But late in life, he finally admits who he was and writes an autobiography. So who am I talking about? Georg Gaertner? Or Butch Cassidy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitler's Last Soldier in America","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The title certainly grabbed my attention and the preface and first chapter were intriguing, but the remainder of the book delivered little. The sub-title could have been \\"How I escaped from an American POW camp and lived a wonderful life in the best country in the world\\". Proving once again: you can't judge a book by its cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kundalini Book.","review":"For those of you with a passing interest or a passion for Kundalini this is the book to read. It covers every aspect of Kundalini and is written by a Western author so it is quite easy reading.Also anyone having any kind of Spiritual Awakening should read this book.Even though the books title doesn't show it, this is the best book I have read on Kundalini so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible","review":"Han Bennick is an impressive free jazz drummer. His best work has been with saxophonist, Peter Brotzmann.But something has gone radically wrong on this recording.

He's always had good luck with them.The first thing that I noticed when I opened the box was that there was a gap between the case and the faceplate. I called LaCie customer service and they sent me instructions on how to open the case and also noted my serial number so that I wouldn't void my warranty. The problem was that there were 2 screws that hold the faceplate onto the internal chassis who were not even tighted (as if they started the screws and didn't tighten them).By the way... the actual HD inside the case is a Maxtor. If I had know that prior to purchase, I would not have bought the LaCie.I fixed the problem with the case and turned it on.. only to be hit with a high pitched winning sound coming from the HD. This noise will drive me crazy and is not \\"Ultra Quiet\\" as noted in the description. I'm sending it back to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"LaCie drive quit working","review":"What a disappointment that what I thought was a reputable company makes such an unreliable product. After about a years time, my LaCie drive started clicking. And then, no data. It completely failed. I too made the mistake of trusting this drive and didn't back it up.

This one is not. It could be re-released and still find a good audience. If you're looking for a good clean movie that tickles the funny bone of parents AND children this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the Navy","review":"This is not a major war movie,but,it is very enjoyable none-the-less.Jack Lemmon plays a much more competent Naval officer than his Oscar winning role as Ensign Pulver in \\"Mister Roberts\\".This time he is given an assignment to take a broken down sailing vessel through Japanese held waters for a special mission to deliver an Australian Coast Watcher to his post on an island in enemy waters.The trip is at times comical and at times exciting.Rick Nelson gives his best acting performance since \\"Rio Bravo\\" and is more than competent as the second officer.All in all it is a fun and entertaining movie.Recommended for anyone who likes their WW II movies with some comedy as well as action."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wackiest ship in the Army","review":"I was expecting so much more from this film. I have enjoyed many of the 60's comedies such as Support your Local Sherrif and It's a Mad Mad Mad World. But this movie? I have tried two times to watch it, and keep falling asleep. The acting is terrible, though Nelson does carry a very good tune. Not Lemmon's or Nelson's best mediocre work. Would much rather watch Lemmon in The Great Race, and Nelson in Rio Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemmon at his best","review":"If you want a good laugh be sure to get this movie. You will enjoy Jack Lemmon as a naval captain with the mission of hiding a spy upon a ship about to be decommissioned. This is the kind of movie you can enjoy more than a few times--I have!Rickey Nelson does a good job in his supporting role, and adds considerably to the humor that Jack Lemmon masters so very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is a classic movie, apparently loosely based on events from WW2. It's always good to see Ricky Nelson and this role was perfect for his unassuming acting style - also love listening to that crooning voice.

A great, easy to watch movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the Army at it's best","review":"During World War II the Army recruits Navy officer Rip Crandall (Jack Lemmon) to command a battered old schooner for a top-secret mission. If you are ready for a bunch of misfits getting into one fix after another then you will enjoy this movie. Jack Lemmon and Ricky Nelson make a great team in this World War II comedy.

So sit back, Relax and get that buttery popcorn for one of the best comedies from way back when."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wackie","review":"One of Lemmon's best. Ricky Nelson is OK. He just doesn't seem comfortable in movies. But the fun as a war picture is great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wackiest","review":"Jack Lemmon and Rick Nelson are both entertaining in this honest presentation.

He comes across Charlex Xaiver and his X-Men (its the X-team from the equally popular 90's series featuring Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, The Beast, Storm, Gambit, Rogue and Jubilee) and after a rough start, he finds that they can't help him but Beast points him to a Dr. Herbert Landon who supposedly can help his condition. What comes next is a fight between Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine (shades of their one on one fight in the famous Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine comic from the late 80's), an appearance from the Hobgoblin and the true nature of Dr. Landon's \\"cure.\\"One of the best episodes from the series! I only wish they would go ahead and put them on series sets for DVD! Worth getting if you can find it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really Saliva????","review":"As a proud owner of all Saliva's past work, I was very excited to purchase the newest release yesterday. As the album began, I was pleased with the opening track and eagerly anticipated more, gritty Southern rock. However, much to my dismay, instead I received dose after painful dose of soft, poppy, hook ladden top 40/American Idol-esque songs. With the exception of one track near the end, the rest of the CD belongs in the \\"easy listening\\" section, not rock/metal. Although I must admit, some of the chorus lines are a bit catchy, I was hoping for another CD to blast at the gym, not fall asleep to. This disc now belongs to my girlfriend, stocked away next to her Chris Daughtry, Kelly Clarkson and Kelly Pickler CD's... Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is It 2001 Again?","review":"Oh wait, it's just Saliva. Like this band was original anyways.

Thank goodness I listened to tracks online before I went out and bought this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonders","review":"Its sad how after they had one hit \\"Click, Click Boom\\" that was featured on every single soundtrack known to man, that they would make an entire album and have every song sounding almost exactly like that one hit. And if it didn't sound like it they were sure to mention it somewhere in the song. I don't know though, there were one or two songs that were decent but I wasn't crazy about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growth in some areas, a step back in others.","review":"If there's one thing you have to say about this album, it's that it's very varied. There are many different types of music on the album, from straight rock similar to Every Six Seconds to more poppy music similar to Back Into Your System. Some of it is even reminiscent of their first self-titled album, Saliva.However, I can't give the album five stars on principle. I agree with other reviewers in that Black Sheep sounds EXACTLY like Animals by Nickelback, if only a little slower. Not cool guys, not cool.Other than that, a great album you should enjoy if you like Back Into Your System and Survival of the Sickest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, who took the Rock away? Buy Fozzy if you want a great CD","review":"This appears to be the Saliva 'Ballads' Cd....the band from the first couple CD's is long gone, and a pop band with a ton of slow ballads has taken their place. Great band in concert, but this doesn't represent the band at all.

Do you need it??? YEP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful main stream garbage!!!!","review":"I really have liked Saliva's CDs especially Back Into Your System, and Survival of the Sickest. Both of those CDs were great and very enjoyable. So I was super excited to hear this!!! I thought the single (Ladies and Gentlemen) was pretty good, and I felt Saliva would come out with another great CD. Sadly this is not that great CD. This is just main stream garbage!! This is not Saliva!! I mean there are a couple of good songs (Ladies and Gentlemen, King of the Stereo, and Black Sheep), but even those sound like b-sides from other Saliva CDs. Sadly this is just not very good at all, in fact to be frank its awful!! By far the worst Saliva CD!!! Don't buy it if your a Saliva fan, only buy it if you like Britney Spears and junk like that!! I would have given this 1 star, but like I said a couple songs are good, and I just feel bad giving a great band (up to this point) 1 star on any of their CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Poppy. Not the Saliva I Know.","review":"This album is poppy, whiney, and overall a catastrophe. I was utterly surprised to see that only about 2 or 3 tracks rock and the rest is mainstream sounding garble. I agree that Saliva should have changed and evolved their sound from their previous albums as the rap/rock was getting outdated and overplayed, but this was an extreme case of the \\"Woaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhs!\\" Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars since only 2 songs are Saliva","review":"When I heard Ladies and Gentlemen, I was excited. I thought here is going to be a great Saliva album. Instead what we have is another Daughtry CD. I loved the first Saliva album, the second had some bubble gum, but still some rockin songs. The third was raw and a bit immature, but still good. This album is pop. I thought Saliva of all bands wouldn't try to be Nickelback, but the Nickelback album at least rocked a little. I am very disappointed. If you want Click Click Boom and great rock anthems, listen to old Saliva, if Daughtry is your thing then this is for you. Me, I'll listen to Ladies and Gentlemen until I wear it out, then I'll move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muscle with maturity.","review":"I have to admit that I jumped on the Saliva bandwagon when I heard \\"Click Click Boom\\", but once I was on I never had a reason to get off. Even though their last effort seemed stale in areas, it was still a good listen. With Blood Stained Love Story, a natural progression is happening and it seems to suit the band well. The album takes a trip in a softer direction at times, but still goes through the old neighborhoods that made the band so appealing to me in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saliva has turned to SLOBBER","review":"This album is not the Saliva I know.

Ladies and Gentleman is a cool different style of rock song. Broken Sunday is a great track and King of the Radio features some old school raprock so to speak that I love to hear from Josey. There are some soft ballads on here but I've listened to them a few times since I got it yesterday and they are definately startin to grow on me. The song Twister is completely random and definately does sound pop-rockish .....its just completely wierd to here that from Saliva. They'll probably play that one on 96.5 the buzz here in Kansas City. Anyways I like it overall but Survival of the Sickest was my favorite album so far, but of course I love all the older stuff, hell, Click Click Boom was my favorite song for probably around 2-3 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for 2 songs","review":"I first listened to this CD while at the gym and I was pumped while listening to Ladies and Gentleman, then..............the wheels came off. What happened to these guys?? Other than track 1 and 5, this was dissapointing. And the Twister song?? I couldn't force myself to even finish listening to that song. As with all bands, maybe it's time to hang it up boys, you're definitely scratching the bottom of the barrel here. What a shame.Atleast your other CD's rocked.

The noises from the steering wheel can get a bit irritating for parents that don't like toys with a lot of noise but the little ones love it. My 2 1/2 year old niece really enjoyed playing with it as well (always a bonus).The truck seems to be very durable but is light weight so could be easy to tip over. One downside I see is to change it from a push-to-walk toy to a ride-on you have to take the seat all the way out rather than just changing some lever or something so it has to be done by a parent.In general I would recommend this toy. I have several of the other push-to-walk toys and found this one to be much more educational and also a lot more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"My grandson tries to play on this, and scoots across the floor on it, but rolls over his toes alot and it only goes in a straight line. So he is always lifting it up to turn. The space between front and back wheels is small, so when child scoots on it, he has to watch out for his toes constantly. My grandson sat on it and played with the ignition, horn and blinkers until just recently as it was too hard for him to operate. He is a normal 21 month size currently.The seat is hard to change from sit to push. And you can hurt your fingers doing it.Overall, I think this vehicle is cute and noises fun, but it just isn't too functional and a little damaging to toes and fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not like a Tonka","review":"This toy is cute and has the blocks to sort and all but it doesn't have turning wheels and therefore my son wouldn't even play with it. The steering wheel doesn't actually turn anything! I bought it for a present in August and I've already given it away. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This toy was okay.The sounds are VERY loud, so much so that the volume hurts our ears, we put packaging tape over the speakers to try to mute the noise to protect our son's ears. There is no way to turn off the sound except to remove batteries.The seat is difficult to lift up for an adult; pretty much impossible for a toddler.It would be nice if the truck came with 9-12 little blocks instead of only three. The storage under the seat would hold a lot more than 3. We've lost one so we're down to two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves ride-on","review":"My son just received this toy for his second birthday and he loves it, the only problem is the turn signal control is hard for him to use because you have to pull it until it clicks frustrating for a toddler. All in all though it's definitely a toy for a action packed little boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great versatile push/ride on toy!","review":"I purchased this for my 9 month old son and he loves it. He can only use it in push and ride on mode right now with supervision, but he loves to push it on the floor and put the shapes on top and in and out of the compartment. I can see him enjoying this for months to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BIG truck!","review":"My son is 11 months old and the height of the seat is just barely high. This is perfect for the child just about to walk or just starting to walk. He hasn't figured out how to pick up the blocks but we wanted him to grow into the toy so he will figure that out. Changing it from a walker to a seat is so easy that we do it four times a day. This is a VERY cool toy. The boy is in LOVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Love It! My 9 month old son is having a ball with this ride-on! Highly recommended for busy little ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"My 10.5 month old son who has been walking since 8 months old absolutely loves this toy! The best part is it picks up toys too. I read a review belowregarding the seat and how the child can't adjust the seat himself. I believe the design is this way so that younger children can enjoy the toy as well. I wouldn't want my 10 month old converting the pull/push back to a seat because he can't sit on the toy and maneuver it himself. He can however pull it and push it just great and likes to put many of his toys in it and push it around the house. I have however put him on the toy with the seat down and scooted him around while holding onto him. Great toy and most importantly ENTERTAINING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous ride-on","review":"I hated this truck. My son fell off the back of it twice and hit his head.

The difference was that the room was the oval office of the White House. However, once it was noted that the locks in the room were old and unsophisticated, the solution to that problem was obvious. Like the other stories in this series, the most interesting aspects are the presence of other historical figures. J. Edgar Hoover and Clyde Tolson get slapped down by a crooked banker and there are cameo appearances by a junior officer named Dwight Eisenhower and a rising politician named Lyndon Johnson.My greatest enjoyment from the book was engaging in idle speculation regarding the historical accuracy of the actions of the people other than the Roosevelts. It is quite possible that some of the events have a bit of historical accuracy. The mystery is ordinary and I solved it rather quickly.

It is obvious there is an agenda being pushed here, from a lack of Scriptural references, relying instead, on a worldy view of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

If you're a fan of Byrnes, I highly recommend giving this a try. If you liked his last album, Fresh Horses, and if you especially liked the exquisite track \\"I'm Just a Pilgrim\\" from that album, you will surely like House of Refuge.

It's much more efficient, quieter, easier to clean and more comfortable to use than the single pump. I pretty much doubled the amount I express at work. I wish I would have gotten it sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the product. It was difficult and time consuming to put together. Not at all user friendly. The pump itself was not comfortable and a bit painful. After a week of use the pump stopped working. Avent was not helpful at all in the situation. I did not have the receipt; therefore they were unwilling to send even a replacement part. They did; however, allow us to send the pump in for diagnostics. Only to tell us the it would cost $200 dollars to replace the faulty motor. They were unwilling to fix the problem themselves. I ended up purchasing a medela pump and have found it much easier to use and more efficient. I will never purchase another avent product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy another","review":"I had been pleased with this pump up until recently. I purchased this on May 5th and today is July 27th. The cord has broken and needs to be replaced from the way that it stores. When I went to pump the last time today- suddenly I had no power and upon closer inspection I figured out why. I was very dissatisfied with the Customer Service that I received. If you need to buy replacement parts- they don't have these available. So with a breastpump that I am dependant on and nearly $400 later- I will be bringing all the manual pieces in to work tomorrow. This is completely unacceptable to me. I would suggest buying a medela pump who has proven Customer Service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it. Comes in a great bag!","review":"I love this pump.

Not so with the Avent DUOI should have bought Medela the second time around but I figured I'd try something new. Don't ignore Medela's excelent track record.

I mainly bought the Isis IQ Duo because of its brand name and issues I had with the Medela pump (getting mold in the tubes-gross!!) After using the Isis IQ Duo once, it broke!!!!!!!!! Beware of the claim that it is the newest innovation in breast pumping!!! It took me 45 minutes to pump 4oz. out of each breast (this is way too long from what I'm used to). It took me 15 minutes just to set up the manual pump so the electric pump would kick in!! Now that I've used it, I realize it makes no sense!! Why would I pay $350 to manually express my milk- this is too much work!!! I'm going back to electric!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pump, great investment","review":"I just bought the Isis IQ Duo a week ago and I absolutely love it. It's easy to use and it cuts the amount of time I spend pumping in half. I was using the Avent manual pump which I also highly recommend. The manual pump worked great - I would pump 2-5 oz in about 20-25 minutes, which was okay but a little time consuming at work. The Isis Duo cuts that time in half, doubled the amount of milk I was getting and it doesn't take long to set up either. The motor is really quiet. I don't know why the one reviewer says that you can't change the suction because that's just not true. You start by manually pumping and when you push the button it continues to pump with the same rhythm and amount of suction that you apply and you can change it at anytime during the session. It comes with 4oz & 9 oz bottles. I've never seen a bottle smaller than 4oz. It is expensive, but I believe it was well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No replacement parts-rendered completely useless for the second time around","review":"I received this pump as a present (originanlly was planning to buy a Medela pump myself). It was my best friend when I nursed my first child. Now, two years later I am expecting my second child and started looking into replacing everything for the new baby (the old silicone parts turned yellow and sticky after 2 years), preferably with BPA free parts. Not only I can't find BPA free parts, I can hardly find any parts I can replace, except for the valves and diaphragms, which is not a big help at all.I would not recommend this product. You can't reuse it for your own children. Too pricey for just one time use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breast Pump","review":"This has been a good pump. Only takes 15-20 minutes to pump at the same time. The rubber covers for the part that attaches to your boob is pointless I shortly after removed and was way happier.

Over all a very good pump for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Search no Further!!","review":"This product is amazing. I did all the research i could on the web for it and there was mixed reviews. But I went with this one because; first off, its the only personal breast pump with the same industrial strength pumping as the hospital pumps. Next you can manually pump and it will memorize how you like to pump and then do it for you. My husband thinks its a little noisy but it doesnt bother me.

Lem's understanding of psychology, and philosophy are greater than his considerable scientific knowledge. As an unorthodox textbook on those first two subjects I would recommend this book. As a Sci-Fi novel, however, I think it falls flat. There just isn't enough entertainment value in His Master's Voice to make it worth your while.I regret saying this because the laugh, ultimately, is on me. It seems obvious throughout the book that one of it's main purposes is to satirize \\"Western\\" Sci-Fi as mindless escapism. Lem was often critical of popular Sci-Fi authors and their readers for not using the genre to create stories that ask deeper questions and created a more meaningful culture around them.

To make things worse, it was rather difficult to put the top back on. Then I lost my patience.A reviewer said that they couldn't even get it to spin, but that was not my experience. I think spin tops are nice toys because your kids won't be glued to any kind of screen, unfortunately it's hard to find them anywhere.By the way, item I received didn't have a die or the ball-bearing tip.

She made herself the star of the show and forgot about the song and highlighting it. In my opinion, I feel like Duke would have been disapponted with his music being presented like this.The repertoire for this cd was alright, but that was the only bright spot I could find.

If you are shopping for young children, I recommend that you focus on clearer and more realistic examples - for example I found some SUPERB cards and curriculum through Marsha Wenig (sp?) her book is called Yoga Kids.

Williams takes the core message of Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich and lays out a pathway to successful acheivement. His story is compelling, entertaining, and rings true. He makes a number of down-to-earth insights into the process of improving one's own life which were right on target for me. I've also had the pleasure of hearing the audio version of this book: once you hear him, the text in the book comes alive with his humor. I'm sure a lot of readers would find Williams' tone a little hucksterish, but he really presents some valuable ideas.

He was thrilled when he received Thumper because the Boulder video is one of his favorites. Unfortunately, I agree with the other review, the tread constantly comes off Thumper. As soon as my son pushes Thumper the tread slips off and I have to put it back on. This is extremely frustrating for anybody much less, a toddler. He went from being thrilled to chilled. He occasionally comes back to Thumper and tries to play with him, but of course, the tread slips off and he is disappointed. This is definitely not a well designed toy when it comes to the treads and their fit. The rest of Thumper is just as cute and durable as all of the other wooden Thomas trains. Skip buying this one if you can, otherwise your child and you are in for frustration and disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the neck!","review":"My 3-year-old son has a ton of the Thomas vehicles and loves them, but Thumper is poorly designed.

This simple structure is the 'worst' of any of the Thomas & Friends bridges that we have run across. It is extremely unstable and difficult to set up. Unlike the other bridges (which have pins, are solid, or have flip-out supports) this structure depends on friction and two wooden blocks that have to be placed 'just right'. We ended up spending more money almost right away rather than to have the wails of frustration.Since our version of this track now sits on the side lines, we would suggest to just add to the sum you would spend here and buy something that won't be so frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with the bait that comes with it","review":"This product just does not work.

While you *can* empty and re-use, I just throw it out with the garbage and use a new trap. For this reason, best put them someplace where you don't pass often (or eat close to!). This will also attract flies in the local area, so you'll see a lot of activity near the trap.It takes a few weeks of use to clear our the fly population, so buy more than one.

This book is filled with typos, (I caught at least half a dozen), the episodes are listed out of order, and, well, what made me very angry is that he completely botches a review of an episode, because he didn't seem to understand what was going on. Plus, he gives away some spoilers to what happened in the early parts of season 2 (Not that I mind spoilers, but someone who hasn't seen it yet might be upset by it.)

I should have ordered only one at a time, then I would not have bought the other two. Not at this price. For as small as the first book is, and no photos or anything else in the book, it isn't worth the price. And, as another reviewer mentioned, there are a lot of typos! That was irritating. As a reviewer, Talis does ok. As he mentions, I don't have to agree with everything he says. I think he missed the point on some episodes, though, and I think he could have been more in depth on some. I hope the second book is better. I noticed it is larger, so I have some hope that my money was not so misplaced. I would have been happy with the book had it been more the price of a small paperback novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you think...","review":"That cover looks nothing like the one I have, but let us get serious. Many people seem to have mixed feelings about Talis Pelucir's views on the episodes. But what it comes down to, for whatever the reason he likes or dislikes an episode, is that he likes the same ones I do and has problems with the same ones I do. I don't know about his spelling or not - really wasn't looking to see if he spelled stuff like an American or like an Englishmen. The only problem I have is he didn't like Jeremiah Crichton episode and I did. I liked it mostly for the scenes with Rygel but I do understand how it could be compared to a bad Star Trek episode. How would it have been if Aeryn had come down to the planet instead of D'Argo?

While reading \\"So Faux,\\" I found that I could predict what would happen next. Though the content differed from previous novels, the structural elements remained pretty much the same. Once again (as in another of Myers' novels), there was the reference to a \\"frizzy-haired\\" writer of mysteries, who I assume is to be the author, herself. This type of self-consciousness in a writer can distance the reader from her work and shatter the suspension of disbelief that is so necessary to the enjoyment of a book of this kind.Myers' humor failed to make up for the thin plot, the one-dimensional characters and the lack of a well-defined place. This was simply an unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a little predictable","review":"This is about the 5th Den of Antiquity cozy murder I have read by Tamar Myers, since I lived in the Charleston area for 12 years, she is right on on how the natives are about their families.

Thus when I finally time to buy Haydn's masterpiece, I bought the Gardner set and, because it was such good value, the Willcocks rendition. Each was thoroughly enjoyable in its own right. But I could not escape the attention being paid to this new version. So I bouht this one also. If anything, the singing is more beautiful than on the two prior ones. Certainly, the duets are more expressive and provide agreter sense of intimacy. I think that Naxos has here exceeded its own very well established reputation for searching out uinkwon (to American listeners) performers who sing and play music at a very high level.

It not only explains complex psychology in very common language, but it gives practical advice on how to heal. Everyone I know would benefit from reading this book.

Even after I had read only one chapter, I had learned and discovered many new things. There were lists of questions which revealed that there were more narcissists in my life than I had realized. It helped me understand why some of my relationships were so frustrating.I think the title doesn't do it justice. Perhaps it was named using \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" to be different and catchy for marketing. I'm not sure. But I think it makes the book seem like the content will be less serious than it is.

Both times I was dealing with having to end a relationship with a person I loved who had addiction and abuse problems. This book put confusing and crazy-making experiences into the perfect words. It also provided me with validation of my sanity, contrary to the nacissists opinion that everyone is 'crazy' except them. It helped me to believe what I knew: that I wasn't crazy but was dealing with a crazy situation, and that I wasn't alone. Thank you SO much for writing this book. I inspires one to trust their instincts, step back, and set healthy boundaries, before we get sucked down the rabbit hole with the narcissist.

I had spend 21 years trying to duct tape our marriage and those in these relationships find that they receive only devaluation, criticism, denial of any responsibility for any wrongdoing; I could go on forever.

I had been guessing that my oven was off by 10 degrees and while the CDN Pro Accurate High Heat Oven Thermometer and the Kitchen Series Oven Thermometer by Admetior confirmed my suspicions, the CDN was the easiest to read so that's the one I'm going with. Also, I would highly recommend purchasing an accurate oven thermometer because more than just being off by 10 degrees, my oven was telling me it was preheated when it was still a good 25-35 degrees away.

I live in an area where fleas are a problem all year round.

Unfortunately, I also trapped a large lizard one time, and had a heck of time getting him unstuck while trying to keep his fingers and toes attached to his body (I shook sand over the flea paper and kept shaking it so it stuck to the paper every time I pried off a toe/leg). I wish changing the paper could be made easier. It can be very difficult to replace the flea paper without it sticking to my fingers over and over and over.

It is a very cheap plastic bowl with a small night light bulb that screws into the top. Adhesive paper is placed inside. Fleas are attracted to the light and the warmth. The fleas hop into the bowl and get stuck on the sticky paper.I caught between 30 and 50 fleas before the bulb burned out(three days after purchase) in my unit. The same amount of money could have been better spent on some permethrin based insecticide.This is more of a gimmick or a toy. I knew that ahead of time but I like gadgets so I bought one.

They work better at night when the house is dark as fleas tend to gravitate to the light. It's amazing how many they catch, one refill lasts a very long time as the surface is large compared to the size of a flea and it remains sticky. The only other alternative would be to bring my chickens in to take care of the problem, but then there's a different problem to deal with.

In the subsequent 8 months, we have never seen or felt a flea."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much","review":"It doesn't seem to work so good! I put it in the room with two of my dogs and had one flea on the trap. It stayed by the kennel for two days only a few bugs.... i washed the dogs, they were covered in fleas. Ugh"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flea trapper is great","review":"Easy to set up. Whatever this has, definitely attracts small bugs and fleas. You can instantly see all the fleas caught. Helpful for assessing your flea infestation issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"I say keep up the good work Mrs. Afflalo. You are an inspiration to many I will be looking forward to many other books that are yet to come.Luv u always !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inciting imagination in children","review":"This is a wonderful, creative book for young children that promotes imagination and lots of giggles. The illustrations are most appealing to a child as they are simple and colorful. As a teacher of young, special needs children,I have read this book to my students. It delighted everyone and held their attention. It is a book that will become a family favorite and will be read many times. Adults will smile while reading it to children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic vocal performance with flawless accompaniment","review":"Jan Findlay's sweet, contralto vocals are mesmerizing as she sings jazz standards with a fresh, entralling style that is both beautiful and sexy. The title track, Old Devil Moon is a wonderful arrangement of an old standard, and don't miss her rendition of Autumn Leaves. She is accompanied by the Jay D' Amico Trio, who are a perfect match to her consummate vocals, providing a great melodic backup that brings out the best in every tune. I highly recommend this CD and if you every have the chance to see Jan in concert, don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars for childhood memories!","review":"Well, it's only soup, you say...That might have been true when Campbell's Condensed Scotch Broth was readily available on supermarket shelves. But, when it became the object of a many-years-long treasure hunt, it took on new and astounding proportions!This variety of Campbell's soup is every bit as good as I remembered, and it tastes even better seasoned with Amazon's great FREE shipping!Gotta get more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watered down so not as good as it used to be","review":"I, like some other reviewers, loved this soup when I was a kid. It was thick in the can so I'd spread it directly on bread with mayo and have a sammich. No longer can this be done because it is now so watered down. I still buy it whenever I can find it (why is it out of stock at Amazon?) and it still tastes great, but it ain't the same; a soggy sammich just does not cut it. Not only is it more \\"expensive\\" (due to devaluation of the buck) but now it's of even less value because it's half water. Minus one star for the water, four stars 'cause it still beckons the taste buds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"David Schippers' \\"Sell Out\\" is an incredible indictment, not only of Clinton, but our \\"representatives\\" in Washington. The travails of Clinton are well known - what is really shocking is the fact that not one Senator logged into the evidence room to review the documentation first-hand prior to the impeachment hearings! If you are jaded by politics and media spin, this account makes you wonder if watching the network news or voting are worth the time and effort. A well documented, gripping story, and call to arms for Americans to campaign actively for term limits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I Believe in Term Limits","review":"Prior to reading this book, I was convinced that term limits were a bad idea. I believed that the electoral process could be improved by changing campaign finance laws. After reading this book, I believe the only method for positive change in our Congress is to set term limits on our Representatives and Senators. If you find the author credible, you'll be disgusted by the self-preservationist behavior of our congressmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man of unquestioned integrity","review":"Note that this review is long after the publication of this book but Mr. Schippers' book is a timeless monument to his integrity and a searing indictment of our Congress and especially Bill Clinton and friends.An even greater travesty is that this book apparently was given a \\"pass\\" by the mainstream intelligentsia and dismissed by the mainstream media.If you really care about this country and its political future, please read this book. I implore you to do so with an open mind. I acknowledge that I am a Republican but this book should worry readers on both sides of the aisle.Mr. Schippers is a great American and my nominee for a Medal of Freedom. The Constitution really means something to him in its most literal language."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-righteous account by a marginal player","review":"I came to this book with an open mind. Too bad that more of the tunnel vision that characterized Ken Starr appears here in Schippers' book. Schippers can't see the forest for the trees - if he had a broader vision of his role and the political considerations surrounding impeachment, he might have succeeded! Unfortunately, he sees all events as a morality play in which he is the hero, valiantly protecting the American people against their elected representatives (from both parties - neither can meet his high standard.) Particularly laughable is his fawning examination of Kenneth Starr during a hearing - he thinks this is a high point of the whole process - instead he gives new meaning to the term \\"sucking up\\".Read this book and you will understand why, in hands like these, the impeachment attempt failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling case with bonus outrage!","review":"This was a book I looked forward to. Mr Schippers is one of the true heroes of this sorry story that was impeachment. He presents his case well and is much harder on the republicians then his fellow demorcrats (as well he should be.) In my opinion it should have been titled outrage. This is because his outrage positively pours from every page and gives an unpleasant flavor to a story which is outragous enough on its own. The evidence he presents is a tad dry, but that is the nature of the evidence not a problemm with the writer. It is needed to make his case and his case would suffer without it. Be prepared for both passion and plainness. The mix in its fashion makes it less of a read, but not less of a story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Schippers is a typical prosecutor","review":"Once he gets identifies \\"side\\" (the side paying him the money, i.e. the Republican caucus in this case), he simply cannot see the other side of an issue. I understand the concept of zealous prosecution, but Schippers statement that \\"any sitting President who lies about anything should be impeached\\" is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Constitution.Schippers presents his own points of view cogently, if rather dryly. But he absolutely fails to see the other side. Fails to understand that good people could disagree with him for good reasons. Anyone who disagrees with his point of view is dubbed \\"without morals\\" or a \\"sellout.\\" This is NOT a balanced view. It's the Prosecutor's view, of why he shouldn't have lost his case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Clinton-bashing screed from Regnery","review":"As Gomer Pyle would say, \\"Surprise, surprise, surprise!\\" Another dead tree's worth of Clinton-bashing from Regnery, which has published innumerable steaming piles of it in the past, including \\"Hell to Pay,\\" wingnut Barbara Olson's harpy-like screed against Hillary Clinton. \\"The most corrupt President in American history.\\" Yeah, right. How quickly we have forgotten the Reagan/Bush regime and their arms-for-hostages deals? Has anyone ever bothered to wonder why Bush the Edler pardoned Caspar Weinberger and a half dozen of his CIA cronies in connection with the Iran-Contra scandal? Because by doing so, he was guaranteeing that they wouldn't point the finger at him! THAT, my friends, is corruption. The whirling wingnuts still haven't figured out that Bill Clinton is no longer a candidate as they attempt to do whatever it takes to install themselves in the White House to continue the failed policies of their God, Ronald Reagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"17 cartons of documents:","review":"I realize now why the impeachment didn't work. They had 17 cartons of documents. Every one knows it takes 50 cartons of documents to oust a sitting prez. David came to slay the giant but he forgot his sling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this partisan politics or ignorance?","review":"Ever since Reagan looked into our cameras and said \\"I did not sell arms to Iran,\\" America has, sadly, accepted outright lying by our Presidents. Clinton, about Lewinsky (and, come on, other matters), but Republicans about SELLING WEAPONS TO OUR ENEMIES (Iran)FOR PRIVATELY RUN WARS(Contras), to which Bush Sr. was a party. Neither Reagan nor Bush was ever impeached -- indeed, Reagan continues to be idolized. And now this supposed \\"Democrat\\" supposedly \\"goes against his party\\" to \\"reveal\\" the behind-the-scenes Clinton-impeachment scandals! Get serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me want to vote for Gore","review":"I just finished reading this book cover to cover. It is full of conspiracy theories and accusations. Interesting how it is published right before the election Seriously, I have been a Bush supporter because of the stands and values that Govenor Bush advocates.However, when I read a book like this, which is blatantly a \\"dirty trick\\" of my party (Republican), even I can see the hypocrisy. I have decided (although somewhat reluctantly) to vote for Gore and Lieberman. There seems to be more integrity on that side."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsense...","review":"It is totally outrageous the way some people will still go out of their way to discredit our great President; as if Reagan, Bush or any of the others were any better. Reagan's memory has been gone for years with his claims of having no knowledge of arms sales to Iran. Whatever, if you want to read this nonsense then go ahead, but the best thing to do is wait until it comes out for sale in any bargain bin. That should be real soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"These authors are almost right","review":"Unfortunately they missed the part about the Georgia businessman who stumbled into a money laundering machine managed by Clinton and Zell Miller. The guy was kidnapped for 7 months to prevent disclosure of Worthen and United Community Banks.But what Clinton and his \\"bosses\\" didn't know was the amount of power a single citizen could weild when backed up by the FBI!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Inside Story of a Delusion","review":"Schippers in this book appears convinced that one ought to be able to impeach a president based upon secret evidence stored in a secret evidence room. He waxes indignant at the unwillingness of Senators to travel to the House's secret evidence room to view such evidence.He never explains why such evidence was not presented when the House controlled the process. As an attorney, surely Schippers knows that we do not convict defendants of crimes in this country based upon secret evidence in secret evidence rooms. What was he thinking?This book doesn't go far enough into the mental processes of Schippers and other impeachment supporters. He never displays any self-doubt, even now that impeachment has failed. We never know how he would answer the objections of the President's attorneys and others that we do not convict of crimes in America based on secret evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can taste the fish oil - FESS UP!","review":"It's no mystery that this peanut butter tastes like fish, they must add fish oil to get the Omega 3's up. I have to check when I get home, but if that's not listed in the ingredients, that's REALLY BAD! FOR SHAME. But read further, I will convince you of my sincerity.*What really turns me off is the fake reviews that are obvious answers to the honest ones. I might have given it 2 or 3 stars if I felt like the truth was out there, but people need to know why it scores low.*The strange thing is, I have a creamy PB from Smart Balance w/1000mg omega 3's, and it doesn't taste like fish, it's better homogenized, and there's no oil rolling around the top. It would still bother me to find that there was fish in it, since they do not claim it in the ingredients, but I can vouch for it's non-fishy taste, and will even provide the link - [...]It doesn't have OMEGA written in large letters under the name."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(f,null,y(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-6a8c1c6b"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/38.md","filePath":"people/38.md"}'),R={name:"people/38.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
