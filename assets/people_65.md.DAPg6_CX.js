Not in a hard to follow like Inception kind of way, but why does this movie even exist kind of way. On the surface you would think it would make some big or profound statement about our prison system with Robert DeNiro playing a correctional officer overseeing to his final case involving the parole of Edward Norton who was in there for arson that killed his grandparents. Things get complicated when Milla Jovovich shows up as Norton's wife.None of the three characters are at all likeable as they intertwine, making no rooting interest in what happens next. By the time the movie starts to pick up near the end, there is a twist that just left me asking the screen, \\"why even bother?\\" Stone just completely goes nowhere. It tries to be some sort psychological thriller but forgot to include any actual thrills in the movie. If there was some deep subtext or meaning to Stone, it completely went over my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I expected so much more from reading the other reviews. I love all the actors and they do a great job but the story just isn't that good. A Super let down all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant film that will be revered in time.","review":"I think this was a brilliant film -- a deep, thoughtful, poetically-directed tome on the unanswerable spiritual questions of life and a probing, disturbing snapshot of the current state of the American soul -- all wrapped up in the guise of a neo-\\"post-American greatness\\" psychological film noir. Led by a brilliant Edward Norton and a revitalized Robert De Niro, the acting performances were excellent across the board. It is a sign of the dreary state of American cinema, art and culture in general that a film of this exceptional caliber is not receiving the accolades and appreciation that it should. I think that in time it will be regarded as a great overlooked piece of cinematic excellence -- perhaps even a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange editing feels like parts are missing.Or maybe just disjointed","review":"This movie is never sure what it wants to be, jailhouse romp? Affair between old man and younger slutty woman? Thriller? It never really fits any of these and never completes it's promise. It's starts out interestingly enough, De Niro and Nortan have an interesting dynamic as prospective parolee and his officer (De Niro). Then it kind of convults as Norton tries to set up De Niro with Norton's Wife (Milla Jovovich). At this point it gets very hazy as De Niro and Jovovich descend into an affair with strange co dependancy. While DeNiro's Wife sits at home wringing her hands. It just kind of drones along without much resolution, then tries to tie it all together with vague references to Norton's troubled past as a youth. Really just kind of a mess and convoluted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential, lots of it, but in long run fell short","review":"3 great actors, and what seemed to be an interesting story could've been very compelling, intense, nail biting and such, but was not.

Great actors...love Edward Norton! Wow, what a messed up plot....loved it! Lots of dialogue...you have to pay attention to catch everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie damaged by bad ending","review":"The performances were great. DeNiro plays the parole officer who gets seduced by the convict's girl friend. Jovovitch stands out as the best performer in this feature. Both Norton and her character use one another to achieve their own selfish ends. Norton as a convict is superbly portrayed. He runs circles around the parole officer and manipulates him constantly.This whole plot plays out very predictably. We get to see DeNiro's character is not dealing with a full deck. What did he think would happen if he had a relationship with the con's girl friend? It's a movie that stands out as a good character study. Perhaps a rental of this would be worth it. However, it's one of those movies you'd buy because you like the actors. Not so much on the logic and the way it unfolds on the screen. Nothing is resolved. We are just as much in the dark about the character's motivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie well before it came out. You have Deniro and Norton. Surely this has got to have some substance. Not. Basically you have Norton's character \\"Gerald 'Stone' Creeson\\", doing hard time, hoping to make the parole board on one end. Jovovich's character \\"Lucetta Creeson\\" as the wife who can't keep her legs closed long enough. And Deniro's \\"Jack Mabry\\" as a man who has influence on how the parole board will act on Stone's case. Stone does what he has to do, knowing how loose a woman his wife is in terms of influencing Mr. Mabry's judgment. This is what this movie is about mainly, yet the director lost his way somewhere hitting this out of the ballpark even with this cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for film buffs, not for everyday watchers","review":"You'd think with an all-star cast this movie couldn't lose but it did just that. It lost me about 1/2 way through. I did watch the whole movie but quite honestly lost interest after I found the story to be lacking greatly. Its dubbed a psycho-drama and it lives up to that title, but for all the wrong reasons. If you like confusing stories than rent/buy this, however I recommend you read a few more of the reviews to understand what you could be in for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie came fine and the packaging was fine.

Two great actors taking a role beneath them. yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible script leads to disaster","review":"For some reason, Amazon will not post my lengthy review about how horrible this movie is. I'm suspecting it's because I'm honest and thoughtful about why this movie has so many problems. So, I guess I'll have to wrap up my 500 word review with this brief attempt: \\"Stone\\" is one of the worst films I've seen in years. Terrible script, ponderous acting, predictable storyline, and awful editing.

If the audience were stoned they might be happier at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moved at the pace of a stone","review":"You would figure that a film with two great actors and one great actress would be awesome. Well, it wasn't. The movie was slow, confusing and contradictory. The motivation for each character was never explained. Also, it appeared that all of the characters reached some sort of new understanding at the end of the movie, but we are not sure because it ends at that point. I sat through almost two hours of a slow-moving movie to get no explanation or closure!? The one positive thing that I can say is that as expected, the three main characters delivered great acting. Yet it was very hard to empathize with them because I couldn't understand the what or why of their actions. So, unless you are in an ultra-mellow mood (\\"ready to be bored\\")don't watch this movie. You have been forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost its way","review":"Started out good, lost its way ..... which is sad considering Robert DeNiro's in it, which was the reason I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing considering the cast","review":"You'd think that a movie starring Robert DeNiro, Edward Norton, and Milla Jojovich would have a pretty good chance to be great. In this case though, you'd be sadly mistaken. Stone is one of these \\"prestige\\" type of movies that just takes itself too seriously and tries too hard to be deep and memorable. Instead it manages to be merely mediocre. It's pretty obvious where the plot is going from very early on in the movie, it just takes forever to get there, through many painful-to-watch scenes. I wasn't entertained by it, and I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Acting, But...","review":"The information I read to select this movie did not really tell me whether it would have a satisfying ending or not. It sounded by what I read as if it would. Well, it doesn't.The story is dark, which I don't care for. The acting is so good that I did manage to watch it all. I don't recall one instant of humor. It wasn't touching emotionally, either.There is a lot of \\"religion\\" in it, but yet there isn't. Really, there isn't any. Just words, not actions.The ending is very fuzzy. What happens? Heck if I know.I actually like Robert DeNiro in comedies! And he is an ace actor in anything. The other acting in this movie is all good. But the plot, gracious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"As a thriller it tanks. As a psychological duel it fairs a bit better.

Do you have a TV show I can star in?","review":"If you like the concept of watching Robert De Niro die a metaphorical death onscreen,this movie is for you.Why is Edward Norton wearing those cornrows? Why does he have that stupid ghetto accent?Seriously, the only reason to watch this flick is for Milla Jovovich who is hotter than anArkansas Rembrandt. Otherwise this is a one star piece of crap, like the biggest one starPOC I have ever seen OK!De Niro is about to join Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda in the \\"I Should Have Retired YearsAgo Club\\".

I can find enough things to be depressed about in everyday life without watching these people show us how sordid their lives are. I just don't get how such outstanding actors got conned into this steaming pile of crap.(Plus, they probably got paid well to make it.

I'm not even sure if it had a plot. There were too many loose ends that went unanswered, the main one being Why? What was the gain, the purpose of Norton and his wife toying with his parole officer in this way? The film never explained it. The movie is also saturated with religiosity. Again, I ask why.Norton was at his best, but De Niro was miscast as a doddering old fool. I kept wondering how he could be so stupid as to allow himself to be drawn into Norton's sick game.There is nudity and many sexual situations in this movie, as well as foul language.If the viewer had been given a reason why all this stuff took place, the movie might have scored high marks. It wasn't until the credits started to roll that I realized I just wasted two hours of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Watched the movie all the way through.

In fact, I don't believe that any of the previous releases of Rats material (at least in the US) sound this good. It is both dynamic and clear.The bonus tracks were a real plus for me as well. There is a great version of Barefootin and a couple of others. The single version of Mary of the Fourth Form was tacked on at the end - the sequence is kind of awkward since the previous track is a live encore performance that fades out and seemingly brings a great close to the set.

I felt like the whole story was so wooden, the characters are not interesting, and the way they talk and react with one another is just not realistic to me, its just...well, a bit too flowery and trying too hard to be poetic and deep. I don't clearly understand why they have this chemistry either...I just don't understand the hype surrounded by this book. Lesbian lovers, great! But that alone doesnt necessarily make a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help!","review":"Why can't I get a copy of this not audible? Do they not offer one?? Please help! I used to have a paperback version but it was ruined in a fire.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly True.","review":"Wow. I happened to stumble on this book, blindly. I read it once, then twice. I stayed up all night reading it over and over. It was so...true, the feelings Annie and Liza had for each other. I have how writers portray first love as something you're sure of, something that isn't scary. Something you'd have to define. This book does none of these things. Although the dialoge at times seems a little staged, it never falls to TV movie level, and the emotion behind it always shines through. This book made me cry, but in the best way possible.I highly recommend this book to those who may be questioning thier sexuality. I wish I would have had this to read in junior high when I felt that no one in the world felt like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, emotive, I loved it!","review":"I am a young lesbian and I came on to Amazon.com looking for some gay teen fiction. This was reccomended by many friends so I ordered it. It really gave me an insight into teenage lesbian relationships, and pulled me along in the romance and magic of the story as well. I'd reccomend it to anyone like me who just wants some reassurance that this way of life is possible. I really loved it. If anyone wants to exchange booklists or anything else with me, please feel free to email me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best lesbian love story I've read","review":"I don't know where to begin.

It's aimed towards younger readers, I'd say 16 years or younger, but don't let that stop you from reading it if you're older. It delves into complex emotions in a simplistic, refreshing way, which is nice when you're not as familiar with gay books. Definitely a beginner's book to lesbian love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie On My Mind","review":"God, I love this book!!!! Nancy Garden truly knows what she is talking about when she brings you along on the wonderful story of Annie and Liza. Inspirational and equally rememberable, this story will stay in your heart forever. It really shows the true fear and results of the fear of homophobia. And even though the characters may tumble through hard and difficult times throughout the plot, nothing can equal how they must feel for eachother. A great insight on how love can withstand even the hardest of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I thought this book was great, i mean yeah there was something missing more details or something not really sure, but i though the overall book was great. *SPOILER* I loved the part when they first kissed i meant the detail there was amazing i could really see them in my head.*END SPOILER* I recommend this beautiful love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Story!","review":"Annie On My Mind is one of the best books I have ever read, and the first centering around two lesbians, who didn't exactly start out that way. Eliza and Annie are so real in this book, and their story just draws you in. I picked it up one night and didn't put it down until I finished it late the next morning. Believe it or not I cried at the end, and I don't normally do that for books. This is a must-read, trust me. You can't waste money on this book.Ms. Widmer and Ms. Stevenson were great additions to the story as well, they make me think of two of my own teachers.

If the sound doesn't improve to its previous level, I will clean the cables again trying to remove the Progold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera..highly rated","review":"I have had this camera for over one year and each day learn more about the power of this camera. Recently took photo course and many in class had high powered Nikons and Canon DSLR's. My camera kept right up and in many cases had features their cameras did not, such as built in image stablization, and raw button. Just saw new DXO website that ranks K10D above many DSLR's and higher than some more expensive DSLR's. This is a great camera but not for the novice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great digital - great SLR","review":"We took over a thousand shots with our new camera in the past four weeks. We find it very easy to use and the images are excellent. We have used the highest quality setting and still get 300+ shots per 2GB card. The battery runs and runs. There is no hesitation between pressing the shot button and the lens operation - something we have had in our previous Sony and HP digital cameras. It is heavy - about the same as our standard film Pentax SLR but it is solid and the anti shake feature works well. We will try out our telephoto lens next - all our lenses from our old Pentax SLR camera work well with the digital SLR - saving us lots of $$$. Love it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of dealers and battery claims!","review":"Luckily, I didn't fall off the turnip truck. I ended up ordering my K10D from Broadway Photo, after having cancelled an order at Century 21 Photo. They BOTH tried to up-sell me a battery, Century 21 claiming that the camera didn't come with a battery at all, and Broadway trying to tell me that the one that comes with the camera only lasts for 20 minutes. The batteries they wanted to sell me cost $140, which is not surprising since they also charge $400 for a 2 gig SD card! Pentax rates their included 750 mAh batery at 500 shots. If that's not enough, you can get a 1700 mAh battery on eBay for $17.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pentax K10D","review":"Excellent overall. For an experienced SLR user, the Pentax is easy to learn.Setup and Use of features are well explained in the Manual. Becoming familiar with available features and programs will take practice.I recommend buying the Body ONLY and purchase an after market lens. The standard 18-55 Pentax lens DOES NOT do the camera justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great digital SLR","review":"I own two other Pentax film SLRs (ME and ZX-7)and were happy with them, but this K10D is much more capable and a takes a better picture than the ZX-7. I am still learning what some of the capabilities are as I go along (too much to learn at one time!) but have not found anything it cannot do as yet. A digital (DA) f1.4 50mm lens is on my wishlist for the future. It is a little heavy compared to my other cameras but not a real problem. Also found I could use the same remote I already had besides the automatic lens from my ZX-7 camera. I would recommend it to anyone who likes lots of features and great pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a warrantied product","review":"Hello, The Camera is great, but if you buy it from Amazon and it breaks, Pentax doesn't accept invoice from Amazon as proof of a warrantieable product.

I would even be happy to pay a FEW dollars more for this. This provider uses DHL which takes 10 days or so to deliver...and offers a 2 or 3 day delivery for a LOT more money.The camera worked perfectly, taking stunning photographs for 2 days and then froze-up. The return process involved the provider sending me a DHL return label via DHL (10 more days) vs e-mailing it, the return via DHL (10 more days) and they assure me that the replacement is on it's way but as it's only been 5 days since they sent it I still have almost a week to wait.I didn't look for user performance reviews of this camera before purchasing it...shame on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price, a better flash would earn 5 stars.","review":"I've been upgrading my compact Digital Camera's nearly every year, trying to get a very good and portable camera to take on hiking and kayaking trips figuring if it where to be damaged I'd only be out a few hundred bucks. Even my latest and greatest 5.2 Megapixel does not take the quality of photo I'm looking for. After reading the Specs and Reviews on the K-10 and it's weather/dust ristance I decided it was time to move up. Though $400 more than my last compact this camera has proven to be well worth it's price. Not having to worry about a few rain drops, or the occasional dust devil has emboldened me to get outdoor shots no matter what the weather. This camera is very solid, and fast, just flick the \\"on\\" switch and start snapping shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get sharp photos, even in decent light","review":"I wish I had read the few negative comments regarding lack of sharpness with the K10D sooner. Evan when I'm outdoors it's hard to get crisp photos no matter what I do. I have had this camera for over two years and have been driving myself crazy thinking I'M doing something wrong. But when I have picked up friends' Canons or Nikons recently and snapped a few photos, they always seem so crisp so I began to suspect it was my camera. Now I see that others have had the same issue. Not sure if it's a defect with certain units or just a quirk with the model. Unfortunately I am way past the warranty but I look forward to getting a new DSLR some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought a Pentax K10D two years ago. The camera seemed to work well, but several months ago the image sensor went bad- pictures were in magenta and blue. Returning it to Pentax for repair, I got a quote for repair of $400! Their lousy sensor goes bad, and because it was past their feeble one-year warranty, Pentax will do nothing to correct what is clearly faulty manufacturing or parts. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Pentax- they will not support their products, and your money would be much better spent on another manufacturer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pain of 1 year with Pentax K10D","review":"I owned this for an year. You cannot say it is a very good camera. It is just a below average camera.I bought it for close to 1000 $I could have taken maximum of 2000 pictures with it.Also recently it suddenly started showing battery depleted symbol. Contacted pentax, they suggested to send to a third party who does the repair (Note:- All pentax official repair will be done by third party shop)Currently the third party repair shope is saying, it is not the problem with battery it is the problem with reflex mirror, stuck in the apperture...etc. They are asking for close 300$ for repair.Now I realize that with my experiances with Nikon, Canon etc..Overall...Pentax was not worth for the money I spend.Please spend wisely.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amendment","review":"I wrote an earlier review posted here and commented about Mr. Jaconson's references to his other books. I recently recieved an email from the author where he explained some of his reasons for doing so. Key among those reasons was the fact that he often had limited space available due to restraints set by the publisher and wanted to explain where more information could be found. While I still think the refrences can be slightly distracting I now understand Mr. Jacobson's reasons for doing so and thought I should share that information to be read with my previous review. I also noticed in rereading my previous review that it sounded much more harsh than I had intended. Let me be clear: this is an excellent book, well written and filled with great information, and I certainly would reccomend it. My complaint was and is a minor one and shouldn't keep you from purchasing this great book about camping and canoeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for learning about canoe camping.","review":"There are dozens of canoeing books that touch on the basics of canoe camping.

I thought the flow control would be easy to find at the local hardware stores, but I was wrong. I have seen them in the past but not lately. Lowe's can order the Delta flow control made for the Delta shower shower head but it costs around $25.00, which is made of metal. The particular Delta shower system I bought and the plumbers installed has no flow control in the control so a separated flow control is required. I didn't know that until the plumbers were finished.The only problem with the flow control is that it is made of plastic but it works. At the low price of the unit and the high shipping cost, it was much more cost effective to buy two at the same time, since it only increased the shipping cost a few pennies. Now I have a spare in case I need it or I can sell it at a small profit.I recommend it highly if an inexpensive flow control is desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"shower head flow control","review":"this item leaks from the first time you install it, I tried 3 of them they all leak water, this item have defect in the desigeni do not recomend for any one to buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Replacment for my Grand Prix's pricey lights","review":"These were my second setFirst got glass lenses taken out by rocks and gravelWith a little work they adapted well where my factory driving lights wereand MUCH brighter:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disappointment","review":"I bought this CD thinking I was acquiring \\"original\\" recordingssince there weren't any writings on the cover that indicatedotherwise.

This seemed like such a great idea that I bought two. But when you tip it to pour the batter, it doesn't glide down the spout into the tin. It slops over the sides of the spout and spills everywhere. No matter how carefully you try to pour, the spout is just too small to handle batter. If the spout were a true funnel--a measuring cup with a closed spout that wouldn't allow spills--it would work fine. But a tiny spout that's open at the top is a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"The spout is way too narrow.","review":"I bought this for pancake batter but it's not good for anything but liquids.

But, after using it to pour muffin batter and pancake batter, I decided a larger funnel-pitcher may have been too heavy for my arthritic hands. The only feature I would like to see changed is the funnel spout, which seems to let some of the batter spill over the top unless the batter is of a quite thin consistency.I hope the company that makes this item will sometime come out with a version that has the top rim of the spout covered over, more like a tube, the same way the spout on an ordinary funnel has.

The instruments used are all quite authentic, with extensive liner notes on them. There were no notes on the actual recording or performers, so one is left to assume that all instruments and compositions are by Mr. Reyes. The music itself is at times haunting, airy, dark and light; one piece with vocals. This CD left me hungering for more, if there is more. The only shortcoming is the briefness of the recording; at 37 minutes I was hoping for more. I believe it was originally released on LP, which would explain the length.

Her characters, usually pretty well developed, are so one-dimensional that I didn't feel sympathy for any of them and that is the \\"kiss of death\\" for me as a reader. I want to cheer for someone or at least feel interested in their fate. With these folks I would have been unmoved if they'd all been chucked over a cliff. Plus there were more than a few that I wanted to slap around and and say, \\"grow up!\\" So, perhaps I do not understand what Paretsky was trying to accomplish, but for me the book was tedious and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly awful book.","review":"Have always enjoyed V.I. and so went in expecting this book to be enjoyable and moderately well-done. I've rarely read anything so contrived, so full of characters that even a mother couldn't love (no wonder all the mothers died...) and so devoid of any redeeming qualities (like plot, depth, character development, etc.) Would definitely recommend giving this one a miss. Wait for the next Warshawski."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should not have been published","review":"This is an awful book. It is poorly plotted and sloppily written. Furthermore, the transition from print to the Kindle edition has not been adequately supervised and so there are countless errors.

The usual spark is completely missing, and so is credibility. I wish I could have liked this, because the theme is an important and vital one. But I found this to be quite laborious reading which just did not ring true. I do hope that this doesn't discourage her from trying again to show that she can tackle important social issues.

These are the main characters; a strange mix that doesn't really work.

Imagine my disappointment when the first five pages were so totally dull, and the characters so completely deadly that I knew it would be a waste of time to get into the novel any further. Sara Paretsky may not want to be \\"trapped\\" in the Warshawski novels, but she does so extremely well in that genre! Ms. Paretsky has made the same mistake Robert Ludlum did when he tried to be funny in his two \\"Road...\\" books. This is a writer who definitely needs to stick with what she does so wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't even worthy of 1 star!","review":"I have read all Sara Paretsky's books and my opinion is that she didn't write this book. It reads more like a friend or relative wrote it and used her name to get it published. The introduction of the characters was so haphazard and hard to follow that I didn't care about them at all. The opening paragraphs are about an irritating female drunk awakening after a binge...it only got worse. My advice is: If at first you don't like it, don't bother plowing through the rest of it; give it up as a lost cause and choose another of the many female sleuths available like the Sue Grafton series or Janet Evanovich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Country","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I love the V.I. books and was ready to take on a new Paretsky book, but now I realize that it's best to stick with the familiar mysteries.

Sara Paretsky should stick with what she is best at and that is the V.I. Mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?","review":"This was something totally unexpected. I am not sure where Sara was going with this book and was really disappointed. I did not associate with the characters and it was hard to get into the book.

It was boring and didn't keep me hanging on. Definitly not a page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one strange book.","review":"Although this book is sympathetic to women, poor and homeless people and critical of anti-women, patriarchal church leaders, showing what they're really all about, it's a weird book. Paretsky makes some very good points showing a lot of the contradictions in today's society, the problems of the homeless and of poor women and the lack of decent shelters, funding, decent health care and mental health care--but the points are almost lost in the strange story and weird religious allegories. The reader gets bogged down in all of this while Paretsky is making good points about society today and the need for solutions to these very real social problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ghost Country\\" will change your perception of homelessness.","review":"I didn't expect to like this book as I have been waiting years for the next installment of V.I. Warshawski's sleuthing and this is not it. But Sara Paretsky has written an amazing book about how inhuman we humans can become and how the human spirit can survive the unspeakable. This may sound too heavy or uninteresting but, as I read, I wanted to know what would become of the main characters. I wanted the sisters to see their grandfather for the emotionally crippled, love-less creature that he was. This novel shows how different are perception and reality and that what appears to be true is often not. I highly recommend this book. I for one will look at the homeless with different eyes now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating","review":"I found this title extremely disappointing. My expectations were obviously too high. A really weird offering from Paretsky.

This attempt at magical realism is so badly conceived that I wonder what Paretsky could have been thinking. The magical elements hit us over the head, rather than hinting at an alternate reality.The characters were all unlikeable and the main character, a ghostly re-incarnation of a Sumerian goddess, was absolutely grotesque. I found myself almost rooting for the fundamentalist church people who have evil designs on the goddess.Not that I wish Paretsky stay pigeonholed in the mystery genre, but I wish she'd get back to doing what she does so well--created well-paced mysteries with moxie and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read!","review":"\\"Mental Leaps\\" gives the impression of an academic book, and it is. However, it is written so well that [almost] everyone can understand it. It is a very good intoduction to the very concept \\"analogy\\" -- not very philosophical or very abstract, but rather \\"scientific\\" and concrete. Authors give a lot of examples and refer to experiments and case studies, thus the reader should have considerable amount of insight on \\"how we think\\", \\"how we learn\\", \\"how we understand\\" and etc. after reading this book. Of course, no one should expect to learn everything about these issues from this book, since cognitive science is still in its infancy. I think anyone can benefit from this book. A little insight about your own \\"thinking\\" won't hurt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convincing","review":"While the books premise is interesting and creative, I did not come away with the feeling that the authors had proved their point.

It's pretty obvious that everyone was nervous for this special debut (particularly the chorus and the tenor ... and perhaps even the conductor) ... BUT ... that aside ... this is truly a performance to treasure for all fans of opera. Nothing can dim the Callas/Gobbi combination in their traveling 'ACT 2,TOSCA SHOW'. It's interesting to compare it with the Covent Garden version of a few years later. Both are well worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY - Complete rip off of 'Stage'","review":"The tracks on this album are the exact same tracks as those on 'Stage' minus 2 songs. The 1st 6 tracks of 'Stage' were recorded at The House Of Blues in Los Angeles, CA. The last 6 tracks of 'Stage' were recorded at The Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, CA. For some strange reason, the tracks on 'Extended Versions' alternates between the 2 shows, I can only guess in an attempt to keep the listener from recognizing the order of the songs from 'Stage.' This CD is a rip off. Don't buy it! Buy 'Stage.' You will be much happier with 'Stage.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY, a swim cap that doesn't sufficate my head.","review":"After going through 3-4 different swim caps, I finally found one that breaths and doesn't constrict my head!

For a moment I though it was a youth size but after checking the package I confirmed it is adult size. The material seems ok but I will never be able to test its durability because I cannot put the cap on, and I am normal size. So in general I recommend Speedo Lycra Caps, if you can try it on first, but otherwise, be aware that you might get a cap that won't fit you, even if it is sold by Amazon (my case). It barely fits my 10 year old. I am going to try and return it but I'll have to pay the return shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea gone very bad!","review":"First of all I LOVE how comfortable it is. Doesn't feel like it's squeezing your head like a normal silicone cap would. HOWEVER, two problems. The banded seam around the edge leaves a lovely indentation around my forehead. The cap also holds water so by the time I'm at the end of the lane, I have this lovely water bubble inside the cap. I have to open the cap away from my head to let the water bubble drain out so I can hear again. Thumbs down.

And never again will I use a silicon swim cap - too tight, pulls the hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my swim cap!","review":"I use this cap inside the silicone swimcap (for long hair) as a liner and it works really well. The first use I felt it a little too tight for comfort but like any piece of clothes, it expanded just right after the first use. This cap resolved a constant issue I had with using just a silicone swimcap for my laps; I hated that my hair snagged and by the 4th lap my silicone cap would come off. Not anymore! Just love the product. I have long and very abundant hair and it keeps it in place! Please know that swimcaps are NOT meant to keep your hair dry. They are meant to keep your hair off your face and enhance your performance while swimming! Highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!

When I first ordered this I started to regret it after seeing as the other reviews say it was too small. I have long thick hair and I didn't think it would hold but it did! It's a great cap and awesome material. It's a nice barrier between my hair and goggles, now they don't get tangled and my regular silicon cap fits better than ever and doesn't slip off!

Clay shows off his spanish alittle with Feliz Navidad, but the song that touched me the most is Clay's version of Mary Did You Know? This song stopped my heart and took my breath away for a bit, I was driving while listening the first time and when Clay towards the end of the song speaks the words, I had to pull into a park and listen over and over again.This CD will make a great addition to anyone young or old a Clay fan or not.

Checked the bags the next day and 90% of them had lost suction and expanded back to normal, some of them did it in a matter of a couple hours.

At first, two of mine leaked and I realized there was a small \\"bubble\\" at the end next to the zipper pull where air was leaking out.

I didn't read the reviews on this site - which would have stopped me from throwing away a bunch of money on these worthless bags. They are very cheaply made - though not priced that way. I bought 4 sets with 8 bags each. I have attempted to use about 10 of them. The air sucks out fine and whatever is in there becomes a compact brick. But just as the other reviews stated, within a period of time - sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes several days - every single one of them took on some air. Lighter objects, like pillows, seemed to work best - perhaps because they offered the least amount of resistance. Very, very disappointing. Not worth it at all.

They really need to re-do this and make it from vinyl or something. The first one I used worked well (but I am afraid one of the cats might chomp on the corner). The second one, apparently the blue \\"zip\\" clip was misaligned and sawed right through the bag!!! I didn't expect to be having to use duct tape the first time I used these. I'm still not sure if my duct tape will hold... doing a test now. If you have these - DONT use the zip clip - if it's not lined up just right it will tear the chinsy plastic.

It is sturdy, the Famicom version has wonderful colors, the buttons are reponsive and feel like quality buttons, the rechargeable battery is great, the screen is bright and clear (no dark corners!), the ability to change the brightness is great, and also I thought since it was small that it might cramp my very large hands; I have had problems with that on GBA SPs before, but it has not so far been a problem! Also, it seems that IF the screen gets scratched I can just replace the faceplate which is great. :-) It came with a soft storage bag that is pretty sweet. Lastly though the one I got was a Japanese Version. I'm ok with that because everything works right here, but if anyone is a stickler ask the seller first. TTFN! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works pretty well, for its age","review":"At this point the gameboy micro is a vintage gaming system, but it works just fine for its intended use. The buttons are easier to hit on the SP while these tend to pick up sweat a lot due to the glossy finish. It is very small and you can carry it anywhere. It is more portable than most phones. The screen has the same resolution as the SP and Advance but a lower pixel pitch, which means the pixels are closer together but again the resolution is the same. The backlight is pretty much always on high because the other levels are so close in brightness to the highest one they are not of much use.-1 star for poor button action and a system that is hard to hold on to but other than that sturdy build. Buy one while you can, although at this point its probably too late for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micro is a waste of money","review":"Both the GBA and GBA SP are backward compliant with GB and GBC games.

After over ten years together, the band is still capable of releasing a brilliant record and progressing even further. Many bands don't even last ten years let alone still sound relevant and interesting after long periods of time. On The Argument, Fugazi has embraced melody moreso than in the past and use to their advantage. Songs like \\"The Kill\\" might be more mellow, but their still intense and enjoyable. \\"Full Disclosure,\\" \\"Cashout,\\" \\"Oh,\\" \\"Epic Problem,\\" and the title track are all great, stunning, powerful songs that make The Argument one of the best records this year.

Professor Boyle drives home that point, along with the relevance of International Law to defending defendants in such controversial criminal cases.

This is nothing more than a blatant attempt for you to cash in on the Tiger name. Your contempt for Tiger's success comes off as very immature, and your advice to him is heavy-handed. Why such bitterness for a young man so early in his career? This book has absolutely zero depth.

Of course, now the Agency has him back, programmed to help in the assassination of presidential candidate Frederick Coffin. Bruce Weitz plays Speakman's former mentor whose involvement in the conspiracy is predictable.

For most students, they're usually just intimidating and the object of many blank stares. IMO, for students who will take only one class in statistics, learning out of this book would be very helpful in a way many other books would not be. For students who will take more than one, gaining a strong conceptual foundation will be helpful as well.My guess is that the students complaining about this book don't know how good they've got it.

Even after I shower, my tan continues to develop. The longer you leave it on (max I have done is 8 hours), the deeper tan you will have. I am sensitive to smells, and this tanner is not offensive. It definitely has a smell, but it is light and doesn't make me choke like most other tanners. I also use this tanner on my face and it is amazing.

I could not be happier with this product! I am fair complected, not stark white with freckles but light skinned and this color is great! I'm never going to look like dark skinned people but this product got me back wearing shorts! Color lasts for days as well as being very easy to apply if one is familiar with self-tanning lotions and mousse.

So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel. They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese. Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's. If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible. If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion. Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color. Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories. I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do.

However, I feel potential buyers deserve at least some warning about this novel's awfulness. To be fair, it actually starts out somewhat promising if rather conventional. I enjoyed Rod's character as Hispanic characters are few and far between in gay fiction. But the novel quickly disintegrates into unbelievably silly scenes, cloying dialogue (what passes for 'love' between Bart and Rusty will make you diabetic if you aren't already) and a plot that becomes plain stupid.

Well, we're still waiting. We've got an absolutely delightful, polite, even-tempered two year-old. Luck, maybe? We don't think so; like White, we've noticed a pretty clear-cut correlation between parental behavior and toddler behavior. Do we feel we've failed if our toddler occasionally acts out? No, we just work at parenting a little harder. This book may not have in-depth or novel solutions to all parenting problems, but it offers solid approaches to shaping behavior.

The first time she had a temper tantrum at 12 months I was shocked and had no instinct at all as to how to respond to her. This book really opened my eyes to what's going on and how to avoid letting that behavior turn into a bratty 3-year old screaming at me in the grocery store (isn't that what we all want?!).

Basically, you're screwed and it's because you spoiled them. Needless to say, this didn't help me.

It pits the 19th century linguistics orthodoxy about the chronology of the Vedic people against a diverse set of scholars. On the one hand, you have the archaeologists who are completely against the racist basis of the linguists' framework; on the other, you have most Sanskritists and historians of astronomy who claim that the internal evidence within the Vedic books goes against the linguists' chronology. Bryant conflates all these diverse scholars with \\"Hindu nationalists\\", suggesting a political agenda behind the views!He has created a false dichotomy of AIT and OIT. In fact, most of the scholars who reject AIT reject its chronology of invasions or immigration around 2000 BC, preferring to stay silent on the situation before 4000 BC or so.The intellectural framework for the book is weak.

The writing style is simple yet evocative and we quickly move from the author's training days to the moment when he first meets an enemy plane in combat. What I particularly appreciated about the book was the focus on Anderson's family and the stresses they suffered and the continual reference to the brutality of war and the number of the author's flying colleagues who died. The World War Two reminiscences end about two-thirds of the way through the book and then we have to wade through perhaps too much about his post-war experiences as a test pilot, a desk-bound bureaucrat and then a commander in the Vietnam war.

The wedge did smell a bit on the chemical side at first, although I was able to tolerate the odor until it dissipated (something like a week). Most importantly, it helped tremendously with my back. Unfortunately, this lasted only a couple of months, and now the wedge seems to offer little support (the 7\\" vertical height in the back is now naturally compressed to something like 2\\").

Yes, the sleep is worth the money, but I would imagine you could make a more durable pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this wedge pillow!","review":"This pillow is like sleeping on a sack of cement!

I started having pressure in my eyes and lymph nodes in my head which prevented me from laying flat. The first week I tried sleeping directly on the pillow and it was torture. It is brick hard with little give. It helped relieve some of the pressure, but I was so uncomfortable I would wake up through the night and be sore the next day. I tried it for a straight week in hopes that I would get used to it or maybe it would soften but no luck. Eventually I had to put a thick pillow on top of it to make it through the night. The reason I purchased the wedge was to get away from having to stack pillows to begin with. I used it off and on for 3 months and finally tossed it in the closet. Even with light use, the thin cheap pillow case has a tear in it.

Nice clean highs, but the bass is a little muddy. Maybe it will clear up in time as they burn in, but for the price... I especially like the volume control and headphone input. It works excellent and matches my system. But these speakers are great for the price. If I spent 100 on them I would be mad with the sound quality, but for less than 30, they are excellent. I just picked up a new pair of speakers which sound way better than these and they were cheaper too. Check out my other reviews on which speakers I got. These will be sitting in my closet for a backup pair, not worth sending them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like deep, solid bass, these speakers are for you.","review":"I like these speakers for two good reasons: The price is right, and they deliver really good bass, which is what I was looking for when I purchased these. The manufacturer was good enough to list some of the specifications on the package cover, which is really what helped me decide on this product. While the sub-woofer definitely delivers the bass, the two satelite speakers are a bit short on the higher frequencies, but still good. So take my word for it, these babies kick--and then some!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, just absolutely Awful. Did I mention Awful?","review":"Oh my GOD!

It sounds great from a quality perspective. The shape and style of the speakers are slick and glossy. Cables are thoughtfully located out the way. There is over 6 feet of cable from the bass unit to the input/volume control module which means you can place these speakers that far away from your computer, another nice touch.The Bad: The power cord is surprisingly short. At less than 5 feet, don't think about moving that speaker away from the wall outlet.The Ugly: I've got the volume cranked up all the way and I can still hear the birds chirping in the backyard. Honestly though, the loudness of this unit is lacking and it won't be a stand alone living room stereo speaker. It is, however, great for desktop computer or small bedroom sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good sound and price","review":"Pros: Sleek, Good quality, excellent bass, ez to set-up, price, enough power for a small room.Cons:Can't find one.I loved this item, it was a good buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"sub-woofer does not work","review":"I opened the box and set it all up only to find that the sub-woofer does not function.

They are meant to be for computer speakers not to be mistaken for a stereo system like most bad reviews want them to be. I really like them I use them for computer gaming and listening to music while I'm in my room. It's great for that, they are also good for watching Netflix and Youtube videos if you want good sound. They have wonderful sound quality and truly beautiful bass. There is an AUX port on the volume knob and that makes it easy to plug in your MP3 player into.

Excellent bang for the buck. separate base control is helpful for fine tuning your listening environment. however there is one pitfall to these speakers...sound quality. Compared to a hifi system or more expensive name brand systems, these fall short. But this can easily be overseen with the attractive price. If your not too concerned with sound quality as much as economy, then these speakers will please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"If you are looking for an upgrade for tinny laptop speakers or ultra cheap non-powered or even powered 2.0 speaker systems, this will fit the bill perfectly. They are compact and the control pod is very convenient. The sound quality is adequate for basic computer use if you tweak the EQ settings of your sound card or playback application. If you are looking for audiophile level fidelity or desk shaking bass you will be disappointed. It is too underpowered for any substantial bass response. If you turn the volume up too high the subwoofer does that sharp \\"boom\\" in the 40 to 60 hz range that causes the driver to cut out. Overall, good quality sound for this price point. It will not compete with anything from the likes of Bose, but in the sub $30 crowd - a very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great for price","review":"I was a little skeptical about buying these because I wanted a decent sound but after reading the other reviews I decided it was worth 30 bux.

The 160 picture package seems to be the way to go. Everything is nicely divided into smaller packages (2 packages of paper per cartridge) so everything stays neat and fresh. Much better price. Has worked well for me and I have been very satisfied with the quality of the pictures I can produce. I've even used it to make copies of scanned pictures from the 1930's.

I know I could put it down for another, well-seasoned author but I always feel like I've wasted my time by not finishing.IDK, the book is like a boring narrative; the writing amateurish and just to full of extraneous details.

I liked the main characters but felt they could have been developed a bit more, just meaning I did not feel as bonded and invested in them as compared to other books with new or unfamiliar characters. It also ended a bit abruptly and could have had a little more wrap up to satisfy the reader or draw them in to future adventures of the characters, since this is a first in series.

Only stubborn refusal to give in allowed me to finish \\"Final Jeopardy.\\" I found myself getting frustrated that such interesting premises and plot twists could be written in such a lifeless way.Also, having met the characters in another novel, I was surprised at how unlikeable they were in this one. The heroine behaves unprofessionally in her work life, and she is somehow both emotional and cold in her private life. It was difficult to sympathize with her. She didn't come across that way in the other book.There were good things. The short side stories of other sex crimes were interesting, if a little distracting. The author also does a good job of explaining why someone would want to pursue this particular disturbing career.

Conversations read like narrative, and it was often difficult to figure out who was speaking. The overall tone, even given the hard-boiled prosecutor and seen-it-all detectives, was flat and expressionless. With all the tightly written, literate crime novels out there, I wouldn't be inclined to try Ms. Fairstein's works again."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK first effort","review":"I bought and read this book under the premise that an expert in the field of legal crime was taking a step to bring her accumen to the world of fiction. I was somewhat disappointed. The main plot itself is mundane and cliched. The sidetrips into other cases are interesting to a point but not eye-opening like a Patricia Cornwell. The supporting cast needs fleshing out. Beyond Chapman, the cop sidekick, you never really get a feel for the other folks; to the point that you need to review occasionally to differentiate between a friend and a secretary.

Started the audio book while on a short road trip (yeah, thanks to the recession, we're still driving old cars with built-in cassette decks) and I was thankful for the concrete median, since there were times in the story I would have preferred slamming into the grill of an oncoming semi. To be fair, I finished the story while making a number of short trips while in town, so when I say that the story at times meandered it may be my own disjointed listening sessions.

Nagel, more than anyone else, is responsible for the re-examination now going on within Anglo-American philosophy of scientific materialism and of the reductionism and scientism that has gone along with it. Across a wide variety of philosophical problems, the book examines the hold that scientific materialism has had on recent thinking, and it suggests a number of ways that we can loosen that hold. Some of the suggestions are dazzling; even more dazzling are some of the problems themselves, which are discussed nowhere else.

But the easy to use power button and volume controls are a plus, as well as a small footprint, helpful with a cluttered desk.Unfortunately, if my cell phone is within about 6 feet of the speakers, they go crazy with static.

The right speaker had great quality sound, but every time I turned it up--to make up for the fact that the left speaker was emitting very little sound--a strange buzzing sound came from both speakers. Funnily enough, when I shut the speakers off and left iTunes playing a song, I could still hear the song faintly from the left speaker. Two months later, they broke completely. The volume button caved in and now all I get is feedback. It's definitely not worth $20 or even $5.

It may be a good \\"idea\\", but as some others have noted, the implementation of the idea is fatally flawed.There's a HUGE amount of noise using headphones and a 5.8GHz cordless phone on the same desk causes an irritating tone when in use that only stops by turning the speakers off.Very disappointed so hopefully they can be returned despite 2 with no packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unusable - straight to trash can","review":"These speakers appeared to be a good basic pair of speakers for those who want a no-frills, inexpensive system. They look pretty nice, admittedly. Power is drawn through a USB port, which is a nice idea - no bulky transformer. And herein lies the problem.Power from the USB port needs to be filtered; on these speakers, it is definitely not. They hiss, crack, and transmit/amplify every electronic interference signal that comes out of your PC. Move your mouse, and you hear clicking. CD-ROM usage is even worse. The noise renders the speakers unusable, for even the most patient among us.For the price, they're not even worth the effort to return ship them.

For personal, and health reasons Ryan quit baseball when he was young, but after he meets his new neighbor during his senior year in school he decides to go out for the team. Although his friendship with his new neighbor is downright unstable at times, He brings about a spark in Ryan that he hasnt had otherwise.

If a human is murderous and violent enough to set a trap in the first place, yeah, they might kill a fish, but who is the \\"stupid\\" one here? I can't help but feel the need to rebut such a ridiculous statement. Should a fish not swim in its natural habitat? Should all creatures surrender their homes to the human animals?

I contact them again, they sent another transformer that had the same manufacturing flaw. They seemed to have drawn the line at replacing the faulty transformer only twice. This is the response I got from Daniel P at customer support:\\"I have been informed that all the adapters for this product will have some copper coil that is visible through slots in the actual adapter.\\"Evidently they don't understand that the cooper that's exposed is outside the protection of the transformer case making this a fire hazard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Night Camera","review":"I have used several different security camera's and I have found this camera to be the best for night vision as the picture is clear and distortion free.

I tried a ferrite bead and adjusting my software and bios, none of which helped me. I also had a little trouble with the wire -- had lost sound in one speaker 'til I wiggled it again. When headphones are plugged into the jack on the speakers, I can only hear sound out of one earpiece. Am trying to get Amazon to exchange them. Hopefully, it's just a problem with this pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 2-Speaker Computer Speaker Set","review":"Excellent value for the money. I don't think you can get a better sounding computer speaker setup without going to a system with a subwoofer. However, a decent subwoofer set usually costs at least $20 more than these. They also look good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Price/performance ratio!","review":"These robust little beauties cost about $5 more than the tinny, poorly shielded computer speakers I had before. The sound quality alone puts these speakers in a class way above their price -- lovely full-bodied reproduction. There are earbud and auxillary jacks in the front, so you can listen in privacy or plug in your mp3 player (although I had to crank the speaker all the way up to get a decent volume level from earbuds), and they're easily adaptable for computer use, CD player, mp3 player, or whatever you need small portable speakers for. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant get any worse !!!","review":"Cyber Acoustics CA-2022R 2.0 Computer Speakers- BlackThey are terrible ...1.

The quality isn't as good as what you would hear through a USB-linked sound system but that's to be expected, and is not that great of a difference. I find myself incredibly satisfied, especially considering the price. The volume quality when connected to an MP3 player is not as great as when connected to the computer but would suffice at any small gathering or a private dance party with yourself as you clean around the house. I also noticed many people complaining about a glitch with the headphone jack but I found nothing wrong with my model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I wasn't looking for music quality sound & the low price got me to purchase these & quit relying on the monitor speakers. These definitely fit the bill- they're better than most monitor speakers, they sound ok, but keep in mind that they won't do your music library any favors. Four stars for these based on their price-point, but if you really care about audio quality, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works For Me !","review":"These speakers have a nice design and are pleasing on the eyes. Sound quality is excellent and loud but I normally use speakers with earphones since I am HoH (hard of hearing) . The available volume using earphones was at first disappointing but once I got into the sound dialog of my computers I was able to tweak the sound, using controls that I'd never thought of using, so that I had more volume than before. Without being able to do this I would have been disappointed since my hearing loss is somewhat severe. All in all I have rated the Cyber Acoustics CA-2022 with 4 stars instead of 5 stars due to the additional tweaking necessary for them to work to my expectations. I have used Cyber Acoustics products before and have been pleasantly pleased with my purchase(s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Computer Speakers","review":"These speakers are just fine. Very simple to connect with brief, clear instructions. I needed speakers for an inexpensive 19\\" TV that had terrible, almost inaudible, sound even with the volume set to maximum. With the speakers the quality and volume of the sound is very good. The price was reasonable and delivery was great. They arrived a couple days earlier than the estimated delivery date given. These speakers were among the 10 best computer speakers rated by an audio pro on the net. I would buy these again for other equipment and recommend them to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful reliability","review":"I guess I should have known from the price but these speakers lasted 3 months before they finally completely quit.

Totally worth the price! They make A LOT of noise, and it's pretty clear (it starts to sound like $20 when a song with a strong bass plays with max volume). People have told me that they can hear my music from outside my building. So, they make me happy! And they were cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There have to be better cheap computer speakers than these, right?","review":"Needed some computer speakers for the office and didn't want to spend upwards of $150 for small powered monitors so I tried these. Overall, the sound is pretty disappointing and isn't remotely balanced. The highs are over-accentuated. Upper-mids are scooped. Mids sound boxy. Upper-lows are relatively clear but the very low end is pretty much non-existant; to be expected with such small speaker cones. On the upside, these get plenty loud enough for my needs. I didn't expect miracles for $20 but these aren't a whole lot better than the stock speakers on my laptop computer. The search will continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound for a good price!","review":"Despite some of the comments for these speakers, I am very very pleased.

In addition, one of the speakers made a rattling noise on low notes (which may have been a one-time manufacturing defect or shipping damage). We ended up returning them.From my experience, if you want to spend only $20 like I did, I'd say you should consider headphones. We were hoping to replace other speakers and headphones we use with our system, but, unfortunately, these speakers just aren't up to the task. They don't produce anything like high quality, rich sound. They don't even get up to the level of the cheap built-in speakers we already have or the inexpensive headphones we already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price","review":"I love buying at Amazon I always find the best price on the merchandise I want.

It does provide a list of all the trails but its very limited. It's basically a list of Trials (about 5 trials on each page). It provides almost no information about the trials expect for the mileage and the surface. It fails to give you the exact starting points, it only list the town names as the starting points. It would be nice to know the exact address for the starting points. It does not give you any idea as to the grade or time it will take for the ride or the level of difficulty or even a map of the trial. This book is not worth the money.

Yes, it is convenient that it uses the USB port to power it. But they are the worst sounding speakers I've ever heard. They are great if the only thing you plan on listening to are video clips on You Tube or some other low quality sound (very very quietly). But if you ever plan to listen to music, movies, etc please don't bother buying these. The volume dial has 9 dots but they begin to sound horrible between the first (no sound) and second dot. These speakers also pick up RF interference and make lots of hissing and bleeping sounds when a cell phone is nearby (good speakers have RF shielding to prevent this). I highly recommend spending a little bit more money to buy better quality speakers. These are a waste of money since they will most likely end up in the trash.

WILL NEVER, NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be lots better","review":"A consequence of Samsung's policy of speeding products to market. This box has a mind of its own in deciding and remembering which channels are NTSC and which are DTV -- an opaque process that is hard for the consumer to override or reset. The worst problem is that there is a programming bug in the ASTC mode that Fox used *last year* for \\"Widescreen.\\" (Fortunately, Fox uses real HDTV this year.) The top and bottom of the image were cut off so you lost things like the score on football games. (This is in a mode where, showing a 16:9 image on a 4:3 monitor, there are intentional black bars at the top and bottom of the screen to make the image fit.) The worst part was, after repeated contacts with Samsung North America, it developed that not only was there no firmware update (even though there is a connector on the back for firmware updates), they had no way of even reporting the problem to the engineers in Korea to request a firmware update.

When it does work, it switches channels slowly, and the machine easily freezes while compiling the electronic programming guide (they mention this \\"feature\\" in the manual). But the real deal breaker is the fact the the machine freezes any time it gets a signal it can't handle. My first unit simply halted with the annoying \\"HELLO\\" message on the front panel. It did not respond to any remote or front panel buttons. Power cycling did no good. The second unit, when it encounted a bad signal would go into a reboot cycle, taking 10-15 seconds to recover. I guess that was suppose to be an improvement. When it finally locked up, I was able to coax it out by flipping the resolution on the back of the box.

One battery is a water filled type with high cranking amps used to start the V8, 330HP engine and the other battery is a sealed gell, deep-cycle for running the \\"house\\" electronics. The charging requirements are different for each battery and I was assured by the manufacturer that this charger/tender could meet the specific needs of both types without a problem. I installed the tender and within 24 hrs. both batteries were fully charged and in maintenance mode.

I contacted Deltran who told me to ship the unit back to them on my nickel and they would look at it and repair what went wrong then ship it back to me for $15.

IT SURE DOES!","review":"Before I'm blasted for this review, let me start off by saying that I loved the original TV series when I was a kid and I still like to revisit it. This film just doesn't capture the feel of that show and even though the animation isn't bad, it also isn't all that great. I don't mind remakes when handled with care, but this one seems uninspired and almost pointless. Sure I want to see Astro Boy with all the advances made to animation, but lets do it with an inspired story and people who give a hoot. It's actually a boring movie, which should never be the case when you're talking about an animated film....or any film for that matter! Astro Boy bombs away? Yep!.. It sure does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete destruction of the original story","review":"I cannot fathom why would someone want to make a movie called Astro Boy if you are going to completely and uterly disregard the story created by Osamu Tezuka. This is just a futuristic pinochio with some excuse for actions scenes and a villain that does not know what he is supposed to do.This is just a sad attempt to earn some money from people on brand recognition, given that this is one of the most iconic characters in the history of comic books. What's original about this movie? The \\"i-am-a-real-boy\\" plot has been beaten to exaustion, and has been performed more interestingly, for example in AI. Another example of a robot story that's fun and created a new story, is Robots from 2005. It is by far nothing exceptional, but at least they don't steal the character names from somewhere else.If you want to see some real Astro boy stories, please go to the comics, also sold here or the TV series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A subliminal brainwashing","review":"Aside from the movie itself, I would like to draw your attention to the subliminal brainwashing in this movie. For years, unless you have no perception, the limousine Communists in Hollywood have made movies advocating Communist totalitarianism (e.g., The Motorcycle Diaries, Che, Reds, The Front, etc.). In their attempt at brainwashing, they have also gone for the kids. In this particular movie, you have a couple of lovable robots who are adorable Marxists. Now, you can imagine what the liberals' reaction would have been if the couple of lovable robots would have been adorable Nazis.

With a little bit more of intelligent thought and creativity and good execution to the plat. The movie could have been a winner. It was choppy, scenes did not smoothly flow from one to another.

This work is a must read for all who question, struggle and who seek guidance in our challenging times."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does a shepherd do, anyway?","review":"We live in an urban society and don't understand the shepherd mataphor. Rabbi Samuel shows us the true caring necessary in the ancient role of shepherd and applies the insights of the Psalm to our view of God. This book is meant for everyone who thinks about, or questions, the idea of a personal God. It is a scholarly work, well researched, with citations covering the historical period from Plato to the present and philosophically from the atheist to the pious believer. But don't let me scare you. It is written for the laymen, entertaining and at times, witty. If you wrestle with the concept of a caring God in the 21st century, you must read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your hard earned money","review":"I can only be described as a voracious reader, and romances are my most common fare.

This book is definitely worth reading. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because Chapman falls back on the old advice that husbands have the final say when the husband and wife are at an impass. He presents verses from the Bible to back up his position, but it's weak. He and I will have to agree to disagree because the Bible actually doesn't say who gets the final word. Conservative Christians love to obsess about this - yes, obsess - but God doesn't.

I wasted two hours of my life watching this DVD last night and I wish that I could get it back. So, for your sake, I advise you to stay away from this one. It has a promising premise, I know. But it is so poorly written that you feel taken advantage of because it undermines your intelligence. They thought that by putting in every dark subject matter they could think of, it might pass as artsy reality fare, but it fails miserably.

The movie is especially terrible because it trys to pawn itself off as a good film. Do not be fooled by this cra*- actually, I take that back. If you are fooled by it, you just aren't a good enough person to deserve to recognize its obvious patheticness.

What is there to say about it? It's terrible, it tries to force chronological inconsitencies on us so that we can marvel at the sheer brilliance of the writers and the director, the writing is lazy, it tries to hard so hard to be cerebral that whatever plot there was is lost in an ocean of weak plot twists and bad acting.

The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it provided jobs to a whole lot of people. I think this movie expressed wishful thinking in being able to change your past to alter the present. The movie shows how messed up the present can be when you tinker with the past to get revenge for those that hurt you.Even though there are children in this movie, it is still not good viewing for the little kids. There is one boy that is swearing in this movie which is wrong and there is the suggestion of child porn. which is also wrong.

This haunting movie left me in awe. Original story, developed characters, and an indulgence into the \\"what if\\" make this an excellent movie. My opinion of Ashton Kutcher's acting had never been too high, and then I saw this movie. I have a new respect for the man who I thought was only a one dimensional actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't think I would like it ...","review":"When I first saw the previews for this movie, I thought it appeared to be too mushy and maybe just not the type of movie for me, but I guess I was wrong.This movie makes you change your mind about wanting to change the past. It delves into the idea that you could cause the past to change simply by taking your mind back to that point in time and ... well ... changing the sequence of events. The only thing is, when you change one aspect of the past, the entire future changes as well. Sometimes you should just leave well enough alone.I did not expect the ending, but you come to realize it is the only way the movie could really end. It can be a bit slow at times but overall it is a real attention getter. Be prepared to at least get a little teary eyed at least near the end. There are some disturbing scenes and some tear jerkers.Overall, good movie. I am not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher but enjoyed his role in this movie.Yet another great addition to my movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected!","review":"I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about this film and quite honestly I didn't know what to expect. Two of the people that I watched it with didn't like it but I was blown away. It really makes one think about way things happen and how our decisions affect our lives down the road. This movie does deal with some very disturbing adult subject matters (i.e. victims of child pornography, animal cruelty, and suicide). I wouldn't recommend it to young viewers due to the aforementioned subjects but I think mature viewers should watch this movie and judge it for themselves.In addition, I liked the ending on the theatrical version the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I went into the theatres not expecting much, but looking forward to a nice time travel movie. Man, was I surprised. This is the best movie I've seen all year! Now, I'll admit I was a little skeptical of Ashton Kutcher in this role, simply because his past characters have been....idiots. But I gave him a chance as I would with anyone, and he didn't dissappoint. The begining is a little bumpy, going over Evan's childhood, but once we get caught up it moves to a much quicker pace. There's nothing in this movie I didn't like, and I can't see why anyone wouldn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you like Memento? Sixth Sense? Timeline?","review":"What an awesome flick. I had to pause it on occasion just to rest from the mental barrage. This one will keep me thinking about it for days and I will need to watch it again to find things I may have missed. I knew very little of Kucher before this, other than most critics diss him routinely, but I thought he did a great job. Yeah, there might have been a few inconsistencies, but unless you've time travelled and know exactly what to expect, just get over it and enjoy the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite bad Reviews, I loved it","review":"I thought this was an excellent movie, at least way better than what the critics said.

I, and one of my friends were both in agreement that the film is extremely well put together and with an excellent plot. The only flaw is maybe the film is a bit too sick for some in places. The film isn't gory however, but while you don't see the horrible scenes, (mother and baby being blown up by dynamite, dog being set on fire whilst alive) you do know exactly what has happened. So not Reccommended if you can't stomach that kind of thing. Despite this, I think it's an excellent film, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. Well worth seeing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 100 Of Suspensful","review":"My friend and I were granted by our husbands a night out while they watched the kids. So we went to see this. It is truly one of the better films of 2003. I thought the plot twists and turns were great, and weren't predictable. Ashton did a wonderful job in this movie and was finally able to show that he's not just a comedic actor. If he continues to get rolls like this he could be a top contender of dramatic actors in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with everyone here","review":"Except the people who give this movie 3 stars or less. This movie was definitely deserving of 4 stars in simply its originality. You can't deny that you've ever thought of what it would be like to change something in time. To go back and change something to better your life or someone else's. This movie completely hits that at all angles showing the downside of what it would be like to change time while showing the plus side as well. I won't like, I simply do not like Ashton Kutcher but this movie at least made me respect him as an actor, because I now know he can do that. Amy Smart is great in it as well but I was really blown away by Kutcher's performance.

I think our current understanding of the known universe(s)/multiverse and quantum theory supports the idea that such an event like this could really happen.

The emotional pay-off is quite profound (especially in the director's cut, much better than the theatrical edition), though viewers are advised that the material is often VERY heavy indeed - you have been warned! An unexpected masterpiece.Followed by several in-name-only sequels, beginning with THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT 2 (2006)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep meaning about stillborns and subtly God. Awesome movie.","review":"Awesome show, don't listen to critics and people who didn't appreciate this film, it is violent and disturbing but for a good and deep and truly compassionate and selfless purpose rather than for glorifying evil and the director's cut gives touching, tear jerking meaning about stillborns and subtly God's plan or destiny. Far better than theater version that underestimated (hmm, maybe not after all) intelligence and spiritual depth of audience and gave in to a cop out shallower version. Get this, for the first time I've ever seen the Director's Cut is a VERY different movie.Btw, it appears many seemed to have missed that baby being born to one of protagonist relatives or rather the deep meaning of that in RELATION to the protagonist and his mother.

It turned out to be a pretty decent movie, but I really wouldn't recremend it to anyone just because it does leave you feeling really empty inside and like I said before it was very disturbing/dark.

He never convinced me that he was the character he was supposed to be playing. He never stopped being Ashton Kutcher to me.Also, the plot was really dumb and kind of boring.

I was optimistic coming in but after watching this I now think the airhead who recommended this to me when I said I like time travel stories is an idiot and probably only liked this movie because it was stupid simple (while pretending to be clever) and because she probably thought Ashton Kutcher was cute or something. This movie was total rubbish and a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least Kutcher tried something new","review":"This movie had a lot of potential, but somewhere along the way, fell way short of expectations. Everyone was interested in seeing Kutcher in a more serious role and he did very well, along with the rest of the cast. The problem stemmed more from plot holes and a lack of connection to reality. The idea is cool, the guy can basically warp his brain and memories from when he was younger to alter the present, but in the end it seemed very rushed and went in to many different directions before ending at a heaping mess of an ending.I wanted to like this movie, and parts were kind of neat, but in the end, more time should have been spent reconstructing the script so that it could have been a much more intelligent movie and a real winner at the box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story of Violence","review":"The movie is bad. Really. Doesn't follow the rules that establishes at the beggining, the acting is wooden, and overall seems rushed. If you look at the \\"behind the scenes\\" featurette, you can understand that the two young directors have energy, but don't seem very, how to say it, intellectual in their approach to cinema.This movie is about sadism and violence in general. How people act against each other, and the results of their actions. In this sense, \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" work as an indictment of the cowboy syndrome. But being this a latent interpretation, is not enough. Anyway, the show of violence makes all of us voyeurs of many disturbing things. As in any Hollywood war movie, to show violence and to insinuate or say that is bad is to be hypocrital. For those who gave this movie many stars, please watch more (and better) cinema and then re-watch and have a say (again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY GOOD MOVIE THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.","review":"BASICALLY I LIKE TO WRITE REVEIEWS FOR PRODUCTS THAT I BELEIVE ARE VERY GOOD OR POOR BASED ON MY OPINION AND PERSONEL EXPERIECES.NOW THIS MOVIE I LOVE BECAUSE I DO RECOMMENDED TO BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo.................","review":"Ok let's get real Suspense maybe.

This movie was so bad it has created a new catch phrase amongst my group of friends. We measure how awful something is by how badly it made us want to go back in time and hang ourselves with our own umbilical cord (if you've watched the director's cut, you'll know why we say this . . .).

I was disturbed by parts (and I've seen some very disturbing movies, but this was just too much for me) and I was also bored halfway through the film. I saw about half and didn't watch the other half. I also couldn't stand all the switching screens all the time, I was losing my train of thought as to what was actually happening. I love 'psychological thrillers' as I would call this movie, but this..this was just not what I expected. At all. It almost makes me wonder if everyone was watching the same movie as I was.

There is nothing good about this movie except for Eric Stoltz's hilarious portrayal of a pedophile.And off topic, if every time he goes back it makes everyone's life worse, then when he strangles himself as a fetus (wow, what a retarded concept) wouldn't that make things worse as well. Oh, I get it, but he kills himself so now he doesn't have to deal with ruining other people's lives. He can't even fix his mistakes, so he quits.

We had to turn it off without even finishing it because of some of the scenes. If you are bothered by any of these things and the fact that this movie implies that these things occur, do not rent or buy it.

I, for one, happened to think the acting was great, they took a risk with Ashton being a huge comedy actor, but it paid off. I really felt something inside me empathise with this kids condition and his desperation to make things right. It came out around the same time a Donnie Darko which, because of it being so good, a lot of people compared the two and decided to slate this one, whereas i took them both on their own merit and found this movie to be not only thought provoking, but a sad insight to desperation. A great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tale","review":"He can go back in time and change events, which changes the lives of his circle of friends, and family. Not very profound . . . obviously, changing the past will change the future. But for the Butterfly Effect to be true to its name, many other things would change too, which doesn't happen. The film is \\"politically correct\\" covering a rainbow of situations . . . in having lead characters in prison, dead, happily married, as a paraplegic, as students, in a mental ward, with incurable cancer, in a porno movie, a drug-crazed hooker, and so on.

The actors all seem like amateurs - there is little chemistry between would-be lovers and friends, just lousy acting.ALso, it is not very good sci-fi: I mean, like his dad this guy just has some kind of power to go back in time and change things by looking in his diary or at old photos (but not otherwise!). Then, once he's back in the present, he can remember how things were, unlike anyone else who's affected.

It seemed relevant in 1975, so I believe it is even more relevat today.The author uses humor and wit to get kids to see how spoiled the little mouse has become. It is much like a Freaky Friday story, since a witch has the mother and daughter switch places, and by doing so the daughter learns what it's like to have a difficult child.

Almost a year and a half later I'm Calvinistic and Post-millennial. Hunt's book is good in one way and bad in another. It's good because he encourages discerning New Age techniques that are infiltrating the Christian Church. It's bad because he poses it within the context of an erroneous soteriology (doctrine of salvation) and eschatology (doctrine of \\"last things\\"). Hunt's prescription for the problem: throw up the white flag in surrender in this inevitable apostasy and wait for Jesus to save us in the Rapture.

I only have one baby that is 16 months and it is very helpful to me. I love that if he is sleep and I need to run to the store I do not have to worry about a shopping cart because of the extendable basket. The stroller allows him to recline and for me to do my shopping with no problems. The ride is very smooth and the control is great. I love the way it has so much storage.The only problem is if you do need to use it for a newborn and an older child, the older child can not sit down. The child can only stand. You have to recline the front seat to get the car seat onto the stroller. Which sort of sucks if you have a yound toddler that needs to be belted into that back seat. It is also a little heavy to lift in and out of your car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the vertically challenged!!!","review":"The first thing about this stroller is the weight....it is very heavy compared to other strollers.The second is the height of the handle.I'm 5'2 and the handle hits me right in the chest.It's hard to push a stroller with your arms up at chest level.The third is that it is misleading that you can use it with an infant seat because you can't!!!You have to recline the seat all the way back to fit the car seat on it then there is no room on the back for your toddler to sit or stand.The only good thing about it is the size of the storage basket.There has to be better products out there!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to maneuver","review":"We bought this for our three year old and newborn.

Maybe it might have worked once my son was able to sit up, but I didn't want to have to wait six months to use the stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"thought it would be better","review":"When I bought this stroller I was expecting good things. It looks nice and Fisher Price is usually a great name. (for toys, maybe not strollers)I was surprised at how many pieces there were and assembly was a bit time consuming. Once it was together it looked nice like in the store so we were excited again.However, after loading our little one's inside we found that steering was quite difficult. The stroller pushes nice when going straight, but steering is a different story.The handlebar sticks out far from the rest of the frame which makes it feel like it isn't so sturdy. There is a lot of \\"up and down play\\" in the handlebar and that concerns me.I think the weight is a bit much too. I expect a double stroller to be a little heavy, but my wife can barely get it in and out of the minivan which is not typical.Overall, I'd say it okay at best. Perhaps Fisher Price should stick to toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good...for about a month...","review":"We bought this stroller at Babies R Us over a year ago thinking it would be great for shopping at the mall with the extra large basket!! However; after about a month of use this stoller has been sitting unused in our garage because we can no longer collapse it to take it anywhere. We have tried over and over and have had many other people try, but the stroller is somehow \\"locked up\\" and will absolutely not close anymore. It is too big to put in our Yukon without being collapsed so we cannot take it anywhere to get it fixed nor can we return it to Babies R Us since we can't get it there!! When we were able to use it it was okay...a bit hard to manuever and the tray on the front does not stay closed (it is a split tray which meets in the middle so baby can push it outward) so it's a good thing there are straps to hold baby in or else he would fall flat on the floor. I would not recommend this stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"too complicated","review":"I was so excited when we first got this stroller. It is very easy to close, it rolls without any effort, and it turns without any problems. The problem is with the hood, It is flimsy and flops every which way. If you try to adjust it, it flops forward and covers the entire front. It will fall backwards to if all the snaps are not in place. When the snaps are in place though, it does not fully cover the child in the front. Also the tray opens in the middle and does not stay shut unless there is an infant seat attached to it. There are soooo many straps, snaps, and hooks, it is quite difficult to figure out. Also the front seat is adjusted with a dial and it does not stay up all the time. It will fall back when you least expect it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Double Stroller","review":"My husband and I LOVE this double stroller.

My kitty is probably about 20 to 23, not sure on her age, but she was having UTI all the time and I was taking her to the vet for anti-bio tics. Of course, he would want to examine her and it just got to be so awful to bring her in and put her through all that so one day I got on Amazon and started looking around. I decided to try this and it has been great. I gave her more at first like it says, but now I give her 2 doses every day. If she starts having an infection I give her more and it never gets very bad. I have really been happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent results","review":"This is an amazing product. My female 7 yr old pug has been having UTI problems for 6 months, she has been to the vet countless times and over perscribed antibiotics, which made her sicker!

I started her on uti free and within 1 week she stopped peeing all over the house, no more blood in her urine, and she voided a bladder stone. Clea is back to her old self!

My male cat gets recurrent urinary blockages and infections due to calcium oxalate crystals, racking up big vet bills. Did not resolve the problem immediately, but he seemed to have less pain and straining within the first week. Gradually able to void more normally, instead of tiny frequent amounts. Six weeks later he is peeing like a champ and seems to be feeling fine. I mix it in his food or in a little peanut butter, he eats it up with no problem. Only question I have is when to stop it. The product label says you can keep them on a daily maintenence dose. I'd be willing to give it him indefinately to prevent future problems. However, the product contains uva ursi and I noticed articles about herbal remedies on the web say that long-term use can lead to liver damage. The product is homeopathic, so the amount of uva ursi is presumably very small, so perhaps it can be safe for long term use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Recommend","review":"The positive reviews on Amazon and on this product's website did not reflect my experience.

I didn't want to put her through the stress of a veterinarian visit and antibiotics, so I researched online trying to find a homeopathic product that might help. I read great reviews about this PetAlive product so I purchased it. The product arrived quickly and I immediately started administering it to my cat.I very much like the idea of a homeopathic pet medicine, but more granules landed in her fur (and all around her!) than in her mouth. It's difficult to administer, even with a pet who doesn't fight you. So in that way, you end up wasting a lot of the product. As far as the effectiveness goes, at first it seemed like it helped.

The cat was practically climbing the walls and running from room to room, howling in pain. I couldn't catch him to give put it in his mouth because he was in such pain and was acting like he was afraid of me. I gave him these pills on some wet food every 30 minutes for a few hours and within no time he was lying on the bed peacefully.

Most musicians/songwriters don't make the cut (my favorites are Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, Lowell George and David Knopfler -- not quite so much older brother Mark, although I do agree he's quite good). My first listen to this album was enjoyable, my second was a smilefest. If you want to hear Fleetwood Mac, listen to Fleetwood Mac. Christine is still almost \\"Perfect\\" (her maiden name). Her voice is magic, the arrangements and production are first rate, and the songwriting is wonderful if not exactly legendary. Hard to expect much more. I rate this as a \\"must have\\" for any Christine fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the verge of wonderful","review":"I love Christine McVie's songwriting and her beautiful voice. Although I was quite disappointed that she had decided to leave the Mac, I respected her decision. She had put in her time.Twently years after her first solo album and I still love playing it. I think it's one of my favorites because it still has an FM flavor to it (not surprising due to the guest appearances).This release definitely echoes a new chapter in her life, post Fleetwood Mac. It's definitely a new sound without Buckingham producing her work.I would have loved to have heard some more of her piano work on the CD, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelic Voice and person","review":"Christine Mcvie is a pure example of class. It is shown through this album with her angelic voice. We all know how Christine was not involved with Fleetwood Mac's previous project 'Say you Will' she stated she was tired, and just wanted to relax at her home in England. Although, I was very dissapointed that Christine wasn't a part of 'Say you Willl' I'm very glad that she made this album, it was a very nice treat, seeing that it was released in the United States, on my birthday September 7th. This album is a joy and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, so it's not Fleetwood Mac, but...","review":"Okay, so this is a solo CD. Okay, so there are no members of Fleetwood Mac guesting here, as Ms. McVie has left the band and is living happily in the English countryside. Okay, so the songs can be somewhat redundant. If you tire of hearing the timbre of Ms. Nicks voice and want a mature, soulful voice, this is where you want to be. Christine's keyboard work is fine as ever and she lays down exquisite harmonies that would make Stevie Nicks green with envy. Sing on, Christine. We'll be listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING midstream adult contemporary","review":"Initially, I was afraid that Christine McVie would be sorely missed on Fleetwood Mac's Last effort, 2003's \\"Say You Will\\". After hearing this, I'm glad she wasn't involved in the Mac project at all. The voice is still there but unlike Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, the song writing has become sub-standard. The songs are pretty, but COMPLETELY forgettable. If you haven't already done so, I suggest purchasing the last fleetwood Mac disc or Stevie's SPECTACULAR 2001 effort \\"Trouble in Shangri-la\\"...now there's something to sink your teeth into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adios Perfection","review":"Starting back in the days of Chicken Shack, I always longed for more of Christine. Her first solo album was wonderful (please remaster than gem), the second divine--the tour she mounted to support that effort resulted in a night of bliss for this listener. I was so glad when Fleetwood Mac efforts with CMc made it to cd, so I could program the discs to just play her songs.And then there's this.What a disappointment. My guess is that there's a lot more to her not joining the reformed Mac. This is such a poor effort. The songs are commercial in a way that her fine tuned songs that reached artistic or commerical success never had to stoop. Christine, there was a period when we loved you. This cd was a tough break up for me, but it's just time to tell myself it's time to move on.

So, overall it does the job. It's a no-frill keyboard and the feel of the keys is ok, but not great. It was detected without issue by Windows and was easy to setup.

It is as if Kurosawa had recovered from a terrible head injury and began making films from his spleen. Flashy and uncompelling, Kitano's work is more sophisticated than Woo's, which should get him a lucrative Hollywood contract. What it gets me is a headache. To any of the people who praised this film to the skies, I ask \\"Are you acquainted with the name Ozu? Mizoguchi? Naruse? Teshigahara? Kobayashi, even?\\" If the answer is \\"yes,\\" then you cannot condone the continued irritation of someone like Kitano. And one more question, the one perennially asked of so-called modern art: can the term 'beauty' be redefined by its opposite?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is WAY TOO SLOW.","review":"I love stylized movies with stylized violence.

I guess the only reasons are to state what a great masterpiece not only of Kitano's work, but of cinema this movie is, and to state my disgust at the insulting DVD quality of this. Its not DVD quality, and it certainly does not live up to the beautiful 35mm picture. The cheap third rate transfer renders everyhting under-exposed, de-saturated and \\"viedeo-y\\". When the camer pans, for instance, it looks like you're watching a DV recording of Hana-bi on a tv set. you see the digital lines, for Christ sake! Sadly, the options are slim. One can get the VHS which is pan and scanned, or deal with this ONLY friggin' region 1 DVD. HIGHLY RECOMENDED FILM, however, beware of an aweful and unacceptable transfer. I lost much, if not all respect for New Yoker Films. its a mockery to all lovers of movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is a masterpiece, but avoid the DVD","review":"The movie is a masterpiece worth 5+ stars, one of Kitano's best works. But I was totally dissapointed when I so that the subtitles where burned over the film, as a movie lover I consider this outrageous, the film beautifull cinematography is totally ruined by them. The quality of the DVD is not up to the level of the movie. I can't belive that to this date there are companies creating dvds with subtitles burned over a movie. Please wait and see if Criterion Collection eventually releases \\"Hanna Bi\\", they do respect movie lovers.The artwork is lousy, I don't know why they changed Kitano's beautifull artwork which is the original to the japanese release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"I'm glad to see that this is film is available (and on DVD, too, best of all).

Then they say they will refund my postage if I remove this negative evaluation of their service."},{"rating":"1","title":"not WA like a lot of others","review":"Bought the 8 GB at 17th street - but they did not send the WA card.

Second, I'm a young guitarist in my twenties who plays in a 60's sounding garage rock band that's influenced by early Kinks, Sonics, Stones, and The Beach Boys music. Chuck Berry's music is an indispensable gateway to opening up the fret board and will really help you understand the dynamics of Rock & Roll music. There's songs in here that would greatly benefit a beginner, and songs that will either challenge or give satisfaction to more advanced guitarists. If given propper study you shouldn't have any problem playing the 12 bar blues structure, and hopefully figuring out your own soloing methods for rock and roll music. Buy this book, it's cheaper than guitar lessons and could help your playing move up to the next level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I bought a Nike Triax C5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago.

It says that it is \\"for pilots\\" but as someone with a bachelor's in aerospace engineering, this seems a bit more complex than just the basics. My class has several people in it who are not engineers and they are struggling a bit in the class. However, I will say that the book itself is very straight-forward and all the answers can be found if you do a little digging and reading between the lines. Another thing I like about this book is that all the answers to the chapter questions are in the back so you can double check your answers. That's nice when the problems start to get a bit more complicated. Overall, it's a good book for talking about the basics of flight theory and aerodynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative","review":"Burt is 6th grader waking up to his sexuality at the same time his older brother is dying from leukemia. His brother works for their attorney father by serving subpoenas on people. Burt sometimes accompanies him. Bob falls in love with Marion Hirsch a kind of free spirit who cannot return his love. The novel follows a year using the title of a book of poems Burt receives as its theme. Aunt Ida reads the poems to Burt eveery day. Slowly Burt begins to put the memories together. When he realizes his brother is dying, he tries to hold on to sensations, descriptions, feelings. The novel ends suddenly. It is almost as if someone did not include a few more pages. This suddenness leaves the reader with a sense of unfinished business. This contrasts with the careful way Bernard Cooper had been approaching this final scene. Yet the novel is full of memories of the people and friends Burt lives with and the seemingly mundane events of their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hole in the 8-BAll","review":"Normally, the purchased products from Amazon are the best not this time.

Most of the book is a dull recitation of facts about how some people in our parents' generation found meaning by becoming foster grandparents (holding dying babies mentoring pregnant teens, or working at the local McDonalds.)Sorry, but this is a depressing book that does not speak to me as a child-free adult who has spent her life working outside the home.

An old man has no friends other than his dead wife. On what he thinks is his last day on the planet, he mopes about, reminiscing. Even the injection of a troubled boy takes too long to have much effect on Mr. Morosity.I know the Greek history, and cinematography. The long takes are indeed interesting, and the only interesting thing about this movie other than Ganz's fine acting. The transfer, BTW, is execrable.The extra film of the academic explaining the symbolic and literary antecedents was amusing and annoying: the former for its silly professorialisms; the latter for forcing ill-fitting and ultimately unnecessary parallels with Homer's Odyssey on the story.One other element of merit, however: glimpses of the desperate refugee underclass and undercurrent of human trafficking.If you like slow, predictable downers and deserted, half-constructed buildings, this film is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unutulmaz","review":"bu film, izlemeye baladnz andan itibaren sizi saryor; müziiyle, görüntüleriyle, öyküsüyle, oyuncularyla...

The subtitles failed at the end. It didn't matter because I think the director had no idea how to end the film. It was a big muddle with lots of wonderful scenery. The pace was often excruciatingly slow with slow long pans to nothing special. It was kind of like film students made this film. The poet with the stovepipe hat who came back from Italy to fight the ottoman empire was too too boring. But Greece was just lovely. Is there really a fence around Albania?

This will put off most viewers conditioned by the fast cutting of popular Western cinema. Hey, I like a lot of popular Western cinema, and I like Angelopoulos, as well. A time and a place for everything. His weaving of the past and the present is a beautiful thing to behold if one is able to allow the time and space to let it work its way in.

Entire passages cut off mid-page, only to pick up several pages later when the author had already moved onto a different subject. In a longer title this wouldn't have been much of a problem, but with the short pieces I felt that I was missing the entire context of the essay. There were also several noticeable typos and grammatical errors.

Now all functions quite well. But be prepared to do this kind of diddling and don't expect the Disney Land house of the Future where device is self-aware, smart, and simple.

Price is good.Con's: No external surround sound.I expect a Home Theater In a Box (HTIB) to have surround available for more than just the internal functions like playing DVD's. Only Left/Right audio inputs are supplied via the Aux input for connection to a Satellite or Cable box. Digital Optical Audio is reserved for the PT1050, which costs $100 more.If you plan on using this system for TV viewing, save your money and buy something with better capabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome system","review":"This unit is very good for small living room but it's powerful enough for Home theater. All Black and very matching for black trimed plasma T.V.I purchased 50\\" panasonic TH-50PX75U Plasma T.V, it's looks complite with this Panasonic SC-PT950 home theater system.Weakness is hard to figure out how to increase rear speaker's volume.All others are perfect. 5DVD players are very good quality than any other DVD player. If you are not picky for stereo(like pick Bose or Karmen/H) then it is good system for Panasonic Big T.V. Rear speaker is handy and works good.

I stumbled onto \\"Bone\\" quite by accident, and was just blown away! Beautiful, evocative songs (\\"Fall in Love with Me\\" really is as good as everyone says, and is worth the price of the CD) are delivered in Booth's exceptional voice. If there's a better male pop singer out there, I haven't heard him. My one gripe is that a couple of the tracks are over-produced. It's a minor flaw, though. Needless to say, I have rescued my copy of \\"Laid\\" and I'm working on acquiring the rest of the James oeuvre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome surprise","review":"First, the answer to the obvious question...yes, James fans can buy with confidence. From the self-deprecating liner notes one would expect a hastily put together side project (Booth is working on acting & screenplays since James' breakup)-but this isn't the case at all. This is lyrically, vocally, and melodically a very solid & sustained effort-the right mix of harder & softer moments and a variety of tone & song structure that is much to rare nowadays.Hope this will help keep him in the game & on the map"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I've been a big James fan for a lot of years and liked Booth's Bad Angels collaberation. This CD however was a pretty big dissappointment. I threw it in the trash after a couple listens.

I like the lyrics, music, diversity and the sound of Tim Booth's voice.This album delivers. I think the music is not quite as good as with James. I think the lyrics are pretty good.

I really like the set and will use it even during the school year for reviewing grammar rules and conversations.All in all, worth even the full $79.95 despite one reviewer stating it's confusing, it is set up like a non-intensive 1 semester college elementary Mandarin class. Well organized and easy to follow and learn from. I'd suggest it as a supplement to your college class too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely helpful","review":"I bought this product a few months ago and started learning on my own. I wanted to up the amount I was learning, so I began taking weekly lessons with a Chinese instructor. She was amazed at how much I had learned in such a short time. It helped with the vocabulary and pronounciation. I now use both and have doubled my learning ability. I needed to do this, as I only have a short time to learn. For someone who is not in such a hurry, this product is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 X Better Than Last Version","review":"For students who tried the first version of LL Mandarin, this latest is far superior (both to the original LL and competitors).First, it now had grammar fully integrated into the course. So, as you proceed thru the course, you get a clear understanding of basic Chinese grammatical constructs.Second, it now has a separate set of CD's that are designed for book-free learning - i.e. listen while you drive. It would be helpful if the publisher included the text for this section, but it is fairly easy to follow without one.Worth the money - better than anything else I've seen on the market..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Language Usual","review":"This book is very typical for the Living Language series: a dialog, followed by pronunciation, grammar, and new vocabulary. It is a decent guide to learn from if you're not much focused on the Chinese characters - it only gives you about 60 of them. However, if you need some easy Chinese dialogs to listen to, by all means buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Chinese - Living Language","review":"Very well organized lessons. Clear notes. Vocabulary progression is practical and not too extensive for each lesson. The additional CDs that can be used without the text are very handy. This course the best of the three Mandarin courses I have. I would prefer the text printed on higher quality paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the beginner","review":"For me, this package isn't well constructed.Lets take lesson 1 for instance, the very first dialogue we are given is:Wang xiaojie, hao jiu bu jian! Ni hao!It then gives the whole conversation before giving the translation in English:Miss Wang, I haven't seen you in a long time. Hello!Ok, so how are we supposed to know what word means what when you consider that Mandarin word order is mostly not the same as English?It then gives 32 words showing how different tones have different meanings. In the first lesson!

You then have to buy separately one of two companion audio/cd programs, which the book references. Without audio of any kind, the book alone is useless unless you aren't a beginner. As long as you understand that, great. I mail ordered this sight unseen based on the Amazon reviews (but from a different vendor). When it came as a stand alone book I returned it because the cd version was cheaper than buying the book and the program counterpart separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This book is totally confusing and I hate it.

She often mixes up margaritas (and similar) so I thought this would be a nice produce for her parties. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It decent job of chopping and mixing, even ice, but it had significant problems elsewhere. The front drip tray was warped and would not stay in place. The motor had a strong ozone smell, like burning electrical wire. Even worse, one of my spouts leaked constantly, making a mess just sitting there. We returned this item as defective and didn't want a new one. Instead, we purchased a Margarator (which we love) and use it with our standard blender. Again, a great concept, but the product quality was not up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this product","review":"I bought the VillaWare Double Smoothee maker and it was a problem from the moment I pulled it out of the box. First, the silver lable was not glued on the product and wouldn't stick. Next when I made the product using THEIR receipe it wouldn't dispense from the spout and the spout connecting to the blender leaked. Tried calling the seller and emailing them about my problem and they wouldn't help. I called the manufacture and since I bought it HERE from a vendor they would help. So...now...its in the blender heaven of trash somewhere out there. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. THANK GOD FOR AMAZON'S ABC GUARANTEE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well, but...","review":"This thing does work pretty well. Blends fine and the dispenser works as advertised. But the description doesn't tell you the pitchers are made of PLASTIC. Well, that doesn't mean it's that bad, right?

Oh well, time to figure out how to return this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Love It","review":"I wanted to love this product but have had defective ones shipped to me.

The blender has two speeds which are great for blending just about anything you put in them.

Overall though, I highly suggest this blender to anyone who wants a good looking, double blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"back order","review":"I was not told the item was no back order until after the purchase.

It's not basic enough to be a good first book and it's not advanced enough to be an expert book. The book suffers from lack of diagrams and in depth descriptions of the subjects that the author glosses over. Although I will admit that he glosses over an awful lot of ground. If you're interested in finding out what you should learn about, this will give you a list. However, if you wanted to learn something about either archery or bowhunting, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"This is an excellent DVD. Both my girls have learned to sign using this product. We started our eldest daughter at 10 months and it took about 7-8 weeks before she could actually sign for us. We started with 4 signs (milk, eat, drink, dog) and were watching it 3-4 times a week. Our second daughter, we started at 15 months and she picked up her first sign after 2 weeks (we only watch it 2 times a week). Its important to start with 3-4 signs until they master those, and then move on to other signs. The DVD format allows you to select which signs you want them to learn first, which is helpful. Each of the signs runs for 1 - 1.5 minutes. The sign will feature objects of that sign and then both a child and an adult performing the sign. Its helpful to see the child perform the sign at a child's level, which isn't always exactly correct, but is ideal for communication learning. Excellent product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I have been teaching my daughter to sign and wanted to expand her vocabulary so I was excited to see that this DVD had words that we hadn't learned before (especially animals since she loves them so much)and was so highly rated. Wow, I was disappointed by this DVD. The words are only signed a few times and often the word is not said at the same time as it is signed. The baby in the DVD signs so badly that there is no way you could tell what word is being signed if you didn't already know. We have had great success with the Talking Hands DVD and would definitely recommend that over My Baby Can Talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Helpful","review":"This DVD was just ok. It could hold my 12 month olds attention just for a little while. The only useful signs that it taught were more, eat, and drink. The others were signs like cow. These were signs that didn't really matter in my opinion. If you are looking for a DVD to teach your child sign language so that you eliminate the frustration of knowing what he/she wants you might consider a different one."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I ordered","review":"My grandson had this when he was small but my daughter lost that copy. So I bought this for my new grand daughter. She is still a little young for it but it was just like I remembered. A great tool!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They like it","review":"My boys are premies and I am teaching them sign language to help with language delays. The boys (10 months adjusted age) love this video, but I think it is kind of obnoxious. But, it isn't for me.. it's for them. It teaches a lot of good signs and reinforces the signs that I am already teaching them. Plus, it shows an actual baby signing, which I think is useful for them. Overall, good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST THING I EVER BOUGHT FOR MY CHILD","review":"THE BEST THING I EVER BOUGHTI bought this DVD when my daughter was 9 months old. She loved it. Within 1 month she did her first sign and by the time she was 1 she did every sign on the video. People were amazed that she never cried. I simply said that is because she can tell me what she needs, or sees. I passed along this video to a friend and now I am going to bUy it again for our 4 month old son.I am so excited to see the second video in this series!!! I will buy the 3rd if one is made. Buy this before any other toys!!!! My daughter is now 2 1/2 and can speak like a 5 year old. BUY THIS VIDEO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My child learned so much!","review":"My son loves to watch the video over and over again. He's learned all of the signs and this video has also helped him to verbally identify objects as well. He does not have a hearing disability, but I wanted him to be able to communicate with me as early as possible. We started watching the videos when he was 10 months old and he learned quickly. Now, he asks to watch the videos! Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I read the glowing reviews and ordered this video for my 9-month-old baby. She has no interest in viewing it and neither do I. The choice of signs is a disappointment since twelve of the twenty signs are for animals. The only ones useful to my baby's daily life are milk, more and eat. I wanted a video that included mommy, daddy, up, down, hurt, change or diaper. Those who enjoy the Baby Einstein videos and want to talk to their babies about animals may not be as disappointed in this video as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Thoughts","review":"Very cuteClassical music was niceCould have said the words more, for hearing children.My child picked the signs up quickly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Video for Children ever!","review":"My 8 month old son LOVES the video. He has been watching it since he was 6 months old and has leaned to do the sign for dog and milk already. I am very proud of him. But of course what parent isn't proud of their child?They have done a wonderful job. They say children can't do this type of thing until they are about 10 months old. But if your child has learned the grasp or pincher motion, he/she can start to learn to sign.My son is a very curious and bright boy who barely sits still for 15 minutes at a time. This movie holds his interest so long that I can hit replay and he will sit in his swing and watch it twice through (and still laugh, babble, & \\"sing\\") through it the second time around!This video is a great tool to broaden children's horizons by allowing them to communicate before they can talk verbally. And we all know that any amount of communicaton eliminates much confusion and frustration between parents and children."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"From the pediatrician to the neighbors, everyone is astonished at an 18 month old communicating in a language above most adults! It's almost alien to see our little daughter so agile in her ability to communicate what she wants... I've become somewhat of a show off. It's irrestable. This DVD completely serves it's purpose by allowing the baby to let us know exactly what she needs, in turn ending all tantrums!!! My only regret is that I can't find the next stage or a sequel to this DVD. I don't know if other sign language DVD's would drive the lesson home as SOLID as this one did by not only representing what a paticular sign means with at least 6 or more examples, but the classical music is just the cherry on top! BRAVO! This should really be the standard not the rare ability of a LUCKY few."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 15 month old wants to watch it every day","review":"What seems to work for my baby: it's in short segments, nothing too far beyond what he can relate to, nothing upsetting, information presented by children as well as adults, different angles on the same idea, and each sign shown slowly and clearly and more than once. There are three of these videos, and we bought them all - so the review is really about the set. I think the 2nd one is even better, but there's no point in comparing them because he uses some of the signs from all 3 videos. If I had it to do over I would still get them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it","review":"I have three of those DVDs and I just bought one as a gift.

We ordered My Baby Can Talk First Signs and the follow-up video too when he was a year old, realizing he should be talking and wasn't. The signing videos have been awesome in helping with his language comprehension and we still get very excited about the new signs he learns every time we watch. We ordered other signing videos as well and my son definitely prefers My Baby Can Talk over the rest. As soon as he was able to focus enough to gesture, he started learning signs. It's the neatest thing in the world to see him signing \\"horses!horses!horses!\\" as Disney's Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron and his herd run across the TV screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a favorite DVD","review":"I purchased this DVD for my son when he was 9 months old and he is now two. While he didn't necessarily use or even learn all of the signs, he did learn the ones that were useful to him before he could talk, like \\"more\\" and \\"milk\\". More than anything, I think this DVD helped him to learn to identify different animals and learn to say different words. This was his favorite \\"show\\" to watch for a long time, and he still asks to watch it, long past the time that I thought it would continue to hold his attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT - NOW WE NEED MORE DVDs By YOU!","review":"EXCELLENT DVD!!! -- We began teaching our daughter sign when she was 7 months old. We tried several other DVDs before this one but she simply was not interested. Once we put in My Baby Can Talk this DVD immediately engaged her and, she started interacting with the program right away. Every time I put this DVD on she claps.

At age 17 months he is able to sign many of the words taught on the DVD, including his favorites; fish, shoes, bird, duck, eat & more. Ethan also uses the signs at the appropriate times in \\"conversation\\". The My Baby Can Talk video is brilliant!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Signing Video","review":"This is an excellant tool to have for your child.I showed this to my daugter at the age of 7 months and in two days she signed dog.Now at 14 months this is the only video she will sit thru.I would have to agree that some signs on the DVD are really not needed and wish they would have the sign for mom or dad etc.Overall I am very pleased with the signs my daughter has learned.Her grandparents have come to know what she is signing so it makes it fun for everyone in our family to be able to understand what she is signing.Very excited about the second DVD that will be released out this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies and young toddlers","review":"I highly recommend this video over Signing Time if your child is still a baby or younger toddler. We also have Signing Time videos and really like them, too, but I found \\"My Baby Can Talk\\" to be especially better for the younger ages. This is because the images are not as \\"busy\\" and fast moving. If you are one of those moms, as I am, who limits TV time and is concerned about how the graphics and fast moving images of TV affect brain development, this is a great video. I cannot wait until they come out with another video."},{"rating":"2","title":"nicely done, engaging, but poor choice of words","review":"I agree with the other reviewers about the limited selection of USEFUL words. The tutorial does advise you to pick only four signs and use them over and over again when the dvd is off. But it also says to play the dvd at least 4X a week. I just don't see how words like, \\"dinosaur\\" and \\"horse\\" would fit into everyday life, at least not in an urban area in the 21st century. \\"Eat,\\" \\"more\\" and \\"drink\\" are about the most useful signs in the dvd, with the runner-up being \\"book.\\" I was surprised \\"nap\\" and \\"potty\\" wasn't included - wouldn't it be a DREAM if your child can tell you when he/she needs a nap or go potty???"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best DVD for Babies","review":"I watched this tape with my daughter of 10 months only four times and she has already used the sign for milk.

She started watching at about 7 months, and by 11 months she began signing 'milk' and 'duck'. Now she knows a couple more, even 'fish' which I thought was too hard, she really does better when you focus on doing signs with her one at a time, to remember and learn. When she wants something and she opens and closes both of her fits, because she knows its communicating something to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this dvd","review":"She's now 12 months and she's been using watching this video since she was 10 months. It's the only video that she'll actually sit and watch the whole entire thing even after 30th time. The music is somewhat soothing so it's not that annoying for us. At 11 months she started signing \\"more\\". Then \\"eat\\". Then \\"book\\". She tries to do cow, dinosaur, cat, fish, most of the others. But they're somewhat difficult for a baby. But she's got the one's we'd like her to use downpat. I can't say enough good things about this video.

We started showing him the DVD when he was around 10 months old and he caught on right when he turned 1 year old. He loves the imagery and music and it holds his attention well. We're looking forward to the next volume coming out...hope it's soon.The only negative feedback I have is that the baby who deomonstrates the signs on the DVD doesn't always do them correctly, so it can be confusing to babies who are watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro to sign language for parents and baby","review":"Our 8 month old just started viewing the dvd. It focuses too much on \\"things\\" (ie: duck, bear, cat) rather than action words but it is simple and a good start to learning sign language. It also moves very slow which is good for parents concerned about fast moving images/TV/video games but our baby seems to get bored after the 4th word. Over time his attention span should increase. My only other complaint is that the baby in the video does not do MOST of the signs correctly. Otherwise our baby enjoys the DVD.... of course it's too early to say whether he is actually learning the signs. But my husband sure is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Baby Can Talk","review":"My 23 month old loves this video. He is doing great with it.

It does cover the basics, but the music, pacing and ways they introduce signs leave much to be desired. The baby in the video also can't make intelligible signs.I was trying to save money and not buy Signing Time, but after two weeks of this, I ordered Volume one of Signing Time and never looked back. My baby could have cared less about My Baby Can Talk, but responded to Signing Time instantly. He was making signs for eat, milk and more within a week.MUCH better options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"the overall transaction is ok despite a little confusion at the beginning","review":"The seller first sent me a wrong item.

The pockets aren't large enough for most shampoo/body wash bottles. The suction cups don't stay on well. The worst part is if you don't remember to hang dry it every night, the inside flap grows mold. It's machine washable, but so large that it's practically a full load by itself. I would not recommend this to anyone; just get a basic kneeler without the 'extras'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but unnecessary","review":"This was great when I first got it. But shortly after a few uses it got moldy and spotted. I've washed it in the machine several times with bleach and its still stained.

The pockets are fairly useless though, I rarely think to reach down for anything there (we stopped storing anything in the pockets) I wish I could give 4.5 stars since they should have just saved the material for the pockets and made a cushier product.But I'm all-around very happy with our kneeler and recommend it to anyone with hard flooring in their bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More sore knees!","review":"Loved this mat!

Not only is the advice weak (and vastly different from other excellent books on this topic), but it is entirely phrased from an evangelical Christian perspective. What our \\"Creator\\" wants us to do is repeated every couple of paragraphs. As you can imagine, our \\"Creator\\" pretty much wants us to forget the abuse ever happened, and joyfully commune with God's plan. I feel that I was misled in purchasing this book, because it is portrayed as another useful self-help book, and the underlying evangelical message is not mentioned in the reviews. Although you may like this book if you are a fundamentalist, unfortunately, from a psychological perspective, the advice is very very poor. If you are not a born again Christian who believes all we need to do is pray, you will not be helped at all by this book.

I was thoroughly disappointed. Effective historians have a natural ability to absorb volumes of information, select those facts and events which are important, and weave them into a coherent, interesting narrative. While Mr. Amato's 41 pages of supporting notes and 15 page bibliography suggest that comprehensive research was performed on the topic, no amount of references or notes can make up for his failure to focus on important aspects of \\"Dust's\\" history and inability to create from them an interesting story.

It's well balanced in use, and the handle is shaped so it allows hands of all sizes to use it with ease. I did find the nozzle rather unsatisfactory, as the shape doesn't lend itself to a water flow that facilitates the easy movement of water from the container out to the plants. To obtain a good flow of water, it's necessary to tilt the water can almost 90 degrees upright; not easy on arthritic hands. The adjustable nozzle and stem do help in storage, and to a degree, in adjusting directional control of water flow, but the pressure used to move them, again, is excessive for a person with arthritic hands, who will find doing so difficult and painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the drawing board...","review":"I usually adore Good Grips products, but this one fell way short of my expectations.

The cultural notes, however, were of even greater value: *when* to use phrases is integral to knowing *how*.My only two concerns, a half-star I withhold for each: the two-cassette method of delivery and a too-small glossary/ vocabulary/ dictionary. Pack a CD with the book and it's a five-star value; pack another forty pages of German-English word translations and it's official.However, if you're serious about German, get the FSI course; if you need a German-English dictionary, pick up a Collins Pocket Gem.

Unfortunately like so many movies today, this one has NO ENDING, NO CONCLUSION, NOTHING. While some story lines can support an ambiguous ending, this particular story cannot. In fact, there is not even any ambiguity; the authors don't bother to suggest what happens next. This means that watching all the gritty (and stressful) drama is completely pointless because the viewer never finds out what happens to the characters. Period. Given that the entire movie is about what will happen to the characters in the end, having no ending pretty much means that watching this movie is pointless.

There is no need to have gone through \\"Creating Motion Graphics\\" before using this book. At most,I'd recommend this book IMMEDIATELY after Chapter ONE of \\"Creating Motion Graphics\\" since this book is VERY step-by-step, and when one is just starting out, it is MUCH more helpful to go through several complete and broad projects to get ones feet wet(such as this book) than learning, in depth, a few concepts at a time, which is what you get in the first book if you go through chapters 2 and further. (You might be able to skip the first book altogether if you're already familiar with the adobe interface -- which I was NOT).

The book is pitched well for the undergraduate student. One thing that attracted me was the attention Kozloff pays to the smaller phyla, groups that are often given little time and space or are even left out completely in other texts developed for the undergraduate crowd. The line drawings and figures are good. If you are looking for a book to support an ecological/natural history flavor, then check out this book. If you want more emphasis on taxonomy try Rupert and Barnes. If you want an evolutionary approach, try Brusca and Brusca.

This and the 3rd installment went straight to video so they knew the sequels were not up to par with the original. FDTD 2 is very predictable so there are no surprises, not even the gory vampire killings.

Firstly, sequels to movies like \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" shouldn't be done, everybody knows they will never be as good as first ones, and FDTD 1 didn't allow a sequel with the same characters so you previously know this sequel has nothing to do with with the first one. Secondly, the Tarantino factor. Quent Tarantino had nothing to do with this movie (he didn't write, nor directed it, he didn't even make one of his classic \\"little appearences\\"), so don't expect his wicked twists, dark screenplays, ironic situations and the Kubrickian effects..., although it seems Rodriguez has learnt something of him trough this years and for little moments he hits the spot, that's the reason why I'm giving 2 stars to this sequel (1,5 would be more apropiate).

This film focuses on a group of bank robbers who decide to knock off a score one night. But things go wrong when one is bitten by a vampire and soon the body count rises. Robert Patrick is so-so as our hero, who suspects something's wrong immediately. Some neat camera tricks and plenty of violence abound, but this is mostly a flat delivery and a cheap imitation to the first one.

You can really tell the difference between the two authors. Hooper's chapters contain Americanisms, theological statements opposite to that of the beliefs of Lewis, and a writing style emphasizing physical actions and not thought processes.The dead giveaway is that 20% of the novel contains detailed descriptions of apparatus and their use. Lewis hated with a purple peeve such items in literature.Hooper has also rewritten much of the poetry of Lewis to exclude the allusions to classical Greek and Roman literature.For more information read \\"Light in the Shadowlands\\" and \\"The C.

Not to mention that anyone who has read Lewis can easily come to the obvious conclusion that the above \\"Lewis\\" collection is some sort of spin-off of the real Lewis.

It is obvious that this is not C.S. Lewis. Everyone knows that like a robot, C.S. Lewis never changed his writing style. True, supposedly this change can be explained by the fact that he didn't finish this story, but come on people, everyone knows that with C.S. Lewis, his early drafts were ALWAYS just as polished as his complete book. Anyone who would even foster the idea that C.S. Lewis wasn't a perfect writer, is insane.

While clearing out Lewis's study, a friend stumbled upon an unfinished short that later became, 'The Dark Tower.' The untenable rumors surrounding this story (as well as several other shorts contained in the compalation), are completly ludicrous! This book contains some of the most vivid imagery ever produced by Lewis and is a frightening (though thouroghly entertaining) journey into the mind of C.S. Lewis himself. Although it is sadly incomplete, it gives the reader a satisfying taste of science-fiction that only Lewis could give and is filled with delightful bits of true Lewis literature. If you are familiar with Lewis's famed Space Trilogy, or if you are just searching for a merely satisfying read, then you must pick the amasing book, 'The Dark Tower.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Towering Darkness","review":"It's easy to see why these stories were not published; they weren't finished. Putting aside the question of Walter Hooper's role (or non-role) in the present presentation of these stories, they lack the polish--even more the point of so much of Lewis's writing.On the other hand, there is a certain fascinating quality about a first draft which will recommend \\"The Dark Tower\\" to fans of writing as well as loyal followers for Professor Lewis. Their notably unfinished condition excites wonder as well as speculation about how the master might have finished them. That he didn't tells us as much as we need to know about the literary quality or place in the Lewis catalog of works.Only for the hard core Lewis or writing student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you're not a Lewis enthusiast","review":"I was pretty dissapointed by this book. It is not the \\"normal\\" C.S. Lewis. I was actually relieved to find out that this work is suspected to be forged by Walter Hooper, because I was appaled that C.S. Lewis would turn out a work of this poor quality. It isn't even half as good as the rest of the space trilogy, and the plot is kind of stupid. I have a hard time believing that C.S. Lewis wrote this. I have heard that C.S. Lewis hated mathmatics, and I highly doubt that he would give that subject such a large role and discussion if he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What appears to be a not very clever forgery. . .","review":"Serious Lewis scholars have known for years that much controversy has surrounded the appearance of these \\"unfinished stories\\" with regard to their authenticity. Walter Hooper, Lewis's \\"alleged\\" secretary, who unfortunately still maintains the rights to Lewis's literary estate, has proven himself to be an unreliable source, at best. Kathryn Lindskoog, among others, has cast serious doubts on whether anything Hooper says or publishes about Lewis can be considered accurate.Chalk this one up as \\"deutero-Lewis\\" (and badly written at that), and forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT PURCHASE!!!","review":"superb!!!i have all three seasons now and watch them over and over,a must for anyone interested in the world outside our own!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"History channel presents: running out of ideas","review":"I love this series, I really do, season 1 of the Universe is probably the most interesting thing I've seen on TV.

Just make sure you aim straight for the eye so that the suction surface is approaching parallel to the lens surface. If you aim at an angle, it won't stick, and you'd keep repeating yourself and wondering if it even works.

Some of the photos I even enlarged to 14x11\\" and still looked sharp.However, this Minolta Sightseer I bought (from Wal-Mart though) disappointed me in the following ways:1. Rough resolutions, - it is the worst I've experinced after using many other point-shoot cameras. The lighting conditions have to be perfect to get decent resolutions. Use of slower speed films did not help either.2. Slow recharge time, - when you shoot in dark conditions that require flash, the waiting is too long between shuts.

It isn't of course one of the sofisticated and expensive Minoltas, but for my amateur purposes, it seemed pretty decent at first sight. It proved to be a disapointment: the pictures are not very clear, especially the portrait type ones, though I was careful not to shoot them from too short a distance, the flesh is too slow. But the surprise was when, after only 27 days of using it,my camera's computer system stopped functioning, without having previousely been subject to any shock.

Gibbs devotes an entire chapter to vi and another entire chapter on basic command syntax- both are not on the exam. Gibbs also includes sections on Admintool and Adminsuite when both products have been discontinued in Solaris 9. Gibbs still refers to SVM as DiskSuite and the book contains numerous typos (ie. syslogc). Gibbs tells the reader to use rlogin, rcp, rsh and does not even speak of the secure shell.

However, upon reading the first few chapeters my heart sunk. The book was written a long time ago, and attitudes have moved on. The psychology of child rearing has also. My two biggest gripes with this book were:1. Its overly religious tone, using excerpts from the bible for example, which is used almost on every page, and distracts rather than reinforces, especially for those of us who are not christian believers.2. Rather than equipping the parent with an array of tools to help discipline your strong willed child, the author recommends corporal punishment as the main tool of choice, and goes about defending his rationale at length.

While I agree that parents can be more successful if they are consistent with discipline - but I cannot understand how anyone could urge desperate parents to beat their children with belts, sticks or pinch them on the back of the neck - and then quote bible scriptures as justification.

Further, other techniques are more consistently effective than spanking, and are not potentially harmful.There are large bodies of research pointing to the harmful effects of spanking which include increasing your child's level of misbehavior.I have found that while there are some parents who believe very strongly in spanking, most parents wish they could avoid doing it and have conflicted feelings about it.

Dobson's book is just one more piece of trash to be thrown away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This person is obviously no Christian","review":"It amazes me that anybody in this day and age would follow such dangerous advice. It is well known that abuse leads to aggression in children. What Dobson teaches is abuse. He shows a complete lack of understanding of child developement. He shows no care or concern for the welfare of children. His only interest seems to be in reinforcing those parents who wish to have an advocate for abuse.This man is not a Christian. His teaching is in direct opposition to the teachings of Jesus. He does not show even a small amount of the compassion, kindness, or wisdom of the Savior. He is telling parents to turn from the teachings of Jesus, and give into the evil of violence.If you are a true Christian and you want to read a parenting book written by a Christian that teaches Christian values, I would recommend any of William and Martha Sears books.May the love and peace of Jesus live in your hearts.

This book is exactly what Iexpected, a joke, albeit a sick one. Dobson is no more than ataskmaster with little to no respect for children except as chattel to be passed off by right-wing families. I plan on raising my kid the exact opposite way -- encouraging them to be independent, strong and respectful of others. [He] seems to think wailing on kids is the best way to raise them. Shame on Dobson (I refuse to call him doctor because he doesn't deserve it) for writing such trash, and even more shame on families who would institute such barbarism on their own kids. Dobson is certainly one scary figure. Please, families, look elsewhere for some reason and sanity. This book should be destined for the trash heap but, unfortunately, will probably be viewed as Gospel by some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous","review":"\\"Spare the rod, spoil the child\\" does NOT refer to a switch with which to hit your children, rather it refers to a shepherd's crook which one should use to gently guide their children, as a shepherd does his flock.

Asinine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Dobson calls parents to Common Sense and Courage","review":"Boy, there are a lot of parents out there who are afraid to be the bad guys. That's too bad because either you show your child the consequences of bad behaviour or they will learn the much harder way -- bad grades, lack of self-discipline, disrespect for authority, the list is endless.Besides, once your child even THINKS you might follow through with a dreaded punishment, you'll be surprised at how peaceful your home becomes. The yelling and the empty threats can go away, and actual communication and relationship-building can begin to take its place.If my children stay away from drugs and avoid other bad decisions because they are afraid of their parents \\"finding out\\", that's ok with me. That's the job I signed up for when I decided to get pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dobson is an AMERICAN TALIBAN","review":"I read large chunks of this book before I knew Dobson headed the extreme right-wing Focus on the Family. As a sociologist, I thought it was some of the worst child rearing advice ever. Now that I know the truth about Dobson and his extremist agenda, it all makes sense. He just wants parents to raise mindless proles who will do what the talking heads on Fox News tell them. He is dangerous in that his advice will stunt children's intellectual development. As a PhD, I would warn parents to stay away from this book if they want to raise something besides dittoheads."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wooden spoon?","review":"I bought this book in the hopes of trying to control my very strong-willed two year old. I loved this book until I got to the point where Dr. Dobson in all his glory told me not to spank my child with my hand, but instead use a wooden spoon or something of the sort. I truly believe that a hand should be for love but what are you going to do at your friends house? Ask for a wooden spoon and then proceed to spank your child. No thank you. It's illegal to do that and I for one am not going to jail for spanking my child with anything other than my hand. Read the law then compare it to this book! Something is not right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Child abuse manual","review":"If your goal is to beat a child into submission, to break them and make them hate you this is the book for you. It is a manual on how to abuse a child from a vocal proponent of torturing children."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor advice","review":"Having a spirited child, I was looking for some sound techniques for use in dealing with him. I did not find it here. Dobson compares a \\"strong-willed\\" child to a malfunctioning shopping cart and a dog; states one can start spanking with a switch or plastic object at 15 months; accuses advocates of non-violent parenting of being responsible for child abuse; says that after a punishment, the child should be encouraged to pray so he can realize he is a sinner; the list of ludicrous advice goes on. I had heard positive things about Dr. Dobson and was shocked to read the comparisons and advice in this book. Quite frankly, it frightens me that this book is still in print.Not a good option for parents opposed to hitting/spanking."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes!!","review":"as a Christian mom, i have heard alot about dr. dobson, and know that he is well respected in the Christian community as an expert on family issues. i thought his book would be an excellent resource on raising children in a Godly way. however, i felt this book had WAY too much emphasis on corporal punishment. it seemed to be the author's first suggestion rather than a last resort. i know there are differing views on corporal punishment within the Christian community and in society at large, but this book advocates it too strongly. it is hard to enforce a \\"no hitting\\" rule with your child when your first reaction to his misbehavior is to hit him yourself. it is a mixed signal that is very confusing to a small child. i know alot of people believe strongly in this book as a \\"biblical\\" approach to child rearing, but i truly hated this book and would not recommend it to anyone. if you want a Biblical resource for child rearing, read the Bible, and seek out other resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Sears book is *much* more helpful for Christian parents","review":"I am not impressed with this book. It is my opinion that Dr. Sears' book on the fussy baby is much more helpful and practical for Christian parents. The proof is in the pudding... Dr. Sears had eight children... three of those children became pediatricians.Sorry, but this book was a big disappointment for Focus on the Family fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great advice, IF","review":"This is a great book, IF: you want your children to grow up to hate you.Most \\"strong-willed\\" children are probably smarter than you are. Part of that strong will is that they can already think for themselves. They will remember most or all of their childhood (happening NOW) -- and they will damn sure remember whether or not you rely on your physical dominance over them.Kids need love, unconditional love. If you just want them to obey you, this book will help... but it comes at a great cost.Consider the following, fromMan for Himself. This is Erich Fromm, NOT Dobson:\\"The 'good' child may be frightened, and insecure, wanting only to please his parents by submitting to their will, while the 'bad' child may have a will of his own and genuine interests but ones which do not please the parents.\\"As a loving parent, you can do better than James Dobson. There are plenty of parenting books out there, pick almost any one over this one - and remember, you're going to be Mom or Dad for LIFE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does this man dislike children so much?","review":"I think James Dobson would do better spending time dealing with his dislike of children then writing this kind of non-sense.

I would not recommend this book to parents and would actually caution anyone reading this against following much of the advice given. While some of his points are sound, I am afraid I have to worry when a professional quotes the Bible rather than research to support his points. Not knocking the Bible, mind you, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone hoping to gain helpful parenting tips.In my defense, I am not a therapist or a parent who is totally against physical discipline. But this author seems to ignore the negatives associated with it which are well documented. There are better books out there for parents looking for help with their 'strong-willed child'."},{"rating":"2","title":"15-Jan-12","review":"Posted a review but forgot to star and date it.

Horrible. I have a strong willed child whom I've never hit and we are working through it with no problems at all. I would NOT recommend this book and have thrown mine away - wanted to burn it - wouldn't even put it in a garage sale or goodwill for fear someone would actually follow his advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, Millions of People Can be Wrong.","review":"I hate, hate, hate this book. Anyone who would hit their dog because she wanted to sleep in a spot James Dobson hasn't designated for her is a bully and should not be writing books on how to raise children. If you want to bully your children and make them think you are a tyrant, this is the book for you. If you want your children to learn to make good decisions for themselves without resorting to hitting them with objects like switches and belts, look somewhere else. Basically his advice boils down to beating the crap out of your kids when they don't do what you want. Apparently, he feels the same thing about animals. He even compares the two when he is relating the story about his dauchshund to how kids should be raised. Yes, you too can treat your children no better than an animal and sell a zillion books. If you want to learn how to really be a parent, this is not the book for you. Can you tell I hate this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG AWESOME","review":"I cant put this game down.

I enjoyed that I was not as ridiculously wild as NBA JAM, which had crazy dunks and silly moves. NBA street has some great moves, lots of options and plenty of your favorite players. I wish the AI was a bit stronger, as I found I could roll through most anyone with the right team, but all the stat keeping was worth the trip.

Obviously EA Sports Big did. This game is a good rental, tops. Buying it is suicide, because I beat it in two days and unlocked all the characters (including the gigantic Chinese guy) and all the courts.What makes this game so lackluster is no four player support, which is a must for any sports game, downright awful play-by-play announcing, and repetitive gameplay.

NBA Jam is still the best hoops game off all time, while NBA Street is only a memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun.","review":"This game is fun. It is real easy to learn, I got it yesterday.

Its got flare and style straight from the street! Ever see the And1 mixed tape videos? Well this game captures the flashy crossovers the insane dunks in an NBA JAM type format but better! Gameplay is easy enough to grasp as anyone can pick up the control and start playing. You pick your main team and travel to courts throughout the world challenging other NBA and Street Legends. Once you beat a team you can add some of there players to your team building your own dreamteam. Though it may seem like a run and gun type game you will have to play D if you want to get far. The gamebreaker shot is a nice addition to the game as this shot keeps you in the game or breaks it wide open, it's all about timing. Only complaint is it is not multi-player, other than that it is the best B-Ball game on PS2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Just picked up a copy today and played it for the first time.

I couldn't determine if the author himself felt this way, or was trying for balance. Tull is known for his seed-drill and horse-hoe, which are forerunners of today's havesters, plows, and other farming machinery. This book gives a strange biography, descriptions of seed drills and other implements prior to Tull's work, a brief account of Tull's book and its immediate results, and finally a description of some modern farming equipment. The whole is written in a verbose apologetic manner, as if the author is fearful that either the pro-Tull or anti-Tull contingent will attack him if he says something too plainly or too boldly.There is useful information here, but it was a chore to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New formula smells terrible!","review":"I've used this product for years and really liked it.

The paper is too thin, the print so very small and close together that it really hurts the eyes. Misprints are common. The annotation provided is wildly inconsistent; some items have many useful (if nearly illegible) footnotes, others none at all.

I do not know if there are any alternatives to nitrites, but I will research to find out.

I guess it's a good read for those who want an extensive knowledge on the subject, but for an amateur, it's not much help. As for the design section, it leaves a lot to be desired.

All of the weight is in the stainless steel / polymer sandwich handle (to stick the stamped blade into). Weight is a major factor when buying a knife. A forged knife will offer better overall balance / control than a stamped knife. These just feel cheap.They do look ok from a distance - but your are better off to get one good forged knife then a whole set of these cheap stamped knives.Regards"},{"rating":"1","title":"What I paid for...","review":"I was initially very excited at the prospect of getting such a classy looking set of knives for so little. Then, they arrived in my mailbox.Seeing them myself, I found them to look cheap. the blades weren't alligned properly, the handles felt awkward and hollow, and furthermore, I couldn't get them sharpened. I even got a different sharpening stone than what was included with the set and gave that a try. no luck. the entire piece felt loosely contructed, as though it would fall apart if I wasn't careful.I did, however, get a couple of knives for Christmas. I got an OXO good grips chef's knife and two wusthoffs. I found these knives to be far superior and although I know that they are expensive, but they are exceptional.

Also, Walmart carries this same set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin blades, heavy handles","review":"The knives look good, and are very sharp. After nearly slicing off the end of my finger (first slip in 30 years), I have decided that the poorly balanced knives are dangerous. The stamped blades are extremely light, thin, and flexible. The handles are thick and heavy, so all the weight is in the handle. When the thin blade meets something tough to cut, it flexes and the result can be loss of control of the knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek expensive looking set for cheap!","review":"It's a very nice looking set, looks like its worth a hundred or so and for only $15 (the price I paid when it was on sale) it's a definite good buy. However, the quality itself isn't that great, yes the blades are stainless steel and they cut very well but the handle is made out of plastic and I wonder when they will break or chip and become discolored therefore rendering the rest of the set useless.

It is still a very listenable compilation because there are no bad songs and none are done badly. I just say that there are better compilations out there which include the REAL greatest hits that are on this package and some OTHER actual greatest hits based on career length sales.

Thankfully Amazon returns was wonderful about refunding the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to look at; but, not comfortable to wear","review":"These shoes are quite stylish for an everday office shoe. The overall look is sleek and kind of dresses up your basic business casual type shoe. Unfortunately, for me, the front rise of the shoe comes up way too high on the foot, causing it to rub uncomfortably against the top of the foot. Shoe has a pretty good slope forward and so feels like foot is being pushed toward toe and that increases the discomfort with the upper. The size was accurate and the shoe quality was good and really wanted them to work out, but after trying them on several times with different trouser socks, nylons and walking around in them for a bit in the house, realized there was just no way they were going to work out for me. Obviously, this could be an issue specific to my particular foot size/shape and preference. They don't work for me, but would be a nice shoe if it works for you.Franco Sarto Women's Bocca Loafer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too narrow!","review":"While these shoes may look nice, they are way too narrow.

The shoe is great for travel, as it's a good walking shoe, but can also be dressed up. It can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants. The wider toe box means my toes aren't crunched. The leather stretches, so if you have a wider foot, the shoe will adjust.

When I put these shoes on, I almost wept for joy because they were so comfortable. The footbed molded perfectly to my foot, and there was ample room in the toe box. Unfortunately, as soon as I walked in them the shoe slipped off my heel with every step. I tried heavier socks, but that didn't help. I think the problem is that the back of the shoe goes straight up instead of curving slightly. Sadly there is no such thing as a size 12 and a half, so I will have to return rather than exchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women's Loafer","review":"I was very pleased with these shoes.

I walk long distances to work, and they are very comfortable and stylish (compared to walking downtown in gym shoes!).Over the years I noticed the leather getting a bit lower in quality. This particular recent Franco Sarto shoe purchase is rather poor. The leather nearly looks like pvc, the inside is now all fake leather, it smells bad, makes your feel smell and slip & slide. The bottom insole is very cheap, glued in poorly. The material is \\"pleather\\", smells bad, makes your feet sweat and smell bad, in addition to a slip & slide type of feel. The heel is seems to be painted a slightly different black compared to the leather.Overall, Franco Sarto's cost cutting is very noticeable. As much as I love this shoe, this will be my last pair.

Now they have cut the price in half, and only the outside looks the same. The inside felt terrible, there are seams where there were none before, did not fit well at all.

But it has flaws that just detracts from the game so much. A serious lack in the ease of finding the plot. After a while it can be tricky to have any idea what the character is meant to be doing. Alot of rpg's spoon feed the plot. This ones becomes so hidden that you are left wondering what is the point. The graphics are ok, but the repetative use of graphics makes the game not only harder to navigate but also visually dull. It just lacks deapth and interest. Interesting characters like rummy just are not in it enough. There are better rpg's out there and there will be better ones for the PS2 coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please heed the warnings","review":"... this game is horrible. Please, do not be caught up as I was with the promise of a PS2 RPG. This game is difficult to play, boring and many times brings on the \\"smack my head with a controller\\" syndrome. If you got this game for free, give it five minutes of your time. But never drop a dollar for this, or it will be a dollar wasted... this game is bad. Very bad. And I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"... WASTED!!!","review":"When i bought this game i thought it would have decent sound the reapetive \\"Music\\" really gave me a headace in the first 5 minutes I've played it!!! If you want this game keep in mind you'll be wasting your money!!! If you want real rpg games buy Final Fantasy games!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?!","review":"This game has some very inovative concepts but they are not developed very well, for example, there is a mini-game where one has to hit certain buttons at certain times so that the character will play the right notes. When you hit a note perfectly the word great is displayed on the screen, but it is diplayed right over the notes that you have to play next. It is very irritating. Also, the story can become boring, the same five days just keep repeating and you have to solve it. The only problem is that every time the days start over, you lose all of your built up items and your money. Again this is very annoying. I say that if you really need an RPG right now, then this is pretty much your only choice but if you can wait a little longer I would go with Final Fantasy X."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy...","review":"OK. People, you should seriously save your money and not buy this game--if you want to rent it go ahead, I'm glad I did, because if I had bought it I would have made a BIG mistake. Ugh...to start, the controls are REALLY hard to use, and once you get used to them (if you ever) they make your hand start to hurt. And when you go out of town, every 10 seconds stupid and annoying monsters show up that you can kill in a snap. And the graphics are HORRIBLE!! Waaaaah, the graphics of PS1 are just as good, if not better...and the storyline is rather unorigial...the minigames don't even make sense, there's never anything to do, you always get lost and it takes forever to get around, and...must I go on? So basically, don't buy this game. It's a waste of you money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Oh Why did KCEJ port this horrid title?","review":"I thought the same thing as most gamers would when I laid my eyes upon this new addition to the video game store's shelves; \\"Cool, an actual RPG for the PS2\\". I luckily made the ever so wise decision of renting this game before buying it, because I nearly became ill once the game began. The cut scenes are badly done, with all of the character's having no voice acting & the messages scrolling by in realtime, nearly too fast for you to complete reading what they've just said. The graphics are far below par on all counts, the game looks like it could have run on the PSOne, let alone a next gen system like the PS2. The story is slow & boring & the constant load times are sure to drive you crazy. The camera angles leave more than something to be desired. About the only joy you will gain from this game is during the battle sequences, if you last that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU DON'T LIKE HEART ATTACKS AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE...","review":"THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. You (mouse) is stuck in a constant time loop. Most of the game is running around though the town. Almost 0 progress is made after the beginning. Everytime I try to play this is feel my blood pressure going up because THERE IS NOTHING TO DO! Think a huge castle might be fun to explore? wrong! there are annoying monsters readly to ambush about every 15 seconds. That's another thing. This game relies on time. The graphics are horrible. I think my gameboy had better graphics.. seriously. The one major plus of this game is the music. It has one of the best scores i've ever heard on a game. Up there with the final fantasys'. Rent this before you buy it if you have any intrest at all.

This book address these questions. Reading this book, one can see how we create our realities as societies, cultures, countries, etc. We can gain additional, if not totally new, insight on this matter. What you will find out may surprise you, it may even make you angry or just make you not believe what the book says. To gain further insight, read The Personal Nature of Reality also which will show you how we create our own immediate reality. To me it was difficult to read but others that I know had no problem. Possibly it was hard to read was because it was packed full of information? I give it 4 stars because the way it was written.

Its for Creating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Channel Material","review":"I've read most of Jane Roberts Seth Material books. In my opinion Seth Is telling it like it is. More and more now a days the cutting edge theoretical physicists are agreeing that reality is very similar to what Seth has been describing since the \\"seventies\\". This puts a Quantum Physics spin on the reality that Seth has been telling us about for decades. If you're interested in knowing what reality is really like, the Seth Books can enlighten you. I've enjoyed all the ones I've read. This one, The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events, included. However. if you want to know my favorite of all, it would have to be The Nature Of Personal Reality, written in '74. Followed closely by Seth Speaks. Written in '72.

Her father engages an actor to play the final appearance of the phantom. Arriving at the same time are a young man in love with Silvie, as well as a burgler. All three agree to play the phantom for their own reasons.You can imagine the opportunities for confusion. (Don't forget the real phantom is running around this wonderful castle, too.)

Basic specifications are well organized (tabulated) and the wiring diagrams are pretty good. Basic techniques are covered however the manual would be better if alternative techniques are discussed. That is advanced stuff and would confuse people who are not as mechanically inclined.If you know your stuff, this is a basic reference guide for specs and diagrams but that's about all. If you are unfamiliar with Mercruiser drives and engines, the book is fairly informative regarding disassembly, inspection, and repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Michel Legrande...","review":"This is a delightful musical with a very young Catherine Deneuve and her gorgeous sister, Francoise Dorleac who was tragically killed shortly after the movie came out. Danielle Darrieux is the beautiful mother who has left her lover because his name, Monsieur Dame, is too silly. She is left with two beautiful twin daughters, Deneuve and her sister, and a nine year old boy, Booboo. The story is pretty much fluff as a group comes to town for the weekend for a fair. Everyone is in close proximity as coincidence keeps the various lovers from discovering their mates before the end of the film. Gene Kelly is a bit old at 55 but everybody has a good time and the music is terrific. Highly recommended for the music and the girls. It's not a bad way to work on your French, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, this masterpiece gets the DVD treatment","review":"Regarding the VHS release of this film, I had written:\\"Jacques Demy's salute to the Hollywood musical is an absolute triumph (I think Leonard Maltin might like it better were he to watch it again today), but the gorgeous cinematography and delightful choreography will be completely lost to anyone watching a non-letterbox version of this film on video.\\"Wait until Miramax releases a DVD or letterboxed VHS before watching this exquisite movie on the small screen.\\"That time has finally come. And while Miramax is chintzy on the extras (as is often the case-I give the movie five stars, but strike one for the lack of even the re-release trailer or Agnes Varda's documentary \\"The Young Girls at 25\\"), the movie looks and sounds amazing. If you don't have the chance to experience LES DEMOISELLES on a big screen, this DVD is the next best thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comme Ci Comme Ca","review":"Although I loved the colours and the clothes, and few of the tunes were catchy, overall I felt the film was rather bizarre. Catherine Denevue and her sis would have been better served with flattering wigs. Catherine was also very graceless in her moves, dancing and other. A strange flick, no doubts."},{"rating":"1","title":"In between","review":"It's too, well, French, to be a traditional musical (a lot more overt sexuality than what you'd expect from a film with Gene Kelly), but it's too much of a wanna-be American musical (that misses the mark) to stand as a good French film. The romantic pairings are laughable as are the supposed talents of the characters. Gene Kelly looks incredibly out of place and awkward. Yes, it has some lovely music, bright colors, and a few charming characters, but overall is very disappointing. The best part of the film is the smooth and understated opening credit sequence highlighting the ferry ride across the river. It's downhill from there. If you like Jacques Demy stick to Lola and the Umbrellas of Charbourg. If you like Gene Kelly stick to An American in Paris and Singin' in the Rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird French Pop Film","review":"I don't doubt that the other reviewers are sincere in liking this film, but the prospective purchaser should be warned that this is a really weird, hokey, pop movie that is hard not to laugh at. The best thing about it is the discovery that the French could have made something so utterly artificial and commercial. OK the dancing and visuals are pretty, but you have to watch the whole thing with a sense of irony."},{"rating":"1","title":"french cheese- the stinky kind","review":"What can I say except that I was pleased that Gene Kelly only had to spend 10 minutes in this unfortunate film. As always, I can't really say anything against Gene Kelly but as for the rest of the film? Well, it is a feeble attempt at creating a french version of the Hollywood musical. They really missed the mark but I guess it would of helped if ANY of the stars could sing. If you can imagine, they dubbed Gene Kelly's singing voice.....mon Dieu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who was Mick Ronson","review":"After reading this poorly written tome I am still no closer to knowing anything about who the real Mick Ronson was.While the Authors seem to have a good knowledge of Mick and his life I was always left feeling that they where not going to give us anything other than an outline. Apart from a brief interview with Dale Buffin ( drummer in Mott the Hoople) where we see an inkling of Ronson's personality this book really lacks any bite,it is all just too polite and as I said poorly written. We get no sense of anticipation about what is going to happen next and no sense of what I call the need to read.Mick Ronson deserves a better book than this.All in all this is yet another rock book which fails to Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"blade not sharp - pulling hair","review":"I usually like Remington products but this hair clipper is horrible.

If the plastic guards were any cheaper and flimsy, they would break. As far as the clippers themselves, they work fine, but I use a guard when I cut my hair. If the guard does not work well, then it really does not matter how the clippers cut. I think I will continue using my 5 year old Wahl clippers that I paid less that $20.00 for until I can get another set like them.

On one side of the plastic comb guide there is a ridge to hold the comb guide in place on the shaver, and on the other side over half of the plastic ridge has been cut away so that there is just a small sliver of plastic to hold the comb guide in place. Once that piece breaks off - and it will - the comb will not stay on the shaver, and therefor, the shaver is useless for cutting that hair length. All of the guides are designed this way - to break. Notice the other reviews of folks looking to replace their broken comb guides. Shameless, that a company would do this. Stay away from this product.The only reason you could possibly want this is if you only used the shaver without the guides.

Today, a bust stands in Westminster Abbey, and Hesketh Pearson's biography can claim a good measure of the credit for it.Comprehensive, detailed and sympathetic without being hagiographic, this book is essential to understanding the enigmatic genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confucius with the best commentary and translation.","review":"The only problem is that the text may be hard to follow smoothly since small amounts of translation are possible on each second page due to the commentary and original characters.But the translation is the best, and the commentary is superb.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confucian Analects, The Great Learning & the Doctrine of the Mean","review":"Has Chinese Language, Chinese Classics,complete dictionary of all the Chinese Characters, tremendous help in learning chinese and thoughts of K'ung (Confucious).

Tabak who operates TBK Inspections llc in North Carolina takes the viewer through his process, beginning with building lot and exterior walls. He progresses to the roof, crawlspace, attic, and interior. His main tool is a powerful flashlight. The subject house is made of brick, with some aluminum siding on a low concrete block foundation, which is perhaps not typical enough. Tabak is thorough, explaining what to look for and why, but an overall assessment would also have been helpful. He does note the need of various repairs that would lower a buyers offer. During the first segment the camera operator stays on Tabak instead of showing walls and windows he is examining. All the same, this program contains valuable information for any home buyer at a very reasonable price. Recommended for public libraries. David r.

Just *read* the manual, *follow* the directions and you should be good to go... and very quickly, I might add.Be careful to not grind the coffee too finely. Stay at about, say, a little finer than the average pepper shaker - NOT powdery at all.Be careful to not let *any* grounds spill on to the filter's edge (or \\"sill\\"). Number one cause for bad coffee or problems in a Bialetti is a bad seal, so pack the filter w/ coffee with great care, and clean and maintain the unit very meticulously.

Not that they are without merit; however, if you follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully you get a good immitation of an espresso complete with crema; ie turn the heat (flame) off as the product (crema) is coming out! A few seconds does make the difference between the crema dissipating or not. You will get a feel of this by monitoring the sound. It takes practice just like a manual espresso machine! This is still a mocha, but the best mocha I have had. I have used both commercially prepared mocha grind coffee and my own grind, set between filter grind and espresso grind. Fresh is best. The 4 cup makes the right amount for a 12oz cappuccino or 2 4oz ones. I have a regular Bialetti 2 cup, as well, but I find the amount made insufficient. Bottom line is this is IMHO the best mocha maker on the market, well worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 3 Brikkas, all three were defective","review":"I just wanted to alert potential Brikka buyers that there may be several batches of defective Brikkas floating around on the market.

Then I heard that the Brikka would make an even BETTER brew! So I bought the 4cup Brikka. Here are my observations:the 4cup brikka makes only a little bit more than my 2cup Moka express.the brikka leaks out between the bottom and top pieces of the pot before producing any coffee so I have to lift the valve myself to let the coffee come out the top to prevent further leakage. When I do that, I find that there still is about 1/4th of the water in the bottom chamber!Basically: my brikka leaks too much no matter what I do to prevent it.Stick with what has worked for the last 90 years, stick with the moka express."},{"rating":"2","title":"4-Cup???","review":"I just received this today and very excited! I used to own Moka but did not like the bitter taste... So I bought this one hoping it'll taste better.I clearned it, made two batches so far and making the last one before tasting since it says it'll start making right after 3 batches.First of all, I don't know why it says 4 cups. It makes about 1 shot at a time. The maker is large but the wanter measuring cup that came with it is small and way less than one cup. I think it's misleading to say \\"4-cup\\"It does make a little crema that I wanted...with moka, it doesn't happen.I have a feeling I have to keep trying to get a hold of it though.

(But I love Bialetti.)","review":"I joyfully used a Bialetti 2-cup for 15 years. No problem. I thought I was upgrading when I purchased the Brikka. But, consistently, only 1/2 the water brews. Also, it is virtually impossible to unscrew. If I tighten too much, it takes DAYS for me to unscrew it. If I don't tighten, the coffee leaks out of the center. I did everything recommended, from making startup brews, using the expensive Moka Illy coffee. To no avail. This coffeemaker hates me. And I hate it.UPDATE: What I learned from this experience is that BIALETTI IS WONDERFUL. They generously gave me a new (different) coffee maker and coffee tin. Great customer service earns my loyalty.

And the 2-cup model DOES produce crema.As for david's results, it's puzzling. If the coffee is boiling in the upper chamber, I'd guess not enough pressure is building. I would speculate that the seal between the chambers is not complete. Check to see if there are any grounds breaking the seal before you screw them together. If there is nothing blocking a perfect seal, I'd suspect a defect. Even if the 2-cup model is superior to the 4-cup, I can't imagine a functioning 4-cup to produce the results you're getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of the 2 Cup model","review":"I am very picky when it comes to espresso... and I have been very surprised by the good quality espresso this machine is capable of! The 2-cup model is preferable - especially if you only intend to serve 1-3 cups at a time. You need to make the whole amount, so it ends up being wasteful if you buy the 4-cup version (if only 1-2 people are served). Americans are accustomed to \\"double espresso\\" size servings - if you make single espresso size shots a 2-cup model can easily produce 3 generous portions.I have found the Brikka espresso tastier than the Moka. And if prepared correctly, there really is a decent crema on top. There's no comparing homemade to professionally made espresso - but this little brikka is better than most home machines that cost hundreds of dollars. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not espresso, exactly, but very good","review":"OK, it's not espresso \\"per se\\" (to use the older Italian), but it's very good coffee and fun to make.

If you like strong, burnt tasting coffee, this is the machine for you.I wanted to like the Brikka, but for under 30 bucks, try an Aerobie Aeropress (recently got one and I love it) and compare espresso results.

No matter what coffee I use, what temperature I use, how much or how little water or coffee I use, when I take it off the stove, etc., any \\"crema\\" that might briefly appear either gets blasted away by the pressure-induced spurts of steam that come from the stem of the coffee maker once the coffee has brewed, or gets boiled off because the maker has no way to stop heating itself.

By this I mean: the thing doesn't work, at all. It is an absolute disaster. Don't buy it.Specifically: this device has two main parts, a top and a bottom. The purpose of the top is to collect brewed coffee, and the purpose of the bottom is to brew the coffee that should be collected in the top.The main problem is that the coffee does not in fact go into the top, but instead bubbles out of the Brikka in between the top and the bottom, creating a really ugly burned coffee situation and leaving the would-be coffee drinker with nothing to drink. Like, I mean: all the coffee, upon brewing/burning, is spilled out into the broader universe, and none of it actually goes into the coffee-getting part of the gizmo. It's sort-of like buying a car that burns petrol but doesn't actually go anywhere.So in short this is a disastrously bad piece of coffee gear.

The parer cuts and feels great in my hand. The Chef knife chops like I never thought I could! It's even more fun in the kitchen now when I cook with these Elite knives. I can't afford the expensive French cutlery, but, the Elite forged knives are as close as I can get to the best without breaking the budget.

There are many levels on which she is writing and on which she can be read.

Also, he includes an index of prayers at the end of the book.I will be purchasing this book for all of my close friends and family because I feel it's an item everyone should have on their shelf.

The songs are great for listening to while doing just about anything (entertaining, driving, working out, relaxing, etc.).

Why did Amazon end its licensing agreement with AMC in midseason of this show?

Western","review":"I'll admit to hoping for another Deadwood when I signed up for the first season of this show. Clearly that is not what I got. Hell on Wheels is historically inaccurate in every instance except once there was a railroad. It is poorly written, poorly staged and allows Anson Mount a single facial expression. It has twenty men swinging pickaxes in a ditch on the prairie which they call the cut while no one moves any of the dirt out of the hole. You don't lay track in a ditch to start with.

But it is an extremely enjoyable book because it displays honor not only in the son of an ancient house but also in a street urchin who becomes his closest ally in a difficult, dangerous, and demanding task. Burnett didn't surprise me this time, but not all of her books have surprise endings. I found it a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Balkans will always be a mess.","review":"This book is located in an unidentified eastern european state but the implications point to the Balkans and Bosnia/Serbia. The novel is an overy romantic tale of instilling race-hatred and drafting children into warfare. I love F.H.B.'s well known novels but this one frightened me. Today's newpaper front page is full of orphaned child soldiers from eastern europe,Rwanda and Sudan that are not really very different from the main characters of this book. Do not put this book into the hands of young children, it needs to be read in historical context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bushnell's classic 1971 anthology","review":"In 1971,Nolan Bushnell invented the first video game,Pong.He decided to call its company Susiucchiee.But Later he changed the company's name to Atari because no one seemed to know how to spell or pronounce the original.I really love this game.Plus it also has interviews with Nolan Bushnell,Atari Memorabilla,Excerpts fom the book known as Phoenix and a free sticker.I have this on the Playstaion format.I love playing Asteroids,Asteroids Deluxe,BattleZone,Missle Command,Black Widow and Centipede but Pong was what made this disk great.Buy the 30th annioversary edition today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Games, Bad Graphics","review":"First of all, let me say that I LOVE these games. In fact, I grew up on them. That being said, I was VERY disappointed in this disk. I wasn't expecting \\"Final Fantasy like\\" graphics by any means, but I did expect to be able to read the on-screen type (score, instructions, etc.) I got right in front of the T.V., and I still couldn't read it. Also, the playing field and objects were SO small, especially Asteriods. I couldn't even see what I was doing (even with the cabinet graphics turned off). Warlords was probably the worst designed game on the disk. I couldn't even tell what was happening on the screen. The best designed game on the disk, by far is Centipede (my favorite). You can see this one fine, and read the type. It's really the only game worth playing on the whole disk. All the others gave my friend and I a headache. My friend said that the ORIGINAL Atari system had better graphics than this disk. That's pretty bad! Save your money...they didn't get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro at it's best.","review":"Some of the best Atari releases.Plays really well as it is analog enabled.This game will definitely bring you back to the days of youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old for this generation!","review":"I like it but my grandkids only use it once in a Blue Moon...it's just to old for this generation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Description is wrong","review":"I bought this game solely for Millipede (which it does not have). My attempt to at least have the description corrected by using the feedback form seemed to be ignored so I am leaving this review.

Most of the songs are pretty good too, although there are one or two that could be better, which is presumably why they were initially left on the shelf!Production is (of course) superb.Certainly good enough for the established fan, perhaps not the best introduction to the band (get Time to Burn first) for the novice, and I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Melodic Rock ive heard in ages","review":"Wow:) this is superb. normally im a heavy metal cd buyer but i also love melodic rock when its done right.

They produced the albums with great reputation during the late 80s and early 90s while I was almost away from American music with the exception of Bad English, Brian Adams and Richard Marx. (Sorry Giant was still not in my dictionary in 1992).It took no time before I love this CD. It is really an excellent combination of wildness and catchy aspect of hard rock reminding me of early Loverboy, Survivor and Foreigner. My #1 favorite is Love Can't Help You Now, which should become their comeback US hit. Sky Is The Limit that follows is great fun pop. Wow and their Robart Palmer cover \\"Bad Case of Loving You\\" is a nice case of covering Robert. If you love 80's rock, you will definitely love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is what you are looking for","review":"...if you loved Giant's previous releases, as well as S.

This bag is tough, it has 3 midsize, inside pockets; 3 sectionals, two large and one small in size for drum stick storage and a large storage pocket on the front of the bag. It has a great progressive look...... I carry all my drum tuning tools and access them with ease because of the extra storage. I carry 10 pairs of 5a oak drum sticks, a pair of pro-rod drum sticks; a bass drum beater; two tuning keys; a drum wrench; a set of allen wrenches; drum pad mufflers and some personal items.

I looked them up on the internet - they have no phone number or corporate address listed on their website other than San Jose, CA (no street address). The only support available is via email. Directory assistance has no phone listed. The Better Business Bureau does not list VEO, but does list the original/parent company named XIRLINK and states that the company has an unsatisfactory record with a pattern of non-response to consumer complaints. Guess that's why they now market their products under a new name. I will avoid their products in the future and stick with reputable companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I received this camera as a gift and had nothing but trouble from it. It has serious issues within its firmware that overpower any positive vibes from its low price tag.

The backup battery only works if it has 90% power. If there's less it doesn't work. My camera doesn't read my CF card. Sometimes it does, but when I turn off the camera, it forgets the CF Card was even in there. Also, the internal memory will sometimes say it's full; but when you go to see if there's pics the camera says there's no pics. The camera was a joke from the start.

When I plugged the USB cable in, Windows XP didn't even recognize the camera.TWAIN - the Twain driver is messed up. Half the time the computer can't find the camera even when you use PhotoImpression 3.0 (which came with the package and is an old version).Please, don't buy this product. Or if you do insist, make sure you have at least a 12-pack of AA batteries. I would rate it a 0, but that's not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Amendment Icon","review":"This is really an excellent book. The first 200 pages focus on the embattled comedian, his bits and his scrapes with the law. As someone who was never a Lenny Bruce fan I found this section a provocative read. However, I found the book becoming progressively more compelling as the authors get into the details of the First Amendment trials. They do a masterful job of intergrating theory with the mechanics of placing the factual \\"matter\\" (the testimony) before the finder of fact.In its discussion of the post-death and resurrected Lenny Bruce the book ascends to its highest level. The irony of Lenny Bruce as a First Amendment icon, whose free speech is beyond challange and the political destruction of William Kuh provide brilliant insights on the vicissitudes of American popular culture since the 1960s"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meant only for attorneys to read","review":"The title should have been 'the legal defense motions on behalf of Lenny Bruce'. There's very little else in the book. It's main appeal might be for attorneys like the attorneys who wrote it. A big bore for everybody else apparently to make some undeserved money off the name of Lenny Bruce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juan Luis is back at his best !","review":"Listening to a new material from Juan Luis is a sublime experience.

From rhytmic merengues like \\"Mi PC\\" to bachatas like \\"La hormiguita\\" this new CD makes me remember his previous works, but also adapting it to today's world.

They worked beyond my wildest expectations, so I decided to go ahead and augment the 16 MB internal storage with a 128 MB SD card (maximum size for this camera).The long n' short of it is: I received this item in 3 days, plugged it into the SD card slot, turned the camera on, and the storage capacity magically increased from 11 shots (in high quality) to 102 shots -- 1760 shots (in low quality).No formatting was required.

It hits hard and is such a powerful story that you are just sucked into it despite it lacking the dramatic effects of the blockbuster movies of today. Paddy Considine gets the role just right and Toby Kebbell is amazing as his mentally challenged brother.The Big Twist - I did not see that coming - and you have to watch the movie all over again afterwards to get a whole new appreciation of it. No more said as I don't want to ruin it for you.The one downside for some people will be the accents.

Even though its a bit soft and floral it is at this time when the masculine scents come to the top (about 5-10 minutes in). From now on its pretty darn good. Through out the life of it definitely shows its quality. I personally didnt buy this because its just not my type. I went with the tangier coney island instead.I have been thinking about buying it though. While at saks, multiple outrageously pretty women came up to the bond no 9 area and told me to get chez because all guys should have it.... and then I bought coney island haha. For the money..

Although I had known about the more famous ones (Elizabeth I, Henry VIII & wives, Victoria) this marvelous book has now revealed the stories of the others to me. Not to mention the beautiful portraits of the royals themselves. The best thing about the book is the author's opinions of the King or Queen just slightly slipped in. Though, like others have said, the book doesn't go into great detail about anyone, you'll learn what really happened in the days of Mary I or Henry VI. The writing is definitely English, and while reading you may require a dictionary lying around.

There was no depth to the characters, in my opinion, and none of them were particularly likeable, despite the fact that in theory, they should have been very likeable. I can't quite put my finger on what I disliked about this book, but I can say that I have read most of her other books and this is, by far, the one I've liked the least.

As Lillie struggles with her life's lessons, taking detours with alcohol, cigarettes and casual sex, she slowly learns what it is to be an adult, and just what it is adults do have control over. While the motif of invisiblility could have been brought out more, making it more \\"literary\\", it is still a highly accessible and enjoyable novel from this first time novelist.

Only one alien effect (a rubber mask, probably made for but not used in The Arrival). A few underground scenes stolen directly from \\"The Arrival\\". As a TV pilot, we are introduced to the two characters that will show up regularly, so of course, neither is injured. Of course, the aliens couldn't be driven away either (no reason for a series then). Full frontal nudity on one woman, not a playboy centerfold either, for 6 seconds or so. No swearing I can remember.

Also, the last few essays about specific writers were somewhat enjoyable. But on the whole, it's stuff I've heard before in a more accessible and enjoyable fashion. Sometimes it led to some mildly interesting conversations, but basically, I feel it was a waste of my time. Sven needs to get a grip--technology isn't going away. Also, I had to chuckle when I read him boast about the fact that he is \\"in no sense online.\\" Well, that might have been true when the essay was first published but his journal sure is online now!

In more recent releases, though (including this one) it has only offered the jarring and insipid music of Robert Israel. During live showings of Keaton films in Minneapolis I have witnessed piano scoring (the best) and creative contemporary scores by local groups. A great musical score really helps to accentuate the strengths of the film instead of calling attention to itself. Israel's work is subpar and takes away from the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keaton's marriage life slapstick farce","review":"This splendid slapstick farce was Keaton's revenge to the tensions and bitterness of the marriage life with his first wife, Nathalie Talmadge. The film is a torrent of very calculated sight-gags with a unstoppable rythm that arrives to its \\"climactic\\" explosion in the spectacular scene in which the character incarnated by Keaton, a wrecked lawyer who have to be married by 7 p.m. of his 27th birthday to inherit a big fortune ( this is, in 24 hours ), must choose between five hundred spiteness brides or a rocks avalanche. The film knew a very poor remake in 1998 called \\" The bachelor \\". Another masterwork of one of the greatest technician and comic artists of cinema.This DVD edition contains too the early Keaton's shorts : \\"Neighbors\\" ( 1920 ), a shakesperian underground farce and \\" The balloonatic \\"( 1920 )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keaton's Ruthless Romance","review":"\\"Seven Chances\\" (1925) is a fine example of Buster Keaton placing his stylistic imprint on material not specifically tailored for him. In fact, the premise appears ideal for Harold Lloyd: a stockbroker belatedly discovers he will inherit $7 million if he marries by 7 p.m. that evening, yet only has a few hours remaining. What could have been a traditional thrill comedy emerges as a surreal nightmare - featuring one of the great climaxes in movie history, with hundreds of potential brides (and an avalanche of boulders) chasing Buster through the Southern California landscape. The 20-minute sequence is propelled by Keaton's stunning athleticism and a remarkable editing precision. Like many Keaton silents, \\"Seven Chances\\" seamlessly fuses his deadpan expressiveness with an expert command of the film medium. He transforms a simple farce into a provocative examination of ruthless romance in which deadly boulders are preferable to devouring women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must.","review":"I would also concur that this is a must for any serious beginner, intermediate or intermediate advanced jazz-keyboard player who wants to learn jazz baselines.It teaches base lines for all kinds of major and minor scales, diminished scales, different time signatures, waltz, bossa-nova etc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gunnar Dybwad - ALWAYS ahead of his time.","review":"I spoke today with Gunnar Dybwad, at 91 years old he lives alone in his own home, and continues to think about the future of services for people with disabilities.

But I guess that is one of the rules of tantra: don't build something up only to be disappointed in it.

This book is a great beginning on the basic breed personality, finding a good breeder (take your time!!!), and some things you can expect with Shibas.Still doesn't prepare you for the joys and challenges of raising/owning a well-socialized, good canine citizen Shiba. While the book convinced me that the Shiba was the dog for me, actually living with one is a lot of fun-- with the caveat that I have the time it takes to socialize and train my dog. (Because of the human-dog bond, I'm not sure he'd follow his commands from a different human in my absence).I do wish the training tips and hints were expanded and continued-- these smart dogs will have more commands under their harnesses in their first week with you than you'd believe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As dry and boring as it gets.","review":"I read the book while preparing for my teacher certification exam. My professional training is in History and I have had my share of dry, boring books, but this one literally put me to sleep. I used to read few pages before going to bed, a sure way to cure insomnia.The textbook is just a collection of facts, dates and names. There is no cause-and-effect line in the book, not even an attempt to draw some conclusions. Instead, it reads like a statistician report. If memorizing the dry numbers is your thing, go for it. For the rest of us, who are trying to actually understand and make some sense out of the past, stay away from this book. You will get your basics in, but it will not make you think or encourage you to seek more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"The History of Texas","review":"The history of Texas is a really good book.

Boo!That aside, it's little things that add up. Such as stating for a fact that Crockett was executed after the The Alamo fell.

I currently run a small Adrenanlin kicker box with 3 way speakers and I get a good mix of bass and treble using the onboard BASS and TREBLE controls on the deck. I am completely satisfied with this unit and would highly recommend it for users who want a solid deck at a great price and who do not require such features as a fully programmable EQ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic CQ-C1333U-don't buy this","review":"i got this after long research on the web. the key pads are crampier and the system overheats and skips the tracks after 2-3 hours of play. i will be returning and getting something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good player","review":"I was looking for:- Affordable price- AUX in- CD/MP3 playerThis in-dash receiver is just what I was looking for.Sound quality is just as the original player I had in my car (Toyota Corolla 2005), maybe a little better.I would summarize that it is a great buy for the price I paid ($100.00)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job well","review":"I needed a CD receiver with auxiliary input for my MP3 player.This receiver works well, it is easy to use, it has a nice remote.It's difficult to compare audio quality: I think this type of devices are all equivalent.

Although the text is descriptive as far as features are concerned, the drawings of the birds and their features does little to help identify any particular bird. I was quite disappointed to see only sketches and what could be construed as very poor quality black and white photographs of birds. No full colour photographs.

Douglas Mawson, a veteran of the 1907-1909 Shackleton expedition, returned to the Antarctic in 1912 with his own team. His sledge journey with two companions turned from a harsh but rewarding exploration into a terrifying fight for survival in an instant. At almost the same time as Scott was busily scribbling inspiring hoo-hah in his diary trying to cover up his appalling faults of leadership and organization, Mawson was courageously fighting for his life and refusing to lie down and die. An incredible story! One hopes that Australia remembers Sir Douglas Mawson and his fortitude. He is an example to all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Taking Apart a Puppy...","review":"Reading The Marshall Plan for Novel writing was a bit like watching someone take apart a puppy to see what makes them so cute.I purchased this on the advice of another writer. Overly structured, cookie cutter plot devices do not a great novel make. Does it work? Maybe. I don't know, I don't think I'll be able to use it. It sucked all the pleasure, joy and warmth out of writing for me. When I tried to face my current WIP the day after reading this, I was too demoralized and paranoid to type more than a few words.If for some completely unanticipated reason you have to sit down and crank out a novel (let's say they'll take apart your puppy if you don't), this book might be helpful.Definitely not for sci-fi/fantasy genre writers. It does NOT encourage speculation and imagination. I recommend Donald Maass's Writing the Breakout Novel instead. Both useful and inspirational. There are better places to find info on novel-plotting that will not make it a miserable chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Writing Guide Ever","review":"I have purchased and devoured a lot of writing how to books over the years. Some have been better than others, but, this is by far the best book I have read on the mechanics of writing a successful selling novel. It walks you thru plotting the scenes of the novel, the difference between action and reaction scene and then concentrates on the mechanics and style of writing. Definitely beneficial and informative. Easy to understand and apply to your writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing, hard to understand","review":"I was hoping this book could help me with writing my novel but it was very confusing and in step five it has a section called \\"Sections and section sheets\\" that I could not make heads or tails of.Check out pages 59 - 64 to see what I mean.

If you actually want to write an \\"original\\" book, and simply need a little help getting started on your monumental opus, check out \\"How To Write And Sell Your Novel...

Well, that was great for the first quarter of the book but then I realized I couldn't keep track of my storylines. The story became a big jumble in my head that I couldn't seem to untangle. The Marshall Plan has given me a way to keep track of it all. This is exactly what I needed to get my novel moving again and remove the clutter from my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide...deserves to be on every writer's desk!","review":"Literary agent Evan Marshall recognized the need for a clearly written, step-by-step workbook for writers, both published and still trying. This is the result. While detailing the necessary steps carefully, Marshall's easy style encourages even the most blocked of writers to try again. He guarantees this sixteen-step program will take you from nebulous idea to finished manuscript.I was skeptical, until I applied his sixteen steps to my own unfinished novel and found, to my joy, that every one of his points worked. This is an excellent guide for writers and deserves to be on every writer's desk.LINDA HUTTON, MYSTERY TIME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I've finally found a book to help me focus on what is necessary to write my first novel.

Thank you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Approach to Plotting","review":"\\"The Marshall Plan\\" is a cute title for a gimmick. However, the Plan is a shallow, formulaic approach to plotting that can make any genre fiction hit its marks on page counts--but that's all. If you're a mainstream writer who needs help with more weighty matters, like developing characters or finding the right point of view, forget the Marshall Plan. New writers beware: If you think you know exactly how to write a novel after reading this book, you'll find that you've still got a lot to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, Easy to Read Layout","review":"I am an aspiring writer and Marshalls book is easy to follow and useful. It was a smart investment. With a pen, paper, that book, imagination, and a little research, you will have a novel in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, structured system -great for long term projects","review":"The methodology presented in this book is great for creating interweaving plot and sub-plots, with depth to more than just the lead protagonist and antagonist. By following the steps, you end up with a good story line that has peaks and valleys.A key part of this process that lets it work with the weekend or part-time novelist is how it has you create detailed sections from various character's view point, listing the action and subsequent reactions to those scenes. This can be done over a period of time, and then when those are finished, you go back and write out the scenes in detail as your first draft. Again, something that can be done over a period of time as you have it, without losing track of the story because you have already outlined it.Definitely recommended for genre fiction in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy Brit","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my British husband who is always complaining about American cheeses.

Of course I couldn't name which ones - they all sound alike. I bought this album the first day it came out hoping for an original nu-metal band. What a disapointment. First off, they are not hardcore. If you want hardcore, listen to bands like Hatebreed, Will Haven, Candiria, etc.. No One is another generic nu-metal act featuring simple, down-tuned, 3-chord guitar riffs. The bass is somewhat decent, but nothing special. Their name is fitting because that is what they'll be in a couple of years - no one. They'll be forgotten under a pile of nu-metal acts that sounds just like them. The only good point is that they feature very little rap elements, not that it makes up for a boring, lackluster album."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*...","review":"The band is exactly as their name implies. They are not that heavy, people! Almost every review here has the term 'heavy' in it. You want heavy, listen to Soilwork or White Zombie.

The lead singers voice is annoying as crap, he sounds like a baratone faggot with his 'ahhs' after almost every word, especially on 'My Release'...'It's real' was decent, as well as the first few seconds of the song 'Cut' when he says something like \\"bring the $#!+\\" I don't remember really but I do think that I liked the song 'Breathe' but I know for a fact that over all this CD sucks and should be avoided by any fan of metal or even numetal.

I felt bad for them and thought Chemical sounded pretty good, so I decided to show some support for them and picked up the cd a few days later.....WHY OH WHY DID I DO THIS?!?!?!

The White Stripes are Led Zeppelin compared to these guys. I'm almost saddened by this display of pure nothingness. The members of this atrocity should be ashamed of themselves.

She has a passion and caring for her ship and crew that the others don't. Except maybe Captain Kirk.

How is this to be believed? The same thing happens in the shuttlecraft. Outside the window, the stars are stationary. These SFX shortcuts do not promote the reality of the show.

Many keys were not responsive and the space bar in particular was bad. One had to tap it pretty hard for it to work. This new one here works quite nicely and I do not have any complaints. If I had a wish, then I would have liked to see a bigger back-space key. It is a very basic keyboard without some of the features that regular keyboards have but it serves my purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sour and good if you love sour candy","review":"I love all kinds of sour candy but this gum is really good and lasts long. It has many flavors and well worth the cost. Reminds me of Penny candy in the late 70's.I recomend this gum if you want something sour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must Have Changed Their Formula","review":"I bought these based on the previous reviews on how sour these were. While they were sour, it was nothing to write home about. I imagine they must have changed their formula in the year since the previous reviewers because even two in the mouth at the same time barely elicits a puckering of the mouth. You could take a very small wedge of lemon and get the same effect. I also was disappointed in how quickly the flavor of the gum goes away. Each piece only lasts around 5-7 minutes before it needs to be spit out since the flavor is gone and it starts acting like really cheap gum that will fall apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller reneged.","review":"Two days after the sale was made the seller withdrew their item and I was left with nothing even though I won the auction.

As it is really thin from the front the drive tends to break. I had 2 of them and one broke while taking it out of my laptops USB port, even the other one is getting loose now so I am using that one with care. I have others which work just fine. The sleek design comes at the cost which is not worth the shot. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Momo","review":"I loved this book, it was my favorite one in High school. I would love to have it in my book collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book","review":"This is a fabulous book! in my opinion it's Ende's best one! If you're a fantasy fan, you definetly have to read this book, it's about a girl named Momo, her young friend, her old friend and the time-thieves, who steals time from people by making the people think they are saving time. And of course a few other creatures amazing as always from Michael Ende."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly deep and beautiful book for all ages","review":"It's very seldom that a book both takes hold of your heart *and* guides you through metaphors to notice something about reality that had previously escaped you. 'Momo' is such a book. Set in a fantasy world that parallels what we would consider ideal, 'Momo' is the story of a special girl observeing and trying to cope with/battle against the slow and unnoticed appearance of an army of grey men -- intent on stealing the free time from all the people in her world. The effects of this time theft is clever and in a way haunting; the world begins to become modernized, looking more and more like our own. To give away any more then that would be to give away the plot; trust me, it's a wonderfull, wonderfull read for adults and kids alike. I rank it up there with C.S. Lewis's \\"The Chronicals of Narnia\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic for children and adults","review":"I am so pleased that Momo is available again after being out of print. It is one of my all-time favorites. Read it aloud to your kids or your class. There is so much wisdom in this book and it is a great way to start conversations with children about the true values in life.While the story in itself might appeal to very young children (amazon recommends it for pre-school children) I think that its beautiful depth would be lost on them. I am positive that the book wasn't written with this age group in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"The major flaw of this game, is that if you bowl continuously on the leg side and just aim for the wickets you can EASILY bowl batsmen out, even the top teams.This is a grave, serious error and should be fixed, because if this game is based on reality then in reality if I am aware that I could get batsmen out by just bowling at their leg-side then it's not worth playing the game of cricket.The commentary is just atrocious. For starters, it's boring and some of the phrases used are recycled over and over. EA Sports also could not attain the rights to some of the teams, thus fictitious names are used for most players.This could be a great game if you play against your friend. But I don't always have a friend to play, so in conclusion, this game sucks. EA Sports will never catch up with Cricket video games and give it the respect it deserves, as they do with Madden (American Football - and yes, I have played it and it's very good), which sells more far more copies than Cricket.

Nice wide and yellow beam that works wonders in fog, rain and snow.Although these are small lights, they put out a lot of usable light.

I've been using it for a long while now, and have no problems with pumping or dripping. It dispenses just the right amount of the liquid soap at just the right pressure.Refilling it is super easy, just take off the cap, and large opening is very pour-friendly. I also appreciate its sleek appearance: it fit in my existing decor flawlessly. Stainless steel furnish makes it easy to clean, and there's no issues with tarnish or rust. All in all a perfect pump. The best!!01/2013 update: this pump has been in use for over 3 years, and still functions beautifully and looks as good as new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted :(","review":"Easy to install and worked great until it broke 4 months after we bought it.

The matching Soap Dispenser was over $100 and people were complaining it was plastic. I ordered this in stainless steel. When this arrived I was stunned that the finish was identical to the Steel Optik finish of the Hansgrohe. This is listed as stainless steel but it is in fact more of a lacquer coated brushed steel finish. The quality of this pump is outstanding at a fraction of the cost. I ordered a second one just to have if this one ever fails. If you are considering this just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"This is an attractive and very functional soap dispenser. I bought 4 of them.

So, maybe I should not have been so lazy and got up off the couch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install","review":"It was much easier to install the new soap dispenser than to remove the old one.

This plastic straw hopefully will remedy that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Problems Here!","review":"This was a bit tricky to install because of how the container screws on but the ease of filling it and how well it works makes up for all of that.

It is a good product for the money but didn't earn 5 stars with me because although it states that it is stainless steel it actually looks more like a brushed nickle so it doesn't match my stainless sink exactly. Also the soap holder is about half the size of the one that it just replaced, which means I will be refilling it twice as much as I had to before. It seems to work fine and very easy to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big bad soap dispenser","review":"This dispenser works well, I have had it a while and it holds up. No complains whatsoever.

It is basically the story of one man's genesis that has endured the ages as a plot device yet it appeals to a contemporary audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious work","review":"This is impressive work, entertaining and ambitious in several ways. You can see the influences, from Joyce to Salinger, but while Denali does a great job of paying his respects to Holden Caufield and Stephen Dedalus, he then moves right on to explore new, and interesting, territory. One of the more enjoyable, enlightening books I've read all year -- and I read a -lot- of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disjointed collection of thoughts from VC & dot-com execs","review":"This book collects \\"gems\\" from dozens of executives, practically all in the venture capital or internet space. Each contributor talks about what they view is a key strategy or issue. The book comprises a little over 80 pages of easily read thoughts, some of them quite interesting. However, there is little cohesiveness to the collection of thoughts with adjacent sections jumping across diverse topics. Despite this shortcoming, I thought the booklet was worth the reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercifully short book","review":"A sheltered and self-indulgent author who believes that every trivial thought that passes through her head is fascinating to the reader. It isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past page 96!","review":"This book was one of the worst books I've ever encountered. I think the author is in love with her own voice and her lacy way of putting words together...I'm sure this was a very cathartic experience to write out her inner world but I found it miserable and now feel like I need some prozac just to get over thinking this might be an insightful book. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"A chemically-induced coming of age story.","review":"The transition from obsessive-compulsive disorder to a peacful life of shopping, falling in love and finding a job is told with poetry. I wanted much more, however. Slater skampers past very weighty issues with barely a nod. Perhaps the new life \\"lite\\" she enjoys with Prozac makes her unwilling as of yet to probe in much depth the problems and potentialities to which her remarkable experience speaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I agree with the reviewer before me. I started this book and set it aside because there was nothing on it that has not already been told better somewhere else.I would much better recommend The Beast, by Traci Thompson, for an honest, emotional but sober account of what it means to live with depression. Believe me, I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey Across the Chasm - from Illness to Wellness","review":"This is a remarkably well-written memoir about journeying across the chasm, from illness to wellness. The journey is subjective, philosophical, psychological and metaphorical.Lauren Slater had been dealing with mental illness, especially depression, for a very long time. When she hears about the FDA approval of Prozac, she knows that she wants to be on it. Slater's memoirs delve into the world of 'being well' and what it means to enter that world via chemical intervention.It is beautiful and lyrical in its use of language. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in mental illness and its treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Poetry","review":"I couldn't put this book down. The poetic descriptions of her sights, sounds, feelings, inner and outer world transformed me into a colorful inner place I didn't want to leave. Being a Prozac user myself for 7 years, I know what she means by being \\"better than well\\". It's a feeling I had never had before Prozac. Almost like being in love. I recommend the book (and Prozac) to anyone who's inner world is so terrible that they need to be transformed to a better reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put down the book","review":"I can't recommend this book highly enough. Though I don't take Prozac, I was totally touched by Slater's story of her struggle towards mental health: I laughed, I cried, I wanted to know her more and more. Her writing is excellent, and her insights thought-provoking. Also, as a psychologist, she is able to seamlessly weave into the story her knowledge of pills, drug dependency, and human behavior in a way that expands the narrative. Some of the most touching parts of the book for me, were the descriptions of her relationship with Bennett, her lover, who loves her not in spite of who she is, or was, but because of who she is--Prozac and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting book carried by her strong writing","review":"I have read reviews that call this a great book and I think that's a bit of an overstatement but it is worthwhile as an honest and very well-written account of everything they don't tell you about Prozac in those magazine ads. Slater did write a great book, her first one, \\"Welcome to My Country,\\" and this follow-up seems a calculated attempt to capitalize on the first bit of acclaim she won with something sexy like Prozac. Still, she can pull it off because she has so much insight and writes so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more author making money from Prozac controversy......","review":"I expected this to be a book that you are so engrossed in that you can't put it down. Not to be!The author is so intent on using poetic words and phrases that you lose interest right from the start. \\"And the flour was snow\\" \\"the purple silk of a plum\\", blah, blah, blah! She is so intent on sounding like a philosopher that she forgets that people expect to get answers from the book, or perhaps that was not her intent at all.Anyway a HUGE dissapointment. If you want to read it, borrow it from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull.","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but sadly, it's dreadful. All the cliches about self-obsessed little rich girls apply. Her writing is good, but she just doesn't tell us much. What caused her depression, anorexia, and anxiety? Biology? Abusive parents? Original sin? I've struggled with depression myself, and hoped to find something here that spoke to my experience. No such luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headphones for any price!","review":"I love these so much that I've bought multiple pairs of them over the years.

As someone mentioned they do make a lot of distracting noise,, but beyond that, they are poorly manufactured. I bought a total of 10 of them from two different suppliers, and from each at two different times, depending on who had the best price at the time. One by one they have stopped working until now I have only two out of the ten still working. I have taken a few apart and it looks like water leaks into the electronics and destroys it. Since I have a masters in electrical engineering, I am now trying to redesign them so that they work from real power instead on the noisy water generators. If you buy one, my advise is to take it apart, and coat all electronics with RTV to protect it from the water. If not, plan on it to stop working within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This was the second Aqua Glow I received from Amazon.

They work very inconsistantly. We did discover, finally, the method of carefully and smoothly moving the dial quickly around, but with no rhyme or reason they (esp. one of ours) will suddenly stay locked no matter how many times we enter the code correctly -- waiting patiently inbetween tries, taking the batteries out and back in again. One of my sons is currently locked out of his vault with things of his inside -- it alarms every time you even move the dial at all.

My daughter got this as a birthday gift. She put in a check she got from her grandparents, her wallet and all her money. She was able to open it about 2-3 times and then it never worked again. I emailed the manufacturer and got no response. Unfortunately we do not have the packaging anymore, since it was thrown away on her birthday and we did not discover the problems until a few days afterwards.

We had some initial frustration with it, but finally were able to use it with the 0-0-0 code only. Our 5 year old still had trouble using the dial effectively and I had to operate it for him whenever he wanted to open or close it. Frankly the toy did not get much use for this reason. Now, the safe is stuck open. The doors are open, but the lock mechanism is extended so it can't be closed. Whenever we turn the dial we get the \\"error\\" buzz and the 0-0-0 combination no longer works. The product is discontinued and so we are probably out of luck with regards to returning it.

Paper dolls have more personality than any character in this book.I've read screenplays and this reads like a screenplay that didn't sell.

Eddie and Roberts characters are perfect foils for each other.

I normally like Buddy Films, but this one was just plain bad. The jokes were horrible, the acting was worse. Reality TV fits into this movie seamlessly, which is probably another reason why I didn't enjoy it.

This is a typical Eddie Murphy noisy movie, so noisy that I have to turn off the volume and watched it in mute. Why Murphy is so similar almost in every of his movies? He's so noisy and annoying and just couldn't keep his big mouth shut a minute. This guy is not a good actor in the least, because he could only perform or act with his thick lips. De Niro also seemed to fail putting his heart in this movie, maybe just because he also wished that he'd be deaf to avoid the nuisance of Murphy's loud mouth. This is a terrible movie and it only makes me finally decide not to watch any new movie with Murphy in it, no matter what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie Murphy is pretty good but","review":"Awful writing.

I wouldn't know because I don't usually watch those movies...but who cares?This movie was just hilarious. DeNiro and Murphy were delightful on the screen together. The contrast of their characters and the eventual evolution of their relationship was pretty interesting. If you're thirteen or older, and you like comedy, then go see it. However, even though it was kept under wraps pretty well, there is quite a bit of violence in this movie that may frighten small children.

The ... montage I've seen in any movie. Ever. It reminded me of Albert Brooks saying, \\"Now we'll show the French the meaning of the word montage!\\" in \\"Real Life.\\" It just went on and on and on.

However, this is the exception to the rule....this is a horrible movie. You can lose count on how many movies were used to make this turkey.De Niro, I can't see why he wanted to make this movie. My guess is that he lost a bet and he had to make it. Murphy wasn't funny either. Let's face it, his movies (except Shrek) have tanked.If you want to see this movie, my suggestion is not to.

A veteran detective, he finds all of the hoopla taxing and detrimental to the job he has to do.This movie is pure fun.

This movie was very funny anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very plesant night on the town.","review":"You would not expect Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy to be a great comedy match, but both of them pull if off in SHOWTIME.De Niro who proved he could do comedy in ANALYZE THIS and BRAZIL proves it a third time. He does it however playing a \\"De Niro \\" role as the tough no nonsense cop who gets stuck with Murphy to get out of a PR jam.Like De Niro Murphy plays a part he has played before as the cop who is more savvy about TV then police work.Rene Russo is fun in a supporting role and William Shatner is absolutely hilarious as himself trying to teach De Niro how to play to the camera. If he had more scenes he would steal the show.The only flaw in my mind was the lack of development in the relationship between Di Niro's character and Russo.

He would crank out so many classics in the 70's, 80's, and early 90's. Today his films have been mostly flops rather then classics and nothing can touch his glory days. Now, add anther falling star in Eddie Murphy. He has had mega success in Shreik and Dream Girlz but he seems to make a good film and follow it up by making three bad films in a row. This brings us to the film Showtime. If this movie was filmed in the 80's it might be freshier and funnier. However, today this movie comes out as predictable and stale. DeNiro does his usual curmudgeon shtick with the usual facial expressions and Murphy still tries to act like he's the funniest man alive. The movie is alright but nothing i'd go out of my way for but its alright to watch if your just sitting around and have nothing better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every De Niro comedy gets worse","review":"... With every subsequent comedy De Niro has made, I've gone to the theatre to have my hopes dashed again and again. With Showtime, De Niro has hit a new low, and I am just about ready to give up on him.The biggest problem with this movie is the complete lack of focus. The movie could have worked as a parody of reality TV and various other cop genre. It could have worked as a Hollywood cop thriller with the quintessential wise-cracking rookie paired with the hard-bitten older detective. It could have been a Naked Gun joke-a-second comedy. Instead, it's a little bit of all three, and it ends up being not good at anything in particular.The most interesting character in this movie are Vargus, the criminal, and Powder, the dog. De Niro and Murphy phone in their performances.

Maybe I don't have my antenna well positioned, but I don't have many options.The indoor antenna is very limiting, because it's only about 15 feet long, which means that you've got to position the receiver pretty close to a window (yes, the antenna needs to be facing outside - and needs to be pointed N, S, E, or W depending on where you are in the country.My recommendation is that his is a good car receiver, but if you're looking for more than that - consider other options."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sirius\\"ly Flawed","review":"The suction cup mount is plastic with a steel bolt through it.

Sampled the rest of the album at a local record store and now I'm hooked on this release and so glad I bought it. It's solid, consistant, and as another reviewer stated, \\"more mature sounding\\" than previous releases. The beats are so good. They are slow to mid paced which provide a change of the typical death double bass syndrome. Chris' vocals are even more evil sounding as well.

His debut was very good, but on this one Dante Blake was even better. The production gets better and once again you are introduced to Quik's unique creativity. The Compton's producer/rapper is joined by his usual crew - 2nd 2 None, Hi-C, AMG and Playa Hamm and they all do a great job flowing over Quik's music. The truth is I don't feel much that reggae song but I love the rest. It's a rather short album but you still get a nice ammount of high-quality tracks. Quik raps about the rap game, money, the streets and of course he always has quite a few things to say about women and sex. On this album he also takes quite a few shots at his rivals - rappers Tim Dog and Compton's Most Wanted. It's an album that you really enjoy listening to.

I especialy enjoyed reading in black and white the proper placement of the tabernacle and the rules on saying mass. So many priests ignore the proper ways and opt for keeping taberbacles in seperate chapels and use glass chalices. The ceremonies of the modern roman rite detail guidelines for liturgical colors, linens, vessels and vestments, the altar, the church, and much more. What i found lacking is the ceremonies themselves, It contains rituals which are reference only, incomplete. Just like the ceremonial of bishops, this book will give an outline for a ritual but refer to other texts for the complete ceremony. I reccomend The Rites vol 2 if you want actual rites and rituals. All in all this book is worth the price, though personally I would rather the american curch follow Rome more closley and leave the modern stuff to the protestants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"This book offers idiosyncratic interpretations of the rubrics of the Roman rite and tries to pass them off as official and binding. For example, the discussion on the proper placement of the tabernacle (page 29) misrepresents what is actually said in the body of Roman ecclesiastical law on this subject. In giving directions to the celebrant for the communion rite (page 121), Eliot goes way beyond what is actually stated in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, stating that the priest is to hold the paten in the left hand, hold the host at eye-level and so on. Thirty years ago the church abandoned this kind of writing about the liturgy for good reason: It mistakes mystification for mystery. This book fails to understand the nature of the renewed liturgy, and tries to put new wines in old wineskins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors of Fact, Poor Interpretations","review":"This book fails to understand the overaching principles of the renewed liturgy. Written by an Australian priest living in Rome, it criticizes gratuitously certain applications of the reform of the liturgy in the United States.

I don't know of the importance of this particular John Todd to anyone else, but as for me, it was a complete waist of time and money. If you are concerned with the Illuminati cults, which started with the babbeling of John Todd Collin I recommend \\"The Todd Phenomenon: Ex-Grand Druidvs. the Illuminati Fact or Phantasy?\\" by Hicks & Lewis. \\"The Todd Phenomenon\\" will be expensive for a tiny old paperback, but at least it is the correct John Todd."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing","review":"This item was not shipped to me as it was cracked in several places & thanks to Amazon, my purchase price was refunded once they inspected the piece and decided it was not suitable to send.

The gauge, however, was a huge disappointment. Upon putting the new gauge through its paces, I found the device to produce inconsistent readings.Here is an example: the gauge was attached to the valve stem. The reading was exactly 34 psi. The bleeder valve then was used to release a small volume of air. After releasing air, the pressure reading increased to nearly 35 psi. I performed numerous measurements, being careful to hold the gauge completely vertical, as advised by Moroso technical support personnel. The result was the same: the pressure would fluctuate by as much as one psi.This is not the performance I expect from a 50-dollar gauge. The product was returned for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in BRAZIL -- NOT USA - What a deceptive Picture","review":"The picture on the Amazon leads you to believe that this is \\"MADE IN USA\\" and of high quality components.What a load of crack.

Unlike some gauges, when you remove it from the valve stem the needle goes back to zero. It feels a little delicate without the ~extra charge~ rubber cover which should just come with it.Also, think about which model you need. I wanted something just for car tires and I could have gone with the 50 lbs. model.

After a few weeks, though, the gage stopped returning to 0 psi (stuck at 5 psi). Consequently, all my readings became suspect (since they now indicated my cheaper gages were off by 7 psi) and I stopped using it. My cheaper gages may be off by 2 psi but hey, at least they still work.This is supposed to be a high quality product and hand calibrated, etc. But it's also a waste of money in my case.Note: I did not drop the gage or misuse it in anyway.

By the time you've pressed hard enough for the air to stop leaking, a lot of it has.I don't care how accurate it is (or isn't). If the chuck is such a piece of crap, it renders the whole thing USELESS. I also have a $9 Slime digital, and it has no problem seating the first time with half the force.The only good thing is the chuck is attached with a nut and can be easily removed to put on a better one.

Carry bag fits the campfire and stock hose with 10' extension with some room to spare. The hiss even sounded like the hiss of wood burning. Most campsites won't let you bring in wood from out of state so you have to buy there at $5-6 a bundle. I figure I saved $50 in wood cost as the propane used was about $18 for 4.5 gallons. Even if you are able to bring your own wood it takes up much more space than the unit and a propane tank. It just made camping with a fire a lot easier.

I had purchased it as a gift and cannot, in good conscience, pass it on to the intended recipient.The gardens pictured are exquisite and had the quality of the photos been equal to their composition, this book would be an inspiration to gardeners everywhere. Unfortunately, the photographs are grainy, soft (read 'blurry'), and lacking any depth-of-field whatsoever. Using these substandard images to represent years of dedication by talented gardeners is insulting both to the reader as well as the garden owners.In a world full of lovely landscapes and brilliant photographers, this book does justice to neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking Waste of Time","review":"The photo quality in this book is poor and the reading isn't any better.The author tells us \\" A total lack of inspiration is a sign of laziness.\\" and then goes on to state \\"Lazy people should not garden because they end up demonstrating their nature publicly.\\"I think lazy people should not write books.

Photos are moving and information is interesting as we see stages of the development of the World Trade Center in the early seventies. The photographer was at the same spots then as he was after the attacks so we can see the terrible void in the New York City skyline where these magnificent structures stood.

Nice pictures of the WTC from its early days and building, and tastefully done pictures of its sad destruction.

I can only speculate that the reason for this book is to make us Christians feel like we can read these stories to their children without fear, or regret. Really, it is quite bold to try to twist things to appear to be Christian so that Christians can claim them as their own. Unfortunatly Murphy perpetuates this behavier in this book. The origins of these tales are obviously Pagan, read up on the brothers Grimm and really study the tales they told. Everyone should be able to enjoy these faery tales without trying to make them acceptable first. Appreciate them for what they are, dont put a spin on them.

Naturally, I also scored high on the exam. After studying this book and making a 95% on the practice test, I was extremely disappointed to find that the real exam dealt with very little of the content found in this book.

I am afraid that you can't just read the title and give a review. Those who have studied this book, understand it's contents and taken the exam will know better. This book is a good supplement to a good study guide, but certainly does not gauge how well you would do on the exam.

The book is spiral bound, so it lays flat on your music stand. A variety of blues and jazz techniques are meticulously illustrated. New chords are introduced with a nice full page guide to the keyboard fingering. It is a bit cookie cutter, but having the fingering written out below and above the staffs is a plus. My only complaint is that the \\"band\\" seems to be a cheesy concoction of General MIDI instruments played through an inadequate sound engine. The CD sound quality is irritating. One word of extra advice: You will not need the CD for the companion book, Chords Complete, because it only contains incidental backing rhythm tracks for the chord exercises. I have four books authored by Konowitz. The sound quality of the CDs are uniformly cheesy except for the Listen and Learn Blues Book published in 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I was not impressed with the lessons in this book. The music did not sound like any jazz that I'm familiar with. As another reviewer put it, the music seemed terribly \\"white bread.\\"I also found the CD of very little help. As I try to learn to read western music, after studying the verbally imparted music of North India for 20 years, I find that I'm very insecure about reading rhythm. So I turned to the recordings of the lessons on the CD to verify if I'm reading the rhythms properly. No dice. The MIDI orchestration makes it virtually impossible to hear what the piano is doing. A more sensible format would have been to have ONLY the piano playing, with the left hand in one channel and the right hand in the other, so that you can hear each part clearly and distinctly. As it stands on the final product, the CD recordings are a hopeless hodgepodge.Pass on this book and keep looking if you are interested in learning this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teonanacatl : Great Historical book","review":"I had this book once.

Fattoria Estense silver label is slightly syrupy, sweet and sour, full-bodied, and a good value. It would be nice to have an smaller spout so that pouring can be more precise, but the hanging drop from the neck of the bottle makes finger-licking-good treat for the pourer! With Fattoria Estense silver label, it's easy to forego calorie-laden salad dressings, butter, and such. Have fun experimenting; you'll be sure to find a new favorite food and balsamico pairing.

And in all of this, it was NO convenience that Amazon only, as far as I could find, has customer service email addresses, rather than phone numbers. As I said, I eventually got everything straightened out, but it was a gigantic hassle--so if you sign up for service via Amazon, be ready for inconvenience when your phone arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understandable","review":"I am currently taking and Inro to Economics class.

This movie looked like it was filmed on a $50 budget in the alley between a motel 6 and a run down bar. The acting is horrible, the movie is gawd awful. I too fell prety to the few glowing reviews.

Jack Nicholson plays Charlie Smith, a man trying to please his airheaded wife by leaving California to become part of the Texas border guard. The wife is played beautifully by Valerie Perrine, with other movie characters played quite well by Warren Oates and Harvey Keitel. Among the grit and sand of his new job Charlie encounters the young family and becomes involved in their journey as the promised land dream fades into harsh reality. This is a poignant movie, directed by Tony Richardson. It is scored well and has an ending that somehow makes the struggle seem less harsh and lifts the spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I found this , film / DVD good , and a nice transfer , it is nice to see both Harvey Keitel and Jack Nicholson in a filmtogether , this is before the Nicholson Directed \\" The Two Jakes \\" .

You probably have to have East-European origins in order to fully appreciate this kind of beauty, because the stories of Hrabal are all sad after all.

I found it funny, thought-provoking and relatable. The hyperbolic trait of the main character to please everyone is something that many people can see in themselves, though maybe not to the extent portrayed in the movie. It's a slow comedic build up, with poignant and sentimental moments along the way, but the pay off at the end is worth it. The last few scenes make the whole movie.The editing and fast pacing of the movie is something rarely scene outside of screwball comedies, like Big Trouble, and you wouldn't think it would do well in a pseudo-drama, but it works. The dialogue is smart, funny and despite its fleeting nature conveys all you need know about the story and the characters.As for the seller, the item arrived in great condition, and quickly as we'll.

But this book seems to be written from the author's experience in putting together e-commerce sites using Microsoft's technologies. The back cover didn't promise any .NET developer stuff anyway so I wasn't expecting it I guess. But I found the coverage of Web site design to be helpful and it got us to thinking about some of the designs we'd initially come up with and we made some good changes. So it was helpful in the end. I do wish there were more examples of how to implement stuff like personalization, which I still don't really understand.

A small group of civilians and doctors, along with 7 military soldiers have been set up in a compound underground to do surveilance on the zombies.

While I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead, I never thought it was that good other than for the time period and influence it obviously had. Day of the Dead was not only the best of the Romero movies, I feel that it is one of the best zombie movies in general.

It should be part of any Romero movie fan collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAY OF THE DEAD","review":"In the final installment of Romero's trilogy, he takes a somewhat sympathetic veiw towards the walking dead.

I had thought that it's a very mediocre parody of a good film until I came here to read the reviews. If this is a cult fave of the genre then I don't want to see the others either. This movie is as scary as your grandma when she is upset, because you don't like the lunch she cooked. If you'd like to shiver a little watch something from the Hammer-studios instead!

The DVD extras are also very feeble on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring And Overrated","review":"Day Of The Dead is somewhat slower and not as effective as its precessor Dawn Of The Dead,but still delivers some gore from the great Tom Savani. I didn't like the pace of the movie and also the acting of the soldiers was really annoying,plus picture quality was below average and sound was anywhere from blarring loud to soft. Lastly a group of researchers studying the behaviors on zombies and being ordered by the military trapped underground in missile silo just gets boring and looses its touch.

I loved \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" because of the fantastic special effects and the obvious humor/parody. I hate this third movie because it is not scary, it lacks humor and it's just plain stupid. The basic premise is that the government is no longer functioning because the zombies have overrun the country. That's pretty farfetched, to begin with. Then, we learn that an obviously unbalanced doctor is trying to housebreak one of the zombies. Why in the world would anyone do that? Didn't we learn our lessons from pit bulls? This movie used up my tolerance to stupidity by the 30-minute mark. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not get it on pay-per-view. If you must see it, wait for it to come around on cable.

After recently viewing it, I've gotta say...in hindsight, the problem with \\"Day\\" might've been that it was ahead of its time. Much of the movie's tension & underlying themes really hit closer to home in today's world than it did in '85. I dare to say it's aged more gracefully than Dawn of the Dead (I'm not saying \\"Day\\" is BETTER, 'cuz it isn't...but presently speaking, the \\"campiness factor\\" is still nowhere in the league of \\"Dawn\\"), and the gore effects still rival the big boys of today.

Most of the untalented cast spend the movie screaming at each other. The heroine is unattractive and bland. The villain is so over the top that he's irritating.

It's really painful to watch, and I think it'll turn your soul to tar and your brain to oatmeal with repeated viewings.The best zombie movies in my opinion are the ones that make you feel like it's the end of the world, with violent death around every corner. It's you, with perhaps a small band of survivors, trying to hold out against the destruction of civilization and the human race. This one makes me root for the zombies, and frankly, it loses me there.I highly recommend you skip this one, and see Dawn of the Dead (2004) or 28 Days Later instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"day of the dead","review":"the third installment of the dead treollogy and was shot different from the script that was sopposed to be.as a romero fan i loved it very mutch.i was 15 and had an cousin who got me into the movie theater to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Day of the Dead","review":"I've seen all 3 of George A.

But Day of the Dead and Return of the Dead partII suck a big fat one for free on two knees.If you the amazon buyer likes corny portrails of soldiers, a story line about as fast as a zombie's walking pace then you would like the movie The Tenant as well because they both suck.Return II sucks too but I'll review that later.I would call this a piece of trash but I would really hate to insult all of the pieces of garbage that might get called pieces of trash from time to time.Save your money please or buy ZOMBIE. Now thats a slept on zombie flick. I bought it and really enjoyed it and was pleasantly surprised.Now see here with some friendly advice you can even get a free recommendation to a real movie.

Romero took the whole apocolyptic thing way too far.There is no tension, fear, or suspense in this movie.

The script is so more mature and in depth you question why Romero hasn't put out another original 'Dead' movie since then. Dawn was just fun, unserious and so innovative, however \\"Day's\\" complexity makes Dawn seem childish. Incredible innovations in this one, with beautiful visuals and great spots. Romero said in an interview that he laughs whenever he watches this film, kinda makes you wonder if the next 'Dead' will be a bigger box office draw than Titanic...

Tom Savini gives us the most awesome effects (look for the rolling head and the dismembered Rhodes), that perfectly enhances Romero's writing style and the actor's performances, cliched as they may be. This is one of the best horror films of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Romero's best!","review":"This is definitely one of Romero's best movies. I would rank this slightly below both \\"Dawn\\" and \\"Night\\". I think this movie is getting unfairly panned. Someone said its depressing but its supposed to be. How would you feel if you were outnumbered by the enemy 400,000 to 1? I also love the in-fighting between the scientists and the military, it adds another problem into an already horrible situation. I have heard of Romero's original script for this movie but have not read it, so I can only imagine what could have been....This movie is one of the best horror movies ever and tops in the zombie genre.Special mention goes out to Captin Rhodes played by Joe Pilato. He is one of the most evil, despicable, funny, loveable villians ever to grace the silver screen. I rank him only behind Darth Vader on my all time villians list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Day of the Dead","review":"If you want a good zombie film, this is it. This is one of many zombie films, I chose this film as a good representative of the era. This one hasn't suffered from censoring, though it could have done with some.

The only thing that's wrong with it is not including every extra a special edition dvd would have! This is a familira situation on some blu rays. But still this has never looked better since it was in theaters back in the mid80's. At the time we all wanted a bigger scoped movie and this one was a let down in that regard. IT's a good movie though if you take it on it's own. It has plenty of gore and chomping ,just a limited place as in a bunker compex to see it in. Fans wanted a faster paced movie and ROmero gave us this interesting movie instead and it's got alot of cool thoughts embedded in it. This is worth owning for zombie movie fans and the blu ray is the only way to go. In fact I think it's a minor horror classic that raises some good points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"One of the best zombie movies ever made and definitely one of my favorites.

In fact the only reason I watched it all the way through is to see the gore. The gore is disgusting and very well-done. Here are some reasons why I dislike this film; 1. It takes place mostly in the light 2. The profanity is stupid, there is no reason for 50+ f-words in this movie 3. It is way overrated.

The high definition was nice (pleasantly, brutally graphic) but unfortunately the movie is pretty sad, dull, poorly acted, shabbily written and overall a waste of time. I actually am a B movie horror fanatic so am pretty forgiving of not-so-well-made horror movies, since they afford me such entertainment, even when not brilliantly done. But this one was too poorly made to even qualify for that! It was dull! And that just isn't fun!

Day Of The Dead","review":"Probably one of the best intros of all time. George Romero's underrated classic Day Of The Dead is really good but Not as good as its predeccesors. The fact that they train a zombie to be behaved was a huge part of the story line. I was shocked to be honested. The movie is good in all aspects. Romero is a genious. PERIOD. Not the greatest movie in the world but it doesn't deserve the bad criticism and the bashings it is getting. Most of the Zombie flicks right now (especially the remakes) suck. There all flash and no substance. Good Job Romero."},{"rating":"2","title":"George A Romers. 3rd and Final Zombie masterpiece.","review":"What can i say George A. Romero is the zombie man. No one can create a zombie movie like him. The trilogy follows As night of the living dead then dawn of the dead then day of the dead. Some say this is the worst in the series, so do I. But it dosent mean its a bad movie. In this movie a single woman and about 30 other men are in a bunker. The acting is very strong, many actors feel the terror of the world coming to an end. Plenty of brain munching and good fx by Tom Savini. Overall great zombie film by George A. Romero. 4 stars being the worst in the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"This truly is a Dead series.","review":"I have to admit, I only saw this movie because I heard it was the goriest out of the 3. I wasn't expecting that to actually be true. This movie features some of the most disturbing death scenes ever put on film. Too bad the talking and theories became a serious bore after you realize nothing has happened for an hour. It is somewhat of an interesting movie compared to the other two, but it's not in the same class as Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead. I guess they had to learn the hard way that releasing a horror movie the same year as it's parody (Return of the Living Dead)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Best of Romero\\"","review":"This is my favorite Romero film of them all. The gore is the best in this one, (in my opinion). The zombies also looked a bit more realistic compared to the dawn of the dead and night of the L.D., where their skin was just kinda pale, not saying there were'nt good movies though. This was the movie that got me into zombie films. After watching one of the soldiers throats getting ripped out while screaming (and the fact that you can hear his voice getting higher and higher was a nice touch I might add) was excellent. Like I said one of Romeros greatest Films ever. If you dont like this one, you dont like Romero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect DVD of This Classic Film","review":"If you're a zombie fan, you'll either love or hate \\"Day Of The Dead\\". You'll love it if you like intelligent, mature storytelling along with your blood and guts.....you'll hate it if you keep comparing it to DAWN or NIGHT, which are two totally different movies.In my opinion, the best of the DEAD trilogy. While it's a shame Romero couldn't give us his original concept (the script of which is included on the DVD) the film he managed to come up with is just as good.The only thing wrong with this DVD release is the soundtrack: there are minor (but annoying) overdubs in a few scenes, apparently taken from a TV track. Nothing major, but when you hear the character John say \\"Right!\\" instead of \\"S--t!\\" in one of the opening scenes, you'll definately notice it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good film/bad news","review":"Day of the dead is a better film than it gets credit for,so please check it out.I know this isnt the best place to say this but i have some horrible news about a sequel.

The Barras are very tight, musically and vocally, and must be a lot of fun to see live. The uptempo songs here are well worth the price of admission. Rattling Roaring Willie is wonderful (see also the version they did with the Chieftains on \\"Fire in the Kitchen,\\" an album you should own.) I would suggest that one or two of the slower ones drag a bit, aiming at intensity but not quite there (by contrast, see the greatest hits album's \\"Marquis\\" for a beautifully poignant slow traditional tune). I'm also not a fan of their version of \\"Second Hand News,\\" but then I don't think it's a song worth covering in the first place. All in all a solid 4 stars, and 5 if you're in the car in Nova Scotia driving the Cape Breton highway. On that front, there's a store in Cheticamp, N.S., called Down Home Charlie's, that does mail order - might be cheaper than this import price."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"First I have a disclaimer, that I am an Amazon 3rd party seller.

Had never heard of the Barra MacNeils prior to this.If you listen to this CD, don't expect the first song to be representative of all the others--they are all different, and each one showcases a different talent, either separately or together as a group.I love this CD.

In fact, this is his first time working on any film. Until now, he was working at a bar and voice-acting in several video games.After Porn Ends has the look and feel of something a first-time filmmaker would create. Wagoner picked a sexy, attention-gathering topic and then he treated the enormous complexities with something that looks straight out of a film school textbook that he skimmed. You are unlikely to get much out of it unless you want a Where-Are-They-Now of porn actresses.For a look at the porn industry that is surprising, insightful, and mature, check out David Foster Wallace's essay \\"Big Red Son\\" which appears in his bookConsider the Lobster and Other Essays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows the Reality of a Life After Porn.","review":"It's interesting how so many of the people featured in After Porn Ends seem to have all of the same problems as \\"normal\\" people, bad relationships, self-doubt, substance abuse, compounded by the stigma of having been in the adult film industry. There is such a glamour that is constantly associated with the world of pornography that it is compelling to see that it all seems to easily slip away when the cameras are turned off. The parties and the money don't last forever and real life has different demands.The documentary style itself is adequate to the task but it is little more than turning the camera on and letting the performers talk. It's good that many of the people included are interesting in their own right since they don't seem to be prodded much by the director.Whatever your personal stance about pornography might be, this is an interesting study that shows the variety of lives that performers have led after they end their careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I watch plenty of documentaries but this one didn't really grab me.

However Linda manages to adjust to her new role, she does so with the precise motions of an automaton and with as little emotion.

They can handle the bass extremely well with the +18db bass boost switch kicked 'in' that you will not feel the need for a subwoofer at all. +18 is rather excessive and I don't run it that way, but with it 'on' these speakers handled it without any sign of break-up.

It has a light on in the front that is permanently on as long as the power cord is connected - it does not tell you if the coil has switched off. The only way to tell is to keep checking below your pan if the coil is red hot or not. It then waits till the coil completely cools down before it decides to come on again. I find this completely unusable if you're doing anything that requires constant heat. If you're toasting burgers or buns or cooking vegetables, you will find that it takes a phenomenally long time because of this constant switching on and off. Food also cooks unevenly because of this.

We gave it a second chance after an overnight rest (perhaps it was just suffering from \\"opening night\\" jitters), but, when plugged in, it repeated its zoom to surface-of-the-sun temperature, and would not go off no matter how we turned, jiggled, etc the knob.

The thermostat is not linear making temperature adjustment a task in itself aside from which, mine came loose internally. I've taken it apart, re-calibrated it and locked it back down but it comes loose again with moderate use. This meaning if you spin it a time or two the wrong direction, it gets super hot or barely warm until you calibrate it to the knob sticker again.It's also a pain in the rear to clean.All these positive reviews really show you how unreliable random opinions are. I'm looking for a much larger, double burner simply because it will be more stable for frying and sauteing. This unit is fine for boiling pasta, making sauces etc but avoid it for frying."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I own three of these things and they are the biggest pieces of garbage I have ever seen. After you use them for a couple of weeks they start malfunctioning. The burn will just shut it self off you have to wait for about 5 -8 minutes then it will reheat ruining what ever you are trying to cook. I contacted the company and after weeks of sending information and answering all there questions all I got was the run around. This is a terrible product and the company is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"shuts itself off","review":"Like others, I've also seen that it shuts itself off from time to time.

It heated up fast and cooked food as it was supposed to. It is mid/late Nov 2009 now, and the hot plate stopped working. One day, instead of getting hot, it smoked up the room and set off the fire alarm (read: I live in NYC ...). After that, it just stopped working. I had expected it to last at least a year, but this is just unsatisfactory. Do NOT purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this model!","review":"Received first unit and died within first week.

It showed that the darn heating element kept shutting off even though I have it turned all the way up. I never could get over 155 degrees in the smoker after 6 hours!

What a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Burner","review":"Pros: Burner works very well and does exactly what I purchased it to do, which was actually to light hookah coals on so that I don't have to ruin my current stove in the kitchen.Cons: I always use the burner on the highest setting that it has and after a while the coils turn off for a minute which I don't like. however it does work and they always turn back on without me having to do anything.Overall: Love the burner, it works great, its portable, and it does exactly what I purchased it to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes my \\"kitchen\\" complete","review":"I have a second \\"kitchen\\" away from our home where I have a West Bend large countertop oven but didn't have anything to boil water or cook liquids. I purchased this product based on reviews from other Amazon buyers. The quality of the product is excellent. It's nice that you can lift up the burner if anything spills. It boils water very, very quickly. It takes around 5 minutes to cool down. The range from low to high is very nice for either cooking or keeping warm. I only use pots which are the same size as the burner, which is what the manufacturer recommends. I'm very satisfied and happy I purchased this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't seem to heat above 200 deg","review":"I've had this hot plate for about 2 years now. It's barely satisfactory. It has a long cycle time, which means cooking temps vary significantly, and I frequently burn what I'm cooking because when it's in the \\"on\\" part of its cycle, it's @ max heat (glowing heating element). Very difficult to get things to actually cook @ low or medium with this.Also, I wanted to make toffee this year for Christmas, and before I started, I went to test my candy thermometer with the \\"boiling water\\" test. I discovered that this hot plate will literally not heat 4 - 6 quarts of water above 200 degrees. It just maxes out @ 200. Maybe it's a safety feature? Seems kind of weak, though, given that 200 degrees is not even boiling. :(I just ordered myself a new Broil King. Based on the reviews, it sounds like it's a much better option."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this poorly designed hotplate","review":"I have no idea how this got more than 3-stars on Amazon unless people just have not used a good hotplate before.I bought this to replace the 10-year old hotplate I got at walmart for ten dollars that finally quit working after using it a couple times a week.Unlike the old one which had a compact base of solid insulating plastic, this one has a huge metal base that gets glowing hot and cannot be touched or moved even after the burner has been off for a minute.It also has the \\"china-made chemical smell\\" when used for the first time so I am sure there are some fumes burning off that are probably unhealthy.The burner itself is slightly warped and does not make full contact with a flat pot so there is wasted energy. The knob is also warped and wobbles when it's turned.This is ridiculously poor design, even for an inexpensive item. I'd return it if I had not used it. Instead I will toss it in the closet and search for a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for lighting hookah coals","review":"Works perfectly for lighting coals for my hookah.. But definitely randomly turns itself off and back on, presumably some sort of anti-overheating measure. I assume there are wires inside that are getting hotter than they should, and it's a fail safe. I don't think this would do well for cooking, as it seems like it only runs for about 7 or 8 minutes before getting to that point.Also I think I saw people complain about not being able to remove the coil to clean the base. The coil won't completely remove, no. but you can angle it upwards and it leaves more than enough room to clean underneath it, so that's just senseless complaining.But that wasn't my purpose, for my purpose it gets 5 stars, that's what I bought it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product description should outline the \\"safety cycling\\".","review":"As others have reviewed this thing has an annoying feature that is not advertised that essentially turns the whole burner off when it hits a certain temperature. Annoying to say the least, this product is only food for heating up water for oatmeal and maybe a small pot of pasta or soup. Forget preparing an actual meal where the plate needs to be on for an extended period of time. I would not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase of the year","review":"I bought this expecting it to be kind of bad because of the price, but I didn't want to ruin my stove and it was taking too long (and wasting too much) to cook hookah coals on the grill. That said, this thing not only has not broken, but it lights my coals entirely in under 1 minute. Maybe even 30 seconds if I timed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design","review":"Like the 34101Y version the directions say to unplug this when not in use. Why? Because it's still on, a small amount of heat still comes from it. Absolutely ridiculous. Who wants to unplug this after each use and then plug it back in?Also, like most 5th burners these days they irritatingly design them to go on high until the right temperature is reached, even if you put it on low. So you can't let something slowly build heat, you have to watch it so it doesn't burn, then it will turn off the burner when low is reached. This was probably designed to heat food faster.You would think after decades of making these they would get it right.Other than that, the build quality seems fairly nice and sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"Same problems as other bad reviews. Turn it on low - blazing high heat. It turns off and on. High low high low even when I'm not touching the knob. Maybe a manufacturing defect. That happens, but when I see all the same complaints, maybe someone needs to call the factory manager in China. Spend a little more for something less crappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what you're using it for","review":"I purchased this \\"hot plate\\" to use for roasting coffee beans outside.The problem I encountered with this model was that it would only heat for a few minutes and then would shut off to cool before heating up again.Coffee beans take approximately 6 minutes (give or take depending on the type of bean) to roast. Just when the coffee beans were entering the last stages of roasting, the unit would turn off. Not good.For the low price I will keep the unit around for other potential uses should a need arise, but as for the intended purpose that I bought the item (roasting coffee beans) it is more or less useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT Bad","review":"After using it for 2 yrs, NOT every day only in winter 3/4 months each year, suddenly coil got on FIRE and brook coil in to half, Flame was high like 2 FT, I unplug the Burner then stop the Flame, well nothing happened.But if you leave it burning it could happen something very bad .

If I am looking for another to replace the one purchased I will go to a store where I can see the product before I pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"I wanted a cheap hotplate, and that is exactly what I got. I haven't noticed that it cycles on and off like the other reviews say, but it definitely does not heat evenly (or maybe that is just a result of my cheap pots), nor does it get a pot of water to an actual rolling boil. It is lightweight and poor quality, but it works, so if all you're looking for is a temporary- or occasional-use hotplate, why spend more? One good thing is that the heating element lifts up a little bit so that you can easily clean under it or put a spill-tray in. And it does have a nice, sturdy cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"we are remodeling our kitchen, so I bought this burner to help while I have no stove. I didn't like the control knob right from the beginning. However, after less than 10 uses, the entire unit stopped working. As I only paid $12 something for it, I threw it away. I am currently using a Cook's hot plate that not only cost less, but is sturdier with a better control mechanism. Don't waste your money on the Proctor-Silex Fifth burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burner","review":"I would not recommend this burner to anyone. It worked great the first time I used it but after that it started shutting off after not being on very long.

It doesn't do it just once, it does it multiple times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Lighting Natural Hookah Coals","review":"Picked this up based on a recommendation from another hookah smoker.

So happy I don't have to light coals off my gas stovetop for 15 minutes anymore, plus no more mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one","review":"Bought this before Christmas. Used only twice. First time it was ok, heat up pretty fast. Second time it made a spark and burned a hole at the bottom of the pot.

It did worth to find the warranty and get a refund, So I just threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good but ...","review":"I basically bought this so that my pregnant wife and myself could sit on floor and cook instead of standing for long hours while cooking. The coil heats to red hot which is excellent. But the coil goes on and off regularly because of some kind of temperature feedback. This feature rendered it useless for us as we cannot cook roti, chapati or pooris delicious Indian dishes. I thought this feedback sensor was in the coil because of the clips holding the coil in place from expanding after heating beyond a certain temperature.So I took it to my machine shop and cut off those clips. But still the coil went on and off. Later I opened the coil assembly and checked if any other switch went on and off inside but I could not makeout any kind of temperature sensor inside. Please let me know if anyone knows how I can keep it permanently hot.Thanks,"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little \\"heat\\" where needed.","review":"I purchased this little \\"fifth burner\\" to use in my lower level family room to primarily melt butter for my husband's popcorn.

I would recommend it to anyone who needs a small, reliable little burner. It is also handy for keeping hot appetizers warm without over-cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Extra Burner","review":"I purchased this burner to use for boiling water, mainly. It's an adjustable 1K watt burner! If a person is going to do a lot of frying, don't get this burner, as it will not generate enough constant heat. And, the cycling on and off must be a safety feature, which I can't say I have experienced, since I don't use it for more than 15 - 30 minutes at a time.

When it gets to the desired heat level the heating element cools down. It then cycles slowly back and forth from hot to not. It's okay for boiling water but it may take 20 minutes (with the lid on). When I make a large pitcher's worth of tea (about 1 gal.), I set my timer for 40 minutes. Frying is not easy because it fries for a good 60-90 seconds then you have to wait about four minutes for it to heat up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I brought this so that I could heat traditional Turkish coffee.

But it does something the other portable burners ive had did.. it quits heating the coil frequently. As if it's meant to not get too hot.

From Baby I Need Your Loving to the killler Why Do We Call It Love this CD..well...Swings.

That is not him, and the obvious dubbing of George's interview clips is a great dishonor to George. I have to wonder, too, if the filmmakers created this as fiction.

The use of plug-in filters, zooms and fades are unnecessary. Not only that, but the phony Harrison voice is bad. The box says \\"Harrison s complete audio tapes narrate this film\\" - anyone who has ever owned a micro cassette recorder knows of the horrible fidelity... The voice is in a padded vocal area using a condenser microphone and digitally recorded. Not even post production can clean up micro tape that well... sound designer slacking.Whether or not this is true, this production is extremely campy."},{"rating":"1","title":"mockumentary","review":"i saw this film on netflix. it was catergoried as a mockumentary. you can notice that the songs are not the Beatles or even George. if this was really George then there would have been permission to use the actual song not just the riffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dates Messed Up","review":"They claim McCartney died in November 1966 then they say the remaining 3 put out clues on Rubber Soul and Yesterday and Today which came out before November 1966. Now if he died in November 1965 then it's plausible. Interesting to watch for some \\"Paul is Dead\\" clues I never heard before. Other than that, the date errors are just terrible. Worth watching once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's one for the Conspiracy Nuts","review":"Now I've never seen the entire movie but I did happen to catch some parts in a documentary. That a documentary was even produced on this absurd nonsense was a joke to me. What made it all the more laughable was the seriousness in the narrator's voice, like he really believed this crap himself. It also had some fake British bloke trying to imitate George Harrison's voice. Sounded like the guy that did his voice on the Yellow Submarine movie! Perhaps it actually was!! But you know, I still am not sure if it was meant to be serious or if it was just meant as a joke. Either way it is not worth spending one cent on it. Don't think I would even be interested in viewing the whole thing if it was given to me for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"EYE OPENING!!","review":"Totally MIND BLOWN! This documentary presents one heck of an argument on the possibility that Paul McCartney isn't the one we see today. I was a little skeptical going in but you would not believe what they present to the viewer. A MUST WATCH! WOW!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT, under Any circumstances, BUY THIS DVD!!!!","review":"If you must watch this, hopefully you'll have Netflix and can watch it without feeling you've totaly wasted your month's subscription fee. If you don't, find someone who does. Or just take advantage of the free trial period. Hell, it would cost less to subscribe than it would be to invest in this crap. This could have probably been marketed in a more 'fun' fashion-the 'Paul is Dead' story/myth, 'clues', etc. are a hoot to go through. But to claim that this is a 'testament' by George is near-criminal. As you'll read in other reviews, the facts/dates are wrong in many instances,and the 'voice' of George Harrison is the Worst job I've ever heard of anyone trying to mimic him. He did not sound anything like this at the end of his life. Please, PLEASE, Do Not support the \\"film-makers\\" by buying this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"couldn't watch this terrible acting! Only could bear 15 minutes of it! Felt like a lifetime movie...although some of those are good. This one is so set up and fake! Acting is so hopeless that I should say \\"acting\\" is so hopeless. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD","review":"I did not have any problems with the seller, bit I am not giving 5 stars because I thought that this was a CD full of bohemia style songs or boleros and it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really worthless!","review":"This book was a waste of my money. You would have to be \\"mentally challanged\\" to need this book. I mean really, what kind of person needs help dealing with such common, everyday experiences like \\"knocking things off nightstands\\" or \\"my tub is overflowing.\\" For crying out loud, turn the water off! I was extremely dissappointed with this book, even insulted. How dumbed down is this world going to get?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excting update","review":"This was a Nice update of the Gatchaman characters. Great action,and a dark, intriguing storyline give punch to the episodes. Thankfully, it was missing \\"7-Zark-7\\" and 1-Rover-1, two characters in the Americanized \\"Battle of the Planets.\\" However, I hated the music featured over the menu and wished there was a way to delete it. I bought this a few months before buying the Rhino releases of \\"Gatchaman\\"/\\"Battle of the Planets\\" and I must say the original '70's Japanese series is still superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gatchaman is back!","review":"I'd been a big fan of the old \\"BATTLE OF THE PLANETS\\" cartoon so when i saw gatchaman on dvd i had to purchase it. Overall it's a good quality miniseries good animation and a good amount of action.All the characters are there slightly changed but still there.My favorite character was always Jun(Princess/Kelly) unfortunatly her \\"character\\" is only used in suporting role.She's only there to spout technical jargon.But that's keeping in tradition with the old gatchaman, the focus always seemed to be on the two male leads,Ken and Joe, and in this miniseries its no different.There's a LOT of political intrigue with the galactor and not enough gatchaman action.Also the music is horrible,the main song is very lame. Overall a very good miniseries with some pretty good action just dont expect it to be the exact same show from the seventies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was good THEN","review":"When I first noticed that G-Force was \\"revamped\\" I must say I was disapointed. But once you give a shot you will realize it has all the cool elements of the 70's hit, though I saw it as a kid in the 80's. The first thing you'll notice is the characters and costumes are a little different as well as the ship. As for a previous review there is ONE instance where they use an original music track. And you'll know it right off the bat! But I do agree the original music score is the difference, it'll take you back to when cocoa puffs in front of the TV were the standard. But I figure they want to appeal to newer audiences also. Overall great DVD, I wish they would continue this line if only to see how much farther they can take it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is *not* for G-Force fans!","review":"As a child I was an avid G-Force fan. I would watch every morning before school and as I grew up and discovered more about this wonderful world of anime. I realized that the G-Force I watched (as well as Battle of the Planets) was an American release of the Japanese \\"Science Ninja Team: Gatchaman\\". Now that anime has started flooding the US marketplace (thank you!) I finally found this... a coveted \\"Gatchman\\" DVD, a sweet memory of my youth. But, when I popped it in I didn't see the characters I remembered. No 7-Zark-7, no Pee-wee, no Ace... and no \\"G-FORCE\\" team yell. What I came to discover, is this was a re-labelled 3 episode set of what was shown on tv more recently as \\"Eagle Riders\\". So, yeah, it's technically a modern Gatchaman... but if you're expecting the original, you may be disappointed. If none of this made sense, enjoy the show... it's still pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you think","review":"If you are looking for Hallelujah Live with Kurt Nilsen et al, this is NOT IT. I don't know how it got associated with it, but if you look under Espen Lind, you will find it. I do highly recommend the other Hallelujah Live, it is an excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film on Soviet Georgia","review":"Several of these reviews seem to be for some teen comedy -- \\"A Chef in Love\\" is definitely not a teen comedy! Instead, it is a tragi-comedy about a French chef who falls in love in and with Georgia (the country, not the US state) as the Soviets are coming to power. Having lived in Georgia, I was spellbound. Much of the movie was filmed in old Tbilisi, and the scene at the ancient cave city of Uplistika is spectacular. And for those lucky few who have enjoyed Georgian food, the Chef's love affair with the country, its culture and people is more than understandable. This is a great film about a great country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor teaching. Too much fusion. Reused material!","review":"Some of these moves are very difficult even for experienced bellydance students (beginners - forget it!), and Suhaila doesn't break them down and doesn't explain. On the other hand, some exercises are too simple and boring and don't require a bellydance or pilates instructor. Still some other exercises are weird and made me doubt if they are useful for dancers or anybody at all. I was disappointed that there was much less dancing here than I expected. I also felt gypped: there is some overlap of exercises between different DVDs of this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout! Great fun!","review":"Suhaila gets a little emotional at the end of one of the videos, which I found cheesy; however, she is an amazing instructor!She'll kick your butt ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent drills - but not really beginner","review":"Suhaila is an excellent teacher and her technique is known all over the world. Her students are fanatics. I can see why! She does some very original exercises that help target muscles that help in dance. I can see how this DVD series would be frustrating for beginners, but for those with a little expeience, you should totally consider buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD WORK OUT","review":"I ordered this set and i love it, yes some moves are a little hard but great cardio workout!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect format--discs not compatible","review":"I am giving this one star not because of the content (which I can't even view), but because the DVD format is listed incorrectly and now I have to return this. It's actually DVD-9, which means it's a dual-layer DVD, NOT a standard single-layer DVD. Your player has to be specifically coded to play this, and none of mine are. Had the DVD format been listed CORRECTLY, I wouldn't have purchased this."},{"rating":"1","title":"unseen","review":"I wouldn't know what to tell you about his product because i never recieved it.

I just want to say that these videos are good, but not really if you're expecting a normal workout or basic bellydance instruction. In a way, they're for more advanced bellydancers, although I could also suggest them to anyone who enjoys moving her body, becoming more flexible, and gaining control over -- really, I have to say this -- the strangest muscles. The \\"Buns\\" video also left me dazed when I first did it. (Why on earth would anyone want to flex her glutes individually, I wondered!) And honestly, since I'm not a performing dancer, I have no practical purpose for it myself! But if you get a kick at all from the process of gaining awareness of and control over your body, these videos are not a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fabulous and well worth tryinging...","review":"This is a really wonderful way to experience the Suhaila method. It's about as close as you can get to her studio as a video can get. She breaks down an undulation in a way that no other teacher does. This is an essential video to add to your fitness collection, for dancers, with a ton of experience under their belt and for the non-dancer as well. It's challenging, inspiring, and Fun! Keep squeezin' those glutes, it takes a long time to get that one down!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitness Video not a Bellydance Instructional","review":"I've been bellydancing for 3 years and got what I wanted with these videos. I wanted a good conditioning video that would help maintain and improve my strength. That's what Suhaila provided. I would not recommend these videos to someone that is looking to either learn basic bellydance technique or never taken any bellydance before. Instead, these videos are perfect for the bellydancer who wants to condition their body OR someone with previous dance training."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this book hoping to learn a bit more about the operations of a unit partly made famous by Sajer in \\"The Forgotten Soldier.\\" Instead, the account I received was one which hardly differentiated this Division from any other serving on the Eastern Front. Lucas never brings the description down to the platoon, company, or regimental levels. I never felt like I was taken inside the Grossdeutschland, indeed I don't think the names of the major officers were ever mentioned. The whole book has a strange, detached feeling. It more seems to be a general account of what every fightingman in Russia went through than a history of an individual unit. I guess I was hoping for something more along the lines of Sydor's \\"Soldiers of Destruction\\", but that was not what I found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpletech still has never failed me","review":"Being that I only had the 8 MB that came stock with my camera the switch to the Simpletech 64MB cf card was a huge difference.

It consists of three adventures,each having a different \\"feel\\" to it. One is good hard SF, the other is a military-based exploration and the third feels like a D&D dungeoncrawl in space.After the adventures there are a few resources for creating explorer heroes as well as how to run an explorer campaign for GM's. Finally, there is a brief explanation of the Concord Survey Service. I particularly found the character templates the most useful as well as uncommon uses for common equipment in the PHB.Overall, it's a good package. I've run two of the three adventures and my players were pleased. Definintely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Biography","review":"A wonderful story for the whole family!
