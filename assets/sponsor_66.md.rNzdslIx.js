This series compares most favorably even if the characters and situations are not quite as fleshed out. As an \\"older\\" reader who enjoyed the Potter books immensely, I also enjoyed this series. Riordan has created interesting characters and situations. I have been enamored with Greek mythology, gods, and mortals since I was a child. In 8th grade, I devoured Edith Hamilton's \\"Mythology\\"... and I wished there had been more.I feel that I've found \\"more\\" in Rick Riordan's books which merge the mythology of the past with life of today. Most enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Greek mythology to life","review":"First of all, I am not ten years old. But my son is (and I sort of remember when I was). Having said that, this is a great book for the tween and teen reader, especially boys that have no particular attraction vampire lit. There is great action, the character development is solid, and the central idea--that mythology is real--is a fascinating premise with which to begin an adventure story for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrill Ride","review":"Percy Jackson has a lot in common with Harry Potter - both are youngsters who discover they have special powers, both are teamed with a male and female friend to form a trio for going on quests. Percy Jackson is a more modern tale than Harry Potter, but still manages to weave in the lore of the Gods of Olympus. I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it to others. Although it is written for young adult readers, adults should find it equally exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Fun to Read!","review":"This was recommended to me by a few of my students. I really enjoyed the story- I've always liked Greek Mythology so I found Rick Riordan's twist on it really entertaining.

I'm sure I would have enjoyed it if I were a little younger - the story is not very original but when I was younger I loved stories about becoming an unexpected hero. The language is pretty simple and the story doesn't really develop. I never felt like there was something I was looking forward to, it took me actual energy to keep reading it. I do think this is geared for a younger audience, with the simple language and the weird references to NYC, the empire state building, ect. I feel like if I read it younger though, it wouldn't be so bad but I wouldn't really have been in love with it.I recommend this book for people around age 13 but really no one older than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is that narrator?","review":"The narrator sounds like Paul Reubens... aka Pee-Wee Herman!!

(Yes, I know it is Jesse Bernstein narrating, and not Paul Reubens)."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent thriller series!","review":"although i wasnt sure at first this is an amazing series of books. i m not ususally keen on these kind of books but since i have recently read the maximum ride series i love books that are action packed with adventure this series is a must read along with the maximum ride series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for re-teens thru adults","review":"I preview books that I get for my nephews (10 & 11) so read this, and the other books in this series, before giving them to them. Very age appropriate with plenty of adventure to keep them engaged and entertained.I enjoyed them and my nephews loved the entire series. Great for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I've always been interested in Greek mythology, so this book caught my eye really quick! The story is extremely simple, which is not suprising since it is written for middle schoolers. But, it was a fun and fast read. My only issues were the ease in which the problems were solved and the mythology presented in the book. For example, why would a 6th grader be able to take out a minotaur so easily? And then beat Ares, the God of War, in a battle? There was also a lot of mythology introduced in this book, with little explanation behind it. I knew most if because I've studied Greek mythology in high school and in college. But, how much of this would the average middle schooler know? Still, a very fun way to introduce mythology to young readers! I'll continue on with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lightning Thief, film edition.

The plot is great, the characters amazing, and the writing style is fantastically vivid. Rick Riordan's book sucked me, and I couldn't put it down.

It is also a story about friendship. I am fond of Greek Mythology, so I would highly suggest this awesome book. It has a great ending. Like lots of books, it leaves you hanging-wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC BOOK","review":"The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan was an exceptional book. I would rate it a 5 out of 5. The main character, Persy, finds out that he is the son of the mythological God Poseidon and he is charged with stopping a war BEFORE it starts. It appears that most, if not all of the mythological creatures in Percey's textbook come to life. Not all the God's like Percy as he is suspected of stealing from Zeus. He has limited time to find Zeus' stolen property and bring peace. The Lightning Thief one of the most action packed books I have ever read. It is full of monsters popping out of no where and trying to kill Persey. This book will have you jumping out of your seat with excitement. It is a good book for both boys and girls and is one that will definitely get your blood flowing.Review by JP Ascolese"},{"rating":"2","title":"New and Improved Harry Potter","review":"This book is similar to harry potter in that it is fantasy, the main character doesn't know what he is etc., but I believe that this book is much better. The Lightning Thief takes the magical aspect of Harry Potter and combines it with some comedy. throughout the entire book there are jokes and pranks that are up to modern times. There are also a lot of action and fight scenes to keep the book moving. The book is a very easy read and could be read by almost anyone 10+. Anyone who loves fantasy or Harry Potter will really like this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"my son devoured the whole series","review":"I didn't read this book but my 12 year old son did and loved it. He is not a big reader but read each book in the series in less than a week. Keep them comming Rick Riordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"windsor jr. high","review":"The Lightning Thief was a great book. I literally couldnt put it down. It made me think what if there really is the olympian gods. My favorite Olympian god is Poseidon because I love the ocean and I really like to swim. one of my favorite parts was when Percy, Annabeth and Grover were in the underworld and Annabeth was playing with Cerberus the 3 headed Rottweiler and he didnt want her to leave. I couldnt believe that that person would be the one to betray Percy. I cannot wait for the next book to come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Couldn't have been more of a Harry Potter rip-off if Riordan had given Percy a trident shaped scar on his forehead.

It is good for people who like fantasy or don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!!","review":"Amazing. That's the only word to describe this book!!!!!!!!! Keep it up Rick Riordan. Hurry up with House of Hades please!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and entertaining even for adults!","review":"This is a delightfully entertaining book based on the premise that the gods of Olympus still exist and have mingled their blood and talents with mortals. All is explained casually and naturally with the author's charming wit and imagination. The text of the book is such that adults will enjoy and laugh with Percy and his gang of semi-gods with different powers. Olympus is over New York City (of course) and the entrance to Hades is in Los Angeles (naturally, just the right place). This is a very sparkling and pleasant diversion from the tragedies of this past week in New Orleans."},{"rating":"1","title":"love","review":"Love the whole sereis. So amazing. Love love love it.

I bought it thinking it would be stupid. When I started reading it, it was hard to put down! I have read all the books in the series but the last one. It was so hard to put them down. But, if you don't like greek mythology then this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary...Brilliant...Magical","review":"If you like greek mythology, you will absolutly ADORE this book.

Percy jackson caught my attention because I was look for something on mythology and my sister told me about about a book she was currently reading called The Lightning Thief. When I read the first five chapters I was completey drawn to it.I could relate to percy and I admired the idea of greek ledgends mixing with moderntimes.Every page I read increased my imagination of monsters,gods,heroes,and olympus. I recommend this to parents who have kids that enjoy reading about heroes and myths"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"I have read this series four times, and i can honestly say it's the best book I've ever read.

It has a lot of actions and adventure never seems to end for Percy Annabeth the smart girl Grover the satyr. You must read this or Zeus himself will come down and say that with his thunderbolt. If you dont you'll be missing out a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gread read, but Percy can't be 12!","review":"Percy Jackson is just your average kid with a few problems: attention deficit disorder, dyslexia and monsters that appear at the most inopportune times. On top of that, he discovers he's the son of a Greek god and if he wants to enjoy his next birthday, he'd better find and return Zeus's lightning bolt. From one crisis to the next, Percy and his friends have to figure out how to survive long enough to complete their quest. Mythology, mystery, adventure and human relations - it's all here! My only issue was Percy's age. I know he's a demigod and he's gone through a lot of difficulties in his life, but some of his comments and observations did not seem like they could come from a 12 year old. I kept visualising him as 15. Otherwise, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Read","review":"Percy Jackson is the son of Posidon. Throughout the book Percy, Annabeth, and Grover go through constant adventures. From battling Meddusa to fighting off Lotus eaters this book kept me up for days. The series is a must for reading, but the movie was a rip off. It didn't follow the story line at all. Plus Percy was like the only charaster who was as described in the book. Also Luke did NOT die in the first book and he did NOT die with a water trident, either. Overall I loved this book+ series, so much I had to wresle the book away from my friend to read it (trust me, that was hard. No kidding for a black belt)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"I love this book because it brings a lot of imagination into kids' minds, imagining what they could and would do if they were (like) Percy Jackson.

Percy and his closest companions, a girl half-blood named Annabeth and a satyr named Grover set off on a quest to retrieve Zeus' missing bolt. As the clock ticks down to their deadline on the Winter Solstice, the three friends need to use all their courage and wits to conclude the hunt. In this first book of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, author Rick Riordan creates a wonderful combination of thrills, mystery, and humor. Mix it up with Greek Mythology and you've got a combination to please parents, librarians, teachers and kids!--Reviewed by Michelle Delisle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Great read!

My friend kept pushing me to read it, but I refused. She kept telling me it was better than Harry Potter. My response was \\"Nothing is better than Harry Potter!\\" I still think it is the worst series in the world even though I never read it. I still haven't read it 3 years later. Always remember nothing can defeat Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"l i g h t n i n g T h i e f","review":"This was an excellent novel. I highly suggest you read an adaption of The odyssey by Homer prior this story. The book is much more understandable afterwards. All in all Ithis book was very enjoyable and I look forward to reading the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, to say the least","review":"Riordan should keep his ideas about the inferiority of women out of his books. The formula of fantasy derring-do can be done excellently without dumbing it done or treating woman as inferiors, humiliating people in general or belittling women. The derision of women in these novels disrupts the story. The many derisive references to fools and such nullifies any mechanism of developing a \\"bad\\" character and lessens almost all of the characters. Riordan lacked the imagination to create a world without incorporating nasty attitudes that should have died an undignified death by now.Many of Riordan's phrases are like ice water in the face and paraphrasing from other better books is shameless. Bah, garbage.This was the first work by Riordan I read. Disbelieving what I read, I got the second novel to make sure the first wasn't an anomaly. Riordan gets no more of my money. One can find better fantasy from authors like Dahl, Grahame, Hiassen, Lewis, Rawn, or Lackey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"After starting the book, I discovered that 30-50 pages at a time were missing--it jumped from page 89 and then the next page was 135. This happened a few times in the book. Obviously, a publisher's reject but it was described by seller as being in very good condition.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Percy Jackson and the Olympians series review","review":"This book is another one of those amazing books which takes place nowadays, but reveals something crazy that's happening--in this case, the Greek gods are still alive!!!

This book is so well written, the characters so well developed and the story has so many plot twists, you won't want to stop. My son loves it (he's nine) and I love it just as much (I'm not nine.) My son and I actually discovered and read the second book in the series first (The Sea of Monsters). But, it really doesn't matter if you read them out of sequence. It reminds me of \\"Harry Potter\\" quite a lot. We are both hoping this is turned into a movie. It's that good.

The kid is a god and what he just forgot that he was and his name is just like that god he is like? I don't get it. Idiots!

Please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"This book is a little elementary. Also, it seems like a lot of concepts were taken from Harry Potter. I think there is even a blatent reference to the Potter novels in the book.

The underlying message loses four stars. Percy Jackson, the hero of the story, adores his supposedly-wonderful mother. She has had an affair with Percy's father. She still loves him but purposefully marries a slob, using him as a cover for her son. Percy rationalizes why it is wrong for him to kill this bum, but leaves the means to do so in his dear mother's hands. She does the dirty deed herself. This is presented in the story as clever and funny. Our hero still adores his mother. I can forgive his short-sightedness - he is a kid. Unfortunately, the author of this book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This printing of the book is a mess!","review":"I don't even know how to review this book. My son loves the story but the book is a mess. The page numbering skips from page 216 to 187 twice. The pages are out of sequence. The table of contents does not match the titles of chapters within the book. There are two chapter 14s and no chapter 16. What is going on?? I have NEVER had this problem from a mass-produced paperback. My son is very upset because now he is half-way through a great story and isn't sure his book is in the right order or has all of the original chapters. Very sloppy and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disillusioned (son of Discerning Reader)","review":"Okay, I really wanted to like this story but could only get half way through before it was so stupid I didn't want to finish it.Sure it moved along quickly, and Percy got into one scrape after another - but Aunt M for Medussa? It started out good, and I know a lot of kids liked it to the end so I'm real happy for them. I just didn't like Percy much, or Anabeth, and all that monster stuff was real lame. I like Artemis Fowl, Harry - and Ender's Game is one of my favorite books - all their characters were believable and they were smart. Percy just didn't cut it and I felt like I was in ancient history class."},{"rating":"1","title":"not original, bad story, no suspense, nothing good","review":"I hated this book. I have read many fantasy books and this was the worst of all. I would have given it a 0 star if that was possible. I thought the story was totally predictable, the descriptions were not up to the standard I would expect from a published book (more like an amateur school assignment). The characters did not have any depth and some of the main characters are obviously influenced by Harry Potter series. So in all a book where I did not like the basic story or descriptions or characters, hence nothing good about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan of Percy Jackson series","review":"I love this book that comes with few pictures are amazing.

Definitely one of my favorite books.","review":"This book was a masterpiece. The way Rick Riordan uses mythology is just insipring. I couldn't put the book down. Finished in one day that's how good it is. The only thing that i didnt love about this series is that the author foreshadows too much and that can get annoying. For example the book will say \\"it was a great plan, and it almost worked too.\\" Before telling the story of how the actual plan occured. That's the only fault i could find with this book the rest is just amazing. Definitely a great buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story--will read the others","review":"I liked this book. It can not be compared to Harry Potter they are different stories. If you go into it thinking it will be as good as the Harry Potter series you may be disappointed.I thought it was great and the premise so unique..as far as I've seen. The children of the Gods are among us and have some of the powers of their diety parent. Percy Jackson is special however because his father is Poseidon. This is very rare since Hades, Zeus and Poseidon made a pack to not father mortal children(however they have not kept their pack)."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!!","review":"i absolutely LOVE this book!!i could NOT stop reading this!i finished in less than 1 hour!

And the more I read of this series, the better I thought it was. It's not a ground-breaking story, but it's smart, inventive, quick-witted, and fun. By the end of the Lightning Thief, one is invested in the characters and has a real feel for the world Percy and his friends live in. Now, like I said, it's good, but not perfect, which I found worked to the reader's advantage. What I thought was smart about this story was that Rick Riordan left enough unsaid and open in its introduction that he was able to seamlessly embellish on the latter part of the series without it seeming forced or contrived. There was some violence in this book, but not too much, and I thought it was perfectly age-appropriate for its target audience. A great read for anyone who loves action and wants to have a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"I love this book so much! It really pulls you into the story!

They keep kids and adults entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am I the only person over ten that likes these books?","review":"I feel so awkward with all these reviews from parents about how their kids love these books so much. I'm fourteen (I started reading them when I was 12 or thirteen though) and its like one of my favorite book series ever. Every one in my school stared reading them in Elementary, but there the kind of books that don't really have an age limit. Me and my little brother (who is ten) read them together a year or two ago and we love talking about the characters and stuff. These are amazing books that you shouldn't be put off about just because you think they might be too young for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Real Shocker!!","review":"The Lightning Thief is a fantastic fantasy written by Rick Riordan. This book is about Percy and his friends' journey to the underworld to prove their innocence to the Gods and free his mother from the underworld.

I recommend this book to anyone with an good imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very exciting","review":"Percy Jackson isn't your average 12-year old. He is just ... well ... the son of Poseidon. Percy is in great danger because he was accused by the sky god, Zeus, of stealing his master lightning bolt.

If you like adventure, action, and exciting moments, then read this book. -- Thomas"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only my college mythology course had been as interesting","review":"In The Lightning Thief, Rick Riordan offers up a fun twist on ancient Greek mythology. Percy Jackson is a thoroughly modern kid with a wry sense of humour that makes his appealing to both the young and the young-at-heart. The book zips right along and although I could tell where the story was going, it had no problem holding my attention.Perhaps the most telling indication of the book's quality is the fact that I've already picked up the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lighting thief","review":"I thought it was a very good book and plot.

A friend suggested it, saying it was \\"the best book in the world\\" but when I read it I thought that is was seriously over-rated. I say that it would be great for young readers, but if you are someone looking for a book that is interesting AS WELL AS logical, I say find a different book. But nice incorporation of Greek mythology. (By the way, does anybody else wonder if the movie isn't even based off this book at all? Did the producers even read it, or just base it off the cover?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lightning Thief","review":"Percy Jackson is your average, troubled twelve year old.

On top of that, he is also being blamed for the theft of Zeus' thunderbolt. Now, he needs to go on a quest to find and return it.This is a fantastic story for the young and the young at heart.

Along the way they encounter many people including Anna Beth that helps them on their search to save his mom. The final meeting comes when Percy finds out that his father is Poseidon. This book is filled with fun and adventure that all boys and girls will enjoy. It involves his school, camp and finally the place that the Greek gods live, Mount Olympus.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure","review":"This is a very good book. I liked it because it was accurate when it came to the mythology. It was so much fun to read.

The dialogue is horrible. The author never spent any time developing his characters or setting so I feel that during his dialogue it is like one person talking to himself the entire time. In addition I fee the pacing is bad. I watched the movie first and thought it was entirely too choppy so I thought I would read the book and now I know why the movie was choppy...because the book was too. I don't see what all the hype is about. First person books are hard enough to read and when they're bad, they're really bad and when they're good they're really good. This book was simply unfinishable."},{"rating":"1","title":"PJATO","review":"I am sooo glad I got this book for free. Changing a character's name (and the names of his two best friends), the name of his school, making muggles mortals and selling rehashed stories as original ideas does not make you an author, Mr Riordan. I find it hard to believe that a supposedly reputable publishing company would allow this drivel to be available in bookstores. Save your money and just re-read the Harry Potter books since they're the same exact stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall disappointing","review":"I was somewhat captured - at first. I wanted to know more. But I could not (albeit I tried) get over the LACK OF: 1. originality, 2. good organization, 3. fluidity, and to top it all off - BAD sentence structure and repetitious style. I am left to wonder why the publishing company accepted this material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple!","review":"Has anyone else noticed how simple he's made Greek myths? And not just that, but how he's basically just rewritten them in more simplified, modern words, adding occasional references to iPods to make the book seem - pretentiously - relatable? We already know the story of Medusa, and the Titans (like a ca-gillion times), and Athena & Poseidon having a rivalry - WRITE SOMETHING NEW! Pretty amazing how he's gotten away with this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My rating is low and haven't read it yet.

Unfortunately I bought all the books based on a friend's recommendation. I will probably really enjoy them. But there is no text to speech option. Thanks Hyperion Books a subsidiary of Disney. Disney is always at the leading edge of technology for people with disabilities. And I am getting really tired of companies taking that away from books so that they can sell the audio version for 25 bucks. Thanks for pilfering more money out from disabled people who have to pay for more expensive products that accomodate them."},{"rating":"1","title":"omg","review":"i absolutely HATED this book. The writing looked like it had been written by a toddler the chapter names might of been been creative but a) they gave away the whole point of the chapter and are just stupid. Also Rick Riordan have a little sentiment i mean seriously, (my gut?)when some one dies or is hurt you dont say in my gut i knew they were severly hurt ....cant you say in my heart or something and finally he TOTALLY copied off of harry potter i mean a boy who has anger issues a side kick that is kinda slow and has red hair and a smart girl this is a really bad book.Iknow TON of people that hate it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo","review":"Children are advised to stick to Bulfinch to learn about Greek mythology. The plot of this \\"modern myth\\" is about as memorable as a EULA and about as readable as a book of poetry by preteen girls. I don't understand why everyone likes these books so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"distinctively disjointed","review":"While I realize this was written for 9-12 years old children, I still feel that this was not a well rounded adventure story. I expect the film version to be disjointed and choppy trying to quickly cram as much scenes from the book in a possible. I do not expect the book to read like a disjointed script. There is little depth, warmth, or even amazingly entertaining action scenes. I do not feel the book was however a rip off of the Harry Potter series. It is just the tried and true children's fantasy adventure story formula. The Lightening thief does not even try wow the imagination but churns out a mythology mish mash that should be entertaining and fun but just falls short. The only thing I can recommend is the adoption of a dyslexic hero, something my nephew could enjoy, however though it claims that this problem is due to half blood demi-god status of Percy. hmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read for all ages","review":"I'm like a lot of people who finished the Harry Potter series and needed something new for a daily dose of magic. After expressing to a friend on how much I love to read (but YA usually because they're quick and to the point) and in passing mentioned how I love mythology, loaned me this book. A week later, I ordered the rest of the series intrigued on what crazy shenanigans Percy Jackson would get into next.The book kept me on my toes the whole way through and just when you think it is wrapping up, a new surprise comes your way. The character development of the main character is wonderful. I wanted to link him to Harry (dark hair, green eyes) but no, Percy is much more better than Harry. He's got attitude (a New Yorker through and through)and spunk which makes Harry fade into the background.I recommend it for everyone who likes fantasy, regardless of age. It's a really fun book and I can't wait for the other three to get here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighting theif","review":"The best book ever!

Thanx."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"Rick Riordan dose a excellent job in writing the first book of Percy Jackson. He really pulls you in and makes you feel like you are not just with Percy, you ARE Percy. I was completely engaged throughout the whole book. I couldn't put my kindle down!

I love this so much that I have read it more than 3 times and still enjoyed it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story weaving ancient myths into modern times","review":"After seeing the preview for the movie, I picked up the first 3 books in this series. It was an easy book to read and the characters were likeable. The way the author combined ancient Greek myths into the story set in modern times was terrific and will probably launch many copy-cats. For being an \\"action\\" story it lagged in places, but the ending was very strong and really made me look forward to reading the next book in the series. I liked that the author made Percy's ADHD and dyslexia assets and \\"explained\\" the need/existence of the \\"disorders\\" (just as the original myths explained the unexplainable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Idea, Good Execution","review":"Perhaps I'm a bit biased about this book, considering I'm a sucker for Greek mythology. The modernization of the Greek gods was masterful, and I found myself enjoying the humorous allusions tremendously. The plot was also excellent, with an unexpected twist in the end that leaves us on the edge of our seat for the sequel. Percy himself comes off as quite funny; he's a normal, likable character that everyone can relate to. You can feel the sparks fly between him and Annabeth, and I look forward to seeing how that relationship pans out. All in all, this is a novel definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student Review from Ms. Gehrke's Class","review":"This book is full of gods, half- bloods and monsters, I do not wish to mention as they are very, very horrible. This may sound like a history book but it is definitely not. Percy (whose full name is Perseus Jackson) is a half-blood and son of one of the most powerful gods in history. He finds out when he's in water, water heals him even if he has been bit by the most poisonous things. He makes to very close friends named Annebeth and Grover along the way, when he goes to the place he shall live Camp Half Blood.This is one of my favorite books I've ever read because it is full of adventure. For example, when Zeus's master lightning bolt was stolen, they met Ares and fought him. I hope you like this book as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first step in an ever engaging journey.","review":"I purchased this book shortly after its publication in the hopes that my youngest son and I could start reading another series together (we had recently finished the Cirque du Freak series and thoroughly enjoyed it.) As much as we loved \\"Cirque,\\" the Percy Jackson and the Olympian series took us on a journey that neither of us will ever forget. Rick Riordan's seamless weaving of Greek Mythology into a coming of age teen tale made for an engaging, evolving, storyline that readers of all ages could enjoy. The ONLY reason that this particular book got 4 stars is because some of the late book in the series are actually better. I applaud the author and his ability to remain entertaining over the course of an entire series. I highly recommend this book to one and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief - Book One","review":"Have you ever wandered what happened to the Greek gods and their children? This book will explain it all. This book called the Lightning Thief, shows every angle of what happened to Percy (who got kicked out of hiss boarding school), Annabeth, and Grover to find Zeus's Lightning Bolt that someone stole. I would recommend this book to people who like Greek mythology and has special powers (for example Percy has a water power. He has a special ability to breathe in the water).The vocabulary in this book is easy to understand and it encourages young children to read. It shows them more about Greek mythology. For example, they meet Ares, God of war in his human form. He only has ten days to return the master bolt to Zeus before the summer solstice ends and everyone is standing in his way. Zeus is getting ready to fight him on the beach. Can he get the master bolt to Zeus?"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars For The Lightning Thief","review":"Percy Jackson is a 12 year old boy who finds out he is the son of Posedion, the sea god.

Worth the money any day. It is going to be a movie coming out soon. I can't wait to see it. It has the same producers that made Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets. I hope it will be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"It's ultra-fun pop at its very best.

It is more of a stropping stone using a ceramic stone at the correct angle to hone the edge of a sharp knife. It does this well. I use it after each cutting with my sharp knife to keep the keen edge on it, for that it works well. It should be advertised as a hone and not a sharpner. I bought this for sharping my knifes and was very dissapointed. I had to buy a real sharpner, but this item is handy for keeping a keen edge on my already sharp knifes.

Yes, it also sparked the Spanish horror movie era. Reality check: it's a slow moving horror film that just hasn't dated very well. It lacks the exploitation elements of later Naschy films (no nudity, mild violence) and the script is lackluster and the acting is too easy to dismiss. Naschy was inspired by the old Universal horror movies, but he really missed the mark. Universal horror films: classic. Hammer horror films: classic. '70s Spanish horror films: classic.

Being a musician and audio engineer, I was pretty amazed at how loud this little set of speakers actually got. I was playing an iPod Classic through it and the only distortion you would hear was when the iPod internal volume was high.The front has a button for \\"Surround\\" sound which when you have both sides wide open delivers a good low-end boost, making tracks sound a bit fuller. The docking piece itself held my dad's Zune and my iPod (separately) well enough, but to be honest I didn't really care if it could or not. Of course, this isn't the be-all, end-all for home or on the go audio.

The Colle rates as one of the easiest leading attacks for white to master; however, one should also note that it is unpopular among elite chess players as the average Grandmasters find this opening easily neutralized...which certainly speaks only to the opening, not the quality of the book.The attack is direct and threatening very early in its development. Lane does as high quality job defining this opening and explaining the critical variations. If you are looking merely to beat your friends, play effectively at the amateur level, or just advance your understanding of the game by learning another opening, The Ultimate Colle will prove to be very worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite useful enough for the price","review":"Lane gives a lot of variations, but he does not give much explanation to guide the player. Furthermore, there is really no need to include both Colle systems in a book on The Colle.The Koltanowski system and the Zukertort system are so different, and likely to be useful to different players, that including both in a single book is like including the Najdorf AND Dragon in the same book.I recommend _A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire_ by Aaron Summerscale instead.

There are the obvious hunks as well as some lovely surprises showing the beauty of men as diverse as Nick Adams, Wayne Gretzky, Guy Madison and Bob Conrad. Some of these guys were never household names,but their beauty is captured here.A few highlights: the full page portrait of the magnificent Rock Hudson, a full page picture of the stunning Jon-Erik Hexum who could probably be the subject of his own book ,and a great photo of James Garner (I have never seen him looking this good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"School Boring Murders","review":"Yawn.

I bought both \\"So Real\\" and \\"Mandy Moore\\" and surely had them memorized from listening to them so many times. Of course, admitting that I loved those albums shows that my taste in music as a preteen was not quite refined. However, I lost touch with Mandy in the following years, and my musical preferences grew and changed. Thankfully, Mandy has obviously grown and changed as much, if not more, than my musical taste. This cd made me glad I'd found my way back to her music. Her voice has matured, and she now has a unique sound that suits the songs she has co-written. I can honestly say there isn't a weak song in the group, and I can once again put a Mandy Moore cd on repeat.

The music overpowers her voice on most of the tracks and half the time I don't know what's she's saying.

The middle tracks such as Few Days Down and Can't You Just Adore Her have become my favorites from her album.I would recommend you give the album a chance.

The clasp is a squeeze type which makes it really easy to do up by yourself. I had to get a couple of links removed at the jewelers, but I do have pretty small wrists. Only things that could be improved are the side adjuster has a rather strange black knob on it, they should have made it silver. However it is small, so you can't really notice it. The face is definitely mother of pearl, but isn't anywhere as blue as in the picture, so just be aware of this if you are getting blue to match something else.

It doesn't just speak to female playwrights either, though the title gives that impression. It is a good point of departure that acquaints the reader with the realization that America had, and has, numerous black male and female playwrights whose writing reflects the eras in which they lived, and are living. This little gem also briefly addresses the role of black stage actors performing plays written by white playwrights.

You get what you pay for -- so I was not surprised by the very light/weak plastic and the noticable tolerances and some of the crude mechanics to hold & release the batteries.I was however disappointed by the way the shutter-release button is handled -- using the infrared sensor and a fibre cable. That means you cannot focus before taking the picture because the half-way position is not available. What were they thinking ??This cable sticks out at the side making it a ideal target for getting in the way and being damaged. And the glue to hold the cable to the camera is so weak that the cable came off within minutes even without using it.You get what you pay for is especially true for this item. Use it _ONLY_ as a battery holder and forget about the shutter release button.

As a battery holder its fine. It looks cool and it gives extra weight which some may find useful. The vertical mode? Forget it. Please forget it. You have to switch between remote control and back again PLUS you cannot use any of the custom exposure progs such as AL and EL. since your right hand (specifically thumb and forefinger)cannot be in two places at the same time can it? You have enough to think about in fast shooting without all this carry on. Utterly useless, just a marketing ploy. But like i say, it makes your camera look rather swish to those not in the know, and it does extend battery life. Worth 50 or so quid? Up to you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"All things considered, a good deal","review":"The Opteka battery grip looks and works exactly like the Hoodman, which sells for $100 more. The only advantage is that Hoodman offers a pricey modification allowing use of the vertical shutter release without the cumbersome infrared cable (which is pretty much useless). The grip serves two useful purposes: it doubles battery capacity, which means that you can shoot heavily all day without recharging, and - most importantly to me - it offers a larger grip space and balances the camera when used with longish lenses like the 80-200 or 70-200 zooms, or the 300 f4. Also, it's lightweight. The lack of a vertical shutter release is a drawback, but as another reviewer wrote, that's really Nikon's fault. All in all, the Opteka grip does what it's supposed to do at a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opteka Battery Grip","review":"This unit is fine for holding 2 camera batteries or 6 AA batteries, giving you a few power choices. But an external fiber optic cable needs to be in place when using the shutter release on the grip to send the signal from the battery grip to IR sensor of the camera. The delicate plastic tabs that connect the fiber cable to the camera's IR sensor broke within a couple of weeks, making the grip's shutter release useless (unless the cable is super-glued over the IR sensor of the camera). Since I broke these tiny pins off myself, it is not a warranty item.The unit was inexpensive and the seller was great to work with - I bought several other items from them since - but the quality of the grip is cheap and even at the low cost. If you want a vertical battery grip, your choices are few. On the positive side, the grip adds weight and mass to your camera and gives it a cool, bulky look. Before the cable flimsy connections broke off, the grip's shutter release worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin it","review":"I absolutely LOVE dispatch and recommend this album to all. \\"Bang Bang\\" has some of the better known Dispatch tuines like \\"the general\\" and \\"out loud\\" but also rocks withsofter songs like \\"small change\\". \\"mission\\" and \\"here we go\\" are faster with great lyrics you can sing along to and are sure to get you going. i especially love to listen to this CD when im running or driving- it just has a great energy.

Personal favourites of mine include track #3, \\"The General,\\"- a phenomenal song that one could listen to over and over again- and track #4, \\"Bang Bang,\\" among others.

They have nice harmonies, so I guess if you're really into that, you might think this is a great CD. In terms of production, the vocals are way up front. This is probably because there isn't much happening instrumentally. I wouldn't say the CD is BAD, exactly, but the musicianship isn't great, the lyrics don't make me pause, the band's not innovative . . .

The songs are forgettable and the production is uninspired. The band seems to wander aimlessly from jam-bandy acoustic mush, tocute, message-devoid raggae, to rock that dosen't come close to rocking. If Dispatch wants to break into the mainstream they should pick a genre, committ to it and try to bring something to it. For those of you who like good independent acoustic music, try Badly Drawn Boy or Eliott Smith and leave this for the prep schoolers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dispatch is INSANE","review":"Not only do I DJ Professionally, but I run a music video countdown show called \\"Countdown\\" out of New England.

Second- With \\"Countdown\\", I had the pleasure of meeting them and filming a performance of thiers' in Boston, MA...seeing them live and meeting them only confirmed what I had known all along, They truly are musical geniuses.I first started listening to dispatch about two years ago....As many paople did, I discovered \\"The General\\" first. That song along was comparable to many of Dave Matthews' catchy and uplifting songs. The rest of \\"Bang Bang\\" is increadible as well.

I bought my first CD in months! My son is a 19 year old in college so I have seen many groups come and go through my 50 years. He loved the song and I love it even more. In fact the whole cd is good to fantastic. I think the General should be the anthem for all the young people in the U.S. as we careen into a war with Iraq.

It also has some lovely cinematography, several engaging performances (including solid chemistry between the love interests), and rousing action.

I kept on racking my brain, trying to think of the movie I had watched on the plane, quite amazed that two hours of my life had just disappeared like that. I kept on pushing myself to remember, and I couldn't do it. It was only when I was randomly trolling the Amazon pages did I see the \\"Prince of Persia\\" DVD, and remembered that I had watched it on the plane.Anyway, that's all I really wanted to say. Oh, and the movie sucked. And one last thing: I watched it because Jake Gyllenhaal was in it, and I thought that a man so talented (he really was good in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and \\"Jarhead\\") could compensate for just about anything. But I was wrong. (Okay, I lied -- I only watched it because I was on a 13-hour flight.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, actually!","review":"I have to say, I was a little hesitant when going to see this at first, but it turned out to be fantastic!

ENTERTAINING FROM BEGINNING TO END!","review":"Reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen's 'Golden Voyage of Sinbad' without the mythical monsters, 'Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time' delivers the goods where so many of these silly costume adventures fail. A nice mix of good vs. evil story and some exciting parkour action sequences make this film very exhilarating and entertaining. I found it humorous that Ben Kingsley appropriately played a homage to Torin Thatcher who played the sorcerer in another Harryhausen classic 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad' and the inspired rip off 'Jack the Giant Killer'.Jake Gyllenhaal aptly plays the hero and all supporting characters fit as well including a colorful role for Alfred Molina. Even if you don't usually like these types of films, this one is an easy and fun ride. Recommended to all costume adventure or Harryhausen film fans.

I think they did this movie justice I was iffy when I heard Jake Gyllenhaal was doing this movie, but I'm amaze how good he was transforming into the character I even thought he looked so much. I remember playing the sands of time and think they got it down as the story line is similar with the sands, the Pronce and the Princess. Great action and amazing stunts and a wonderful story line. Would so recommend this as a watchable movie.Other than Prince of Perisa being one of my favorite games the next best thing I think is Call of Duty all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buena Película, Falla con Digital Copy","review":"Estoy muy satisfecho con la película, mis únicos puntos en contra son que el DVD no se puede reproducir en mi PC y la Copia Digital de nada me sirve ya que solo funciona dentro de los EEUU, yo soy de Perú así que \\"no tengo derecho\\" para poder verla en mi PC, felizmente que cuento con mi PS3 para poder disfrutar el material."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointing even for light entertainment","review":"Like many newer movies, such as the remake of the Time Machine and War of the Worlds, the story here takes a back seat to the well done special effects and spectacular fight scenes. The chemistry between the primary characters was a key missfire for me lacking the depth and sparkle of \\"The Mummy\\" - which puts this in an exact perspective - this movie was like watching a poorly done sequel to the Mummy movies - without either Brendan Fraser or Rachel Weiss present. I have greatly appreciated Jake Gyllenhaal in other efforts, but he was wasted here, and all of the silly outfits and god awful hair did nothing to help. Gamaal's performance reminded me of the acting depth of an early Bond girl. This movie was so dull I fell asleep before it was over...and I may never be bored enough to watch it again to see the ending. I could have had more fun if I'd thrown the $16.00 out the car window. Sorry - but that's my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't no Indiana Jones!","review":"After reading the glowing reviews listed here, I was anxious to see this exciting movie.....and boy was I glad I borrowed it instead of buying it!

Rent it, or borrow a copy, or wait for it to come on Cable. You really won't want to watch it more than once. In fact you might not even want to bother watching all of it. Ending was totally predictable. And ostrich races?? Disney are you trying to cash in on the success of Swiss Family Robinson?? Well, it didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for the entire family","review":"This is a Disney movie but adults don't let that confuse you. It is not only a children's movie. It has love, honor, battle scenes without blood gushing and scenes that are magical and transforming. The plot is good and Jake G is great as lead actor with his accent as Dustan, the Prince of Persia. Further there is comedy and romance.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays the perfect role as a cheeky, clever but still fallable hero who falls for the princess of a neighboring kingdom. Great special effects and very entertaining. I always thought 'Aladdin' was pretty lame, but this is several levels up and much more interesting. Not quite perfect, but very good.The female lead is anything but a helpless bimbo, which is refreshing, and gives Jakes character a decent run for his money.The sparring between the two is very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of 2010's Worst","review":"Despite my distaste for Jerry Bruckheimer, I actually didn't think this film looked too bad. I like Jake Gyllenhaal and I knew he had the acting chops to bring this epic video game adaptation to life. However, I'm not sure what Gyllenhaal was doing during this movie, but it certainly wasn't acting. Both him and Gemma Arterton failed to unite any sparks to carry the movie through the dull patches (and believe me, there are lots of those), and Ben Kingsley plays one of the most unconvincing villains I have seen in awhile. To me, this film seemed like the \\"Pirates of the Carribbean\\" films, but without the wit or charm of Johnny Depp's immortal Captain Jack Sparrow. If you ever wondered what it would be like if \\"Pirates\\" didn't have Depp to stir things up between the lifeless relationship between dull Will Turner and boring Elizabeth Swan, see \\"Prince of Persia\\" and you'll see it for what it is: Pure torture.See complete review at:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were These People Thinking???","review":"What in the hell were these guys thinking when they came up with the idea to do a movie about the Persian Empire?

Unfortunately,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Timeis just the latest Hollywoodized action nonsense aimed at teenagers. Far from being epic, Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton come across as a bunch of flirty teens, not as a prince and princess. The action scenes are way overdone, with Gyllenhaal's character pulling off some impossible moves. In between the action, there's almost no character development. Perhaps worst of all, even though ancient Persia should be a cinematographer's dream because of the potential for beautiful locales, the sets were pretty boring. The supposed mystical temple was located on top of a grassy knoll. Where are the rolling desserts ofLawrence of Arabia?

He had been upgrading his boaters annually at a Dexter shop in Maine. When the shop closed down, he was left with beat up old shoes that were really no longer wearable. For Christmas, I decided to surprise my better half with a pair of these shoes. (For better or for worse!) After much research, I chose the Sebago Schooner in Brown Oiled Waxy. They arrived in a timely manner without complications and they looked great. My husband was very pleased. The 12 Wide fit my husband perfectly(he thought it might be too narrow but it wasn't) and he loves the quality of the leather and the craftsmanship. Some reviewers critized the quality of these shoes. I'll have to see how they hold up to the abuse I'm sure they'll fall victim to. For now, I highly recommend these to those who are seeking a classic, quality boat shoe.

Sebago is a good brand, and these look sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoes returned","review":"I have to say that I like Sebago boat shoes. I have a narrow foot and find that Sebago is one of the few makers of boat shoes that produces one in a narrow width. Their shoes fit well, wear well and are comfortable. This was to have been my second pair of this particular style. The size was in stock and delivered promptly by Amazon. The shoe was marked appropriately, 11N, both on the box and on the shoe, however it fit like a size 12N. I had no way of knowing whether Sebago had changed their sizing model or whether this was just a fluke. Rather than reorder and go through the returning process, I felt it was more prudent to simply return the shoes and perhaps find them in a retail store where they could be tried on prior to purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoe","review":"This pair is replacing a 15 yr old pair of the same shoe, they are without a doubt the best shoe of this style made.

They are comfortable and look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Quality is Gone","review":"I am a professional sailor who goes through deck shoes like accountants go through batteries in their calculators. I have worn many pairs of Sebago and thought they were the best quality and fit. I haven't worn for a couple years because you don't see them often in stores. I just purchased two different pairs (both exactly like previous pairs) and the quality that was worth paying more for is no longer there. I have read that they are now manufactured in China, as they were manufactured in Maine. To bad...I won't be purchasing Sebagos anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wide enough","review":"These boat shoes came up when I put in the 7 EEE size. However, Sebago may consider WW the same as EEE but my feet didn't. Because I was mislead I had to pay to return the shoes. I don't think this is fair.

They are just to narrow and they misrepresent the size width! They offer a 11 EE and this is what I ordered. however they ship 11W which is way to narrow even with the shoe untied you will run over the sides if you have a wide foot. It upsets me that they do this and cost them $ when customers keep returning due to this problem. I was not smart enough to believe others that had this same problem.

The shoes I received are not WW and not even W. I dislocated several bones attached to my cuboid many years ago. I need wide shoes. If I squeeze my foot just a little it hurts. It is important to some of us that the shoes we buy are labeled correctly. And another thing - a 12W should be wider than a 9W. My point is that a foot does not just grow long. It grows long and wide.Oh by the way - the shoes look well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful shoes, but the soles wear out","review":"The soles of these shoes are very thin straight out of the box. Made of rubber, they wear fast at the balls of the feet. After a few months, as I walked over gravel, I could feel many small rocks. Also, there is no interior padding at the ball of the foot. Having said that, they are beautiful, perhaps the most beautiful of all the boat shoes. I wish that they had lasted longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"*The* Classic Boat Shoe","review":"This is a beautiful shoe. Really well made by Sebago, which is a division of Wolverine.

The story is set in Scotland and covers the Glencannon clan of Scots who fought on the losing end of the Jacobite reellion under Bonnie Prince Charlie. The characters are weak and the plot centers around lust. All in all it is a rather stupid book that really never should have found a publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a tarot deck!","review":"This \\"Mantegna Tarot\\" deck is not a tarot deck at all! It is a collection of fifty allegorical representations of things like the Platonic virtues: Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, but it does not include traditional major arcana figures like The Hanged Man. It also lacks a Minor Arcana. I have been unable to find any books or instructions on how to use this deck for divination. It has lovely Renaissance illustrations of allegorical figures, but as a tarot deck it is useless to me. I suppose one could create a way to use them for divination, but all the tarot books available are of no use for this deck. If you want a Renaissance tarot deck that can be used for divination--I would recommend the Visconti-Sforza deck instead of this. I think this would be strictly for collectors who want to see archetypal images of the Renaissance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Quality, Ethereal Beauty!","review":"This is one of the most beautiful tarot decks I have ever seen.

(As a quick note, I have been dragged to several hostess clubs while employed at a Japanese company.) The anthropology itself is pretty sloppy- the author seems oblivious to the fact that, as a westerner (before westerners became common in hostess clubs), her interactions will be extremely different from what normally happens in such clubs. The book is long on theory, but short on observation. I can not recommend it as anthropology, or as an accurate observation on Japanese sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Selections","review":"\\"War is Hell: Battle Music from the Movies\\" is far below average.

Overall I'd say it works pretty well and I have been very satisfied with it. I just put maybe 3 tbsp of coarse ground coffee in the bottom, fill it up with hot water about an inch from the top, wait a few minutes and press the plunger down.My complaints: If you let the coffee sit in the mug for a while it starts to taste funny. I think this is because all the grounds are still in the mug and affect the taste after a while even though they're trapped in the bottom. This problem is kind of inherent in the design so it's not really an issue. Also, I was surprised at how warm the outside of the mug got. It seems to keep the coffee warm long enough, but I didn't expect the outside of the mug to get so warm.Overall, neither of my problems with the mug will stop me from using it, and I would probably buy the product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"this coffee maker travels with me everywhere. it is well made and the extra shot a great hidden gem. buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Travel Press Mug!","review":"I bought this mug in red for my boyfriend, who is an avid coffee drinker.

Love the storage for another cup of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-ma-zing!","review":"Super easy to use AND you get a fantastic cup of coffee at the end that you can take with you anywhere. I did substantial research on various french press mugs - this one is the best. There's a fine mesh at the moth of the lid, so you never drink grounds (even when you use pre-ground drip coffee). The insulated mug keeps it toasty all the way through the cup. The container on the bottom is very handy for school, so I can get a second cup each day for free... Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection!!","review":"I have had one of these for years now, and have purchased several as presents. When traveling I often stay at Red Roof Inns and they frequently don't have coffee pots in the rooms. No problem with this handy mug. I put a day's grounds in the mug, another day's in the hidden storage in the base, and I am good to go for a weekend. The \\"press\\" is well made, almost no grounds get through. It makes a great cup of coffee. Hint: if you like cream and/or sugar, put it in with the grounds before you add the water and put on the lid. If you try to take the lid off and put it in after, you will get grounds in your coffee. Also works great for loose tea. One final note: if you don't have a way to heat the water, buy one of those little cup heaters-- cost just a few bucks and you will have hot water in no time flat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for what you buy it for","review":"I have been wanting for a long time to switch from coffee back to tea, but something other than Lipton.

With that and this cup makes it possible to enjoy a nice cup of tea on my drive to work. Get it, you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"The two most important things an insulated coffee mug should do is, keep the liquid hot for more than 30 minutes, and not spill out of the closed lid when jostled around in a car. Unfortunately, this mug fails on both counts. It looks good, is well made, and the ability to carry coffee grounds for another cup of coffee is very useful; however, it just doesn't keep the coffee hot for more than half an hour. If you gulp down your coffee, then I suppose this would not be a problem. I like to take my time.I used a Bodum Stainless Steel French press mug for a couple of years and it performed extremely well. It survived falling off of the roof of my car twice and still does it's job pretty well. I wanted to buy another but they do not seem to be available. I thought I'd try a different brand but now I wish I had just kept my money.Perfect the lid and work on extending the time the beverage stays hot, then you might have something here."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design and cheap materials","review":"I received one of these travel mugs in the mail and when I first removed the plunger from the mug I discovered that it was impossible to put the plunger back in because the plastic parts around the base of the plunger were being pushed out by the metal coil inside (probably meant to make the plastic more durable but actually accomplishing the opposite). I sent the mug back and received a second mug. This one had the same problem. The metal ring doubles over on itself and where it does, it pushes the plastic tabs on the plunger out. This makes it difficult (or impossible) to fit the plunger back inside the mug. I can only imagine how easily these will snap off if one is not extremely careful about fitting the plunger in the mug. I'm returning this one as well and would advise against purchasing this item unless the company changes their design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this...","review":"unless you just want a bad thermos mug. It does not make good coffee, I tried various things like putting my own filter on it - in the end there is too much coffee powder that this just does not filter out.

It could happen.","review":"Perhaps I got a dud, but the seal on the plunger mechanism is not tight. When I try to drink from the unit, drops of coffee leak out of the seal and go on my shirt.

The replacement is fine. LOOK at the inside of the rim if you can! Incidentally, the manufacturer never responded to my e-mail. Happily, I purchased one with a logo from a local franchise coffee shop and they replaced it.

It contains an original track composed of riffs and licks in the style of Nuno. Having learned a lot of Nuno's solos myself, I found the licks in here to be very much in the same style. I'll steal licks from this DVD as much as I do from Nuno himself.For those not familiar with Nuno's style, it's incredibly funky, rhythmic, and with just the right amount of shred.Andy breaks down each riff and lick at both slow and full speeds, and it includes a backing track to jam with. The one thing I wish this dvd included but doesn't is guitar tab on screen, but it's easy enough to learn from by watching it broken down note by note.I highly recommend this dvd for any guitar fans of Nuno looking to emulate his style."},{"rating":"2","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHH, LOVE IT!!!","review":"All I can say about this product is that I LOVE IT!!!!

Readers love an adventure story, so it was bound to sell no matter how ugly the tale, how ugly the man and how poorly written the piece. Chaplin suffers from the plague of late 20th century man: self-absorption. It appears at every turn of this story and at every turn in the prose. His utter disregard for his partner is horrifying. His lack of emotion in re-telling the story is unforgivable. His need to write the story is, perhaps, understandable, but his need to publish it is selfish and pathetic. It shows me he didn't learn anything about living from the death of the woman he loved.As a writer, he barely hits mediocre. I would never seek out any more of his work.

You get a huge clump on the bottom that will not move.I bought this filter with my grind and brew coffemaker and I have to say that both are becoming more trouble than they are worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from all metal filters!!","review":"Please be informed that paper filters are necessary to absorb the dangerous oil from your coffee which is called cafestol.

Now, I don't have to worry about paper waste or paper taste in my coffee. Sure there are other gold-tone filters out there, but they all cost more.In conclusion, I'm not sure what more you get for those other more pricy filters, besides a more expensive, flashy brand name, but the coffee I make with this one is without any odd flavors and doesn't have any mud in it. I'm using a medium-fine grid and have no problems at all, and I'm very happy with the value. I recommend this filter wholeheartedly for those who need a permanent #4 filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a \\"lemon.\\"","review":"My original filter developed a tiny split at the bottom in the middle, where the gold mesh pulled away from the molded plastic.

I am sure it is a great filter, problem is it is NOT the filter that goes to THIS coffee machine. So in my opinion Amazon tricked me into thinking this filter went with this coffee machine.

I never have grounds in my coffee. There is always a little darker/thicker coffee in the bottom of a good cup of coffee!As for price, $20 is NOT the actual price for this filter. $10 is the \\"real\\" price, so you are not getting a deal on Amazon especially when you add shipping (unless you are getting free shipping).

With over 58,000 holes, you can be assured no course grounds of coffee will sink to the bottom of your carafe, leaving a layer of coffee unworthy of drinking. You won't catch any floaters in your carafe either. What does this mean? This means you won't drink your savory cup of coffee not realizing these little pesky floaters. You won't get that scratchy feeling slithering down the back of your throat, itching at every breath. You won't be embarrassed to smile, knowing your teeth are free and clear of dark brown specks lodged between.

The holes are large enough for ground coffee to fall through. The one on the side is quite large, like it was not properly made and the filter material was not aligned with the plastic frame supporting it, leaving a gap between them.

There is SO much I like about them! I got them for my 1 year old nephew, and he loves to feel the different textures and play with peek-a-boos. His older 3 year old austistic brother also loves the textures, windows, and also to stack them and knock them down. He especially loves a good spell of tossing the blocks back and forth, and since they are so soft no-one gets hurt! My five year old niece uses them for stacking, walls, and pretend play. And no one in the house has to worry about stepping on a hard block and hurting their foot! I highly recommend getting this toy...heck, get two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I am not happy that you can't wash them.

No information can be found online about the safety of the foam. Since many foam products off-gas and release carcinogenic & toxic (PBDEs) chemicals, I don't want this around my baby. Especially since she is likely to put them in her mouth (sucking on the fabric and then really ingesting the foam stuff). I wish I could find out more about the material in these blocks, because they seem like they would be good for her otherwise. So few options for non-toxic soft blocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My 12 Month Old Wasn't Interest in It","review":"Looks great and I like it; however, my 12 month old got bored shortly aftwards.

I was so excited and loved them b/c they were soft, colorful and had different tectures and noises. However, my daughter never bothered with them no matter how much I played with them with her. She'd push my hand aside and try to do other things. They just became annoying because they were always on the floor and in the way (she'd toss them aside as she'd dig through her toy bin looking for things to play with). Even at 15 months, I've pulled them back out and tried to show her how to stack them etc. She wants nothing to do with them. She'd rather play with and stack my plastic containers and pots and pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier with this product!","review":"After considering several types of soft blocks for babies, I went with these and am so glad that I did. They are fantastic for joint play with my 6-month-old and he is fascinated with the different textures, sounds, and peek-a-boo windows on the colored blocks. I recommend these blocks because:1) You get more blocks (16) for your money compared to other brands.2) They are well sewn and the fabrics seem sturdy (and surface washable).3) They are actually stackable.4) Each of the 8 colored blocks have different textured fabrics on each side, windows you can open, and pleasant sounds (bells, crinkles, rattles).5) Multi-racial characters on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves these","review":"The soft foam covered blocks are great. Just the right size and they have interesting colors and pictures and make noise which the baby loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy for Babies","review":"I bought these eye-catching blocks for my infant son. He absolutely loves playing with them for several reasons - 1. He enjoys all of the different noises each block makes. 2. He vividly looks at all of the different colors and it really attracted to the black and white blocks. He loves to throw one down the hall and then crawl after it.

Worst yet, nothing is ever really resolved! There are hints that some (in fact, MOST) of the characters are not who they appear to be, but the ending does not follow through with the answers. The sad part is that the novel starts out with great promise with a biochemist discovering (very) ancient Ediacara fauna in the depths of the ocean. The author definitely should have ran with this thread instead of the one that he chose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of effort...","review":"Compared to Bear's other works, this is a relatively short novel, yet I had a hard time finishing it, nonetheless. He seems to have taken Arthur C. Clarke's example and written a story readable in a few hours, lacking depth in story and characters, just because a book with his name on it will probably sell. I can't believe the author of incredible works like Queen of Angels and The Forge of God would bother to put out a half-assed effort like this. Ultimately dissapointing. I've just bought my last Bear hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.. in this book and the author","review":"I was very disappointed is this book. I've read a number of Greg Bear novels, the Eon, Legacy and Eternity series and Darwins Radio and enjoyed all of them.This book was just boring! As other reviewers noted it started out as scifi then turned into a bad mystery/conspiracy.The ending? Very unsatisfactory considering how I had to force myself to finish the book.I don't think Greg Bear put much thought into this novel (maybe he had a book contract to satisfy). I won't be so quick to buy any of his new books after reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Files Is Greasy Kid's Stuff!","review":"I am not subject to paranoia, but this book got to me.

Whew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very sorry reader tunrs thumbs down","review":"I was a sorry reader when I got done this thing -- Bear's done better, but this feels like his agent gave him an outline to fill in, or he wrote it in a few weeks just to get through a contracted book. The coincidence factor was so high, and the characters -- particularly the women -- so bad, that I gave my copy to a library booksale. Want a good book -- try Hellspark by Janet Kagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy meets Kafka/Orwell - without the insight","review":"Bleak. Depressing.Vitals starts out in the techno-thriller genre, Tom Clancy with an X-Files twist. It turns into a bit of a mystery, then becomes increasingly hallucinogenic. The spirit of Orwell is invoked, but Bear doesn't give us Orwell's social insight. The end result is Steven King on downers.Then there's Greg Bear's view of women in this novel. It's incidentally mysogynistic; though one could argue Bear feels equal opportunity despair.There are some interesting ideas, but Bear's biology is not the equal of his physics. (The melange of villains vying to wreak havoc upon the soon-to-be shattered civilizations may include a emergent planetary bacterial intellect -- Gaia done darkly.)Unless you feel a deep need for pointless despair, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"When I heard that Greg Bear had written another contemporary bioscience fiction novel I became excited. Unfortunately, my excitement came to nothing. Vitals does not follow in the tradition of Bear's Darwin's Radio and Blood Music. Instead it is more of an action/political thriller novel with shallow characters, ambiguous conspiracies, and far-fetched science. Don't be fooled by the first few chapters of the book! Although they are fiction about science and scientists, most of the book has nothing to do with either. If Greg Bear's intention was to write a book that could bridge the gap between science fiction and political thriller he failed miserably; Vitals does not work well as either, and works worse as both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending not worth the effort","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I saw Greg Bear live (he gives great book-tour presentations; not to be missed!) and was really interested after seeing his presentation. Also, the biotechnology stuff is very well done, clearly explained, and very interesting.Unfortunately, the story is not very interesting. The characters are confusing, and the plot has an odd flow. Bear tips his hand about what is going on pretty early, and so you keep expecting some twist on that story as you plod through the middle. At the end, things are left in a very ambiguous state, with the main narrator just kind of wondering what happened, and not really sure. Since you aren't sure either, you kind of wonder why you wasted your time reading the last half of the book. Plus, Bear switches narrators a couple times during the book. The transition is disjointed, and gives the impression of a novel that needed an additional round through the editing cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one flat-lined","review":"After reading Bear's foundation sequel and Darwin's Radio, I attacked this puppy with gusto. The tempo is off from the start - taking a vascillating first-person view, swapping around main characters. About half way through, the novel turns Clancy-meets...well...I guess VC Andrews?!? In the end, I felt cheated and wanting. Given the book had promise, it's saved from a single star...but it still feels as if I'm being generous. I suggest avoiding this one and let's hope the next Bear book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time","review":"The author writes heavenly for the first 1/4th of the book; great premise and exciting action. Then - unaccountably - the rest of the book is a confusing mess with the author making every possible error a \\"thriller\\" writer can make. It is difficult to believe that the brilliant scholarship that is so evidently displayed in the beginning can denigrate into such an ineffective, rambling narrative. Either the author fell in love with himself and thought he could get away with anything - or - he is \\"on\\" something. Don't waste your time with this one. You will be inevitably disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vital Beginning, Slimy Center, Moldly Ending","review":"The beginning 1/3rd of the book has sufficiently clever plots twists and mysteries for me to unravel. Unforntately, Greg Bear introduces a rather boring 2nd character to narrate the story in the middle 1/3rd. I found this 2nd character to be too distracting from the best parts of the story. In the last 1/3rd, Greg Bear introduced too many major themes for my taste. In the end, it reminded me of my refrigerator where all the food spoiled, and everything evolved into quarrelling intelligent life forms.On the technical side, Greg Bear's mind controlling bacteria had a flaw that was insufficiently exploited. If you became infected, you could have been contolled by anyone, not just by the villains. Greg Bear made the mind control triggers too open and too vague for a science fiction book.Darwin's Radio by Greg Bear was much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops-a -daisy","review":"'Vitals' isn't on-par with 'Slant' or his more recent effort, 'Darwin's Radio'. The book starts out OK but disgorges the main plot twist almost immediately, and for the next 2/3 thickness, he rehashes, homogenizes and pasteurizes the microbe thing with a variety of rubber stamps (unusual treatment by him)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me comatose...","review":"I have previously enjoyed Bear's work and had high hopes for this one. It started off with a bang and had me hooked well into the first 100 pages.After that it devolved into some sort of mindless, psychedelic mishmash that left me wanting to burn the book. Don't you just hate it when you loathe what you're reading but can't quit?Maybe the bacteria supermind had me under it's thrall. The \\"little mothers\\" must have me tagged.don't waste your time or your money. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute disappointment","review":"Vitals is little more than an undergraduate biology research paper on bacterial evolution, peppered with an incomplete story stretched paper-thin over 330 pages. The Epilogue reads like a work-in-progress plotting tool: a timeline of events and a litany of questions Bear has, for some reason, decided to leave unanswered.There's too much good reading out there to waste time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book","review":"Greg Bear is a talented author. But this one was a dud to me. Forgiveable, given all the other thought-provoking books he wrote - esp Darwin's Radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Confusing","review":"Greg Bear is a man with a great vision in the genre of sci-fi and has written some good books like Eon and Darwin's Radio. But Vitals just falls flat. The story is confusing and there is no \\"bounce\\" to his first-person narrative. It had a promising beginning but falls apart in the middle. I stop reading after 200 pages or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"What has happened to Greg Bear? I was a bit worried after \\"Darwin's Radio,\\" which indicated a mild slide into the land of David Baldacci and Michael Crichton, but \\"Vitals\\" appears to have been authored by somebody else altogether. And not necessarily a writer. Sloppy plotting, atrcoious dialogue, ill-formed scientific concepts and a cop-out recap at the end of the book made this a huge disappointment.Don't get me wrong -- I am a fan of Bear. So who wrote this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vitals","review":"An absolutely fascinating, original biological SF premise doesn't save this book. Even Bear's mention of the South SF Bay salt lagoons, where I'd been hiking that very day, didn't produce more than a passing thrill.The problem here is the plot. It's a basic thriller plot, so there really wasn't much excuse for it falling as flat as it does. Jumps in time and POV add confusion and destroy what tension there is. The plot element of the evil, seductive blonde is lame and overdone, and it's never clear to me why the main character ceases being a threat to the secret organization that starts out by trying to discredit, then subvert, him.The characters go along with the plot: they are forgettable and flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"My first thought upon finishing the book was \\"can't this guy end a book?\\" Far-fetched premise, wholly unbelievable characters, and bad guys who can't make up their minds about how bad to be. I doubt I'll read any more by Bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Mothers are disappointed","review":"(a phrase from the book).Surprisingly disappointing after Bear's history of books that I have enjoyed. I was hoping for something as interesting as Darwin's Radio.Well, the science in this one is fairly interesting at least. But the plot reminded me of a Ludlum wannabe (or Koontz or Cussler). It's full of mysterious people, shadowy recollections, and worst of all, mean old Russians. I dunno.Bear explains a lot of science in interesting ways, and hypothesizes interesting \\"growth areas\\". Most of the relationships are fairly well explored (for this genre). It just breaks down when the action (in a guns and bombs sense) gets rolling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, VERY disappointing!","review":"Not at all typical of Bear's usual work which is lucid, well-written and coherent. This book started out quite strong but seemed to lose steam toward the final third, almost as if Bear lost interest in the novel while he was writing it. It's a shame, really, since the characters have the potential to be very interesting and the premise, while farfetched (see David Cortesi's Feb 24 review for an excellent anlysis) was involving. Coincidentally, I read _Vitals_ soon after I had read Greg Iles' _Footprints of God_. The premises are similar, but the Iles book actually ends better than does Bear's (though I'm not implying Iles' ending was very good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greg Bear Flatlines in \\"Vitals\\"","review":"\\"Vitals\\" is a disappointment. I have read and enjoyed almost everything that Greg Bear has written, and this book is way below his normally high standards. The scientific premise behind the book, that bacteria/genes can cooperate to form a super-mind, was dealt with more thoroughly in \\"Slant\\" and \\"Darwin's Radio.\\" Bear wraps this premise with a story that is meant to evoke the hardboiled detective novels of yesteryear where the protagonist is surrounded by a web of deceit and nothing is what it appears to be. However, the result is dark, clammy and paranoid. More significantly, none of the characters are likable, and some are just repellent. Also, it's obvious that \\"Vitals\\" was written in haste. I found the multiple narrators confusing, and the ending was clearly tacked on at the last minute.I know from past experience that Mr. Bear is capable of great things. I would suggest that he spend more time writing and less time listening to his editors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over edited ?","review":"It starts so well but has the feeling that it is a much longer book that has been edited, and not very well, for page number reason as there are gaps in the story that cry to be filled in. This feeling is reinforced as the author, in the epilogue, gives a timeline and brief summary of events, but too late. I have read other books by Greg Bear and they are all far better. It is a shame as it has the potential to be a great story and throughout there are great descriptive passages and the story dealing with immortality and control of people by of viruses is intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep out of reach of the clinically depressed","review":"Bear, a writer of hard science fiction with an impressive track record, crosses the blurry line into the techno-thriller novel for a novel with more than a passing resemblance to his own \\"Blood Music\\" (1986). Both science and prose style are adeptly handled, no complaints there. Unfortunately the plot he traces out is unrelentingly dark, except on those occasions when it becomes even darker.Science fiction fans who find a book's characterization at fault sometimes refer to the Eight Deadly Words -- these, when uttered by a reader, are \\"I don't CARE what happens to these people.\\" This novel is more a case of \\"I wish I HADN'T cared what happened to these people.\\" Because it's not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think I am smart enough for this book","review":"Well, what can I say? I have read many of Bear's other works and have found them all readable and enjoyable. In many of his other works, he deal with a lot of hard science, but despite this, it has always been presented in a way that allows someone not versed with the subject to follow along. This is not the case with 'Vitals'. I kept saying 'huh?' throughout the book, whenever it started in on the science. Like I said, I don't think I am smart enough for this book. In some cases it read more like a text book than it did a novel. As far as the story is concerned, I liked many parts, but the conspiracy was so complex, that by the end, I was just reading to finish the book, and hoped that it made sense to me. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual standards","review":"I love Greg Bear's books. I've read each one, at least twice. Darwins Radio made me sit and think for a long time, then I had to read it again. I am extraordinarily disappointed in Vitals though. It was all I could do to get through the book. The book is darker than any of his other books (Blood Music included) with a muddled protagonist and almost one dimensional characters. The idea of the book is intriguing, but the execution is poor and the end just happens. It seems like the end of the book is an afterthought, almost as if he had written enough and had to wrap it up in 5 pages. Too bad since it could have been great. One book won't make me give up on his writing, since the rest has been so good, but I do hope his next book will be back to his usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but will not hold setting","review":"Looks good, fits well, but will not hold setting.

Although he called himself a litigator, he was well known for never taking a case to trial (maybe 2-3 cases in his entire career). Lawyers on the other side knew they could negotiate circles around him.

But, I like these recordings for devotional use and the resonance blurs the lyrics such that they can be difficult to hear easily, and in my opinion this is too bad.

After his ludicrous predictions in his ill-fated \\"Dow 36,000\\" book, you think the guy would want to stick his head in the stand forever. Frankly, I wouldn't trust anything that Glassman, who has been accused of misusing data, has to say. If you want to improve your investing prowess, I'd suggest relying upon the recent books written by William Bernstein and Lynn O'Shaughnessy. Don't waste your money on the Secret Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book shows why Glassman has a loyal following","review":"Jim Glassman has been writing a very highly regarded investing column in the Sunday Washington Post for many years. His column has acquired almost cult status because Glassman has an uncanny knack for cutting through the mumbo jumbo and making the most complex financial issues seem simple and entertaining. This book is exactly what the beginning investor needs. It covers frontier financial topics carefully, gets the analysis correct, and makes it fun to read, even funny at times. If you have a friend or relative who wonders whether they should start playing the markets, this book is where they should start. The book does not break new academic ground, but it does make the latest findings easy to digest, and is aimed for a much more intelligent reader than many of the other popular investment books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I am a big Glassman fan, but I was very disappointed in this book. Everything I have read by the author tells me that he thinks in the long-term, but now to write a book about why investors should consider the short-term is indeed a contradiction. I read the book cover to cover and I did not find a secret. What Glassman calls a secret is basically standard investment advice that he has talked about for years. His last book Dow 36,000 looked at the market long-term and as of this writing his prediction for the Dow has not come true! There is really no secret to good investing and what troubles me is that Mr Glassman, an experienced investor, does not know that, or maybe he does??"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stinker","review":"When you buy a book like this you take it at face value. You expect there to be a secret code and you will be a better investor for it. Not so! I guess I was a little naive to think that this book would make me a better investor.

Like Mr. Glassman's first book, Dow 36,000, this one is hypothetical in nature. I think investors need more information about investing that will make them money, instead of books like this that offer little solid information. On a brighter note, the book does give some basic facts on investing, but I have read such facts many times before. In sum, I found the book hard to understand and hard to follow.

There is no secret code and if there was I don't think a writer like Mr. Glassman would know about it. The writing is average, label-like reading that won't win any literary prizes. But the key element that I found most discouraging was what was not in the book. There is no new information here that makes the book a buy. You would think there would be since the information, at least from what I gleaned from the title, has been a secret thus far.

Worse, the pictures are disturbingly bizarre and creepy. I ripped page 78 out of the book to avoid having to see it again. This may the most comprehensive work available on the subject, but let's hope the 8th edition is a thorough revision - and please include a few marvelous color landscapes and fine B&W portraits that are the reasons we love the LF format.... and lose those awful distorted photographs of 1950s mannequins.

All of our previous filters had mesh sides and a solid bottom. We think perhaps, the mesh bottom on this filter releases the liquid too soon before it has had time to really steep the coffee grounds, resulting in somewhat weaker coffee.

None of them are all that difficult to dispatch but some are way rougher than others. The Puppet Master is one example and he's a pretty bad, bad tough guy to beat. He makes a great over all boss for an ongoing campaign.Easy to read. Easy to find the monster type you want. Easily adaptable to any fantasy RPG session.

As you can see from the cover, with Frank Miller's stunning rendition of a Wolf and it's Cub standing atop a mountain of bodies, this book features a MAJOR battle scene, as Ogami and Daigoro face a seemingly endless horde of Yagyu's forces. The body count is high, but the true cost of the battle is more personal: Lone Wolf is seperated from his Cub. After the stunning battle between Ogami and Retsudo Yagyu himself, I was wondering how the series could possibly get any better. The stories featuring Daigoro on his own showed me exactly how.

I especially liked the material on Pyrrus and the First Punic War--I was less familiar with these event than I am with the exploits of Hannibal.I liked it well enough that I just ordered his book on the Peloponnesian War (although I doubt he will match Donald Kagan's fine book on the subject...)Note: the author is not a professional historian.

Bagnall was clearly a novice at this sort of thing and it shows throughout the book. There are numerous glaring errors in detail, such as misidentifying key figures, misplacing sites and dates of events, and an almost incredible lack of sensible analysis of the reasons or importance of events. The reviewer who referred to Bagnall as a (Hannibal) hero worshipper was quite correct - Bagnall is one of those Hannibal apoligists who finds it necessary to glorfy a loser at all costs, including the cost of truth. The comments of another reviewer concerning Scipio, the true victor of the second punic war, are as misguided as Bagnall's dismal attempt to write history.

Each station begins with the traditional prayer, a short bit of scripture, and then the chosen character's answer to the question. It is a thought-provoking way to walk through the stations and one which takes the participant past ritual and into personal reveries and experiences of daily life. Children and adolescents could truly be drawn into the topic by presenting weekly stations in a dramatic way and the authors provide practical suggestions for such events.

And there are no other companies to order them from; Champion's inexpensive models also routinely fail. I do not want to buy the professional models which cost around $45-55-75 dollars. So I am stuck ordering these and returning them when they fail. And they fail often.

The watch has no second hand, which took me some getting used to as all my previous watches did have second hands. As another reviewer noted, when sized to a perfect fit the clasp does become just slightly difficult to unhook. I had to have 6 links removed because my wrists are tiny. Overall I am very pleased with the watch. I wear it every day and I think it looks great and does its job of telling the time. I'd definitely recommend it at Amazon's price. It seems to be of very high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"patty from mich","review":"I wanted this watch so much when I ordered it it said there was 2 in stock but as the days went by I notice that I didn't get confirmation on it so I called the company the watch is out of stock so when I went back to order the other one they didn't have it either so I missed out on this watch all because someone let my order just sit with no responce. I really wanted it but thats the way it is so needless to say I'm NOT HAPPY.

The company told me that they had \\"Fed Ex\\" deliver this product to my home but it never made it. \\"Fed Ex\\" claimed that they left it on my doorstep... how could you do such a thing without ensuring that someone is home to collect the item.. especially in the neighborhood that I live in.

I has a totally impractical hose on it that just doesn't work. It wouldn't stay in the tire gage and it's just awkward and non-functioning. It comes with several attachments to air up different things, which I thought sounded great, but it's just a piece of junk. Don't buy this product- you will be wasting your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both sports balls and bicycle tires","review":"I was looking for something inexpensive that could inflate children's bike tires and also sports balls. This worked perfectly for both. For eight bucks, you can't expect something that will last 20 years, but with the infrequent amount I'll need to use it, it seems plenty solid to last a while. It came with all the connectors I'll need, it is small and well organized (connectors all fit in cap), and it worked fine right out of the packaging. Yes, it is made out of plastic, not metal, but with careful and only occasional use I don't anticipate a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the versatility","review":"I already had a Zefal pump, but gave it to my sister when I gifted her my bike.Great Zefal product, I haven't used the plastic attachments for plastic items (for inflatable toys) yet, only the Schrader valve and the needle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, save your money","review":"Sorry, but I just can't think of much nice to say about this book.

It simply documents it. Further, the entire content of this book is available on Microsoft's website(a fact which I was unaware of when purchasing the book). Even worse, the book is out of date with the advent of the newest release of the API(which has some good improvements). Worst of all, if you're a C/C++/Java developer using COM/ActiveX, this book is only marginally useful as a reference, as the majority of code is in VB format(leaving out important information like typing.....a trend I hope MS reverses).

Very musical and very usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An great and insightful book","review":"I read this book several years ago. It's a wonderfully entertaining read. And while it's not a primer for Japanese culture per se, it shows in great detail the culture shock one man goes through. It just shows how alien another culture can be from someone outside of it. The part that still stands out in my mind today is the English Club at work where they insisted the writer didn't know how to properly speak english as they used some pidgin form of english and japanese!Very entertaining. Anyone who is interested in japan or their culture should pick this up and read for it's entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly American","review":"This book provides valuable insights into what the Ugly American looks like. For that insight alone I award it one star. It is also funny in places, for which I award the second star. My 35-year work experience is in the Western corporate world and this malcontent, self-obsessed, arrogant man would have been a painful employee to have at any company in any part of the world. You actually cringe for the man as you read. The Ugly American goes to a foreign country and is inconvenienced because the people don't speak English, have different customs and worldview and cannot understand his perspective and just generally won't change their foreign ways and dance to his tune. Well, he went there expressly to learn about them, their culture, insights and world views didn't he? That he could not adapt or fit in is a failing on his part, not that of his Japanese hosts. Pshaw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humourous, but lacking reality neither then nor now","review":"Having lived in Japan for several years, I found this book to be a sad assault on Japanese culture. It is definitely humourous somewhat like the movie Mr. Baseball, and certain parts did definitely happen to other foreigners in the 1980s, but overall this should not by any means serve as an introduction to Japan and its' culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A portrait of the world Jane Austen knew","review":"This book is like visiting a foreign, yet somehow familiar country. The people are familiar in their human foibles, but move in a world much more slowly paced than ours. (Although I was stunned to learn how very much wine college students consumed!)Like us, they dwell on the little things, the things that make up most of our days. It allows us to live in history, to feel what life was like 200 years ago in rural England. Without telephones, or cars, theirs was an incredibly connected society, with intricate and vast social networks.The diary is an entrancing way to understand the world before the industrial revolution. A bonus for lovers of Jane Austen - while it spans the times just before her birth, up to her early publications, it gives an in-depth view of the country society she portrays.I wonder if Nancy ever did get her red case back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic sourcebook","review":"i really liked this book. i think it expanded nicely on the basic races set up in the forgotten realms campaign setting. some of the new races i really liked, such as the Orogs and the Avariels that i remember from 2nd ed. speaking of which, they brought back probably my 2 favorite specialty classes from 2nd edition-blade singer and dwarven battlerager. granted bladesinger was in tome and blood but this version is much beefier. and some of the feats like high born drow bring the races back to their old glory. i really enjoyed all of the racial feats.most of the magic items are weak, and i was hoping for new enhancements like were brought up in magic of faerun, but oh well. overall it does what you'd think it would, it gives a gajillion options for making non-human races more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Races","review":"The information in this book is helpful but not neccessary. I enjoyed reading about elves in this book. There is a lot of info on different regions of humans, which at first I thought would be helpful, but there is too much and it limits the creative process. The art work, and I use the term loosely, is horrid, mostly the dwarves. Do not look at the pictures.

The main part of the ship comes pre-assembled, & the rest is easy. You'll just need a small Phillips head screwdriver. The directions don't mention that you have to screw in the 2 main masts (from the bottom of the ship), but I figured it out once I assembled it & had 2 screws left. It's a nicely made wooden ship, with fun details, such as a hold to keep prisoners in, as well as 2 cages with movable doors for the same purpose. My 5 year old nephew loves it. It does not come with any pirates, although they're pictured on the box, so make sure to order these separately. I ordered a few Papo ones, which work well & are the right size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a school orchestra","review":"This is a disappointing CD.

In regards to the former, in her mind, the act of voting is much less important than having the right to vote, a belief starkly contrasted by Tocqueville. By earning, she means being remunerated for labor. She says that by this definition, aristocrats and beggars cannot be true citizens because they to not earn based upon their own labor; artistocrats - based upon the efforts of others, and beggars - based upon handouts from the money of others. At times, her point is very hard to find, and at other times it seems like she just goes on and on.

Every other page talks about the same thing, about the rain and smell and peach trees. and like somebody else mentioned there was no one particular character that I really felt close to.

I agree with the reviewer who noted that there wasn't a character in the book worth caring about. I guess I felt some sympathy for Jenny Sparrow what with the horror of a daughter she had.

It is a story of three women of the magical, bewitching Sparrow family: the men they are and are not supposed to be with, townspeople who don't understand and therefore fear them, and the tricky relationships within their own family. Since the story line seemed so familiar it took a little while for the book to snare me, however, the ending is beautiful and made it all worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"As a great fan of Alice Hoffman I've read all her books many times, with a special love for Practical Magic. The books written after Practical Magic have lacked something, though I can't point out excactly what. The Probable Future however captures everything I love about Hoffman's writing - the everyday magic, the love between the characters and the beautiful description of the surroundings and Unity. Like JK Rowling (author of Harry Potter) I find the magic described in her books so natural that you don't even consider it to be supernatural. I really loved it - and cried at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"still lyrical, but ...","review":"... when did magical become meandering?

It is more believable to me that some college freshman in a creative writing class penned this dreary, repetitive tale peopled with unlikeable characters.At one point she describes a grouping of rocks where people go to make out. They get those rocks so a-sizzlin' that mosquitoes burst into flames upon landing on the rocks. I laughed myself silly - apparently human backsides are impervious to this mosquito-killing heat.I would strongly recommend you skip this particular book. Re-read Turtle Moon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, poorly written.","review":"I like historical fiction, and this story has all of the elements of a good plot. It was written in the passive voice used by so many mediocre writers, though. The prose wore me out. The editor was not paying attention. There were details that didn't flow, and character progressions that did not ring true. Will is not a believable character, and even Stella is progressed way beyond her 13 years in a short amount of time. Ms. Hoffman can certainly conceive of a good story, she just didn't tell it well this time. I may take a stab at Practical Magic, since it was well-reviewed. I wouldn't recommend this book as an introduction to Ms. Hoffman's work, though. Pick another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please! I should have stopped at 100 pages!!","review":"I chose this book based on the premise of generations of women with special \\"talents\\". I was deeply disappointed in the development of this story. Alice Hoffman spent more time describing the scent of lake water, types of rain and each character's hair than she spent on the plot. Or were those things the plot?When the opportunity arose, very near the end, to add some intrigue to the story it lasted less than two pages. There was tremendous possibility, which was ignored in order to pursue the inane and weak love triangle.I found Hoffman's repetitive descriptive style to be greatly annoying. How many times does she have to say the girl's shoulder was hurt at birth, or that the horse bolted on this path? And enough about the sound of the \\"peepers\\"!This was the first, and most likely last Alice Hoffman book I have read. What is everyone raving about???"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After truly enjoying Turtle Moon and Seventh Heaven, what a disappointment to read Probable Future.

I really enjoyed this story as it is different from any I have read. On the surface it is about one family, many generations of women all born in March and all possesing a special ability which they discover on their 13th birthday.The book goes on to tell how the Sparrow family women basically founded the town in which they lived. The locals however were fearful of the womens' 'talents' and even went so far as to drown the earliest recorded member, believing she was a witch.As the book goes on, I realized this story is about love, about judging people wrongly, about not questioning your decisions until it's too late. About living with hurt, fear, and regret. It's also about forgiveness and finding that love can heal old wounds... in fact it can do a lot and change people forever.This book is written very well and reads smoothly.

Harry Potter has matured and the spells are more intestifying which makes the book alot more intersting to read. while i was reading it i was picturing the scenes and tried to captivate in my mind what the author was trying to prove.The main idea of this story is Sirius Black escaping from prison and looking for Harry Potter. He just wants to warn him that Voldemort and Peter Pettigrew are after him and they are going to kill him. Then Harry finds out that his dad, Peter, Sir Black, and Professor Lupin were all best friends but turned on each other. Sir Black tries to explain that it was a misunderstanding.In results to the story, Sir Black was innocent and Harry found out that he was his godfather the whole time they were after him.

When I put my wrist on the wrist pad, which I now see is tilted at a forward angle, the mouse pad ahead of the wrist pad lifts up into the air. It's a see-saw effect.

This romance novel has a decent idea behind it, and a possibly fascinating story line. Here's a witch who uses her supernatural powers to help businesses flush out bad employees. There could be numerous uses for someone with these kinds of skills. But the story is slow going, and the color-by-numbers romance scenes wore on my nerves--with the heroine always pulling back at the last minute. How many times have we seen that before? The dialogue was completely unnatural and I don't know how many times the reader had to learn that the heroine didn't believe in soulmates. Okay, we get it!

Next you will notice that the hooks do not fit into the center, only along the outside edges leaving a hole in the center while hanging pots. Lastly the welds are pretty rustic with the center hoops disjointedly not meeting on the other side. They mostly connect only with the weld. I fool heartedly tried to salvage the pot rack by sanding down the brown paint and repainting it.

The only problem was that it did not have the carafe. I am extremely pleased that I could find the carafe and that it was shipped to me within about 10 to 14 days. We use it all the time, because the coffee maker is very good. The only problem is that the pour spout for this carafe is very poorly designed, and it's somewhat difficult to pour the coffee when the carafe is half full. I find that I have to remove the cover, and even then, it's not easy. This is a Cuisinart design issue, not an Amazon issue.

I will eventually try all of the techniques - when I become a better painter!The New Acrylics: Complete Guide to the New Generation of Acrylic PaintsAcrylic Revolution: New Tricks and Techniques for Working with the World's Most Versatile Medium"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful information","review":"This book was of very little use to me. I was looking for something that would explain the different uses of acrylic and how to use different techniques to achieve different outcomes but there isn't enough detail to get much help from it. Also, I wouldn't do most of the painting styles so it is hard to take anything useful from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I found the book to be very informative and, at times, inspiring. With the broad variety of styles discussed, there should be something for everyone. The works of Mr. Hook and Ms. Buel are particularly inspiring. I recommend it to any aspiring artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"There is nothing new in this book. It is a rather pedestrian approach to painting with acrylics...redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tangled my Hair","review":"This stuff tangled my hair. I'm not sure what i did wrong, but it gives such a profound buildup of product that i wasn't even used to that i just KNEW i could only attribute it to this hair lotion. Suffice to say it didn't help with detangling, and it dried my hair out and made it feel cakey. Ended up havin to wash my hair out the next day. I used it with water, so i don't know if that was the problem or what, but it was a little disappointing considering that others had given it good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need this on DVD!!","review":"This is an amazing video of all of SRV's music videos and I don't understand why it's not available on DVD.

Each vignette has an individually different flavor from a storm-filled Couldn't Stand The Weather to pubs and clubs and other gig scenes. My favorite is the Cold Shot vignette; definitely put a smile on my face as it exemplifies Stevie-humor. What a guy. If you love Stevie-stuff, this has a different flavor and will add new materials and dimensions in the pursuit of SRV fanship."},{"rating":"2","title":"SRV Priceless","review":"This is more of a request then a review.

The author just oozes old timey experience. He didn't dumb down the material. He does cover some detail of XDR and RPC, which I find rather welcome actually. Other prerequisites are expected to be met before reading the book which delves into all kinds of aspects about NFS.This fine Addison-Wesley tome is an excellently welcome reference right alongside the works of Stevens, etc. in my library.Amazon lists this as paperback-only, but I delightedly lucked into a hardbound copy from a used marketplace seller. Hooray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"An excellent book. The author listed everything you need on NFS in one book. I especially liked the fact that I could find information on authentication, XDR representation, portmapping and RPC. The book wraps everything together in a way that makes it simple for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. . .","review":"This book started as a fun look into the world of entitle-brats who wind up in the future. I thought the author's grasp of youth in the 90's was funny and insightful. Once everyone wakes up, this novel takes a definite turn for the dull and diluted. It never felt like there was much of a point to Alec's cause since he was as nasty and unlikable as everyone else around him. I kept reading because I thought there might be something to the story only to find out that no, there really wasn't, except that if you're going to make it in this particular universe you have to have extremely long toes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction readers need more books from Allen Steele","review":"While intensely binging on SciFi books in the last five months, I found myself putting aside Asimov and A.C. Clarke in order to read the too few, still available books Allen Steele has had time to write. Actually, \\"A king of infinite space\\" was the first A. Steele novel I have read, which prompted me to immediately purchase \\"The Jericho Iteration\\" and \\"The Tranquility Alternative\\". From novel to novel, Allen seems to be consistent in his delivery of suspensful and ingeniously crafted science fiction. The relentless pace of events leaves the reader gratefully exhausted but still wanting more. \\"How soon can you write another novel, Allen?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Infinite Cool...","review":"I can't recomend this book highly enough. Steele manages to paint a suitable bizarre enough picture of the future that you could see it happening. The strong science and brilliant character development, as well as some truely original and entertaining storytelling all combine to glue this book to your hands. I couldn't put it down. This is easily one of the best sci-fi books I've read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Cruel","review":"This book is as cruel to the reader as the three characters Chris, Anna and Mr Chicago are cruel to Alec, the main character. The surprise ending turned my guts inside-out. Chris, Anna and Mr Chicago all have reasons to justify how they have treated Alec, and Alec is even convinced that he may have deserved it (I personally hope that Alec is plotting his revenge). In the end, I think that Alec is by far the better person of any of them. I'm not sure, but I think the leson of the story is that any amount of cruelty can be justified. I rated this book as high as I did because it made me think long and hard about what had happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks you and Lets you down big time","review":"Pretty good for 1st 90%. Then something happened...he was late and publisher demanded he finish.....he rattled on without know the an ending. The ending is drivel.

The book description sounds fantastic! The book reality is shatteringly bad.I have never been so bored with a 'Steele' book. The plot is drawn out longer than Coney Island summer taffy. This should have been a short story.I expected insights and conclusions. What I got were a bunch of \\"high flautin\\" aliens and some space robber barons that fancied themselves pirates. Yuck!This book could have gone in so many interesting ways; too bad it avoided all of them. Save your money and buy a copy of Larry Niven's A WORLD OUT OF TIME. Same premise... handled with more style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Play Mat?","review":"I am very disappointed in this product. Had I known how very small this mat was, I would never have added it to my registry. I thought I would be able to lay my son on it for \\"tummy time\\" but even at 2 weeks old, he's twice the size of this thing. My main disappointment is that a friend purchased this item for me, I feel bad that she threw $... away. I'll make use of it by hanging it in his crib, or behind the car seat in a years time when he's in a forward facing seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be CAREFUL of sharp velcro on this toy!","review":"A cute toy (bright and cheery), but FLAWED construction. Be careful of the various small pieces of velcro on this toy!! Some of the pieces are REALLY sharp/rough!! My 7 month-old really gouged/scratched her face up by just playing with the toy normally on the floor. After this occured, I had to remove all the little velcro pieces with a seam ripper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great item for the car","review":"This is an excellent item for the car. It has given my little boy something to look at while on car rides. I think he likes the little mirror the best!

I definitely think it is a worth while product to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit small","review":"I was a bit disappointed because of size. It's a lot smaller than I expected, but that may be my fault for not looking at the dimensions. It's cute, but I really needed something bigger for my 4 month old grand-daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mat but it's not a floor playmat!","review":"I bought this mat having read the reviews and therefore I knew that I was buying something small - and it is! The description does not provide the dimensions and I haven't measurned it but it is about a one quarter of the size of a normal floor playmat.I would also say that the quality could be a little better.Having said all that it is a very useful toy that can be taken everywhere. It's easy to hang in the car and provides entertainment for the journey. We currently have ours hanging on the side of our \\"pack and play\\". Jack loves the mirror on one side and the noise from the sun flower when you press it.The folding ablility and the fact there are different features on each side is also great - lots of black and white for really young babies and colors on the other side as they get a bit older.As an addtional toy, and not a 'playmat' per se, I think this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for when you have unwanted relatives!","review":"It really makes you take a step back and analyze every type of personality and it helps to deal with every type of relative.

My mom, the laundry genius, told me how to knock out that smell. I laundered the set in laundry detergent and one cup of baking soda. It worked like a charm. No more nasty smell. Making me one happy customer. Thanks, Mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"camoulflage bedding set","review":"Great item at a fantastic price. I looked everywhere and found it here for half price.

Two weeks of light use and the adjustment strap in back was broken - the little peg was too worn to stay in the holes. So i replaced the hole-in-peg system with industrial grade selfstick velcro. Worked like a charm! A couple of weeks later, the plastic strap that attached the adjustment straps separated from the blue visor unit. Just tore off. No way to fix that. I have replaced this very light duty faceshield with a Uvex S8510 Bionic Shield, Black Matte Face Shield, Clear Polycarbonate Anti-Fog/Hardcoat Lens from Amazon. I received it a couple of days ago and i can tell you the difference in quality is immediately noticable. Spend some money, get what you really need . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did you buy a faceshield ? asked the wife....","review":"Ok, this thing came in and my wife just shook her head and asked \\"Why?\\"Well I have a wood lathe and the other day I was turning this piece and with just safety glasses I was getting a ton of fine sawdust on my face and in my mouth(don't ask) so I got this.Works great. I gave it 4 stars because the only bad part about this is the top strap has a padding part that wraps around it. It doesn't like to stay on unless you have duct tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it in the vineyard","review":"Comfortable (had it on for about an hour), flips up nicely (like a welding mask), can wear a respirator to filter air (for chimericals) under it, and keep my eye glasses on. Only complaint, I had some fogging. May want to get anti-fog for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves it's purpose well","review":"This Item gives you full face coverage as opposed to just eye protection when wacking weeds. With the eye protection only, I would still get rocks and debris kicked up into my face from the string trimmer. It is very light weight, so it's ok for extended use. The opening at the bottom allows for adequate airflow so you won't feel claustrophobic. To close off the opening just slightly tilt your head forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween 2013","review":"Starting early for Halloween 2013. The item arrived quickly and it seems like exactly what I was looking for, and good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protects Face and Eyes","review":"Tired of getting pelted in my face with debris from sawing, weed eating, etc. I knew I needed something that would provide protection better than just goggles. I purchased this mask and problem solved. My only complaints are that it is hot to wear, fogs up at times, and the headband adjustment isn't that great. I have set at the correct fitting for my head than wrapped tape around it. For the money it does what it is intended to do and I expected some nuances because of the inexpensive cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk. Headband breaks - big design flaw","review":"I have gone through two of these AO/3M face shields in less than a year, under light use in my home wood shop. In both cases the cheap plastic headband has broken at one of the pivot points (where it is attached to the visor), rendering the whole thing useless. That's because there is a big metal grommet mounted in a hole punched through the band at each pivot point, which leaves very little material surrounding it to lend strength to the headband. This weak spot is very vulnerable, resulting in early failures of the product. It's just a matter of time before the torsional forces of raising/lowering the visor will snap that part of the headband. An obvious design flaw. Don't buy this - it's junk!Another 1-star reviewer here mentioned having good results with the UVEX shield. I may switch over to that model, as the reviews look promising.Uvex S8510 Bionic Shield, Black Matte Face Shield, Clear Polycarbonate Anti-Fog/Hardcoat Lens"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a great job for the price","review":"The faceshield was easy to assemble and fits snuggly and was functional with smaller (behind the head) ear protection. I did have to bore out one of the \\"snap-in\\" holes on the top strap so that the peg would actually fit without having to apply a lot of force. I didn't mind making this modification as it was very minor and, again, the price for the value of the full-face protection is totally acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shield","review":"Have used this shield for years. The clear view and the coverage is great. It also fits well and is comfortable for extended use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot to trot","review":"I suppose this product to be good for eye protection but I wouldn't know. I purchased it for my lawn care workers to use while weed-eating but they could not use them in the heat. The face mask builds up so much heat that they could not breathe while wearing them. Needless to say they are not using them at this time. Maybe when the temps give us a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality headband","review":"I had this a few months, wore it maybe a dozen times. I liked it. I wear a XXXL hat and this fit fine.One day it rolled off my work bench and landed on the headband causing it to break. The headband is neither replaceable nor repairable.

It was what my son had requested and he was very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only the Script could have been buried...","review":"Living in Green Bay, I was excited to see the video. But excitement soon turned to pain. The acting and film work were really good, but the script was horrible. Not only wasn't it believeable in any sense, but it wasn't scary either. You knew what was going to happen. So, you don't get scared because it is believeable and you don't get scared because it isn't surprising. What's the point. There were just so many faults with the script - that no matter how good the camera work, acting, or directing were, it was painful to watch. How does a crappy script get the necessary money to be produced?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I am now convinced that people are being paid to write good reviews for crappy movies. This was just the worst. In the first 5 minutes you knew who the killer was and how the plot would play out. The music did not match any of the scenes. The acting was pathetic. The editing sucked. They should have paid me to watch this thing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Other reviewers are liars. Play a game of checkers... much more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"And yet there is an inexplicable fondness...","review":"Oh, Eric Roberts. Do you actually turn down any scripts, ever? It's reached the point where your name on the cast list is as good as Lance Henrikson's at being an indicator of a terrible movie with halfway decent video production values and one cast member who, while subsisting purely on a diet of scenery and trying not to wink at the audience, can actually act."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Fun Book","review":"This is a book I read this summer and I read it last summer. I am nine now. It was fun this time too. The book cover jacket has two unicorns on it because two unicorns come to the Fairy Circle the fairies have when they get together for Christmas. Grace is the fairy Thistle. She takes the fairies to the elf cave to find the Shell of Laughter. It is not in the cave where it is supposed to be. She goes into the dark forest with the other fairies and they find the shell. Anyone will like reading this if they get that far. They will like the elf and Tom the leprecaun because he is funny. Snickers is a hedgehog and he is funny too. I liked this book this summer because it was fun and about fairies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light on biography, heavy on film analysis.

I already knew a lot about her life (which, since she is a woman who shuns the spotlight and many of the excesses that make for good, trashy, celebrity bios...is pretty uneventful) so I really loved that so much of the book is devoted to analyzing individual films and providing behind-the-scenes info.An easy, accessible read and a fitting look at the career of an endlessly fascinating actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial and dispersed","review":"Tries to cover \\"all popular models\\" from 45 to 03, ending up with 5 pages of mostly pictures for a spring over on a CJ.

But I cannot help comparing Steve's voice of the 70's with this album, and for me(of course, this is purely personal preference), it has lost resonance and therefore the ability to be as emotionally engaging. Steve's voice is not such an issue on new albums such as 'freaks of nature'. But on this album of classic Kansas, it does not compare to the originals, and I find myself having to turn it off.

Throw in some children, her grandmother who is a duchess, and some adorable children.

I still found the door a lot easier to work with than opening up the sides of the ball and filling it that way. It isn't the biggest opening, but the ball itself isn't exactly huge either.

Fortunately her sister will eat some of the hay on the ground, but it mostly goes to waste. Since hay is so cheap, and the ball gives them something to do that makes them happy, so I don't mind.I hang the ball on the side of our C&C; cage and it stays there securely.

Bedazzled by their exoticness, she and her husband accumulated and warehoused nearly 100 animals. Hedren is totally ignorant and oblivious of the animal cruelty involved in this.It is just plain wrong to keep a wild animal for a pet, even if it is beautiful. The big cats are not domestic, not loving, and Hedren has scars to prove it. It can only be ego gratification. \\"The big cat community\\" discussed supports poaching and extinction in the wild by maintaining demand for these \\"pets\\".Avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Flatware Chest","review":"Just recieved the Reed & Barton Flatware Chest today.

I remember I was really excited about buying the Eide Norena set published by them. This lasted until Ward Marston transferred one of her recordings for his label.

His \\"personal\\" characterizations are laughable, his name-dropping is irritating, and his interpretations are more about his divorce than about the actual characters that inhabit the first book of Torah.It's not that his characterizations are offbase, but they are just tedious. Besides that does the reader really have to know that this unmarried \\"rabbi\\" is trying to decide between vasectomies and condoms for birth control methods?Great if you are unfamiliar with the book of Genesis and you want something to make you look at the Bible in an un-Sunday school fashion.

The music is very haunting, and such a lot of fun! Listen to Sweetie as he sings 'Love's Never Easy' or the beautiful ballad 'Closer than Ever' by Priya, Akaash and Sweetie. Preeya Kalidas is superb in all her songs.

Never mind that; these tunes will get you going on a sluggish day, will get your party rolling, will lift your spirits.As for the reviewer who calls this \\"Arabian\\" or \\"Middle Eastern\\" music. Hello? Bombay is in INDIA. Perhaps part of that reviewer's dislike has to do with his/her unfamiliarity with India, its music, culture, films and traditions.

As an avid backpacker and general outdoor enthusiast, I found the prospect of a blind man hiking the AT very intriguing. Overall, this was an interesting story and I found some parts to be both entertaining and inspiring. However, as a whole, it fell short of my expectations and was somewhat irritating at times. Bill Irwin is a born-again Christian who attributes God as the driving force behind him making the trip. While I find this relevant and admirable, the author constantly reminds us all how every scenario is God's work and he is but a pawn in the grand scheme. I cannot blame Mr. Irwin for expressing his beliefs, but they seemed to detract from the overall message and became repetitive and preachy at points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson love it.","review":"Colorful and entertaining.

I prefer these types of cartoons compared to the new ones-which on TV are completely inappropriate for smaller kids.

They got some of the best young players in the UK, and littered their albums with free solos.But these solos were always in the context of songs--great songs. It is not that the structure of the music had changed, as most of the jazz playing stayed within rock song confines.Which is why these tight songs hold up.

The first time I started level 2, it took me probably over 5 lives before I even got half-way through, and I'm not a novice gamer. The game is quite petulant, in that you have to go through the levels exactly their way, or you die. Not a fan, probably will try to sell the game.I wish that the ratings were more realistic.

Sonic speeds through this \\"roller coaster\\" type course that goes so quickly it's not possible to follow. And there is nothing really to do.

When you are playing as Sonic and he reaches top speed and then you hit the Rush manuever, it feels like he's going to break through the right side of your DS. The game is really really good although the bosses can be annoyingly cheap and Blaze's levels are exactly the same as Sonic's except she's not nearly as fast.This is the only game that I really enjoyed going after the Chaos Emeralds and although you might want to break your DS in half when you realize you were 3 rings short of getting the emerald and you have to do the stage all over again, it's really rewarding when you finally snag enough rings and can claim the emerald as your own.I highly recommend this game to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fun as I expected....","review":"After reading all the other reviews, I expected a great game. I have to admit, the last Sonic game I played was the Genesis one. Maybe the franchise has gone other places, but I personally just didn't like playing this game. Specifically, my biggest problem was not being able to see the levels very well. The colors are very muted and often have little contrast. One of the things I love about most other DS games (the new Super Mario Brothers, for example) is how vibrant and easy on the eyes the levels are. With this game, Sonic (or Blaze), along with the path you are running on, seems to blend into the background. That might be fine for some games, but when a game's emphasis is on speed and rapidly moving through the levels, there needs to be better visual cues. Just my 2 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"This was another gift for my husband, and he loves Sonic so he was really happy when he got this.

Also, this is the first game where I've been able to play as Blaze the Cat. While she is not as fast, it's still fun to play as her.

I had to take it partially apart and do not only \\"fine tuning\\" but some serious re-adjusting to get it just right.

Add in the parts where he talks about drug use and similiar things and it starts to make a little more sense. Still, it has useful information.>>>> UPDATE: someone gave me the advice to reread the book and upon looking at it, it is as i remember. it is a good read but he talks about dream walking with his teachers, telepathy, notes that celebacy is a sign of immaturity and avoiding dangerous spirits is just propaganda. he says he has projected images of the crypt keeper to others which scared them into avoiding him. there are useful ideas in there but take it all with a grain of salt"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not about a Ninja Master","review":"Glenn Morris' book is way out there.

As someone who grew up cattle ranching and playing bluegrass and old standards myself, I can listen to this over and over again. Great blend of mandolin,banjo, guitar and good strong vocals but not in the bluegrass way. The old time way. I can almost feel myself standing in an old dusty saloon or at a dance hall during the time period most of these songs come from. This is a must for the cowboy purist. I'd say one of the best assemblies of musicians as well; Peter Rowan,Nancy & Norman Blake,Tony Rice, Billy & Bryn Bright bring this project together very well to get the exact feel and emotions of the time.

His songs were exceptional from the very beginning, and they get better with each album. While the children are entertained in an enormous way, they are learning things that are very necessary in life.In these songs and activities, the ideas of needing and supporting each other are taught with rhythms and catchy melodies that are unforgettable. A good example of Susser's positive force and popularity with the kids is in a song on this CD, \\"We'll Figure It Out.\\" The song, with a circus-like feeling, and a positive and relentless chorus states that, 'Whatever we have to do, we'll figure it out'. And just like the kids got \\"Respect And Confidence\\" from Bobby Susser, \\"I Need You And You Need Me\\" will be very enjoyed, and quickly 'figured out'."},{"rating":"1","title":"offensive translation","review":"I am sickened to have received a translation of Quid Tibi Vis that includes the infamous \\"N\\" word.

Nope, can't do that either. The copy sounds like I'm listening to a distant radio station.

The small size makes it convenient to stick in your pocket or purse. There is an emphasis on Georgian silver and it is jam packed with important facts and clear color photos to give you a lot of pertinent information. I do have one major complaint. It does not contain a guide to English hallmarks in order to date silver. I suppose they left this out because they sell a similar pocket book containing that information.

As soon as we switched from a very diluted liquid soap to one the consistency of lotion, though, the dispenser became clogged up.

When you think about it the inexpensive Softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense. You can see when they are empty and you don't have to keep up with batteries.

My favorite topics are : what if human is not a lone species in the universe, what if a parallel word exist, what if we can traverse thru time....and so on the list continue. With a wonderful topic in hand, author can expand it to the limit. Sadly, this book IMHO does not have a good \\"sci-fi\\" topic to begin with. The author present us with a woman-emancipation cause set far in the future, but the story is shallow and boring. The mention of science & technology just happen here and there throughout the book, but doesn't convince me as a reader. Characters are black and white. It's like read novel about captain Hornblower in action deep in space. For those who love real sci-fi, please look at other else.

Honor loosely follows Horatio but both are great fictional characters and \\"The Honor of the Queen\\" will back me up on that.

The book has some interesting creatures and the potential for an interesting character or two unfortunately they never get developed in a truly meaningful way. Another downside is the overuse of magical powers. The use of magic must have some parameters or else the magic user becomes in a sense a God. When that doesn't happen it makes the story childish and whimsical which is what happens in The Runelords.This book is more suited for a younger audience or for somebody who doesn't like a darker, more realistic side to their stories. However if you want better developed characters, a story that parallels real life depicting death, pain, and suffering along with the good, and a rich detailed plot then don't waste your time with this book. Recommend George R.R. Martin or J.V. Jones instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mighty original","review":"This is a surprising fantasy book. David Farland is a great storyteller. And the story in The Runelords is worth telling. It's about Gaborn who loses his father, who was king, and has to battle for the very survival of the Earth, which is in danger because of a rival king called Raj Ahten. Luckily Gaborn is crowned the Earth king, which helps tremendously. The story has great speed and reads very easily, which is actually a good thing. There is one thing I might not like and that has to do with the world that was created. In this fantasy world of Farland it is possible to get endowments, like stamina, smelling and hearing that kind of stuff, from people who volunteer it to you. The thing I don't like about it is that it gives a person a unfair advantage over others, while he hasn't really done anything for it. That makes heroes not so heroic I think. Still, it's pretty original thinking of the autor. I might still change my mind over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing- you will laugh and you will cry. . .","review":"I love trying new authors, and when I picked up this book I never thought that I would sit down and finish it in two hours- its that good!David Farland has started something new and absolutely incredible here, a book that shouldn't be missed.

The endowments are an interesting twist. But I must agree with others that for those characters that have endowments of wit, they are remarkably stupid. I found the writing style dull and boring, and I made it only one third of the way through the book before putting it aside in disgust.

It's been years since I've enjoyed Jprdan or Goodkind's work, as those authors became long-winded and their plots went virtually nowhere in the 800 page books they were putting out.Farland's Runelords series has characters to care about, magic that's creative, and writing that's insightful and exciting. I strongly recommend this to fans of the genre.And if you like this, give Brandon Sanderson's 'Mistborn' a try as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TERRIFIC fantasy epic !","review":"I was able to read an advanced copy of \\"Runelords\\" by David Farland (Thanks Al!) and was extremely impressed. \\"Runelords\\" shows all of the elements of a great fantasy novel, combining action and adventure with a well thought-out system of magic. Farland keeps the story moving at a quick pace as he develops realistic and often moving characters. Though the setting and characters are different, \\"Runelords\\" has the same 'feel' and flare of style that I found in Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of time\\" series.

One, that the story wasn't very smooth. I sometimes felt that 'I' could have gone through and rewritten some of it to produce better dialogue and transition and I don't consider myself a talented writer. And two, I kept asking myself when is the role-playing game that goes along with this book gonna reach the stores? It just has a feel to it like David Farland is the DM for a game and is weaving every player's moves into the storyline.

So much is put on describing magic and it's abilities...the characters are not developed as much as they should be.I bought the first two books thinking the series will be good due to other reviews. I will not be reading book two or the others to follow. I WARN you to be careful with this book. You will either enjoy it or hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need a Rune patch to help with my withdrawls !","review":"This book has a unique approach to a genre that needs a boost in the ole arm. I am a Fantasy fan; I have enjoyed most all of the Author's in the genre, from Jordan to Fiest to Hobb. I have been around and this book ranks right up there for originality. It employ's the tried and true structure of Fantasy novels you have all read, so don't doubt its heritage. But the Runes approach to magic is very fresh and compelling.I blazed through all of the books in Farland's series and they are all very cohesive and true to the original story line. In other words it holds the audience's attention much better than Jordan's \\"Wheel of time\\" series did for me. I hope to see much more from Mr. Farland."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I really liked this book it kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time I read it. I strongley suggest others to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting magic,terrible editing. High-school plot,people.","review":"David Farland has potential but he needs to learn how to write a grammatical sentence, or at least get an editor that knows how. His characters don't always act realistically - several have frank multiple personality disorder. One can only suppose Mr. Farland meant their sudden rages or other inexplicabilities to be gripping, when they're really just the opposite. Plus there are many times he simply botches character development or plot devices. This reader rolled his eyes too many times at _The Runelords_ to want to read the sequel. Poor grammar, poor plot structure, poor pacing. Farland's interesting notion of granting endowments by runes is far outweighed by this book's over-abundant flaws. One guesses that the author dusted off something he wrote in high school and sent it to Tor, who published it because it's lengthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"El Stinko","review":"I will no longer listen to the person who recommended this to me.This book is standard fantasy fare, and not very well done at that. The romance is stilted and silly, the gore overdone, and the concepts strangely familiar, borrowing from everyone from Donaldson to the Dungeons and Dragons game system. He also suffers from the same problem that Joanne Bertin and Robert Jordan do in naming them: the names are either phonetically illogical and unpronouncable, or they sound dumb--who else would have thought to name the hero Gaborn?Farland's characters are plain and washed out. They are among some of the least interesting I have ever read. In addition, the plot is predictable or implausible [especially that hokey messenger thing]Save your money and buy virtually ANYONE else: Jordan, Martin, Williams, Hobb, Haydon, Lackey--ANYONE. Just skip Wolverton a.k.a Farland."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, preachy and pretentious","review":"The author came up with some interesting ideas for a world system and how magic works and it's really the only thing that makes me pick up the book and keep trying to read it (that an the fact that I bought up several books in the series thinking I'd save time having them on hand). The characters are flat and one dementional keeping to stereotypes. I'm finally almost done with the first book. Save money and if you still feel the need to read the book, borrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great","review":"At the very least, this was an entertaining book. Plenty of action and magic, as well as some interesting moral dilemmas(sp?), which set it a step above most modern fantasy. On the down side, this novel was a little cliched; i.e., young, not so powerful prince needs to save the world from Ultra-powerful evil king. This was more than compensated for by showing us that even the villain has some good in him; everything he does, he believes he does for the good of mankind.If you are a fan of epic fantasy and feel the need to start what looks like it will be a multiple tome epic, then Farland's Runelords looks like it may be one of the better choices around. It certainly doesn't compare with Tad Williams work or George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire saga, but it's a good way to entertain yourself during a few rainy afternoons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jordan watch out","review":"The first effort of David farland is one of the best fantasy books I have read in a long time, and I have read a lot of them. The story is gripping and the creation of a new type of magic is very intersting. but what sets this book apart from the rest is the fact that by the end of the book you will feel the agony with the main charaters. this book almost brought me to tears. If you are a fan of Jordan, Goodkind or Eddings read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book; realistic","review":"I first set this book down, because I felt that I had already discovered the plot. In the first chapter, it states that the earth king had leaves around his head. If you look at the cover, so does this fellow. It didn't take much to know that lead character was going to be the earth king. So, I set it down. As the evening went on, I decided to give it a try anyways. I was shocked. Wonderfully refreshing. I cannot give out to much, because it would ruin the book, but for anyone who's tired of the typical storyline, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written","review":"I was excited to start reading this series after finding Terry Goodkind torture to read but after 100 pages I had to put this book down. I almost never stop reading until the book is done but I could not continue - the writing is sooooo bad. The story is unbelievable and as another reviewer stated the magic is more of a \\"commodity\\". No one tops Robert Jordon for me although I do find Brandon Sanderson to be excellent. Read the Wheel of Time or the Mistborn Series instead of this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This... book... is... so... slow....... Great for insomniacs","review":"It took 54 pages for the lead character to meet a girl in a marketplace, and he was already there! Something like 4 paragraphs to drink a glass of wine... We get a description of the bottle, the berries, where they come from, etc... Give me a break! I feel the writer has something to say, but he needs an editor.I enjoy fantasy, but it has to move along. Plodding epics by Jordan, Goodkind, and now Farland put me to sleep. If you agree, check out David Gemmell, Weis/Hickman, Raymond Feist, and similar authors, and leave this book alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"inelegant,derivative,and predictable.","review":"This is an unfortunate excercise in epic fantasy that seems far to dependant on role playing games ( characters have amounts of strength,wit,glamour,etc. that make one think of D&D for example) to make it the least bit interesting. The charecters are flat-line dull and seem to have been created out of a handbook for fantasy genre writing. I made it through about half the book before deciding it just wasn't getting any better. If you want fantasy that has depth, complexity, passion, charecters that come alive, and - here's a concept- originality, try George R.R. Martin, C.J. Cherryh, Anne Bishop, or any one of a variety of truly imaginative scribes who make fantasy so vivid."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Sum of All Men is Zero\\"","review":"This overblown, overlong, over-praised fantasy is nothing short of amazing in its lack of logic. Even given \\"endowments\\", how, pray tell, does a horse run 80 miles an hour without ripping all its muscles to shreds? And if the rulers are getting extra endowments of \\"wit\\", why can't they manage to have boiling oil boiled in the right place at the right time -- just for starters? (The right place is not in the courtyard, then to be hauled up to the battlements, and the right time is not afternoon when you're expecting a night attack...of course it cooled!) If Raj Ahten has so much endowed \\"wit\\", why does he leave 40,000 irreplaceable magic branding irons in someone else's care? And why, oh WHY is the worst thing the author can think of to happen to a woman to lose her \\"grace\\" -- that is, her good looks? The \\"endowment\\" scenes, by the way, are almost pornographically embarrassing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!!!","review":"I had to get used to this completely different fantasy world and its characters. The names and places of Farland's world often sound queer and strange. However Mr Farland has got a brilliant writing style and I am certainly going to buy the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"I really enjoyed this books. Its not nearly as complicated as a Jordan novel, lighter and faster paced, more like one of the Recluce novels. Lots of action (the entire book covers only 4 days) and an interesting magic system. If you like a magic system that's explained, you'll really like this book. While this book is a complete story, its obviously the first in a series, and I'm certainly looking forward to more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable, despite some flaws.","review":"It's not perfect (I had some problems with certain characters). But overall its a unique and, at many times, gripping story. I look forward to the next one in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So book, but I would pass on it.","review":"I read it due to all of the previous comments, but I have to admit I was really disappointed. It started out fine, but I was bored by the middle and count not even finish it. Maybe I'm \\"too\\" used to George R. R. Martin, Stephen Donaldson and Robert Jordan, who have well developed characters and plots. This book was just too light and shallow for my preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring is not the word","review":"Well, plenty of my friends read this book and told me of it's greatness, so i thought why not and took a look. What can I say? The Sum of All Men was undoubtedly one of my most anticpated books, and undoubtedly THE most disappointing. While it did contain some good ideas as previous reviews have mentioned of the magic system- dedicates and so on, it's really quite uninspiring. The characterization...well... totally reeked, characters truly lacked any true development, and really in the end it's a load of ****. Half way through the book, I frankly fell asleep. Seriously, if you're looking for any real read that will keep you entertained for a good amount of time...STAY AWAY, this book's cliched characters will drive away the most dedicated fantasy reader. The good part about the novel? Thankfully, all 'good' things come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright in the begining, but fails quickly","review":"Typical fantasy fare, though better suited to DAW publishers rather than Tor.

The epic fantasy is my favorite thing to read, and almost never will I disapprove of a book in this category.I have found that one in a million. A fantasy book I despise. I had great hopes for Runelords; there are some reviews for it here singing its praises, and not only that, but Orson Scott Card himself has a page long glowing report. Which is why I was so astounded to find that the book was a pile of drivel.I didn't finish it. I couldn't. There was nothing redeeming; the plot was [bad], and the characters were mind numbingly stupid. I quickly found myself rooting for the Wolf Lord and wishing Gaborn and the princess would die, or at least disappear. This is the epitome of bad, cheezy, and stereotypical fantasy. The characters are all perfectly moral and amazing, not to mention beautiful, with no interesting conflicts. The review titled 'Ugh!' sums it up pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too familar","review":"Very poor start to a new fantasy series. Riddled with horrible cliché's such as \\"Time Lords \\"(how can anyone write that can get away with it after thirty years of Doctor Who?) and quasi-Arab/Indian races from hot climates. Details and description are handled in a fairy-tale kind of way in the usual medieval romantic vein, with little realism and nearly all characters beginning Princes, Kings and the like, with little mention of economics or government. The Rune Lords idea was the only sparkle in an otherwise poor showing and even then it was offered without any sense of wonder, mystery, or mystique. The \\"Days\\" were quite good too. It is these features which salvaged it from a one-star. Farland is going to be no match for George R R Martin, or Jordan in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but poorly written","review":"I was very excited to read this book based on the many glowing reviews that I have read. However, I found the book to be a poorly written, overly melodramatic piece of fluff. I found the magic system of \\"endowments\\" to be interesting, but ultimately underdeveloped, especially the obvious moral aspects involved. The writer's style was very annoying in that he continuously broke the cardinal rule of fiction writing: show, don't tell. I don't want to be told what such and such a character feels, I want to see it and experience it along with them. This style left the characters flat and lifeless. While the author made a few attempts at world-building, his efforts didn't amount to much more than namedropping. It's really too bad, because this could have been a major work of fantasy fiction, given one or two more re-writes and a decent editor. I'll pick up the sequel as a used softcover with the hopes that Mr. Farland can improve his style and make these characters live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great potential , intelligent characterisation","review":"Initially I felt the magic-concept to be rather revolting ,but once I read it , it was really well thought out . It is very realistically unpredictable . The characters were real but not soap-opera-like convoluted .The many concepts like the Days' Room of ****** ,etc were refreshingly invigorating to the mind.

The combat system is unique and the controls are almost perfect. My only complaint is the game is far to short. I beat it in a weekend of casual gaming. After two days of playing an hour here and an hour there, I beat the game. I usually get atleast a week or two out of an FPS before beating it. Still and all, Condemned is worth playing through at least once, but given it's length, it's probably a better rental than a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sega Did A Good Job","review":"I had this game for a year before I played it. This game made me jump more than RE 4 and Manhunt 1. Creepy music, dark backrounds, and a detailed storyline made for a really impressive game. I loved the save points and the subtle clues to help you out because there was not a map to guide you. A unique combat system made this game more unique then other horror games that I have played. There was SOME repetitiveness and frustration, but it was satisfying once you got past those points. I really liked the level designs in this game. The mixture of solving crimes & fighting off bad guys kept me interested from beginning to end. You will feel like a CSI agent. If you have a little patience and like horror, you will love this game.

This game had potential if the story stayed about serial killer and didn't drift off so far. The enemy stays the same through out the game except for the end boss. Your weapon selection sucks which mostly leaves you fighting with a board & nail or lead pipe because ammo cannot be collected so guns run out fast and have to be discarded. Not as fun as I hoped and I would not recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Game That Acually Scares You","review":"Are you looking for a very dark and scary game???

You cant tell who is a good person you can walk past somebody you think is good and once u walk by they are attacking you. Its amazing it gets your heart going for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Fast!!!!!!!!!","review":"I read several of the reviews about this game and got suckered into shelling out sixty bucks for it. It is ten levels long -- six bucks a level. It takes only a day to beat it. The graphics are excellent, but game play is too slow and boring. They at least could have given us another serial killer to hunt down after you catch Serial Killer X to make another ten levels or so. But then again this game is so slow and boring it wouldn't hold your attention for twenty levels -- you'd be selling it on Amazon just like I'm going to do after I write this. This game just doesn't have much going for it other than being pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good game until the end","review":"I liked this game, even though it was basically the same thing over and over but it was still enjoyable until the end. This is the reason I'm giving this game a 1 star rating; at the last part when you're fighting the guy with the sword on the rooftop for some reason it would let me pick up the health but it wouldn't let me pick up the board or the small steel pipe. I tried this 12 times, the only thing it would let me do is kick so needless to say I had no weapon (besides my foot) and I could not block. I took the game out and threw it away (glad I only paid $10 for it). That part right there made this one of the worst games I ever played. I do recommend it if you want to kill a little time but that's about it. I was very dissapointed in that."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst game ever played.","review":"very slow moving. boring as hell. graphics suck. i only played for 10 minutes and absolutely hated it. by far the stupidest game i've ever played.

Of course, some of them were totally off-base, but others are amazingly prescient. And, in discussing the character of the Jewish state and how it ought to deal with its neighbors, Peres quotes extensively from Herzl's writings and the works of other Zionist thinkers (e.g., Ahad Ha'am).Despite the mediocre editing job, there is plenty of keen insight on issues ranging from cultural/religious/ethnic diversity to the water problem in the Middle East that make this book a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"bearsmusic30","review":"In my opinion this LP is GRADE A #1 in my book.

You can fully access the web and you can type with their setup. To access the web change your DNS number to 67.171.70.72. Next go to download in the game main menu.

Good, uncomplicated fun.Den 5 continues the stories of the Nar stones, the ones at the center of the \\"Heavy Metal\\" movie. They date back to the 80s. Corben didn't stop there, however.

Its a fun game for roleplaying, but I'm not sure Wizards had any really competant game-balancing rules lawyers actually look over the system, or maybe they didn't play test it enough. Either way, the system has a number of very minor game unbalancing things that spring up in game from time to time that require a comptetant GM to resolve.

Considering that the game designers have so little to work with, they have done a great job.That said, I'd like to mention what I do like about the game: VP/WP system, the classes (except for the Fringer), the Force powers.Besides the problem with starship combat (supplement, please), what I don't like is how lame the Dark Side is.

A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chair of The Giant","review":"Marc did a great job with this story and I will be sharing it with others and than reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appears to be of good quality, installed nicely, fit just like stock.","review":"This is a good looking water pump, (for those that care) and gave me that warm fuzzy feeling when I opened the box and inspected its quality. I bought a remanufactured water pump from the auto shop but returned it. Did not like that it had some rusty liquid on the vanes, that I could and did wipe off. I thought that if there's rust now.....well my cooling system is still very clean and I am not about to introduce any rust or fail-prone parts to it. This products looks and feels good, comes with metallic gasket which I installed with thin line of RTV on both sides. Do not want to have to do a water pump job twice due to leakage! Waiting to let the sealant dry before filling car back up with antifreeze. Will post more if any problems arise in near future. It also carries a warranty, lifetime I think, can't remember right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once great, now not so much","review":"I had a pair of last years gloves. They were great. They were comfortable, fit well, and were very durable over a year of yard work and home repairs. They finally fell apart after a year and I was happy to buy another pair of gloves.This new set didn't even last until January. In the winter my gloves don't get much abuse. I wear them as I use my snow blower and I wore them when I was doing some light work on my car. The new material on the thumbs shredded and disappeared after only a few weeks and the Velcro enclosures on the wrists do not stay attached.I liked my old product so much that I wrote CLC hoping that this was a bad batch and that I could exchange these gloves. Unfortunately, I never received a response.Once great, now don't bother. There are better alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best gloves around","review":"These gloves are great for working outdoors. I wear them when cutting firewood, hauling brush, and doing general maintenance and gardening. They are the only gloves that last a decent amount of time without tearing. The reinforced fingertips are great. I have an average size hand and the mediums fit very well. No bagginess in the fingers, so it is easy to grip tools, and to work with fencing and wiring. The gloves are machine washable but LINE DRY ONLY! Yes, I shrunk a pair... These are really great gloves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Full of Errors","review":"This was a required textbook for a graduate-level project management class I am taking. Unfortunately, it is full of mathematical errors (Our professor pointed out 4 errors during one class session alone!). The other major downfall to the book is that it is heavily skewed toward an engineering perspective of project management and does not consider a business approach. I have had better financial textbooks explain formulas to use when calculating future and present value of cash flows in a more straightforward manner than this book. If you must buy this book, buy it used and save a few dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the book.","review":"If you want to learn project management or get better at it, don't read this book. It brushes over important concepts and spends and inordinate amount of words attempting to describe the profession. It assumes detailed knowledge, gives very poor examples and, in summary, is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game that ends too early!","review":"I bought this game on a whim...I used to hate first-person shooters. However, NOLF 2 gives me hope that the FPS is moving a fun, new, and involved direction. NOLF 2 is not your typical shoot everything that moves bloodfest. The spy-spoof premise draws the player in and keeps the gameplay exciting through and through.The graphics are pretty fantastic, sound is great (you can hear the enemies coming from behind you), and controls are easy to use.The ONLY downside to this game is it ends rather suddenly and unsuspectedly. I probably spent around 15 hours to complete the game. However, the fact that this game is so fantastic and the hope of a three-quel totally redeems the ending.Pick this game up! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece","review":"The programmers who wrote this game outdid themselves. The is the most frustrating game I have played in years. I have a 2GH box with a Nvidia3 graphics card. This is the only game I own that can lockup Windows XP(SP1) to a point where a reboot is required. The levels can take a minimun of 1 to 2 minutes to load. If you enter a new level and die you get to go back to your last save(the one you purposly took). Most games at worst take you back to the begining of the level. Before these bozos make NOLF3 I sure hope they go play some other PC games and learn how to program games that live up to industry standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cate is back!","review":"If you enjoyed the hilarious shenanigans from the original NOLF, then you're going to love NOLF2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way!

What a big let down when I discovered I won't be able to play. Check the system requirements, and you'll find that your video card must support T&L (transform and lighting). Granted, my system is almost 2 yrs.old now, but with an AMD 1 gig processor, 512 mb memory, and a nvidia tnt2 video card, I've never had problems playing a game until now.

It seems that No One Lives Forever 2 and The Thing both use the same new copy protection that results in the CD being unreadable in several CDrom models such as the \\"Samsung SD-616F DVD drive\\" and \\"creative 52x cdrom\\" and I am sure there are other effected models...Oh P.S. Thus far firmware upgrades to the Cdrom hardware have not solved the problem and as of this letter Samsung has issued no information regarding firmware updates to solve this issue, their last firmware was 7/2002. With this type of issue simple game patches will not repair this either since the cdrom will not even read the CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is Cate Archer???","review":"Nicely Done Litech! I thought for a brief moment, the $10 I was thinking on buying birth control with was wasted, but thanfully I was mistaken! After a slow start, the story gets interesting. This is one Game where even if you play it in cheat mode, it wont help you much. Which I got frustrated with at the beginning, but then, actually let me play the game for longer! From Graphics to Sound, this game has it all. Value for Price? - you CANNOT go wrong!I hope the put out a Part 3 to this series!

And an AMAZING one at that. I played the full version (through about 7 missions so far....) and i must say i am floored by the beauty of the scenery, the humor of the writing, and possibly the best vocal acting and lip-syncing yet. But, let's not forget, is it fun?Absolutely!Even if you haven't played the first game you can slip into this easily. However, i would recommend playing the first game before this one so you do not miss out on any of the call-backs to the origional game. Some of them are totally hilarious. Smooth graphics on an athlon 900, 1 gig ram(pc 133)& a geforce 4 4200 video card. A little power,but nowhere near a killer rig.

It has a particular sound/video card requirement that would require an update for our pc. Unfortunately, we had to return it to Sierra for a refund. Of course, \\"Best Buy\\" would not take it back.

The mice can't escape. They do stick their noses through the wires so they have rubbed the hair off the area around their noses. I am going to get a hammock to put in the empty space in the corner. The only complaint that I have is that trying to take the \\"top\\" off, the wires are very hard to seprate from the base. I don't mind the seperation trouble as much I minded the stink from the tunnels!! I would reccomend this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUR HAMSTER GOT HER PAW CAUGHT AND HAD TO HAVE IT AMPUTATED","review":"We purchased one of the 3 story blue hamster cages a few months ago and wanted to share our a story about these cages. This morning my daughter's hamster was found with her left front paw stuck in the corner of this cage.. I had to use wire cutters to cut through the wires and pry apart the cage to release her mangled paw. We then rushed her to the vet, where she had to have her paw amputated. We went to our local PetCo and purchased a new plastic cage with no wires, after spending $234.00 at the vets to save our precious little Sunni. Please consider getting rid of the wire cages and / or recommending that the cages with no wires be used. This was a terribly traumatic morning for us, and we would not want anyone else to have to go through this.Regards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome fit and sweet design!","review":"This is a pretty badass shirt.

It's very well done, and gives a nice overview of what you're going to see on the actual ASVAB or AFCT. It even covers those weird Assembling Objects questions that are on the test now. Granted, it's a little expensive, but I think it was worth it - it certainly boosted my score. I figured it was a relatively small investment in my future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mis-representation","review":"Hamilton Watches are great. Plus its an American company.However, the Altivo ad (the company with the best price I could find on Hamilton watches) has some problems with their description - the picture shows a Khaki watch with a white dial.

She is very knowledgable of the school systems as well and how to deal with a child that might be otherwise \\"labeled\\" disruptive or different. I have taken many ideas from her book and applied them in our home and the outcome is always positive. It is comforting to know my 5 year old son is a normal, healthy, active/creative child!

Look Around For Price.","review":"I bought this set from Amazon UK and the price was about half of what you expect to pay for the US release. The discs themselves have the same pictures as it's US counterpart, but without the large titles (there are smaller titles on the edge), which can be a slight pain, but doesn't really take too long to figure out as they are all in order. For me, the content is the most important factor not a pretty cardboard box so I felt pretty good about saving $40 for having exactly the same edition.First time I have seen the Richard Donner cut of Superman and was really surprised at how much different it was to the Richard Lester version. Picture quality throughout is top notch, even Superman IV, which still is a bit of a stinker after not seeing for years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Boxset!","review":"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman in ridiculous High Def!

Including 3, 4, and Returns, which are terrible?That's really sad. The Theatrical Cut of Superman is an iconic classic, but the extra stuff that Donner added (the cheesy Lois Lane jokes, the lame \\"action\\" sequence at Luthor's lair) really detract from the original.Sometimes cuts are good cuts.Now, you CAN'T get the original theatrical cut of Superman, unless you have an old Laser Disc player. The original cut was BETTER. Better flow, less stiff bad jokes, and act three really cooked.I will NOT buy all of these terrible superman films, just to get that original Superman cut.

This is an antequated study from the 1930's that had no controls. Reading it, any nutritionist worth their salt would know the diet Pottenger fed lacked taurine which caused his problems. Why doesn't Dr. Yarnall? Now, we have that and much more in today's food. How else can generations of cats reproducing year after year and living long heathly lives on commercial diets.

We were buying one of those large rubber balls once a month because he would systematically break them apart. When I received this ball, I thought he would not play with it because he could not chew on it because it is hard plastic. Turns out that it is perfect for that reason.My parents visited at Thanksgiving and my dad taught my youngest shepherd how to \\"play soccer.\\" He loves to play so much that he will push the ball up to you and bark for you to \\"kick\\" with him.

The album opens with the appropriately-titled 'Blown It Again', but doesn't get the least bit decent to track three(the title cut). The two ensuing ballads, 'If You're Not The One' and the acoustic-framed 'He Don't Love You Like I Love You' are both first-rate tracks, but are only a sad indication of the potential that is squandered here. It would probably help slightly if Bedingfield were a better singer--he's far from bad, but not distinctive or original enough to lift the mediocre material much beyond just that.

The next is \\"girlfriend.\\" the ingenius idea of using his voice for the string part is great, and its a nice summery song. the last is \\"without the girl.\\" This song is a motown throwback, but in the best way. Other than these songs, he sounds like hes making Darren Hayes' \\"Spin\\"'s Bastard stepchild. The other songs are harsh sounding, and just not up to the lofty standards of his three good ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Artist","review":"Daniel Bedingfield has a beautiful voice.

'cuz i need your body & soul so bad that it takes my breath away\\"--just gorgeous. made me want to cry...that's another story, though. if you listen to that song on headphones it sounds as if he's whispering in your ear.)his voice is soothing and deep when it needs to be, fast and crazy when it needs to be. \\"gotta get thru this\\" is good the first time you hear it, but then you get sick of it (or at least i did). every single song is a gem, i didn't waste my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I like the songs except for Inflate My Ego.

Great crunch & distortion WITHOUT using pedals! A little buzz but that can be corrected with a noise supressor.

Nicely built as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what we don't need is another Best Of...","review":"Don't get me wrong I like the songs included and love some of the never before released to CD songs.

Well worth the money and a great value. Ronnie James has not only covered older numbers but has also written a lot of new swing that is not only hot and sultry, but is easy to dance to. Most of this CD has been written by Ronnie James and is fantastic. As a dance teacher I use his CD extensively in teaching swing and recommend it to all of my students.The music has you tapping and soon singing along.

How did \\"Monty\\", this hurdy gurdy man with a sidekick monkey, ever score the C&W; limelight?We'll never know....but one thing's for sure: anyone can make it in this one-dimensional business. If these guys can, even a howlin' cat with a two-string banjo will find himself opening for such \\"acts\\" as Toby Keith.Gentry cannot sing. Pure and simple. Face it, folks, he talk-sings his tunes, and his barroom baritone voice would sound better coming from inside a corner spittoon. Pompous, pretentious lyrics, and musical stylings and guitar riffs we've heard all too many times before, just set to different lyrics.Rosanne Cash said it herslf, and I'm quoting, it's just another \\"hat band....and it's shamelessly sexist\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does what it needs to do.","review":"The barrel on this is a bit longer that the other brand I usually use.

Since we've had a diffulcult time finding a local supplier, we found them on Amazon and have been a steady customer since. We're very pleased with the total results of our purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two of mine broke","review":"This is the best bag holder of its kind - easy to get the bags out and very sturdy bags.

I really wish they would fix this problem, because everything else is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prone to Lid Loss","review":"This product works pretty well until the lid pops off and you lose both the lid and the bags inside. This has happened to us many times. Usually we are able to retrace our steps and find the lid, but a couple of times we couldn't. Hence, we have two dispensers with missing lids. The product is cheap enough, but I wish the company would come up with a more secure mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"great when it doesn't break","review":"i appreciate the utility of this product; however, they break and appear brittle in construction. a little super glue will hold the strap to the body of this piece (the insert point for the strap is what breaks) but who wants something new to break? i mean the two that i ordered broke nearly instantaneously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is a replacement for the exact model we had for many, many years.

The song is very poignant to my wife and me as our daughter,Rebecca Oldfield,left the UK and married Montanan rancher, Warren Flynn that year. The song bridges the divide between continents and shows that love is letting go as well as holding on and will live on in our daughter's eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ranma almost ended","review":"Okay, I won't bother to review the second episode, but I personally don't care for this volume because of the first episode. One, if you're a Shampoo fan, you'll probably find the end of this episode depressing. Two, although the humorous parts were pretty funny(especially the part where Genma and Soun beat up Ranma, and then when they replay his insults to Akane), I was really distracted from them because Akane kept acting like a real b*#%# in this! I mean, she hits Ranma at least twice as much as she does in the original story, if not more! And I won't forgive her for hitting him at the end of the episode. I mean, couldn't that oblivious %^@&$#^@@^ see that Ranma was upset at himself because he made Shampoo cry!? Of course, when she just keeps provoking him and he gets angry at her, she of course, pounds him. If you like Akane, watch out for this volume, because it could ruin how you see her."},{"rating":"2","title":"One good show, one not so good","review":"The first of the two videos has Ranma trying to undo the work of Shampoo and restoring Akane's memory of him. Also, he tries to make Shampoo understand that he and girl-type Ranma are one and the same. It is funny and a little sad. The latter when he finally shows Shampoo the truth.The second of these reminds me of television sitcoms that have to make a show to meet their contracts, but don't want to put too much effort into it. As a result, you have a very quick story (Ranma training and saying he is going to China) surrounded by flashbacks of different episodes. This is a bit of a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme that shampoo Shampoo.","review":"The animation in the first episode is very good. The story of Ranma trying to reverse the Damage of Shampoo's attack on Akane is touching in a very funny way. I would have given this tape five stars but the second episode on this tape is really nothing more than a flash back episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateur production","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this tape. This production is something you might see in a college level TV class. It is disjointed, confused, with amateur production values. Now that all aside, I still would of found it tolerable, if it wasnt for the fact the narrator has the most annoying and irrritable tone of voice, I have ever heard! I can't remember one person to person, interview on board. and the tape doesnt know if it's main subject is the QM2, or the cheesy 70's like footage of RIO. Do not purchase this, there are other tapes available on each subject matter, with much higher production quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Being Asian, it's uber essential for my kids to learn how to use chopsticks.

Maybe had it been allowed to run its entire planned six-season arc it might've matured into a truly great series, but as it was, I found myself let down as time and time again what I long predicted beforehand came to pass on the screen. Where were the plot twists, where was the epic scale, where were the memorable moments? I probably expected too much because I'd heard so much praise about it (yes, Rob, once again I mean you) but rather than experiencing a shiver-inducing work of darkness, I found instead a mildly disturbing Depression-era Gothic that was more about mundane grossouts than genuine supernatural eeriness. I can forgive almost anything in a show except the very thing Carnivale was most guilty of: being boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry","review":"For a tv show that ran 2 season but was going to run for six .This show explains every thing so u now how it would have ended ,if it ran for six years must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied","review":"Some of the discs in do not play at all in any player I insert them into.

Through it all, I gave the writers credit that something more was going on below the veneer of arbitrary spookiness and inscrutability. The ending told me that I had been a sucker.Give a high school drama club a $50 million budget for costumes, sets and cgi, tell them to do something spooky and atmospheric, and you'd get something like this. Oh, and throw in a few really talented actors to highlight how bad everyone else is.The only dialogue I ever want to hear coming out of these writers again is, \\"You want fries with that?\\"Sorry for the vitriole, but I just finished watching this series last night, and I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange show !!","review":"Makes you want to keep watching just to see what happens.I would recommend this to anyone that likes weird !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Quality--Should not have been cancelled","review":"Love this series!!

Songs like \\"Poison\\" and \\"Fidelity Down\\" strike deep and get your attention. While \\"Leming\\" and \\"Southern Belle\\" provide balance on both sides of the emotional spectrum. Nothing Here To Sell is a must have for those who love to sing along with their CD's (especially in the car). The third or fourth listen is all you need to get the words right.

Because of this, even the aforementioned \\"Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,\\" gets a quick, glossed-over treatment - then it's on to the next topic. Gelbart is usually an adept comedy writer, but much of this book comes off cute and superficial. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, did Gelbart need a new Mercedes?","review":"It's as though Larry Gelbart told his editor to rummage around for some material, no matter how old and outdated, and slap together a book. What a shame. Gelbart has the credentials to deliver an insightful look at American comedy and yet he gave us an aimless, rambling, long-winded series of pages that seemed to end when the page count got high enough. If you must read this, prepare to skip half.In the half you don't skip, you will find certain nuggets of insight in this book. In most cases, though, you will learn more by reading between the lines. Without intending to, Gelbart has given us a snapshot of a once-funny comedic mind who is reduced to repackaging once-funny material. It's an approach that doesn't work in standup, and it doesn't work here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed in this book.

The editor seems to have padded out a lot of miscellaneous articles by Gelbart with jottings of his own, pages of lavish praise of Gelbart that you would think would embarrass Gelbart to be published in a book under his own name.

You just can't go wrong with Meryl Streep, and Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin also play good roles.The bits of drama are funny (Jack's new wife running off, getting pregnant with someone else's child, and coming back and expecting Jack to raise it as his own) Honestly, Jack let this happen to him, so I can't feel bad for him. The part where he says 'home sweet home' after getting back with his ex wife for one night was hilarious, I was laughing at that part.

The premise ofa self centered philander trying to worm his way back into his original family when they have already gone on with their lives, and when, if he is successful in his project, will ruin everyone's life, is not funny when played by these people.

Which is still too small for a single senior citizen, apparently, so she hires an oddly orange Steve Martin to build an extension which will be costlier and larger itself than many people's homes.Between all the perfect teeth, perfect food, perfect weather, perfect hotel suites and perfect background songs, this felt like Sex and the City III.

However if you thought Valentine's Day was another empty movie full of big name actors, then you may agree with me.I couldn't even bare to watch this movie through. I watched the first forty minutes and gave up. There just wasn't enough going on to keep my attention. It was very empty and the chemistry between the actors was just not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Romantic...","review":"Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin give an excellent performance while trying to rekindle their decomposed after-marriage relationship. It has dry humor, yet a warm, hopeful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"Meryl Streep does it again in this romantic comedy! I thought the movie was light, fun, and funny. She divorces her husband then falls in lust with him. When the family finds out, things get a little crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's funny","review":"I knew I'd really like \\"It's Complicated\\" because the cast is fantastic. This romantic comedy is about a 50-something woman, Jane (Meryl Streep) who begins having an affair with the man she divorced 10 years ago, Jake (Alec Baldwin). In addition to being extremely confused about this crazy turn of events, Jake is currently married to the woman he cheated on Jane with during their marriage. On top of that, Jane just started seeing Adam (Steve Martin), a kind architect who seems too good to be true.It's rare to see a romantic comedy about three people \\"of a certain age,\\" and that only adds to the charm of this well-executed movie. The only things I didn't like were that Jane and Jake's three children are pretty annoying, and the movie didn't have the ending I was hoping for (although the filmmakers did pick an ending that probably made the most sense). Overall, though, \\"It's Complicated\\" is a very fun movie that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie you must own!","review":"It's ComplicatedI have seen this movie 3 times and will probably watch it 3 more times.

I think Amazon should warn it's customers from abroad. this turned out to be a waste of money, including high costs of transportation. A disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"So my husband & I were a bit skeptical about seeing this movie, we debated for the longest time if we even wanted to rent it (\\"old\\" people having sex was just ew to us). So glad we finally broke down & rented it! Hilarious. We ended up buying it because it was that good :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meryl how could you?","review":"I have been a fan of Meryl Streep for her entire career. This production is so not up to her usual standards ... and it's a movie that has been made to target my demographic. All I can say is, Meryl, how COULD you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours wasted","review":"Most romantic comedies run about 90 minutes but this one dragged on for nearly two hours. Steve Martin wasn't needed in this one. Comedy? What comedy!? I will admit Alec Baldwin made watching the movie a little less boring. I could go on but this movie has already wasted two hours of my life. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT Complicated, It's AWFUL!!","review":"Should have been called \\"It's Hairbrained.\\" I don't know why I bought this film. Maybe someone mentioned that they liked it or maybe because I often like Meryl Streep films and like Steve Martin. I had just recently bought 2 of Streep's films. \\"Julie and Julia\\", the story of Julia Child with Streep and Amy Adams which I loved. And then there was \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" Streep and Anne Hathaway. A Delicious film! And uh, then there was \\"Heart Burn\\" which I bought a good while ago, but you can't go wrong with Streep, Nicholson and Nora Ephron whose films I usually like.But, oh, this film! It was awful. It was very boring, and it was stupid. And who on earth wants to see an old couple having sex, especially with Baldin's fat ass sticking out. Jeez, was that ever the worst! I threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST purchase EVER!!!","review":"I am appalled at the LACK of quality this store has! When I opened my package I noticed the DVD container was cracked. Strike 1. Then when I tried to watch this movie it jumped around, it froze, it has wavy lines going through it and 20 minutes into the movie the DVD simply stopped working! I contacted the seller a week ago and have not heard a peep out of them yet! My advice: DON'T EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the famous names fool you into thinking this is going to be a good film.","review":"The story line was very weak. Meryl Streep, I feel, is is a much better dramatic actress. She over acted throughout the whole movie. Aside from the children, who had minor roles, Steve Martin was the most natural actor in the group! I would never recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not my type of movie","review":"I like the actors in this but it was just too corny for me. I like Alec Baldwin but yuck I just didnt go for any of the romantic scenes with him...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This was such a great movie. I saw it about three times.

Meryl Streep is as good as always. Once of my favorite actresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!!!","review":"Best movie ever!!!! We have watched it multiple times and enjoy it each time. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin were amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many funny parts in the film","review":"Meryl Streep, as usual, is excellent in this film playing a woman who has been divorced from her husband for over half a dozen years and who has not had relations with a man since that event. Alec Baldwin is given third billing but appears in the movie almost as often as Streep. He plays the ex-husband, who is now somewhat fat, who took up with a young woman with an excellent figure during his marriage, and then divorced Streep to marry her. She has a son who does not get along well with Baldwin. Baldwin is now disillusioned about his marriage and wants to have an affair with Streep. Steve Martin plays a somewhat nerdy man who develops an interest in Streep. All of this is shown very early in the film, which focuses on how Streep and Baldwin interact and whether Martin will win Streep. Streep and Baldwin have three children who are about 20 years old, one of whom is engaged, and we watch their reactions to what develops. There are some very funny episodes in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Romantic Comedy!","review":"My wife and I both thought this was a good romantic comedy. Great performances by Baldwin, Streep, Martin, and Krasinski make this a fun movie to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product placement is a bit of car crash, otherwise liked it.","review":"Liked this movie, classic Meryl supported by a good cast. The' will-she, won;t she?' plot kept a bit of suspense going throughout.However the thing I most remember afterwards , is the product placement. Wow! This will date the movie I think. I counted ads for a chain of bathroom stores, a cosmetic brand, a water brand and a type of car. The car was quite amusing actually, as part of the plot involves various family members driving out of Meryl;s home, potentially leaving her alone and lonely. However plot device was ruined for me, as when we saw the car moving towards the exit, I kept thinking \`I hope the accelerator doesn't jam'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I saw this at the movie theater and did not like it! There were a few laughs, but Meryl Streep's character was smarmy and condescending and awful. The sessions with her friends almost made me hate women; they were so insipid. Alec Baldwin, whom I love on 30 Rock, and Steve Martin, usually hilarious or at least entertaining, underplayed too much until he was playing his character stoned, and that was a pretty cliche setup. Also these actors, usually good-looking, appeared so unattractive. What happened? Alec's character was probably supposed to show some wear, but the angles from which he was filmed did not favor him at all. No one could have been more pampered or more \\"perfect\\" than Meryl's character; she didn't even have to let her croissants rise. Only good thing about the movie was the guy who plays Jim on The Office, but it seemed like he was in the wrong movie. Only other good thing was I saw it with a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I looooooooove this film!!","review":"Arrived within a week, the Disc want scratched, and i just absolutely enjoyed the actors. Will shop from here again!! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 STars for the kitchen!","review":"This film was truly moronic. The only thing that kept me going was views of the house and the new kitchen. Nice, but not worth the price of admission. Alec Baldwin was a big fat slob. Why would anyone want him? He's in the entertainment business, for heaven's sake. Doesn't he understand that physical attractiveness is part of the deal?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Top 10 worst Movie Ever","review":"What a great cast with such a stupid premise. Divorce for all its pain can be funny...this one wasn't and it was evident on the confusion and pain of the children. \\"10 years ago you won't let him in the house\\" Now you're screwing him, because you're both unhappy..pretty funny....really?Wow, what jackass thought this funny?????? For the record, loved the main actors as they did their best attempt at humor, but the destruction to the other characters really turned me off to any laughter (Plot really sucked). Steve Martin's character should have run away...and would have had this been real."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Complicated","review":"Thought that this was a great way to watch come movies that I had wanted to see, but missed. Paid for the movie and could never get it to download on my computer. Glad that I only spent $2.50. Great idea, but one that I won't try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD appeared to be a bootleg/counterfeit copy! :-(","review":"When I received this DVD of \\"It's Complicated\\", I noticed that the graphics on the DVD case seemed slightly blurry and almost as if they were printed on a home printer. The disc itself inside also looked slightly off and fake somehow. Overall the whole item looked very cheaply produced for such a popular mainstream movie. To test my suspicions, I went to Target and purchased one of their DVD copies of the same film. Upon comparison, both the DVD case graphics and the DVD inside seemed much more sharp, polished, and obviously professional on the Target copy. I've never had an issue like this in the many years I've been purchasing from Amazon.com. I noticed this DVD was sold by VSource through Amazon, and NOT by Amazon directly. Nevertheless, it's disheartening that a vendor Amazon works with would sell a counterfeit copy of an item. It definitely gives me pause about purchasing anything from Amazon's other \\"sellers\\" again. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not So Complicated, Meryl Streep","review":"Kudos,I enjoyed this romantic romp through romance, failed romance, and rebirth. What an enjoyable evening I had watching this surprisingly enjoyable film. At first I had thought I was in for an extended Barilla Pasta Commercial celebrating middle aged sexuality. Although, that's a fair description of this film, that's not to say I didn't fall in love with everyone in this movie, except the pretty boy son who was too good looking to be sympathetic towards.I enjoyed the film. That being said, I was very disappointed in the ending and disagreed with it forthright. What's a matter Merryl, can't handle a little excitement? Think of your children. Five stars for the movie, 1 star for Merryl's poor selection at the end. The man you chose offers you nothing compared to what the man you didn't choose gave you. It's not that complicated, Honey."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"I didn't like the movie. The playing is good, but the message is bad - \\"don't think about anything, have fun, sleep with a married guy, and later you can think about the consequences and easily leave him\\". This movie made me feel sad and bitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"Comedy and some drama mixed in for good measure. I am not an Alec Baldwin fan but Alec and Meryl and Good ole Steve Martin are a great combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, if a little pat","review":"A sweet film about love and romance in middle-age.

I didn't give it 5 stars just for the simple fact that I tend to enjoy a workout a bit less serious. I like it when the instructors lighten up the mood while working out.

I thought I was going to get a great work out and learn some new moves but I did not. The time flew by but I felt like there was more talking then yoga. Her voice is very soothing and she inspires you to have confidence and patience with your body but definitely not a yoga dvd for weight loss.

Everything is delicious, and I love that the author includes serving suggestions with the sauces and pastas. However, be aware that there are no pictures. My other favorite cookbook is the Joy of Cooking, so I'm not bothered by the lack of pictures; it's something I'm used to. This is one of those cookbooks that I enjoy looking through and reading the recipes, comments and menus even when I'm not looking for something to make that night.Some of favorite recipes include the Tomato Sauce with Butter and Onion, Spaghetti Carbonara, and Pork Chops with Mushrooms and Cream. Amazing! Not necessarily my healthiest cookbook, but I wouldn't give it up.I've only made one thing I wasn't crazy about, and that was my own fault; I was unused to gorgonzola at the time, and the sauce was too pungent for me.

I don't remember the recipe, except that I think it had, in addition to the pasta, artichoke hearts and one other vegetable, plus cheese. The dish was delicious and I could tell by looking at it and tasting it that it was easy to make. So I bought this cookbook and have been using it ever since, and I've never been disappointed.

As the Italian Cooking Host @ Bella Online, I run out immediately to buy any book Marcella writes the minute it hits the stores. I lived in Italy for 8 years myself, and her recipes back back memories of the wonderful food experiences we had. My only complaint that includes all of Marcella's books, is that she should include pictures. Her recipes are all so great, the pictures would be truly inspiring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Italian cookbook in the world.","review":"Marcella Hazen is a kitchen goddess and this book is her gift to humankind. It is laid out in well-organized chapters with a great intro and spiced with helpful hints to make you the best Italian cook in the world. She goes into great detail on pasta making so that you can actually master delicious and tender raviolis, fettuccine and lasagna. Her pumpkin ravioli is super but I substitute sweet potatoes and use Al Capone's walnut sauce. Her risottos are just incomparable and she lays it out in such a way that you can make it right the first time.Actually, I have cooked most of the recipes in here and you cant go wrong. So get the book and an apron and go to work! Beware, the pages do kinda curl up if you get liquids on them so try to keep it out of harms way while cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fabulous cookbook","review":"Apparently this is a classic cookbook, but I only found it just before Christmas.

This cookbook should be in every cooks kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and easy to follow","review":"What more could you ask for in a cook book?

A must for anyone who loves Italian food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good techniques, but not the flavor I expected","review":"The book is very well written and it teaches very good techniques for cooking wich gives more flavor to the food. I have tried several of the recipes following the instructions as exactly as I could, but I am a bit dissapointed because they did not seem to me very tasty. I expected to obtain results similar or equal to the dishes you have at Italian restaurants, but there are only, perhaps,a few of them. However, the flavor is not bad either, and I love the techniques given, is just that I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I am an experienced cook and have been cooking Italian food for a long time. Many of the recipes in this book I have prepared more successfully from other Italian cookbooks. Marcella is unduly fussy and opinionated. She insists on cooking mince in milk for spaghetti bolognaise because of the acidity of the wine and tomatoes. It makes no difference; other reliable sources for true Bolognaise have never insisted on this. She derides North American \\"Italaian\\" sausage as anything but and enjoins her readers never to prepare any of sausage dishes with sausage containing fennel seeds. Such sausage probably did originante with an Italian cook, perhaps a family recipe. How it came to be called \\"Italian\\" sausage in America is anyone's guess. I think it's very tasty and adapatable. Her caramelized carrots will scorch too easily if one is not too careful. And her roasts that I have tried in a Creuset pot were not spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're going to buy just one Italian cookbook...","review":"If you're going to buy just one Italian cookbook, in my opinion this should be the one. The 20 odd pasta sauces alone would be enough to keep you busy and sated. Marcella Hazan's brand of cookery is not the most showy. I am constantly surprised how often I can prepare the dishes with ingredients I have on hand. If you follow her instructions carefully you'll wind up with a marvellous alchemy: the simplest ingredients yield the richest of flavors. I would definitely pay attention to her description of ingredients as our American version of some of them (parmesan and ricotta come to mind) are decidedly different from what she intends. I'll conclude by encouraging you to give the Chicken Cacciatore a go--the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only have the money for one Italian cookbook....","review":"This is it!

I use it all the time, and still haven't even tried about 3/4 of the recipes...there are just so many! It is true that some of the recipes require ingredients that are hard to find here (though I was able to make some of the recipes I can't make here while i lived in Italy). Still, there are plenty to choose from that are relatively fast, very easy, and use ingredients that are readily available in the U.S. Some of my favorite meat dishes, vegetable dishes and pasta sauces come from this book. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Italian cookbook ever","review":"Marcella Hazan's cookbooks are all great. This is the BEST. The characteristic that sets her book apart from all others is not the ingredients and not lucious looking pictures (there are no photos), but rather the important processes she describes in clear detail. I bought this as a gift for someone but have owned this version for five years and its earlier edition for 25 years and have never been disappointed. She is the best. Period. You'll never need another Italian cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy only one cookbook buy this one.","review":"This is simply the best cookbook I have ever read or used. I bought it because my attempts at Italian food were always too fussy and complicated. The recipes in this book are clear, simple and easy to follow. The results are astonishing. Every dish I have made tastes right. If I have no idea what to make for my family I page through this book for suggestions on how to use whatever is on sale. She has never let me down. I have given this book to my cooking friends and it makes a great shower gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass (on) the salt","review":"Much as I love Italian food and the preparation thereof, I often find this book frustratingly unclear in its recipes.It is also very old-fashioned as far as nutrition goes. For example, if prepared to the book's specifications, many dishes we tried tasted overwhelmingly salty to us--and we don't generally even make a conscious effort to avoid salt in our diets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"From the rave reviews this cook book has gotten both here and elsewhere I had thought that I was buying the best Italian cookbook on Earth. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This book may be wonderful to some, but it's certainly not what I was looking for. Out of the whole book I found maybe 2 or 3 recipes that I MAY try and that's about it. Great book if you're looking for Italian seafood recipes, which I was not. Tastes may differ, but for me this purchase was a disappointment.If you're looking for recipes as basic as what this cookbook offers, just do a couple searches on google."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one cookbook you should own","review":"If you have only one cookbook, as other reviewers have also said, this is the one to have. The best thing about this book is that absolutely every recipe turns out wonderfully. I own lots of cookbooks and am often on the epicurious website and must say that that is very rare. I have made about half the recipes in the book and hope to finish all of them within the next year. A winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for relaxing","review":"If you want an evening of relaxing just put in this DVD and watch the beautiful nature photography while listening to some wonderful classical music.

I was very much surprised and totally pleased with Cooper's writing style. I have been under the impression that only the most popular writers 'knew how to write'. I can honestly say that I was not correct in this assumption.

While attending that school, I complained to the director of education about how INCOMPLETE it was. It is very technical, has terrible pictures, and is badly in need of an update. I suggested to the school that they contract Hugo Wilson to write their next book (British writer, his books have fantastic illustrations.) In case you are wondering, despite the textbook, MMI is an excellent place to learn to fix motorcycles."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK!","review":"This was quite possibly the most disgusting book I've ever read.None of the characters were likeable. I couldn't really root for any of them except maybe Nathan. Bobby was an idiot, Catherine was too messed up for words and caused her son to be equally messed up, and the grandparents (!).I picked this book up because I like the Survivor's Club. That wasn't exactly a children's book but this one was far too dark to be enjoyable. I finished it not so much to find out what happened as to just get the whole experience over and done. It's the first book I've ever read that made me want to take a shower after finishing it.That having been said, I still have hopes for some of Gardner's other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I know that all the other reviewers rated this book as excellent, but for some reason, I could not get into this book.Gardner is trying to draw out her characters and I believe that she is overdoing it. She spends pages and pages in painful, boring details when all I want is action.A good example is an extremely long description about Bobby and the whole surrounding the target. She gets into minute detail even about what size amunition he takes. WHO CARES? once all of this is done - the actual shooting is done in less than 3 sentences. BORING.Unfortunately, this tone is kept throughout the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I was happy to find a book with a nice plot and low and behold Hide is the sequal. Nice going - When will you have the followup ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not care for this book.","review":"I am surprised that this book was written by a woman. I found it to be prurient and cold. The character development was similar to that of a made for TV movie. Seems to be a weird melange of The Lovely Bones, The Departed, and Cape Fear. I'm sorry that I wasted my time on it. I chose to read the book as Amazon suggested that since I enjoyed \\"Crossings\\" I would enjoy this book. I will be much more skeptical about Amazon's recommendations in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like clever, well written mysteries, skip this nonsense.","review":"The book starts out promisingly, with a taut and suspenseful chapter about a sniper in a dangerous situation with an abusive husband threatening his wife and child. And for a while, I thought it might be a good read, but it became sillier and sillier, with paper thin characters. I just couldn't feel anything for them or even get a grasp on them. Also, the story became more outrageous with every page. I can see why people liked it, but it's a shallow, quick read, a la James Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting story line","review":"I truly enjoyed this book, the characters came to life as the story progressed. There was love, hate, murder, incest it goes on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again?","review":"A week before reading this book, I finished reading The Survivors Club.As I listened to this book, I was instantly struck by commonalities between both books. 1. Convicted pedophile gets out of jail and is hellbent on exacting revenge on the one victim he let live. 2. There's a behind-the-scenes person who is paying for the carnage that follows. 3. The beautiful \\"victim\\" and the dutiful cop who thinks she's beautiful. 4. The dutiful cop goes rogue in the process of helping the damsel in distress.Maybe if I'd read these books years apart, I might have enjoyed both books. As it happens, I mildly enjoyed the Survivors Club and was bored by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALONE","review":"This was the first book I downloaded on my new Kindle, and finished it in a day and 1/2!

The plot elements were all there: suspense, scary twist, thriller ending, unanticipated motives but at the end I still went, \\"Uh... okay.\\" Gardner wasn't able to weave my interest into her story. I love a good thriller to shake up my reading list but I won't be looking for any more of hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Great book.. suspense! I couldn't put it down.

Warren sounds like a witch! I really like the Dodge character. He seems more the average person in that, he is dealing battles of right and wrong.

I hope to see a line of books out with him as the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Book","review":"I thought this was a horrible book that was hard to put down but painful to read. Skip it and buy something that is quality writing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The beginning was very promising. A sniper kills a man threatening his wife and child, now the officer himself is in jeopardy. The wife is pursued by memories of childhood abuse and her son is desperately sick. The book goes downhill from there. If you like soap operas, the hard-to-believe twists and turns will rival one. The characters are impossible to like and the story is, as another reviewer mentioned and I find the word appropriate, yuck. I wanted to like this book but simply couldn't. Writing is not easy and I appreciate the effort and the pedigree of the author but I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst yet","review":"Physopaths and pedofiles is just not my cuo of tea.

I did finish the book buy can not say I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"Read this book in 2 days. The story and characters quickly drew me in and I couldn't put it down. I found that Lisa Gardner added enough deviant, dark, sadistic human behavior to keep me interested but not enough to gross me out!

Do Not Recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth the $.99","review":"So convoluted that I ended up not even caring who did it. For me, the author just through too many subplots in without really developing them. Then she would go off on tangents describing minute details that added NOTHING to the plot. Very disorganized and hard to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"I was surprised to find this book was so good from beginning to end. This is the first book by Lisa Gardner I've read and did not know what to expect. I read a lot of mystery thrillers and this is one of the best. It is not formula driven and is exciting at every turn. The characters are real and interesting and she keeps you guessing all the way to the end. I will be reading more of her books, no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilling page turner!","review":"This was a good book from start to finish, a real page turner. I can't remember reading any of this author's books but will definitely read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I thought this book was well written and a good escape in a book. I kept trying to guess what was going on, but never quite could get it, until it was revealed. It was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Domestic cold war erupts into WWIII","review":"This is the first novel I read by the author based on the great Kindle price, reviews and my love for thrillers. You will not be disappointed with this one. The story starts with a domestic dispute in a tony neighborhood...Bobby Dodge, police sniper to the rescue. After taking out the crazed pistol waving husband, things are clearly not what they seemed to be. No one is who they seem to be, and no one is to be trusted. Reminds me of those old Cold War spy stories. Was Bobby set up? Was his ex-girlfriend involved in setting him up? Is Catherine, the abused wife, really a sociopathic mother? There are red herrings, there are \\" I should have seen it coming...\\" A true cerebral adventure, but that said, I could not say I found little empathy for the characters. Overall, exciting study in psychopathology, but do not look for that heart-warming ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting to read","review":"I just have to say, this was the first book by this author that I have read. I can't wait to download the rest in this series. I was intrigued from page 1 and even when I had to set it down, I couldn't wait to get back to it. Other people have already divulged plot information so I won't repeat any of it. Suffice to say, this was an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I really have a hard time believing this is one of the bestsellers on Kindle store. Reading this book is like watching a cliché, everyday movie.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there's a strong sense of visualization here. More like a \\"been there, done that\\" kind of feel. You have watched and read so many movies/books like this; believe me, you don't need another one. Actually, you're being bombarded with stuff like this pretty much all the time, mostly even when you don't want to.I should admit, the $0.99 price tag fooled me. I thought I can't go wrong with that price. I was bitterly wrong. It's the worst $0.99 I've ever spent. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Expletives","review":"A fairly good novel marred by many gratuitous usages of Jesus Christ or Christ or Jesus as expletives. Authors have a large choice of words to use as expletives that would not otherwise discomfort and cause wincing among those readers, including myself, who revere and honor Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explicit Language","review":"The book certainly was suspenseful. But we listened to it on an audio tape and I would estimate that there are over 30 F-Bombs in this book. It was offensive and disgusting. I wish she would have let the characters express themselves differently. I've never read a book that had worse language than this particular book. It was also extremely dark and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointed.","review":"Let me start off by saying I read Lisa Gardner's' book 'Hide' before I read 'Alone' and I absolutely loved 'Hide' so it would have been hard for any book to top it. But I thought 'Alone' would come close after I read the reviews but it didn't. This book fell very flat for me. When I was reading 'Hide' I felt connected to the story. I loved the characters and the story line and it was a complete page turner. 'Alone' wasn't. I didn't like any of the characters other then Bobby and the story line didn't really interest me. After I was finished reading and I closed the book I just felt very unsatisfied. While reading this book I never felt a emotion. Never felt surprised, sad, worried for a character, or happy for a character. I kept waiting for something to happen to pull me into the book and make me start caring but it never happened. If you want an amazing book, Skip this one and go buy 'Hide'. That was one amazing book. This one, not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time reading this author","review":"Alone is a non-stop ride of pulse-pounding action. From the minute Bobby pulls the trigger up until the very last page, Alone will keep you guessing and turning pages. Gardner is also very skilled in portraying her characters in a lifelike fashion. None of them are truly heroes and none of them (except for Catherine's rapist) are truly bad guys. She gives us someone to root for, Bobby Dodge, and plenty of other characters to try to figure out. The most intriguing character is Catherine Gagnon, who Gardner never labels and leaves it up to the reader to make a decision on.Alone provides readers with an interesting and tricky plot and also gives them the perfect characters to play it all out. This book is recommended to anyone who enjoys thrillers or mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"big let down...","review":"This book was a big let down for me. Not what I'm used to from Lisa Gardner. Too many twists and turns at the very end, it kind of ruined it for me. The start was hard for me to get into, the middle was good, but the end was a flop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, but missing the usual romance element....","review":"The character development of Bobby is excellent, and the storyline was pretty good. However, I felt the last 50 pages or so were a bit rushed. Perhaps because I've come to expect some level of romance in Lisa Gardner's books I was kind of disappointed that this book was missing that component. However, the story was good, and the characters were complex and compelling, and I hope that Bobby shows up in another book. Overall it's a good read, but if you like a little romance with your mystery this book isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommy Dearest or abused wife?","review":"When a tactical swat team is deployed to defuse a domestic abuse hostage situation, Judge Gagnon's son Jimmy is killed. Was the whole thing engineered by the beautiful wife, Catharine Gagnon?Catharine claims she was abused. Her grieving in-laws claim she is the abuser. They believe she deliberately made her young son sick to control Jimmy.And who is controlling the mysterious serial rapist who is now stalking Catharine?This book is a real page turner. I couldn't put it down.It's a suspense filled ride sure to keep you up all night reading, but make sure you keep the lights on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blunder","review":"I just can't believe LS wrote these lines. I can't even call it a book. The main plot -there is a main plot?- Could be written in maybe twenty pages at most. The rest of the book is just a waste of paper and ink. In the epilogue you'll see that they thought who was the bad guy, but they never say why or how they thought who was he/her.Blunders:Who cares what happened with the psychologist? Were pages and pages talking Elizabeth with Bobby and if you skip all those chapters you'll miss nothing.How could the cops just accuse another cop - whom was always a very good cop - of confabulating a slaughter just because one of the cops has a hunch?How can the same cops accuse him of killing one of his friends - whom he also was a cop -?And the biggest:How is possible that a high Judge of the US Court became a judge and nobody knew he forged his marriage?If this were the first book I ever read from LG this would be also the last one. She made much better books than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"A pretty dumb book. I took it as an insult against survivors of child molestation; are we really to believe that Catherine would wind up evil because of her past? How many times did the author have to say the girl who climbed out of the hole was not the same girl who went in the hole...beat us over the head with it why don't you?And I honestly don't believe a judge could have THAT much power...and throwing in the incest story? Creepy and unnecessary.Also, why have Bobby break up with his girlfriend? What was the purpose of having her in the book then?I gave it an extra half star because it was an easy read, but other than that don't waste your time unless you like entirely unbelievable murder mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"Good book! The mystery is unrevealed until the very end...The villain's repeated interference in the protagonist's life is highly ironic and very well portrayed. Good read for a plane journey! The ending could've been a little more crisp and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story - great price","review":"I never pay more than $4 for a book. There are so many great stories out there for less. So, I was delighted when I found this Lisa Gardner book for $1.\\"Alone\\" is a fast paced action / suspense thriller. It is full of complex characters, relationships and situations - like life - but not slowed down by too many details. There are no angels in this book, but plenty of demons. Even so, I had no problems relating to the hero of this story. I identified with the way he questioned himself, his motives and his judgement.I won't tell you the story because I think you'll want to read it yourself. It is a fresh story line and fun to read. I will be watching to see if any more of Lisa's books drop into my price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read ALL the reviews before purchasing it on my Kindle","review":"I kept hoping this book would get better and have a point, but that never happened. Bobby Dodge was a good character, but the book kept getting more & more unreal to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on the first page.......","review":"This is the first Lisa Gardner book I've read and am looking forward to her others. From the first page you're hooked. Superb character and plot development. Gardner keeps you guessing until literally the last page in the fast paced who-dun-it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puhleeze......","review":"A work of fiction can and should have some basis in reality. Fantasy on the other hand grows out of an improbable dream. This disappointing book does not fit either category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?????","review":"I can't figure out why some authors feel they need to climb into the gutter and spew foul words in order to create a story. This author is no exception; in fact she's one of the worst ones I've encountered yet. In my opinion, true writing skill involves writing descriptively so that no crass language is even necessary. So disappointing because this could have been such a great book. I had to stop after the first 12% because I couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good moments, but overall painful to read","review":"Every so often, I read a book which leaves me feeling slightly off balance and ill. This was one of them. I missed the point and disliked the characters and I think I should have an MRI done to figure out why I finished it.I couldn't tell who the good people were and who the bad ones were, butI did like the therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work","review":"I'm a huge Lisa Gardner fan, but I thought that this was by far her worst book.Bobby was an idiot that I couldn't care less about. He did stupid things and thought with his other head. Catherine was just creepy, as were the rest of her family. The bad guy was nothing but a caricature. I can honestly say that by the time I got to the end, the only thing I cared about was the puppy surviving and finding a home.I hope her next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupendously Unrealistic","review":"This is the most completely unrealistic plot I have read in many years. I am aware of Poetic License, and suspended belief, or disbelief, but this one really violates the Pig Rule. A police sniper, paid to shoot to kill, gets prosecuted for doing his job. A judge has so much power and wealth(where do judges get wealthy?)that he virtually ruins the life of the sniper who shot his son. Give me a break. I don't know what world the author lives in, but in my world, this is total fantasy.Suspense is compelling because it is based on reality and rooted in experience.I'll stick to George Pelacanos or Michael Connolly.If this book wasn't in my Kindle, I'd have thrown it across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Rating of Explicit language","review":"I really can't say anything about the book. I downloaded the free preview...It sounded like it was really interesting..Actually I read the 1st little bit and all was going well. Then the language started. I'm sorry, this may be a great book, but I will never know. I will not listen nor read such language. There are way too many adjectives that can be used to express oneself. This review is only for those who are offended by explicit language. As state before, this book may be fantastic, I for one will never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Snipers Manual","review":"I read the sample, three chapters which include a well researched description of how to sit up a sniper station. But I wasn't introduced to anyone I want to know more about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters you love to hate...","review":"I really liked the book, but this is the first time where I have read a book and liked it but hated all the main characters. I am wondering if that was Ms. Gardners intentions? Each character comes with a problem(s) and the author writes the suspense/mystery around the whole group. Very well done. The story builds over time so you must stick with it till the end. If you are a fan of Ms. Gardner you will be very happy you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"Alone by Lisa Gardner is an amazing crime story. It all began with the death of Jimmy Gagnon, son of Judge Gagnon. Jimmy was killed by State trooper Bobby Dodge who with a tactical swat team was trying to defuse a supposedly domestic abuse hostage crisis. But the judge and his wife believe Jimmy's wife, Catharine Gagnon engineered the crisis to get rid of their son, so they want their only grandson taken from her. They start by suing Bobby Dodge and with that unfolded incidences which invokes Catherine's past as a victim of a pedophile half a century back.Embroiled in the mystery of the unfolding drama is the lurking presence of the serial rapist, manipulation by the late Jimmy's parents, the helplessness of the grandson, Catherine's calculating nature and Bobby Dodge's determination to resolve the mysteries behind all the deaths around. Alone, Flash of the Sun, Runaway are gripping until the very end. I like books that thrill me until the last pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alone","review":"I have never cared less for a cast of characters and apparently the author is in agreement with me. She seemingly could not decide on her characters character, changing traits to suit the scene, engaging them in improbable conversations and involving them in impossible situations, not to mention sowing platitudes whenever she had the chance. Gardner started with an interesting premise, but just couldn't develop an interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic behavior","review":"I usually enjoy Lisa Gardner's books , and know a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, but the behavior of the protagonist Bobby is just plain unbelievable.He kills a man righteously in the line of duty and because of some obscure law is being sued criminally by the man's parents. Can such a law really exist? How would the police ever be able to do their job? The father-in-law an incredibly rich and powerful judge. Of course!So what does our hero do? He meets the widow openly in a public museum. He goes to the judge's house when beckoned, where he is offered a bribe. He goes to the wife's house when she says she hears an intruder, finding the nanny dead, hung in a blatantly fake suicide. He tells the widow the suicide is faked before he calls the police.Nope, no way i can get past all that. Especially when the wife is thoroughly unlikeable. All the women in the book are, actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"this book was a waste of several perfectly good afternoons. it just wasn't a good read overall. i really didn't care about catherine or bobby or anyone. in fact, towards the end of the book, i found myself rooting for the killer just for the sake of a book with a different ending than \\"and the 2 main characters lived.\\" there was not even the slightest sliver of happiness or positivity in this book. i haven't read other works by this author but after this dry, sloppy bomb of a book, i don't plan on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"??????????","review":"i can not believe this is the #1 seller on the kindle. a grade school student can thread a better narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I never thought that a thriller could be boring, but this one is. The characters are unsympathetic (especially the heroine; I would have expected to feel sorry for a survivor of sex abuse, but this woman gives me the chills); the plotline feels contrived.... I had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alone..Oh My","review":"Lisa Gardner does it again. i loved every twist..every turn..and every moment of this great novel. no one does it better than Lisa Gardner.

And this book did just that. It keeps you thinking and wanting to read more. I truly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful story of perversion, crime, violence and children","review":"I kept waiting for some redemption in this ever worsening drama/crime/mystery. The writing was decent, the story and characters were just awful I could not even finish the book - I tried and persevered ... and was left feeling awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Psychological Thriller!!","review":"This was a superb psychological thriller that the elements really kept changing the further you got into the book. I would have never dreamed of reading the ending that I read while reading the first or even the tenth or eighteenth chapter! This was my first read from Lisa Gardner as well as of the D.D. Warren series, and I can assure you that I will be reading the next book in the series, Hide and as a matter of fact, I can't wait! I finished the book hours ago and it still has my head reeling! It's been a long time since I've read such an overall AWESOME book! I know you all will thoroughly enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much Better","review":"First as a FYI. This review is based of listening to the book as opposed to reading it.I didn't really like it. First, I didn't like the reader which of course has nothing to do with book. I liked the premise of the book; but too many things that I didn't agree with made it bad for me such as a judge reaching out to the defendent outside of court or the police. There were also other similar things; but I don't want to spoil too many things. In the end, I was just looking forward to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"A sniper does his job and kills a husband holding a gun on his wife and son which begins a a story of incredible suspense. The story takes many turns and you go from hating then feeling bad and then hating the wife. The ending took a wild turn and surprised me a bit, and although it got a little crazy this book kept me reading. When I finished i was surprised how much I enjoyed this book I will read more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is only the second book I have read of Lisa Gardner, and I am hooked. Her characters are real and the plot is ever changing/not at all predictable. Definitely a thought provoking mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Tower....The series that bring his books together.","review":"Upon reading this book, i have found that he places other book's settings inside each book. The place in Mid-World for Randall Flagg is the most convincing of this, along with the same disease from The Stand destroying all of mid world."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incomplete effort shows lack of respect for readers","review":"It's not that this is a bad book, or that any of the books in the series so far are untenably bad, but the fact that this series remains unfinished after 20 years is absolutely unforgiveable. The Gunslinger was first published in 1982, it is now 2002, and in the intervening years, King has published no less than 36 other novels and collections. King obviously has no commitment to this story, and that has shown in the last couple of books. They are just words down on paper, dragging the story along, without life or passion.If you are the kind of person who would willingly buy a movie ticket, and upon the film breaking in the middle, get up and go home with never another care about how the movie ended, then by all means read these books. However, if you're the kind of reader who gets drawn into stories and actually interested in characters, then I'd suggest passing on these books until King decides if he's ever going to finish the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever!","review":"The Dark Tower series is the best story I have ever heard. It is by far more entertaining than any other activity I've ever been involved in. The only bad thing about it is that the next novel (part V) won't be here till 2001 (and that's a big assumption). Buy it, read it, read it again, etc...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Tower Series","review":"Having read the whole series up to date, I can truly say that these stories are not only thrilling but a page turner from beginning to end. There are so many different scenerio's that could happen in this book that it could go on forever! My favorite book so far is when the gunslinger goes back to his childhood as a young lad. My advice is to read from the first book to the last one written though otherwise you'll be confused if you don't know the full story behind the gunslinger and his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING LIKE IT!","review":"From the very first page you're plunged into the story. You become almost instantly attached to Roland and everything that's happening to him. It's an emotional series, one that will make you laugh and cry and bite your nails waiting for what's going to happen next. It's so very real that sometimes you'll have to ask yourself, \\"Is Stephen really writing this - or is something else telling him..\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"These book are VERY good","review":"I just finished reading \\"The waste lands\\" It was a great book. They just keep getting better and better. These books have helped broaden my sense of knowledge and wisdom. You come to love the characters, from Roland, the strange gunslinger from a dying world, all the way down the that stupid billy bumbler Jake carries around. These books are great, and I hope Stephin King isn't dead, so he can keep writing these great novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Addictive","review":"The Dark Tower series is one of Stephen King's most captivating creations. You are drawn into Roland's world from the very first sentence and your imagination will be sparked with the new and unusual ideals until you turn the very last page.

These books provide a doorway into the center of King's wolrd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awsome!","review":"\\"The Dark Tower\\" series is the very core of Kings' work and it is plain to see that this is his best writing. This is not one of his typical horror storys, and even if your not a King fan, I'm sure you'll love this one. A story that is still yet to be complete (4 books so far) and leaves readers itching for the next part. It set in a mysterious world of fantasy but some how is so real like it will draw you in. This is the master's masterpeice. An absolute must...Join the quest for the elusive Dark Tower..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My obsession!","review":"Ever since i started reading these books, i was obsessed. I read all 4 of them in 2 and a half weeks. They are simply wonderful. With vivid descriptions, and living, breathing characters that seem real. These are easily the best books i've ever read. But it's simply driving me crazy waiting for the 5th one to come out. In each book, you learn a little bit more about the dark tower. There are no boring parts, at least not for me. There was never a time when i wanted not to read any of the books in this series. This may sound dumb, but... these books are the things i think about most! It's true! I can relate to the characters so much, i just love it! If there's such thing as a \\"must-read\\" this series is most definetly it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Tower Series is Stephen King's best work yet!","review":"I enjoyed the Dark Tower series very much.

Evil... simply the best!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Okay... the Dark Tower series has everything... characters we can relate to, the best plot to a story Iv'e ever read, and endings that have left us hanging on cliffs for years. All this leads me to believe...Stephen King is God. The tie ins to other King books are ingenious, and his sources for ideas are amazing (C.S. Lewis, Robert Browning, the Wizard of Oz books). The Gunslinger started slow, but speeded up towards the \\"Walter\\" scenes, the \\"Drawing\\" was fast all the way through, and the Wastelands were just plain fascinating (the bible of the series if you ask me), explaining such things as Jake, Randall Flagg, and the nature of \\"billy bumblers.\\" This series is definitly King's best work. In my mind, comparable to the Oddyssey, and the Stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Tower","review":"\\"The man in Black fled across the desert,and the gunslinger followed\\". Those spellbinding words make your imagination go wild. Atleast they did for me. I personally thought about those words for a good twenty minutes. While the whole class was reading I was thinking about the book, and those words impaticular. The rest of the book is just great, and I reccomend it to anyone who hasn't had the oppurtunity to read a great book.This was my very first book read from cover to cover.Believe it or not, and it wont be the last. I've watched many of Steven King's movies and in my opinion they are good, but is books are twice as good.

How he combines our world with that fictional world of Roland and his friends is nearly genial.

There is no question which is the better of the two. Tolkien can't even grasp the kind of story telling ability King has shown in these books. These books combine horror, love, fantasy, western, comedy, religion and more. You haven't read anything until you have joined in the quest for the dark tower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy!","review":"Wow--this series is crazy! I decided to try it after reading King's story in the LEGENDS anthology. I'm not really a Stephen King fan (not into the horror thing), but THE DARK TOWER series had me totally hooked. Dark fantasy, with just some really weird stuff going on, it's totally engrossing. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PREPARE TO DIP OUT OF SOCIETY FOR A WEEK","review":"THERE IS NOTHING THAT COMPARES TO THE EXCELLENCE OF THIS SERIES OF BOOKS.

In fact, Mr. Robert Weirich, Mr. Barry Snyder and I recorded an entire CD of works by Amy Beach and Rebecca Clarke. I do think it was an excellent recording, due in large part to my colleagues' boundless artistry, and the work of my colleagues in the recording studio at Eastman School of Music. I am glad to see that Koch thought well enough of it to reissue parts of it, though they never communicated with me about it. I am happy to report to any who don't know her work that Marin Alsop was aready a wonderful conductor early in her career and has developed into a world class artist.

But the DVD looks no worse than the video release from the 1980s. The only conceivable reason for watching this is for a pre-celebrity Madonna in a couple of topless scenes. If that's worth $5, then Body of Evidence should weigh in at several thou."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Certain Embrassment","review":"I found this video where I rent a few years ago. Without a doubt it ranks as one the most pathetic attemps at filmaking I've ever seen. The sound and visuals were abhorring, often I could'nt understand what the actors were saying. Done over the span of one year(So I've read)Madonna is mildly appealing in some scenes, but mostly sounds like Betty Boop on speed. In the lauded group sex scene she about as sexy as a Time Square hooker and as tired.

(Story line a bit shaky as well.) I wouldn't say it's the worst movie ever made but it's certainly a contender. Though it is interesting to see New York in the late 70's (in a very different way than I remember it). Classicly poor student-type film. Not sure how/why this actually came out in DVD format. It's only an hour long so if you love Madonna, might be good for one viewing - only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny romantic story","review":"This is my first Katie MacAlister book and it won't be my last. This is a very funny romantic story about an unemployed women \`Pepper Marsh' looking for hot man. Her cousin takes her to a Renaissance Fair in Ontario, Canada where they are Wenches for two weeks looking for the perfect Knight. There is many laugh out loud moments, insight into jousting competitions, great sex scenes and a little mystery. I would recommend this book and I would also suggest books by Kimberly Raye and Kate Angell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Don't waste your money on this one. I like her Dark Ones series so I thought I'd try her contemporary works. Awful- just incredibly awful. Way to much detail about Renaissance Fairs and jousting, not enough romance or character development. I tried skipping pages hoping it would get better - nope! Save your money and read this at the library (or use it for kitty litter)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky Romance at its best","review":"This Book Hard Day's Knight is so good I couldnt put it down and I tell everyone I know to read her books every book she writes I read because she is that good.

I kept saying out loud- Seriously?!? This is usually a genre that I enjoy, sassy heroines and heroes that take a little time to develop. I couldn't buy-in to her scenario or characters. I kept trying, but it did not ring true. Eventually I just wanted to smack some sense into most all of the characters. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"MacAlister's Guide to Jousting?","review":"I wanted to like this - some of MacAlister's novels are among my favorites - I just couldn't get into it. In fact, I found myself just skimming whole pages because I got really, really tired of reading about the details of jousting. It felt like the main characters rarely interacted, and when they did, nothing happened that would inspire a magical love affair. If you're looking for details about the gear, clothing, and techniques of jousting, this is a good book for you. If you're looking for a good romance, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about your obnoxious herione!","review":"This is possibly the most annoying book I have ever read. From the moment the heroine met the hero every excruciating word out of her mouth was uncouth and uncool. A usually love a strong female but Pepper became so incredibly annoying that halfway through the I could no longer tolerate her insipid sexual remarks. I find it highly unrealistic that ANY male would find her attractive given the fact that she just did not know when to shut up. I felt absolutely no chemistry between her and Walker and felt that their relationship was completely forced. Thank goodness I only borrowed the book and did not waste money purchasing it. I was truly disappointed in this read as I normally enjoy MacAlister's writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to learn more about jousting...","review":"I preferred Men in Kilts to this book. Learning the ins and outs of jousting was interesting, but it got a bit boring. There wasn't much else happening in this book. The characters were fairly two-dimensional and I never did figure out why Walker was attracted to Pepper. She just didn't seem his type. I guess she just overwhelmed him.This book isn't horrible, but it really isn't a must read either."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Mad MacAlister book","review":"Katie MacAlister's book are not for anything put pure pleasure.

Having been to SCA events before I found she caught the whole thing perfectly!What a FUN book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it!","review":"As someone who is fascinated with ren faires and jousting, I devoured this book. I was so sad when it was over.Pepper Marsh is looking for her knight in shining armor and narrowly misses getting trampled by a horse when the dashing Walker saves her life. How can she resist the brooding knight? Walker is HOT and Katie MacAlister has a way of writing that makes you feel like you're in Pepper's skin. I loved this book and I'm looking forward to her new release later this year. This made me an instant MacAlister fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not my style.","review":"This is the only Katie MacAlister book I've read, because a friend gave it to me, but I couldn't even finish it. I found the heroine grating and obnoxious and couldn't understand why ANYONE should fall in love with her. She puts her foot in her mouth repeatedly, is blunt to the point of illness, and seemed to be written as especially stupid and clueless as a means to advance the plot. I cringed through two-thirds of the book and then I gave up. The characters weren't worth caring about, but I gave it a good try. I'm sure Katie MacAlister isn't a best-selling novelist for nothing, but Hard Day's Knight was definitely not the right introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Funny!","review":"Super funny and really good! I even let my boyfriend borrow it and he liked it too. Really good with just a tad bit of \\"betrayal\\". So perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"This book is one of the funniest modern romance tales from this author. She seamlessly marries modern day dilemmas within the realm of the \\"Renaissance Faire\\" type functions. The main character is delightfully onery andoffers some great one liners. The darned cat she is cat-sitting for also makes some scenes quite memorable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather have the jousting","review":"I'm not much into chick-lit, but I am into Renaissance Faires, which is why I picked up this book. A lot of reviewers didn't like the jousting, but I absolutely loved it. And I loved the Wench stuff, but there wasn't nearly enough of it mentioned, despite the main character's supposedly participating as a Wench for two weeks at the Faire. Outside of the jousting, really all we're left with is Pepper and Walker arguing, lusting after each other, then plenty of over-the-top sex. That got a little boring after a while, but the jousting scenes were quite exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent !!!","review":"This book will make you smile from beginning to end.

I was given it as a gift by a friend of mine because I am an English major. I enjoyed the book. It is meant as something to be interesting, make you think. Just because it is plain does not make the pages any less interesting or funny. I thoroughly enjoy this rather plain but fun book. It's a conversation starter if nothing else.Yes, it is a simple book and it may even be considered to be too plain, but I liked it. If you are a fan of the construction of the English language, you might get a kick out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Resolution","review":"This second book in McMorrow's Tuldamoran Trilogy equals and, if possible, betters the first. The characters have grown internally and in their interrelationships. Once again, the challenges they face are physical, moral, and emotional. The action on all fronts is fast-paced, driving the characters and being driven by them.The conclusion is most satisfying. It is a resolution indeed and seems almost the finish of a duo rather than the middle work of a trilogy. I am looking forward to seeing that final volume in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy!","review":"Being a Nikon loyalist as a photographer, I have mostly (not all) Nikon riflescopes. This particular scope is replacing a Nikoplex scope that just wouldn't work for the long range classes I'm taking and I couldn't be happier. Sighting it in at 100 yards, it was almost in the black right out of the box (6\\"). 200 yards I was able to keep all shots in the black with 3 out of 5 shots within 2\\" (2 flyers were probably my fault). Optics are up to Nikon's high standards and reputation. Mounted on a Savage .308 with a DNZ mount, after 50 or so rounds, it shows no sign of wear or drift, but I've only had one range session so far. Great scope and I'm looking forward to class to see how it performs at longer ranges."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great scope for the price.","review":"When I first ordered this scope I thought it was a 30mm main tube and was on the fence wether to keep it or not.

It comes with two flip covers that work the eyepiece cover covers up the front focus but once you set it I don't think you need to change it a whole lot.This scope is calibrated for what looks like 12x for the mildot sight. I'll have to experiment with what the dots are at 16x to see if they are magnified or if they change their measurement.This scope was a great buy and it is incredibly clear with very fine sights.I'll post more after I shoot it a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplemente Crissy","review":"Definitivamente Crissy Moran es una de las mejores Peach Girls,su pícara sonrisa, su lindo rostro y su cuerpo la hacen sin lugara dudas una de las favoritas de la gente.En este DVD aparece en varias locaciones distintas, con diferentesvestuarios para satisfacer los gustos de cada quien.La fotografía e imágenes son excelentes y las actuaciones deCrissy hacen en definitiva que uno quiera seguir viendo más y más.En general una muy buena recopilación llena de escenas muy sexys,pícaras, sensuales y sugerentes como solo Crissy sabe hacerlas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Serve It's Purpose","review":"This spout cover does not serve it's purpose. It is so hard that there isn't much different between hitting your head on a metal spout or hitting your head on a metal spout with this hard piece of plastic over it.It also does not fit a standard spout and has not flexibility to it to make it fit. We tried it and our spout was an 8th of an inch shorter than where the hole was on this so it kept filling with water and shooting it out the back.We returned this item and purchased an inflatable spout cover which is far superior. It's softer and because it's inflatable, it's easy to flec it around your spout no matter what the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"You get what you pay for. I previously had a spout protector from another company. It lasted nearly 4 years and needed to be replaced. Thought since I have been pleased with the Sassy brand for many years that I'd try this cute frog out. What an error! The frog is too big for my bath spout and falls right off. The back of it is not at all designed for spouts of various sizes. It is definitely \\"one size doesn't fit all\\".Just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really useful","review":"We bought this to protect my daughter from hitting her head on the faucet in the bathtub. Unfortunately, this item is quite hard and so I'm not sure that it really would be that much less painful if she slips. It fits fine on our bath spout, but it also comes off very easily. Sometimes she takes it off and plays with it in the tub. I don't think it is worth the money. If I were going to look for something like this again I might try one of the inflatable ones, which would provide more padding for little heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would hurt just as much!","review":"I was very disappointed when I pulled this product out of the packaging. It was super cute, but the plastic is hard and does not cushion or give at all. It would hurt just as much to bump into this as it would to bump into the spout itself. I handed it to my mother-in-law and asked her what she thought (without telling her my opinion) and she said exactly the same thing.

I did stay on our standard spout with a pull top and prevented bumps on the head, however, there were several drawbacks:1. Always had to remove it when using the shower.2. There are lots of curves and crevices inside from the shape of the frog, so this creates areas for water to collect and sit and thus mildew to grow on. It's pretty gross.We had to through it out and are now looking for something more simple and clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"First of all, this Froggie Spout Guard is absolutely adorable! But more importantly, in the short time I've had it, it has already saved my son from a few bruises and/or cuts from the faucet. The frog fits my faucet perfectly; I can leave it on while the water is running and not have the water back up into it. I've had it now for about 3 months and I've put it in the dishwasher once and have never had any mildew build up inside. As other reviewers have mentioned, my son can pull the guard off the faucet pretty easily. But as he is getting used to it being there, his interest level in pulling it off is going down and I'm sure soon he will leave it alone altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great - exactly what we were looking for","review":"This is what I was looking for to keep my daughter from hurting her head on the bath spout and it does exactly that. We put it on the spout after the bath is full since the spout guard tends to cause the water to flow out the back if you leave it on while filling the bathtub. It fits rather loosely and my daughter was able to pull it off easily, wanting to play with it, but it got old after awhile and now she leaves it on the spout. You will need to clean it periodically because mold tends to build up on the inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This frog is cute and that's pretty much all it's good for.

As she moves around we are concerned she might bang her head on the faucet. However this sassy froggie is almost as hard as the faucet. It probably will be safer because there are no sharp edges but we were looking for something much softer. Maybe it was just wrong expectations on our part but we returned this item and will continue to search for something soft. A bang against this will certainly hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.

I'm not nearly as flexible as the woman in the DVD, especially pregnant, and I am a beginner to yoga. The only modification they offered was to sit on a rolled towel. I was unable to do most of the positions and had to do my own version of them instead.

There are much better products out there.I suggest10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take your time","review":"I absolutely loved this yoga DVD except for the fact that it was a bit fast-paced. By my third trimester, I had to pause in the middle of the routine. There is no rest time in between moves. Just keep that in mind if you're having trouble going up and down stairs, you might also have trouble doing this video all the way through without pausing. Otherwise, the routine was fantastic, not too long or short, not too hard or easy. I feel great after doing it, albeit a little sweaty. I would recommend this for any pregnant woman who has even a little yoga experience beforehand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defintely recommend","review":"There are few issues that I usually have with yoga DVDs.Super corny-ness being my biggest pet peeve. Although this one has a bit of that mawkish vibe (it wouldn't be yoga without it), I found it to be barely present. If you're looking for a meditation guide, this isn't it.I got a really good stretch and there were ways to make the exercises easier (which I needed). I think if you start doing this DVD when you plan to get pregnant and in the early stages, then you'll be strong enough to do them once you start to grow.I've done a few different yoga DVDs and so far, this one is my favorite. I have not tried the post-natal exercises yet. If it's terrible I will come back to review, otherwise, assume I liked it as much as the pre-natal portion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I bought this DVD at 26weeks for primary for the post natal, because I have Shiva Rea's DVD wich I loved a lot.But this DVD has more repetitions of poses and posing is longer than what I expected.So I got cramp every time I exercise with this DVD, and eventually I stopped using it.It's a good price but I like Shiva's DVD a lot more.(how she speaks, transitions, music, and etc...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners","review":"This is not a disc for a beginner, I was looking for short session but it was about 60 -70 minutes long.

This dvd has a little too much of the hippy dippy stuff for me. I don't find \\"fill yourself and your baby with radiance\\" that useful. Or to \\"illuminate every cell of my body\\".I found the routine itself to be pretty good, but I thought the breathing was a little slow for me and I would have liked greater variety in the poses grouped together."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good and easy to follow","review":"I bought this dvd and have been using since my 30 months. I'm 8 months now and im doing yoga with this dvd almost everyday for 5 mins and I would say that I love it. The moves are slow and easy to follow. Also your breathing gets deeper as you keep practising. i have less back pain now and i feel my body is getting flexible for the labor. I'm also doing the meditation with another dvd which helps to reduce my stress level. i have 2 other yoga dvds but this one is my favorite as the poses are practical and tones each muscle in your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the workout","review":"I love the prenatal Yoga workout. I've done very little yoga in my past but wanted to try it with this pregnancy. I love the flow and the background is beautiful. This is great for beginngers."},{"rating":"2","title":"post natal section","review":"I bought this dvd specifically for the postnatal workout. I have gone thru the routine 3-4 times now. I was expecting more abdominal work since that's where most moms have problems. It's a 30 minute routine very similar to other regular yoga routines, nothing special & nothing that really targets postnatal women. On the bright side, it's a good workout when you don't have much time. I feel very relaxed once it's over. I rotate this with my other yoga dvds to change it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth doing","review":"I haven't been able to workout like I wanted to because my morning sickness has been so bad. This was a great way to start again. I think the stretching will help later on in the pregnancy (it's my first), but I just finished the video and my horrible back cramps are gone. Considering I was about to fork out money I didn't have on a massage...I'm pretty happy with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt great!","review":"This was a refreshing and gentle exercise for me. I was doing moderate yoga pre-pregnancy, but then the first trimester wore me out and I was unable to do any exercise at all. This was a good way to get back into the exercise regiment once my energy returned. I felt wonderful and energized all day after doing it.My only negative would be the new-age-y overtones. I understand that makes it more authentic yoga, but I'm not into that sort of thought lifestyle.Overall, however, I would highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"If you have never done yoga before, this video is not for you. It would be difficult to do many of the moves while pregnant if you are not experienced. Particularly the downward facing dog and plank pose. This video does not offer many alternatives for a \\"beginner\\" or \\"light\\" option like most work out videos do. I tried this video 6 weeks post-pregnancy and had difficulty doing it. I am not out of shape! I am glad I checked this out at the library first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga DVD!","review":"This is a very good DVD for those that are beginners in yoga. It has some gentle strength building exercises (like downward dog and warrior 2), and some great, gentle stretches. This is not a DVD that will cause you to break a sweat or get a work out. This is great for those that have back problems, those who are overweight, those that like breathing exercises, ect. I wanted it for the stretches that it has, as my back always bothers me during pregnancy. It fits the bill perfectly!I skimmed over the postnatal side of the DVD, but have not used it yet. It seems to be along the same vein, although a little more strength orientated. It looked like it was also paced a little faster, which is perfect for a gentle way to transition into getting back in shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to do at 8-9 months.","review":"Hard to do at 8-9 months pregnant :(... At least it was for me. I have other yoga videos from Element and I liked them but I don't think that if you have morning sickness or if you're just plain too big to do some of these \\"easy\\" moves- you might just want to save your money for post-partum workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid in 3rd trimester!","review":"I never leave reviews but i felt compelled after 16 minutes of doing this prenatal yoga exercise. It was very strenuous on my pregnant body (in 3rd trimester) and the poses feel rushed. I am a newbie with yoga but I have done other workouts that leave me feeling GREAT at the end. this workout exhausted me (I'm huffing and puffing as i write this)! i had to stop half way through because there was no way my body could handle these poses. There also isn't a warm up. She jumps right into the yoga. the poses are good but not for a pregnant woman!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I started doing prenatal yoga at the beginning of my 2nd trimester and probably read every review on every prenatal yoga DVD out there! I'm glad I picked this one. I do have yoga experience, but nothing intensive. The intro is a bit long, but I use that time to get my mat set up. The best thing about the DVD is it's short! There is no excuse of not having enough time to do it :) The poses are explained well and are not too difficult yet you still feel stretched, strong and relaxed after. Be aware, this is not a strenuous cardio yoga session. I combine it with a vigorous walk every day to get my cardio in. All in all, a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult poses for pregnancy","review":"I ordered this for my 2nd pregnancy. In first trimester I tried to follow the poses and found them quite difficult to do. I could still do it, but didn't feel comfortable about continuing practicing this. It is only for 30 mins. I haven't seen the postnatal part yet.So don't know about it. May be it will help me then.Earlier I did follow another prenatal yoga demonstrated by Shiva Rae and it was quite useful. Poses were given with 3 different options for each trimester. I person can choose a difficulty level that she is comfortable with. Every person is different and every time our body condition changes esp. during pregnancy. I found what I did earlier was way better than this yoga cd.--The Wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd","review":"I really enjoyed this yoga dvd, it goes a little quick for the first time but once i learned the routine and poses i was able to enjoy it more because it flows pretty well. i am looking forward to the postnatal part after i deliver :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think I may Have Expected Too Much","review":"Like some others, I tried this product because of Racquel Welch's book, and her passage that she uses them. I have been trying different ways of putting them on my face (ie, wearing as is, cutting them, etc., been going online to find out tips from others), but I guess I may have expected too much. The expectation was mainly because of other people loving the Frownies, I guess. I'll use up what I have, but won't buy again. Too bad. Here's the thing: I think if you could actually wear the things out in public, when you are actually making many facial expressions, these would help by limiting that. I don't think they're helping me smooth the ones already there.

We are only told that it was a \\"facimile reprint and may contain imperfections\\". I would have loved to have known its basic content. It says little on \\"How to Breed\\" (as indicated in title) -- being concerned only with blood lines and \\"what to breed\\". This book was apparently written in 1900 for people who were very familiar with the basic care of fantail pigeons. I really cannot imagine that anyone would have need for this book. However, if you already raise fantail pigeons and would like a 110+ year old historical monograph (reprinted in 2009) on blood lines and exhibition, this book is certainly for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all flashes","review":"I have been using this device for a couple of years.

Flooring is extremely durable with no buckling, cracking, etc. at all.I am currently looking to purchase a larger shed only because I need more space. The only complaint I have (and a very minor one) is that while it is set up to add wood shelving, it's not a great set up (unless they have made some modifications in newer models). It does work and I have shelving that has been installed almost the entire time I have had the shed, but I have had to do some slight modifications over the years to keep it in place.

One can appreciate and even applaud a serious effort to write a humorous piece of fiction building on the few known facts of Shakespeare's life. However, what Mr. Nye has done is contrive fantasies in which to describe aberrant voyeurism. He has also created ludicrous sexual situations that have absolutely no relevance to the Bard. The book has so little about Shakespeare that it could have well been entitled, An Autobiography of Pickleherring, Shakespeare's Companion. Even serious students of Shakespeare can appreciate fictional humour, but it should be appropriate to the subject and not whimsical fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling!","review":"I only got through about 60 pages of this book. There were a few parts that were good enough to keep me reading, but a lot of it was just uninteresting. I stopped when about 50 pages in there was a very long paragraph describing Shakespeare's mother molesting him. The tone was one of jocularity, & the description ended with an even more disgusting joke. If you like to read descriptions starting \\"Mary Shakespeare would take her son's little member very pleasantly in her hands...\\", (that's the cleanest part of the paragraph), then get this book. If you are appalled by a jest being made of child molestation then skip this book. I am throwing it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderously funny, very entertaining!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Having been a fan of Shakespeare for many years, this book surprised and delighted me with its creative humor and amusing style. Pickleherring is a wonderfully realistic character, living above a brothel and surviving on eggs, which sometimes serve to remind him of the Bard's life. A great piece of work, a must-read for anyone who wants to know more about Shakespeare than his plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A RIP OFF!","review":"LOL....ARE YOU KIDDING ME???

On this CD, he plays with three musicians on acoustic bass, drums/percussion, and piano. The added instruments enhance and don't take away at all from Doug's outstanding guitar work and singing. The CD is great, but I'd also suggest trying to catch Doug live as he is the consummate entertainer- providing wonderful music, entertaining with stories, and making you laugh and think, sometimes at the same time.

Finding pictures titillating to the senses deftly hidden in advertisements is a good rainy-day activity, especially with this book as a companion.

Read \\"The Age of Propaganda: The Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion\\" Chapter 34 by Anthony Pratkanis and Eliot Aronson, and you'll see what truths have been found that dispute subliminal messages and their effectiveness.

I can't stay awake on long car trips, and sleeping with your head bobbing on your shoulder is a recipe for discomfort. Having this little pillow handy is perfect! Deflated, it folds down small enough to put in your purse or pocket. It is even better for air travel, since they don't wash those little blue pillows they hand out--EVER!! I can't bring myself to use those scuzzy things, so I just whip out my little blue pillow, fill it with a few breaths, and I'm ready to go! One caution, however; be sure to let a litte air out or deflate as the plane descends because the air inside will expand with the lowering pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I have to agree with the other thumbs-down reviewer. Inflating this pillow is an exercise in frustration. I certainly would not want to do it on a plane with an audience. The valve doesn't have a cover, instead you're supposed to \\"push it in\\" and it closes underneath (this is hard to describe, sorry). The valve likes to slide into the closed position while one tries to blow into the pillow.On the bright side, the material covering the air chamber is very soft and likely quite comfortable.Maybe it gets easier to inflate with practice, but I'll keep looking.

The conductor draws gorgeous tonal pictures in pastel, and the Philharmonia exceeds its usual self. The Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun is gauzy and alluring; the filler, Boite a Joujoux, is a trifle, a kind of Debussian Nutcracker with a quarter of the energy or fun of the original.It's for the La Mer that I will return -- it could well be the best account ever recorded by an American conductor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The NEON is REALLY neon","review":"The color in real life is SUPER neon pink.

In short, I watched too many movies. This book gave me an unexpected and a realistic take on what really happened on board his majesty's ship Bounty from the time it left England until years after the last of the mutineers had died. I found it most interesting that even though we have court martial documents and letters of correspondence to prove other wise, Captain Bligh is still remembered as \\"the villian\\".

The book lends particular focus on how the Haywood and Christian families \\"spun\\" the tale after the fact to make the mutineers seem more \\"noble\\" and Bligh more \\"evil\\". As far as I can tell, it's a straight-up, honest and well-researched account of what really happened.However, it does seem to me that the book spends proportionally too much time on the court martial and Peter Haywood's family and life, and not enough on the events onboard ship or on Pitcairn Island; I suppose this reflects the amount of material available on each. Further, the author assumes an understanding of geography and nautical terms that could be explicated by a glossary and more (and better placed) maps.

For the first time I have found a book that tells me how to tie a tire swing, tie down a tarp, tie down a trunk, tie a load on top of a car, etc.This is not a book for a person wanting a knot encyclopedia. It only gives a handful of knots, but the knots are VERY practicle, as the title suggests, and covers most the jobs average people do.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that it's coverage is limited, and it has very primitive illustrations -- but illustrations that are easy to follow. Overall, however, it is my favorite practical book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically flawed, boring plot","review":"First thing that hits you n this game is the incredibly slow pacing and terrible technical flaws. Once you have the game working you face what is basically an FMV game. While that isn't necissaily bad, why they used bad 3d models instead of real actors is beyond me. The 3d used for the videos could have easily been done in real time, yet they use a disjointed fmv format. The game is also extremely wasteful of system resources, the requirements are very steep for something that had been done successfully on systems half as fast as what this game needs.Then you move on to the plot that is, at best, a bad pisode of Law and Order. This is definitely not up to the level that the show has given us.In all, it's just not worth the aggrivation of fighting the games bugs that force to to keep replayng parts of the game until you get lucky enough to miss the bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"Be warned that this game does not work in all computers.

I'm running a PIII 733, 512mb Ram, 32 mb Video Card, 16 mb Sound card, and don't have such problems with other games which require a higher minimum system requirement. Due to these technical issues I've encountered with the game, I have not been able to complete it. It becomes extremely fustrating, especially if you've got something and getting hotter and closer to cracking the case. If it wasn't for all this lock up, the game would be great.

Bugs, glitches and crashes plague the game from the beginning. The gameplay is horribly flawed and much of the game doesn't get right what other games have been doing right for 15 years. They use an FMV format but ditch live actors for bad pre-rendered models.The plot is boooring. Instead of the typical way things are presented in the show, the game is almost forcively telling you to think different people did the crime when it's obvious they did not. There is no investigation, you jump through hoops the designers laid out to force gameplay mechanics on a flimsy story. None of the charectors are intriguing, they all fall flat. Everything is cliche'd and it all screams third-rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool game - just like the show.","review":"The best part about this game is the feeling you are working with the characters. The character voices are cool. The game is set up just like the show. The story was interesting, and it was cool that I didn't know what was coming next, just like the show. There were twists in the plot.There isn't a lot of action or fast game play - its more about solving puzzles and figuring out the story.

Although very informative and well documented, in his zeal to justify the existence of Mormon temples by showing many amazing similarities to temples and temple rituals of the past, he fails to notice that nearly all of his examples are from pagan cultures. Nibley proves well that the origin of Mormon temples is paganism.

When it finally got here, I ripped open the packaging and put it into the CD player. This CD is SO bad, words cannot even describe it. Green Day is absolutely my favorite band and this CD is so bad that it gave me explosive diarrhea. I wish I could give it zero stars. If you want to hear Green Day songs, listen to Green Day.

The 2.0.0.0 drivers has a date of 2006 so they would have fixed it by now if one was coming.You can reproduce the crash by just leaving Windows up for some extended period of time - you don't even have to be doing anything to get it to crash.Now I have no choice but to throw an A/C adapter on it and use the MIDI output of the MPD16 in order to use it.

The drivers are well known to regularly cause blue screen crashes in XP. I am doubtful that new drivers will ever appear for Windows or Vista.

The plot is straight out of some wingnut's fevered imagination with a style about at the level of freshman creative writing. Apparently he feels so strongly about the message that he didn't see any need to cloth it in a believable plot or even mediocre writing.That brings us to the message, delivered with a sludge hammer. If you think Rush Limbaugh is more reliable than the New York Times, Bush was the greatest president ever, soldiers are Boy Scouts with guns, and that Move On has fleets of black helicopters staging right now in Canada, you'll love it.For everyone else with a firmer grasp on reality, it's a blatant right wing screed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"In the afterword Card complains about the Left - Right schism that is afflicting the U.S. and identifies himself as a moderate.

This was just a terrible, awful piece of trash. Clearly, the author has some strong political views. Fine. But the fiction part of this novel wasn't even interesting or coherent for that matter. The story starts abruptly with a major assassination. There's no prep for it and you kind of wonder if it's a joke. Joke because, despite the very serious situation, the characters engage in endless witty banter. After a couple hundred pages, the big bad guy is introduced, again, pulled out of nowhere.

However, he needs to stay away from writing about contemporary or near-contemporary politics. In this book, he creates right-wing heroes and flat left-wing caricatures. People who think that left-leaning people are somehow evil and plan to take over the world will probably like the book. For those that don't see politics in black and white, the complete bias that the author brings will probably leave a sour and unpleasing taste in your mouth.

The plot -- sub-Return of the Jedi walkers as effective weapons to invade New York City with is a small, but I hope helpful example of the sort of thing the book asks you to accept -- only makes sense part of the time. In sum, I don't care how good of a writer Mr. Card is, this particular book is fatally wounded by technical flaws.Forget \\"right-wing rant\\". For one thing, I'm not sure that progressives were the villains of this book any more than extreme conservatives. In fact, the author states this clearly in an afterword. Why not give the author the political benefit of the doubt as giving people the political benefit of the doubt seems to be what this book is designed to advocate. Give the author respect as a fine writer. But, do not pretend that this book is anywhere close to well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I'm a huge Card fan. But this book was REALLY awful. The characterizations of the right and left were WAY over the top. The main characters are always in the middle of the action, not because they are connected to it, but always through coincidence. The technology advancements are not believeable.

I loved the Bean & Ender Series and would picked up a book just because his name was attached without the usual research, recommendations from friends, reading reviews, etc. After reading Empire, those days are over. This book was a disappointment and I felt I was reading a piece of propaganda for the right wing rather than a meaningful piece of fiction.Empire is a quick read, fine for a rainy day if nothing else is available. The characters are shallow and the plot predictable. The book is more of a soapbox than anything else. I guess that's his right to use his publishing clout anyway he wants, he has earned it. It is also mine to look elsewhere for my reading selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget the timely story - just not a great read","review":"Thought this book might be good. Great subject matter, great author.

It's up to two intrepid soldiers, with the help of Bill O'Reilly, to restore America to its righteous redness and save the country from universal health care or something.It's such a great premise for a novel, I can't believe no one ever thought of it before.No wonder nobody invites this guy to sci-fi conventions anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a missed opportunity","review":"The premise was an excellent one, but the execution lacked imagination which, given the author, was a huge surprise. The writing in this book and the easily dated references make it seem as though this book was hurriedly written and put on the shelf before the current political climate changed and the book became dated.If you want to read this book and get any enjoyment out of it, read it before Bush leaves office.I expected so much more from this premise given Card's abilities. I think he threw away infinite possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi Thriller that Delivers","review":"Empire is a terrific read with a suprise twist towards the ending that will shock any reader into submission! This is one of the few political sci-fi thrillers that I just couldn't put down.

In a just society, no one should have the power to withhold from others those same necessities. Those whose purpose in life is the acquisition of worldly goods, and who are incapable of recognizing when they have enough, are to be pitied, not celebrated. The natural tendency of evil people toward monopoly of power is the reason for the existence of government, to level the playing field and protect the weak. But ours is a society that is becoming less just and merciful even as, in the name of justice and mercy, it is also becoming less free in matters of speech, press, and religion, while government is generally doing the opposite of its important functions.\\" - OSC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor OSC","review":"When did he start getting so angry? I don't think his political views came first, I think his abilities have gone down the toilet and that makes him angry.

Every character represents either a noble virtue or odious left-wing vice.The basic premise is ridiculous - the President and VP are killed by a \\"blue state\\" coup d'etat. All the familiar right-wing betes noires are trotted out - anti-military arrogant left-wing professors, Princeton is a hotbed of anti-Americanism, Muslims are all evil and trying to kill us all. There is no nuance and no characters who arise above the author's crude stereotypes. Even the military hero, Maj. Malich, is just a sum total of God-fearing righteousness and superhuman abilities.Trash like this is actually anti-American, as it excites the fantasies of the more fevered right-wing extremists, portrays complex issues as cartoons and accentuates the differences in American society."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid title, although not his typical book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I knew going in it wasn't part of the Ender series...back covers do wonders. Anyone who says they were disappointed because they liked Ender's game and this wasn't Enders game needs to get their heads on straight. It's a solid book, not as good as his other works but his other works were phenomenal. This one is just good. Not great, not awesome just good.The biggest disconnect has to come from the switch of main characters after the first few chaptes. It is hard to realign yourself as the story perspective changes pretty severely. Otherwise I have no gripes with the book...although this is one of the less grounded titles I have read from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice book, but not as advertised","review":"The work itself was excellent as most of Card's material is. The only issue is that Amazon's supply of leather bound books is not in fact the leather bound book. There were two limited edition books produced, the leather bound having an isbn number ending in 1 and the non-leather bound isbn number ending in 2. For whatever reason the plastic slipcovers that identify the book as the leather bound book have been applied to the non-leather limited edition book. This unfortunately results in a rather steep price for a book that is not leather bound. These limited edition books are autographed, but you're probably better off buying the book in its general hardback release and saving yourself money for a product that is not delivered"},{"rating":"1","title":"the great liberal? conspiracy","review":"It's a somewhat bizarre viewpoint: there is a greater \\"liberal\\" conspiracy in existence that is evil.

I'll just say that OSC is much better at making up fictional worlds than writing about this one.He has U.S. troops operating within the borders of the United States, generally a big no-no that requires specific acts of congress, when he could have had the same things done by U.S. marshals, ATF or FBI agents, simply because he wanted to have his one-dimensional soldiers be the heroes throughout.SPOILERHe has his ultimate hero nominated for President by both parties (not just SF here, but outrageous fantasy), and never even mentions the problem of a running mate (an Emperor, after all, doesn't need a vice-Emperor).As for the Progressive Restoration taking over NYC, I leave Aldo Verus with Rick Blaine's advice to Major Strasse: \\"There are certain parts of New york, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Video game or book?","review":"I loved Enders Game and some of his other stuff. And as I started this book, I thought, man this guy is good as you read about Rube, his history and motivations. But then things go haywire. It starts to read more like a script from a video game. Another thing is that as I read I kept thinking did I miss something? A major event happens and he obliquely refers to an earlier event that I actually thought I may not have remembered. First couple times I went back and tried to find something, but after awhile I gave up and just kept reading. I did finish it but only to finish it. Sorry OSC, I think you should have just backed the game and left it at that. If you wanted to present your political views (and thats fine, I don't have to agree with them), it doesn't come across well in to me, what ultimately reads like a narrative from a video game! Get it at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful right-wing blathering","review":"Being a huge fan of the Ender series I could not believe this trashy book was penned by the famous Orson Scott Card. Not only is it extremely offensive to anyone with political views anywhere to the left of Glen Beck's, it is also written in a simplistic language of Danielle Steel. I had to stop reading after 50 pages.

Although his previous works will stand alone, the taint surrounding this effort surely saddens all readers that appreciated said previous efforts. Please, OSC, revert to to the old OSC.

As much as Orson Scott Card would like this to be a novel of great ideas, the sweep of history, and the fragility of our political system, at hits heart \\"Empire\\" is merely a political screed designed to advance today's Republican agenda.Plus it's very poorly written.

That's how poorly written it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Mess","review":"Empire is such a mess of a work that I'm not entirely sure that Orson Scott Card really wrote it. You'd like to believe that such a slipshod offering was ghostwritten by someone else to whom Card merely lent his name for marketing reasons.This book contemplates a revolt by forces secretly financed by a very poorly disguised George Soros. The book is so poorly written and conceived that it is unconvincing in all respects. Empire reads more like right-wing fan fiction than anything else.

I have read many books by Harry Turtledove and other writers who have taken on the subject and done wonderful jobs with it. This was not case with this book.What realy killed the book for me was the ultra right wing angle of the book. As a Republican I can stand a lot of left wing bashing.

Good soldiers are conservative soldiers.I am here on Amazon today to order a different OSC book. A science fiction book.

Regardless of politics or personal views, this is simply, by far, one of the worst books I've ever read in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying right wing diatribe","review":"This is an annoying, poorly-written insulting right-wing diatribe masquerading as a novel. I wouldn't have bothered to write a review, but, especially if you have enjoyed other Orson Scott Card efforts, DO SKIP this one. Don't get me wrong, I've read and enjoyed many distopian, anti-intellectual, post-apocalyptic, militaristic pulp novel guilty pleasures--including more than a few survivalist types and even an Ayn Rand. THIS made me so angry I only made it 30-40 pages or so. If it hadn't been a library book I'd have thrown it at the wall. And I was then OUT of book--nothing to read that night. I NEVER quit a book--especially under those circumstances. I can read just about anything with a plot.THIS was painful and infuriating. SO GLAD I did not PAY for it! Now I don't know if I can read the sequel to Pathfinder. Very disappointed. Bad taste in my mouth.Ugh. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept but surprisingly amateurish dialogue","review":"This type of genre is right down my alley -- military SCIFI/ and conspiracy. Sort of a Six Days in May for the 21st century. But OSC has two distracting habits in this book:1] He allows lightning to strike many more times than twice to key characters.2] He moves the story along with dialogue by simply putting quotation marks around what is really just amateurish narrative. E.g. this random passage pg 301:\\"I'm a sworn soldier of the United States of America, performing my duties according to orders,\\" said Cole, \\"You're a hired goon of XXX XXX, functioning as his private army in order to subvert the United States.\\"Well I also happen to be a \\"sworn soldier of the United States of America\\" and I have never used (or heard any other soldier use) stilted dialogue like this.All that being said, I'll probably buy the 2nd in the series if it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Scenario","review":"I believe some of the poor ratings are because of political disagreement with the concept of a left wing conspiracy. I very much enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The syntax was so bad I stopped reading. Which is why I gave it one star.","review":"I had never before read anything by Orson Scott Card. So I didn't know what to expect. I started reading with great interest. But as I tried to read, sentence after sentence, something seemed wrong. Because it seemed that many sentences ended and started where there should have been commas. Which meant that the syntax, or lack thereof, overwhelmed the development of the characters and the plot.I made it through the second chapter. At which time I found myself unable to contine reading. So I stopped.Maybe it's a style thing. And I just don't get it.Seriously, I never expected anything written this poorly. It's like whoever wrote it doesn't get compound/complex sentence syntax and how to use commas. Just about all the reviews of this book are easier to read than the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"From Enders Game to this?? What happened? I found this book to be very one sided, the characters completely cartoonish and undeveloped, and a lame completely unbelievable story.The premise of the book is great (red state vs. blue state civil war) but the manner in which it is brought off, and the way the characters react is completely implausible.It is bad enough that the author has been beating the Ender horse to death for his last 1/ dozen novels, I can't believe I wasted my money on this.Never again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I bought the new OSC book without a second thought as I have always liked his stories, but this was a big disappointment.First of all, I didn't know that this book was a back story to a video game - lame!Second, is is disapointing to see an intelligent guy strive to be even handed, yet his political preferences come through so transparently. (Military = Good, Academia = Bad)Third, the book is boring and predictable. SO disappointing compared to earlier work.Skip the book, maybe the game will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card can do better","review":"Like others I was really disappointed with this book - I'm a huge OSC fan and have found him to be a skilled and deft writer who can has a wonderful skill at bringing out points in a subtle fashion. The conservative bias here was not subtle nor in my opinion well thought through. I personally love a piece on political issues that helps me to see the value of the prespectives of others - this was not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, just don't overthink it.","review":"I got this book for free off of a community sharing bookshelf, and enjoyed it immensely. Does Card seem to be making some bold and controversial political statements? Yes. Do I care? Not at all. Is it easy to ignore in favor of the fun characters, great action, and fast-paced plot? Absolutely.I think the key here is that I am not a Card fan. I haven't read anything of his before, so I wasn't expecting anything in particular. It seems like a lot of reviewers wanted to take this book way too seriously, and from that perspective, sure, it sucks. But if you let it be what it is, a silly action novel, then you can have some fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Soros Should Sue Card for Libel","review":"Although in the afterword Card pretends that the red state/blue state divide is caused by both sides, the novel certainly clears up who is really worse, LIBERALS. Rush Limbaugh must have edited this \\"novel,\\" with virtuous right-wing military men beating the [..] out of limp-writed liberal pansies who are led, no joke, by a stand-in for George Soros named Aldo Verus. What a waste of time and money, luckily it was a quick read. Card had some good ideas at some point in his career, and I always knew he was conservative, but this is the sort of [...] I would expect from Sean \\"I'm so tough\\" Hannity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major let down","review":"Card has long been one of my favorite authors. I have enjoyed everything that he has written except this. I ended up skimming the last few chapters. What a let down. Its hard to imagine that the man who wrote Ender's Game would put this out under his own name. It was very shallow with no hint of the depths and richness of his other works. I wasn't offended by the political message as it was just so silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak premise, lame dialog","review":"For a good writer, even a weak premise can be turned into a decent story, but not in this case. Which is too bad since Card is a good writer. The biggest annoyance though, is the dialog. On the one hand, it's a supposed to be a conspiracy/political thriller, but then the characters speak and it feels like the story should have been accompanied by a sitcom laugh-track. I had to force myself to finish this book and if I could, I would give it a half-star rating at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I'm a big OSC fan, but this novel was just horrible. I am also a moderate, and despite what the afterward might have you believe, this book is anything but. It's pretty clear where OSC stands politically, but to try to pass this off as a \\"Fair and Balanced\\" view is pretty laughable. And even that could be overlooked if this was a well-written book - it's not. Orson, what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Empire, not so much","review":"Empire by Orson Scott Card is, well, worse than the novelization of a Segal/Norris revenge action flick. Every stereotype (conservative = strong, liberal = weak; father off to save thed world, mother torn between housewife and, you know, saving the world).Throw in dialogue that sounds like a bad partisan speech and, well, you get the point.Too bad, really. The premise is interesting and, with a lot less bias and \\"ready for the big screen-ism\\", could have been teased into a thoughtful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I really enjoyed Ender's Game, but Card seems to be going downhill fast. Bad dialogue, poor plotting, ridiculous plot devices - it might make a good videogame, but only if you play with the sound turned off. Hopefully, this dreck represents the nadir of Card's writing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good thing I have a good library","review":"... beacuse otherwise I might have ended up buying this book.Like some reviewers have already commented on, in the long run it doesn't really matter what your political convictions/religious beliefs are, as long as it's a good read. Which this most assuredly isn't. Card, who's given us gems like the Ender-series and quite a few other good stuff as well, well and truly dropped the ball this time.The citizens of NY condoning the murder of it's policemen and firemen? NYs finest wiped out? The NY citiziens and politicos would stand for this and decide it's ok? After 9-11? Good god, but this book has a stupid premise. It's disbelief suspended by the neck until dead, dead, dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me Ann Coulter","review":"A reader of the Ender's series and several others by Card, I expected a good plot, fair handling of the subject, and balanced character development. While reading the first several chapters, I detected a very conservative bias to the plot and character development. This perception was not different at the end of the book. Maybe I am sensitive to the label of \\"liberal,\\" or maybe the 140 hours of graduate level work in engineering and mathematics has warped my mind. But, this novel appears to have a right-wing evangelistic flavor. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and should not be compared to the Ender's Series","review":"I personally found this book to be quite the fun and entertaining read. Finishing this book in approximately four days, I couldn't put it down. I've talked to my brother in law about if we had a civil war in some big or small way, but I thought that Orson did a great job in bringing the characters in a somewhat unfashionable reality of what transpires in the book.The mistake would be to compare this book to the Ender Series because it just is not the case with this book. Treat it as a fresh new read and I bet you'll enjoy the book. If you enjoy conspiracy theory or somewhat interested in militaristic and American ideology, this book would be a fun read for you.What is almost scary is that I can almost see this happening in today's America. (of course, that is just my own unprofessional observation and should not weigh on the books recommendation)"},{"rating":"2","title":"some nice surprises","review":"Politics aside, this is a pretty good story. It has a couple of big surprises late in the book. What makes it an interesting read is that it is relevant to our times. Thus making the story interesting because you can feel that this could really happen. When I'm watching an action movie sometimes I'll say to myself \\"that could never happen.\\" and I lose interest in it. But the actions taken by the good guys and bad guys seem reasonable and realistic. There is no one Arnold Schwarzenegger character that takes on the enemy all by himself and saves the day. Card does a nice job of letting the audience know that these people are not supermen, that they were put in a very nasty situation and are doing what has to be done to save the United States. But it's too bad that people rate this book based on their political view rather then the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor entertainment","review":"Honestly it seems more of a statement about morals and politics then a story. Major ontrast to the ender series, which while very moral are also slow paced, this is jumping around like it is on crack, and sometimes makes as much sense. Plot is terrible and rather confusing on how it jumps around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable - even Ender couldn't have saved it","review":"As a fan of Card's Ender novels, I had high hopes that this would be a quick and enjoyable read. However, I couldn't even get through it. You know you're in trouble when there is a sequence of total implausible acts by the leading characters. Even if you try to suspend disbelief, as scifi readers are able to do, Card bludgeons you with characters who are caricatures of themselves. The protagonist, Reuben, comes from the Paranoia 7 school, except that people are really out to get him. Cole shows up at just the right time and place, and is looking in exactly the right direction, to make a critical discovery early in the novel. This is all just too much to accept. The good news is that I got this book from the public library and returned it before it was due. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card Is So Much Better Than This","review":"I tried four times to read this novel and finally tossed it aside. Having visited Card's website I knew well his political viewpoints, but an author's politics have never stopped me from reading and enjoying a good story (at least in the fiction genre; non-fiction is a different story). But it's not really the political viewpoint expressed in the novel that turned me off; it was the one-dimensional, derivative characters and poorly-developed plot. I've enjoyed most of Card's science fiction and fantasy novels, and you would have to have your head in the sand to miss the politics that are woven through some of then, but a good story is a good story. That's the problem with Empire: it's just not a good story. That's also Card's problem these days: he can't seem to write a good story anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a disappointing book","review":"How far, far away from the genius of Ender's Game has Orson Scott Card come? This novel is, essentially, a reactonary screed against liberals. Which, depending on your political orientation, may delight or infuriate you. What is truly disappointing, however, is that the novel is poorly written, that its characters are all one-dimensional, and that the plot veers wildly and makes little sense. All in all, it's hard for me to reconcile the fact that an author capable of creating a work of genius such as Ender's Game could put his name on something as abysmally pathetic as this book. Most of the comments in this thread focus on the author's transparent political leanings. They should really focus on the fact that this is simply an awful novel. Don't waste your money, or more importantly you time, with this steaming pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Card from the bottom of the deck","review":"I am still not quite convinced that Orson Scott Card wrote this. It seems a little too trite for him. Maybe just a hack attempt at a quick paycheck. This is perhaps the epitome of \\"never judge a book by it's cover\\", the cover art has absolutely nothing to do with the story. This story definitely was not firing on all cylinders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it.......","review":"OSC is/was? one of my favorite writers. I have read just about everything he has written since I first read \\"The Folk of the Fringe\\". This book is terrible. Poorly written with unbelievable plot and lousy dialogue.No point going on there are enough bad reviews here that got it right,so disappointing......"},{"rating":"1","title":"just garbage","review":"i'm not even going to touch the political aspect, because it's not what matters - what matters is, this book is just terrible. awful dialogue. gaping plot holes in every chapter. things not explained. one-dimensional characters. pretty much every mistake an author could make - and from such a seasoned veteran, who has written so many amazing books, it hurts me. i want to know who green-lighted this book so i can take their editor hat away from them. and make them eat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I only got about halfway through before I set this thing aside in disgust.I like books that have a point of view so that's certainly not my problem. No, my problem is that the author couldn't seem to decide what, exactly, his point of was. He seems so hell-bent on portraying the left and the right as equally rabid and dangerous that the book comes across as incoherent and confused. It is certainly unreadable, I only got as far into it as I did because I kept telling myself that it couldn't possibly be this bad all the way through. Wrong. Save yourself some aggravation, pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank god I got this from the library...","review":"First the disclaimers: I only read the first 100 pages and I'm a pretty extreme left winger on social issues.I never imagined this book could be so awful. It is essentially a package to present mindless blathering on political issues and uses every canned cliche of the \\"liberal media.\\" I couldn't finish it. I'm so irritated by this book I'm venting it out here rather than waiting a bit and crafting a more decent review.I really enjoyed the entire Ender series and generally have found OSC's other books at least passably readable. However, I seriously doubt I will ever consider picking up another of his books without first getting some glowing recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire is another amazing OSC novel","review":"OSC is my all time favorite author, but like any writer he has his ups and downs. I honestly thought that this one would be a down but it wasn't. It was proving his ever changing skills with words making a thriller unlike any he had before. It does feel like a movie reading it which I normally wouldn't like, but with OSC his characters are always so endeering and you instantly bond with and empathize with them and so the movie aspect actually is acceptable. Rube and Cole will be right in my heart with Ender, Lanik, Jason Worthing, Nafai and Alvin. He is the master of the tragic hero. Joseph Campbell would be proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frighteningly REAL","review":"I eagerly awaited this book, and devoured it once it arrived. What I loved was a character who stayed true to his oaths. Bad is bad and the affiliations didn't matter.Politically these days it is hard to tell the red from the blue. They all seem to mesh into one giant confusing philosophy that determines who is \\"in\\" and who is \\"out\\" based on small but specific issues. One cannot be liberal in some aspects as well as a conservative in others without being reviled by both groups.Card's comments at the end of the book were so incredibly powerful. I found the book believable, it is a work of Sci-Fi, and with all the technology that is currently available, yeah it could happen.Card is a powerful author, and continues to be a powerful author, by looking at reality, and taking it one step further to see the possibilities that exist, could exist, and probaly do exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Card Thinking?","review":"I briefly read through the reviews and thought, It's Orson Scott Card! How can they give it only one star! After reading the first five chapters, I can see why.Absolutely nothing I read was believable. The characters acted and talked so unrealistically I couldn't believe it myself, that the master storyteller who wrote The Worthing Saga and People of the Fringe had actually signed his name to this. I felt even worse not finishing this book than when I realized that that Card's great Homecoming series was just the Book of Mormon fictionalized.Some of Card's non-fantasy works are readable (Lost Boys), but this one wasn't. Card should stick to fantasy and SF where his political views don't get in the way of his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure propaganda trash","review":"If Ann Coulter and Tom Clancy had a retarded love-child he would have written this novel.I have read, and liked most of Cards previous works, but this one reads like it was funded by the RNC. No scratch that, it reads like it was ghost written by Karl Rove.Filled with one-dimensional characters and absurd plot lines, \\"Empire\\" is a \\"must not read\\" for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink, Stank, Stunk!","review":"Man, going in with high expectations proved to be a grand awful mistake as the book pondered on and on and on and on then OSC tops that slogging by committing the cardinal sin of killing off the primary hero character mid-way through the freaking story! What schmuck would do that?! It would be akin to killing off Neo in the fist Matrix movie and hoping the story would carry it the rest of the way. It was not worth the $1.00 that I paid for it at Big Lots...a clue that it was a remaider stinkeroo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really aweful","review":"Whether it was written by OSC or someone else, this book is aweful.

I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had. I was given a case number, but when I called HP back stating my case number, they said that this was no longer a free call.

Your product uses an excessive amount of ink now, requires frequent 'burping' and print quality is lackluster. Very disappointed. If you only want a printer to function for ~ 1 - 1.5 years, then HP products are for you. They do NOT even offer print driver support on models over 2- 3 years old. INCREDIBLE! I had replaced with a HP product and it started performing abysmally as well with 'ink system failure' notifications. Google search it and see the atrocious design of HP. Disgusting.

We picked up the 8450 a couple of years ago and it seemed to be a good deal at the time, nice features, good brand, but it's been fussy from the get-go and it's not all due to owner ignorance. Technical support is not much help either. I've given up fighting with it to try and get it to print the way it's supposed to. We can print single sheets, usually, if there's a small (but not too small) stack of paper. Too many -- and it jams. Too few -- and it jams.

Too bad, it was a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but not finished..","review":"\\"Carnivale\\" was one of my favorite shows to watch. It was well written and very well acted. The art direction was genius -- every conceiveable detail of 1930's America seemed to breathe with life on the screen.\\"Carnivale\\" was also haunting. There were elements of the story so freaky I had to watch it with the lights on. And yet it was so captivating I kept coming back for more.So, if it was so brilliant, why only two stars?Because HBO cut this show so short of its potential it was shameful. The show wasn't getting the ratings that the other HBO original shows were, so just when the story was really starting to get interesting, it was cut short. I felt completely hoodwinked as a viewer and fan. This DVD set just confirms it. HBO, with their deep pockets, could have at least given it one more season, to tie up the story arcs more neatly, as a courtesy to the many hardcore fans of this show. Instead they truncated it -- and yet they're still selling it! What jerks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I found the first season enthralling and original.It is obvious by the second season that there is no plot and the characters and situations are sensational and maudlin if not corny. Why did HBO cancel a great show like Deadwood and keep producing a grotesque unredeemed production like Carnivale? At the end of season one of Carnivale, the most interesting characters, Lodz (dissapears), the bearded lady and the diminutive Carnival master's roles are diminished and the story slides into the tawdry and incomprehensible. I won't finish watching this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnivale: Very Entertaining","review":"Between the cinematography and the story line, this series left me in awe. I put each in the DVD's one after the other. I lost sleep because I would not turn it off till my eyes couldn't stay open any longer. It kept you wanting more because you had no idea what awaits on the next DVD.I highly recommend picking it up. I didn't purchase the series until the price came down a bit. Now I know why it took 2-3 years for it to go from $100 down to $25-40 (depending on condition). This is a must have for your DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else can I say?","review":"The special features at the end of season 1 explained why the show wasn't renewed: I mean, costuming 5000 people a year? 3-4 days to set up/breakdown the carnivale set? CGI on an epic scale? HBO must have seen a steady flow of dollars blowing out of its accounts. And the viewership simply wasn't there during the course of the show's run.It didn't make the non-renewal any less bittersweet for those of us who love this show. An extraordinary cast coupled to extraordinary scripts - it was as amazing as it was different. It wasn't television - it was HBO.Ultimately, it wasn't even HBO - it was DOAPerhaps it was too slow for America. Or too dark (figuratively and literally). Or maybe just too wierd. But my god it was a compelling spectacle.Goodbye Carnivale. We'll miss you. OK children, time to shake some dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome but...","review":"I really enjoyed watching it. It answered most of my questions from the previous season but it still left me hanging. My husband and I kinda figured the ending. I hope the creators would consider another mini-series to tie up the loose ends, or just make a 2-hr movie. Is that even possible? :-)Anyway, thumbs up on the creators, directors, actors and actresses!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring Back Carnivale!!","review":"Carnivale is the most well acted, beautifully shot, wonderfully written and strangest tv show to grace our screens since Twin Peaks. A rare gem filled with mystery, emotion and intrigue. HBO had the hindsight to get behind this show from the start and i plead with them to let this show be recommissioned for further series (past season 2)to enable some closure for the loyal legions of fans out there. To simply axe this show mid way is extremelly unfair to those whom trusted HBO's judgement from the beginning and jumped on board this wonderfully surreal ride. Please ensure this show is given the respect it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing show....but unfinished!","review":"This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. If you like suspense, mystery, or horror, you must watch Carnivale. The only complaint I have is the cliff hanger we are left with after the second (and final) season. I read somewhere on the HBO website that the executives thought they \\"tied it up nicely\\", even though they cancelled it prematurely. Well, um no, sorry HBO....you cut if off just as it was hitting it's stride. The end is not really an ending, but a new beginning with the forces of good vs. evil. The fact that they cancelled it is unforgivable and I will never subscribe to HBO again, unless they bring back Carnivale. I could go on all day....fortunately for you (the reader), I hate typing. Anyways, I do recommend that you add both seasons to your collection, just be prepared for a jacked up ending. What's here is top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"Just watched both seasons in a matter of 5 days and it was amazingly compelling and original.

Fantastic acting. Amazing characters. Intriguing setting. Had it continued that way it would definitely have warranted five stars, but it doesn't. The acting remains great, but the story just meanders off course and becomes virtually random. New characters are introduced that serve no purpose to the story, and some interesting established characters just disappear without explanation. Technically the show does wrap up, but the ending is so forced and unsatisfying as to make you feel the whole effort of watching was a complete waste of time. Carnivale had the potential to be one of the best shows ever. Instead it crashed and burned. A real shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Service & Quality Product!!","review":"Carnivale: The Complete First SeasonDvds were delivered very quickly after placing the order.

Many times it's pace slowed to a 'they could do without this' kind of crawl.Season 2 is much more foced, aggresive & obviously with a story to tell. It completes the tale that could have been told in a single season by adding three (about) episodes serving storyline needs that were fluffed to 12 (in season 1).Otherwise, excellent, fairly origional story.

Furthermore, those conductors are so delicate that normal use of the cable breaks them. I found all of this out when two of the three conductors in my cable failed and I thought that the problem was likely in one of the connectors.

I only understand very little Greek but it's the whole emotions that Anna puts into her voice which gets me. The album \\"Klima Tropiko\\" is very emotional and has fabulous arrangements. I really adore it, it's very dramatic and has a great style. I can't say much about the lyrics because my Greek isn't good enough. But still whenever I hear the beginning of one of these songs I feel excited. And that has nothing to do with a summerfeeling (I was in Cyprus also in winter), it's Anna's great charisma that she succeeds in transfering into her infectuous songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"\\"Klima Tropiko\\" is an album where Anna fuses Rock with Greek musical traditions...and is surely one of her best-ever works! Every song on this album tells its own story and stands as a work of musical art on its own. In some songs, Anna has so much emotion and power in her voice, it is almost frightening. Particular standout tracks: \\"Trelenome\\", \\"Paralio\\", \\"Parte ta Ola\\", \\"Ekatomiria\\", \\"Agoni Grami\\". But perhaps the best of all is the cleverly symbolic \\"Sentonia\\", where Anna forgets her ex lover by having new bed sheets to go with her new attitude! This album was a platinum seller in Greece (1996/97), and was seen as Anna's comeback to her rightful position at the top of the music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klima Tropico","review":"I believe that \\"Klima Tropico\\" is one of the best cd's Anna Vissi has given us because it contains different styles from rock (Oti mou zitisis) to \\"zeibekiko\\" (Ekatommyria) and ballads (Eleni).

If like me there was not enough room to use a breaker-bar and socket you probably won't get it off.You would be better served with the OEM equal tools from OTC.

Of course being newer everything was a little smoother, but it has two problems that made it unacceptable to me. The first is that it requires constant - daily or weekly - oiling (my Singer only needed annual oiling) in 5 different places, some of which were not clearly indicated in the manual (brief and annoying to follow) and all of which were difficult to access. Also, pictures in the manual did not match the machine I received. The second big problem is that the it does not have a drop-in bobbin, something I thought surely would have become standard in the last 35 years! My old Singer had a drop-in bobbin and it is a feature I am not willing to give up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"I love this machine!

It takes a long time to release steam and smell the medicine. It also does not go through the water very quickly. I can leave it on constantly for days and the water level will not drop very much. I tried adding salt but it makes little difference, without adding too much. I used to have the larger 1.5 gallon version and it warmed up faster, used up the water quicker, and created a stronger menthol smell (when adding the medicine). I do not think it is a problem with the brand, perhaps just the particular model or even the particular machine. Maybe it is meant to work on a low setting because it is advertised as being used in the nursery--near the baby? I need a second vaporizer to use in my room and I'm really not sure if I want to give this model a second chance or buy the bigger one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap and works great","review":"Pros: Good price.

Still a good buy to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"I bought this and it worked fine the first time that I used it. Granted, it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom. However, I have tried it in my infant's room 4 times this winter. I used HOT water & salt to try to help it, but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam. Maybe all of the \\"steam\\" energy is being used on the night light!

It has worked well enough for the last seven months until tonight.At bedtime my husband smelled something burning. When I walked into the nursery to put my son down, I saw smoke coming from the humidifier. The entire room was a hazy.We immediately brought the humidifier outside and checked the water level. There was at least two inches.We never thought this would happen but there is NO on/off switch to regulate it yourself, you have to unplug it from the wall.

I ran to Walmart in hopes of picking up a cheap cool mist humidifier however this was all they had for under $20. I got home and set it up following all the directions and sure enough after plugging it in no steam came out. I added a bit of salt and almost instantly it began to work. It's been running for about 4 hours now and the vapor pads are already dried out and the tank was almost empty. I just refilled it and hopefully it will last until morning.

However, after 2-3 hours, the water is filled with soot and the mist starts to smell like soot. It's hard to explain. I think it's a piece of junk and will have to buy yet another humidifier.

But every once in a while you need a new author to break the monotony. The \\"new\\" Koontz style (Velocity, The Good Guy, The Husband) are very close the the Patterson style with short chapters and an easy read. Also if you havent read The Up And Comer or The Promise of A Lie by Howard Roughan you are missing out. Enjoying Roughans books very much as he is also a coauthor of Pattersons venturing out on his solo career, I gave Gross a shot.The Blue Zone is very good. Being only an inch thick and a quick read is the only disappointment. Dont get me wrong I dont like books that keep you up at night reading useless information, but I prefer a book that doesnt look like a 5th graders class assignment for a book report.The book is good and I hope theres plenty more to come....make it longer and give us more!May Howard and Andrew push out books as fast as James so we have more to read!!!!!DK"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true page-turner!","review":"Just when you think that the thriller novel has become somewhat formulaic, along comes this solo debut by Andrew Gross to remind you of how well-crafted characters can enhance a good plot. You truly care about these people and cannot wait to turn the page to find out what happens next. Gross' use of short chapters keeps the narrative flowing quickly as the plot proceeds on several layers, converging at the end into a coherent and satisfying conclusion.

That said this book is a major disappointment. The main reason is that everything is telegraphed. There are parts of this book where if you can't guess what happens next your not paying any attention to what you're reading. None of the major twists in this book come as a surprise as you see them coming miles (or chapters) away.

After a prologue that basically tells you nothing, the adventure begins. How a lab technician manages to penetrate the Witness Protection Program to find her family is only one of many discrepancies that made me say \\"Hello? Can we have a dash of reality here?\\" The enigmatic \\"fraternidad\\" is not given enough weight to justify the rest of the plot. That said, it was the kind of enjoyable book that is good to read while commuting on a train - you don't have to pay much attention, and you won't miss your stop. But then you're going to want to read something more substantial afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition, repetition,repetition","review":"While the premise is good, the author defuses any suspense by repeating every event over and over.

I give novels to a friend after reading but this is too crappy to pass onto another. James Patterson is a master storyteller and even his worst novels are fun and entertaining, so now I know that he's the one who keeps his co-written books with Andrew Gross on a readable level. This book is SILLY. I'll never know how it ends but hopefully the main character gets killed, she's too boring to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real thriller","review":"The Blue Zone is the first Andrew Gross book I've read, and it was really suspenseful.

A little slow the first chapter or two which was necessary to establish the plot. After that it twists and turns so that you have no idea how it will end. Similar to a Harlan Coben novel.

The two Czech players acquit themselves exceptionally well, their playing is stylish and warm, and the modern DDD recording is full, warm and more than adequate in any regard. The Russian cello-piano literature isn't familiar territory to most classical music fans and it isn't familiar to me, either. I bought this for the Borodin, which I have enjoyed on other recordings. The large piece seems to be the Profofiev, which was written for Rostropovich. I am not a great fan of Prokofiev, finding his spiky and repetitve style often at odds with my own sensibilities. This piece has a great level of invention and keeps the listener involved throughout. The more familiar Borodin and Stravinsky are also done well. So here's a vote for some unfamiliar music you may want to add to your library if your only exposure in this genre is the Beethoven cello-piano sontatas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit, nice adjustable nose piece for larger heads","review":"The lens is a great color for indoor pool areas where it's not so bright.

Whether intentionally playing on Maynard James Keenan's (Tool) majestic vocals or not, \\"Wonder what's Next\\" proves to be a fine commercial debut album, which indeed is riddled with almost subliminal guitar riffs and soaring vocals.

Hopefully several more albums from this very talented group of guys. While being compared to the likes of Taproot and Live, I believe that Chevelle actually surpasses the music of the two aformentioned rock bands, and does so admirably. Many of the songs on this disk mine emotions that rock fans are used to dealing with: Anger, Distrust, Disappointment, Rage, and Loss. However, Chevelle has somehow found a way to make these subjects sound and feel fresh. Comfortable Liar, a bass-thumping riff-heavy ode to betrayal, gets deep in your gut and lingers there. The Red, a critical look at acceptance and disapproval really makes you think about how you may have treated people in your past, and the consequences you may receive for it. Highly recommended.Standout tracks:Family SystemSend the Pain BelowThe RedComfortable LiarForfeitAn Evening with El Diablo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Power","review":"I had hoped Chevelle would make an album like this after their debut, Point #1. The songs have come out heavier, more polished, and (in my opinion) better on this go round, while still keeping the rough sound of Point #1.Songs like \\"Wonder What's Next\\", \\"Comfortable Liar\\", and \\"Family System\\" have thick grinding riffs and shout vocals combined with heavy pounding drums.\\"Send the Pain Below\\" and \\"The Red\\" feature catchy choruses and thick guitar chords.\\"An Evening with El Diablo\\" is just one hell of a rock song. Great bass riff, great guitar riff, and on point drumming combined with a sing a long chorus (in a dark way) make for my favorite song on the album.\\"One Lonely Visitor\\" is a somber acoustic way to end the album...it's done very well.Overall, this album is heavier than the previous, and is certainly catchier in many aspects. Chevelle have put together a great collection of songs that will please fans of heavy rock music.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Right Track","review":"The Amazon reviewer's got a point about lots of modern rock sounding alike... But the almost operatic vocals and intensely personal lyrics (at times sounding like the ranting of someone barely holding their sanity together, at times perfect clarity, it's beautiful) are what make Chevelle truly stand out. I don't know what I expected when I opened the CD, but this picture of three unbelievably ordinary looking guys was a surprise. These brothers make a big noise, you can hear that they've been playing together a long time, and I'm looking forward to more in the vein of \\"The Red,\\" \\"Send the Pain Below,\\" \\"Comfortable Liar\\" and \\"Closure.\\" And that beautiful, beautiful voice. So nice to hear a rocker who doesn't either rap or whine these days! Looking forward to watching Chevelle mature as a band..."},{"rating":"2","title":"After listening to this album.....a fan of Chevelle","review":"This is my type of music. Chevelle reminds me of Staind in music style and lyric type. Whilst I am not saying Chevelle is better than Staind, cause I am not, this band produces some top range music in this their sophmore album 'Wonder What's Next'. This CD comes with an enhanced multimedia part that includes a photo gallery and the music video clip of the song 'The Red' as well as a brief documentary on the 'Making of The Red Clip'. For me 4 songs made this album and they all recieved and still recieve air time on Rock stations here in Australia and my city Sydney. These songs are; 'Sent The Pain Down', 'Closure', 'The Red' and 'Grab Thy Hand'. The songs are a mixture of heavy rock with a period of soft rock and throaty vocals.Great album by Chevelle who are a trio all related by birth. I am now a fan of this great band from the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"they must try hard to be this bad","review":"Honestly, this is one of the worst bands I have ever heard, and I don't just say that about any band I don't like. The musicians in the band have NO skill, and the lead singer sounds like he has been constipated for 2 months. Reeeeeallly bad Maynard impression. As for the lyrics, it's the same old Linkin Park-ish whining about \\"torment\\" and \\"agony.\\" I understand they're all brothers; their parents must be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"eeww...!","review":"I think I can sum up this review in less than a very short paragraph . This CD is not worth the money, all Chevelle is are wannabe rock stars that have mediocre talent. Perhaps, they will improve in the future. Everytime my brother plays this, I want to rip it out of the CD player and bash it over my knee. I do have a postitve though, and they can write decent lyrics, some actually mean something. But you need to have talented musicians to play the lyrics! Better luck next time Chevelle."},{"rating":"1","title":"too nu metal","review":"I was first attracted to Chevelle because of how much the song Mia sounded (and the video looked) like Tool. I liked their first album a lot, though it seemed somewhat unpolished. Their new CD, however, seems too \\"Nu-Metal\\" to me. If you like Trust Company and other bands like that, you'll probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i have always liked this band and i was amazed when i heard the full cd. if you like system of a down and stonesour this might be close to your taste... if this is your taste try stonesour and system of a down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Review","review":"At first, I anticpated that the only song on the CD that I would like was, The Red. Now that I have listened to it, I am wrong. The whole CD is wothy of being listened to again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh","review":"The only tracks of true quality on this CD are the Red, Send the Pain Below, and An Evening with El Diablo. My advice would be to just download them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Im a new fan of Chevelle well actually I heard them on a local radio station and they were at a local radio concert last year, but i never really paid much attention to them.i heard send the pain below and fell in love immediately. i knew that this would be a great band. so i downloaded some of chevelles songs...forfeit, comfortable liar, and family system...i loved them. so i bought the cd.that was about 6 months ago. up to this day wonder whats next has not been out of my cd player.my favorite song off this album is Closure. I love the emotion and the lyrics are excellent. its a great song for when your down...but i love it anytime.i recommend this for anyone who is into bands like trust company and tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helmet with better vocals","review":"Only knew the radio songs when i picked this up. great album. these guys must have listened to a lot of Helmet growing up, because they sound exactly like them in spots. to me, that's a good thing. they also have some droning My Bloody Valentine thing going on here and there too. that said, they seem to be their own band, and they are damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock album of our generation","review":"If you listen to Alternative rock and haven't listened to this CD, you must be living under a rock. Their singles on this CD may have been overplayed on the radio, but they're still really good and the rest of the songs on the CD rock even harder. Chevelle has a very unique sound and this was their first mainstream CD that really hit home with me personally. Give it a listen and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!!!","review":"This is Chevelle's second cd and it's one of there best one's. This cd is amazing, and if you don't have it yet I recommend that you get yourself a copy. This cd won't dissappoint you it's one of my favorite cds!! If you like Chevelle you'll like this cd, so if you don't have a copy already what are you waiting for? Get yourself a copy today!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You've all lost it (period)","review":"Chevelle is an amazing band. I agree yes his voice is a bit similar to Maynards however it is not close enough for any fool to sit here and say that Tool or Maynard should sue, you are insane if you say the music is similar. Chevelle is one of the most unique groups that I have heard in years, and they are one of the most creative. Wonder What's Next is a great CD, but the new one, has blown it out out of the water, it is like they went to sleep stars and we reborn into geniuses. They are an inspiration, I could only wish to be as talented as they are. I could listen to both of these CDs over and over..oh wait...I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This CD is brilliant. The vocals and lyrics are awesome, and the guitar is great aswell. If your a rock fan definatly buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Paying For","review":"I won this CD so I really can't complain, but I will anyway. Out of eleven songs, there's only one really worth listening to, and it's The Red, the song I've heard so many times I'm about to scream. If you really want this CD just download it because I don't think you should pay for this piece of recycled garbage. Better yet, don't waste hard drive space and buy a Deftones CD, you get the same affect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah they're good but...","review":"90% of the people that listen to this listen to Evanescence, Trapt and a bunch of other crap. It shouldn't be that way. I'm sorry but it shouldn't. Did you know their first album was produced by heavy-weight indie producer of Fugazi, Nirvana, Jesus Lizard and Bush fame Steve Albini? No? If you like this NOT only should you check out Tool and Helmet, but I believe Quicksand plays just a major role here. Anyway; take it easy, if it's easy take it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album from a Great Band","review":"I really like this cd...it is one of the best I have listened to in the past decade. The music is complex, regardless of the lead singer doing both vocals and lead guitar. Chevelle is a great band who have excellent lyrics, and have produced an incredible album racked with emotion. You can hear the soul pouring out in the lyrics. I would like to add that Chevelle should not be placed amoung bands like Slipknot and Mudvayne, as their music is nothing alike those bands who are comprised of angry suburban kids who are mad at the world because they grew up in a middle class home...they have nothing to be angry about...Slipknot and Mudvayne are boy-bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really wonder what's next...","review":"Anyway...Chevelle's new album is nothing but astonishing. They showed a lot of promise & what they can do with an extremely low budget for studio sessions on \\"Point #1\\", so on this one they fully achieve their potential while distancing themselves from the nu-rock crowd. There's nothin' new or groundbreaking here, folks. What you'll find is a lot of musicianship & emotion in some of the best structured songs from a major label heavy music band in years. Couple of quick examples: the guitars on \\"Family System\\" & that riff, like a minute into \\"Don't Fake This!\\" are the heaviest music I've heard this year. They do suffer, because of their repetitive & sometimes unoriginal lyrics, but overall this album is pretty awesome....to be continued. gotta go to work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Booya!","review":"Chevelle's \\"Wonder What's Next\\" cd is a deep lyrical experience. These three brothers have the similar vocality of Bush and Tool, the instrumentals of Deftones, and the lyrics that express it all. They bring a slightly different mix to the music scene, they are still pretty young and new, with only one album that has been previouly released to this one in 1999. This album is far better than their first, \\"Point #1\\". This album excels in their instrumental and rhythmic capabilities. This album is filled with catchy deep melodic songs and heavy guitar riffs that only a true rock fan would appreciate. If you truly appreciate rock, you would love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok....","review":"Whats so special about this cd? Its not like they are great musicians or anything, and if anyone says they are give me break any jerk can pick up a guitar and play these songs. If you want to play some challenging songs on the guitar check out Mudvayne, Slipknot, or Tool. This band is just another trendy wanna be rock band. Hey if you like that sort of stuff get it, otherwise stick with some real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY ARE NOT CHRISTIAN","review":"They did an interview back in July on MTV, where they were asked about are they or not Christian. They said they go to church sometimes, but they are defently not a Christian band. They said they rode the Christian band wagon to get famous, just like Evenesence (?). They said this word for word on national televison. I loved them, till they lied. So one star for them cause i use to like them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything that's wrong with rock music","review":"I can't even begin to describe how much this band sucks. Suffice it to say that you will probably enjoy this cd if you are a fan of talentless nu-metal bands like Staind and Taproot. I bought this because I was trying to find a new band in the same vein as 90s crunch masters like Helmet and Quicksand, but I was severely disappointed. This is a cd for people who like their music simplistic, plodding, one-dimensional, and repetitive. Wonder what's next?--How about another song just as bad as the one that preceded it! After the third song of lifeless droning, it just becomes annoying as the torment continues unabated. I've listened to this cd several times in an attempt to understand what so many others like about it, but I've concluded that I won't be able to fully appreciate this band until I can learn to fall asleep and puke at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew Chevelle would get big and sure enough they did","review":"I saw Mia on a rock show a long time ago, and instantly I knew this band could be successful. I quickly bought Point number 1 and was hooked. Wonder Whats next takes a giant leap. Every song is enjoyable and fun to listen to. OF course I went to see them live with Local H and I went only for Chevelle. They totally blew local h away. They blow me away still. I dont think Ill ever get sick of this cd, and Im soo glad there starting to get well known cuz they deserve it"},{"rating":"2","title":"What? Mainstream rock done well?","review":"This is one of the few mainstream 'rock' albums that's worth more than it's alloted 'air time'. This happens to be an excellent, in depth, album. My only main critique happens to be that I don't feel they let their songs develop enough before breaking into the main chorus, I just feel that they need to tack on a few extra bars at the begining of some of their songs in order for the 'mood' to be set. But other than that, this band works remarkebly well together and are definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing Red Again","review":"Ok, i got this cd, and I thought it was ok, so i gave it a 3, then i started listning to it, then i said wow this is some really awsome stuff, so i gave it a 4, then i listned to the whole cd, and guess what, I gave it a \\"5\\". I mean what do we want in a band? Well, i make a list : heavy, melodic, good vocals, very good bass for a rock group, songs have very deep meaning, and whats more, its all in one band called Chevelle.I first heard the song \\"the Red\\" on the readio and said, \\"wow this is some tight ... . My recommendation is to check this out, and buy it. If u dont like it, then u dont know what good music is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Hitting, Hard Rock, Damn Right","review":"This CD is very much worth a listen. They have a style that borrows from Tool with harmonious vocals, heavy guitar and low end bass and a hard beats. But they have a more simple style than Tool. The lyrics are dark talking about pain and angst. I own Point #1 and if you bought this album, I suggest you get Point#1, I feel it's superior to this one. If you are tired of much of the musical none sense out there and want something with more substance and heart. Give these guys a hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Their Own Write","review":"Chevelle isn't exactly copying everything else out there. They don't follow a traditional songwriting structure (verse, chorus, verse...etc) for most of their songs. When I first got the album, I was just expecting every song to come out with a chorus that just blasted me away. But a blasting, catchy chorus is great for a good mood. And Chevelle helps when you're angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I got this CD yesterday, and it has not left my CD player. I am extremely impressed. Pete Loeffler has a very good voice, but, contrary to popular belief, does not sound much like Maynard James Keenan from Tool. His smoothness resembles him, but other than that, not too much. Chevelle does not sound much like Tool either, as people think. If anything they are more A Perfect Circle...possibly some Undertow(Tool) in there, but not much. They are still fantastic, and who wants a copy off Tool? Tool is its own. Chevelle are making a place for themselves in rock music also. Oh, they are not a Christian band, either. i read an interview and Pete Loeffler said that Squint Records told Chevelle that they were not a Christian Label. All good. Buy this cd.Another by the way, Tool is possibly the greatest band ever. But all of their CDs. Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome HARD ROCK","review":"I became a fan of chevelle when I saw the Point #1 video playing late at night on mtv. I bought their first album and I give it 5 stars although I didnt make a review. They have a hard rock tool like style that displays an awesome talent. If you like Tool give these guys a listen. They have a much \\"rougher\\" style. I love this album from start to finish, even the live track. I dont think of this album as metal, more like good hard rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevelle does it again","review":"The Chevelle ablum \\"Wonder Whats Next\\" i think is one of Chevelle's best albums yet. The song \\"The Red\\" is one of two songs that got me into the band. The other song is \\" Tug-war\\" witch i will talk about in the review for \\" This tipe of Thiking\\". \\"Wonder Whats Nexts\\" has a lot of real good songs like, \\"Family System\\",\\"Send the Pain Below\\", \\"Closure\\",\\"The Red\\", \\"An Evening With El Diablo\\", and \\"And Wonder Whats next\\". I think \\" Wonder Whats next\\" is one of my faverite songs by Chevelle becuase it is about how the band has fun righting music together intill they have to reliy on it as a career. It should be noteded that i know that by reading the lyrics. So to understand it like do i you showed read lyrics.You can listen to most of Chevelle's songs and read most of there lyrics at there web site [...]. Check it out if you are thinking about buying one of there albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably good","review":"One of my most cherished albums of all time, spent ages trying to buy this one in stores and eventually resorted to buying it on Amazon and let me just say that this is without doubt the best Chevelle album and thats hard to believe considering they have failed to release a disappointing album yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO!!","review":"This album is so boring! Every song is exactly the same. And on top of that, they use like one chord per song! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"too repetitive!","review":"I was in the market for another straight ahead rock record when I came across \\"chevelle's wonder what's next\\". I had to choose between that and the new Alter Bridge. I decided to go with the chevelle. I gotta admit, these guys can make some pretty good INSTRUMENTAL music, but the lyrics and hooks suck a**. They repeat the same lines over and over again, and the chorus' just aren't catchy at all. An evening with El Diablo is almost too painful to sit through. Out of the 11 songs, I like The RED and Send The Pain Below, thats it. Not bad, just too bland and repetitve. thats it. thats all. too repetitive. later."},{"rating":"1","title":"good question?","review":"I wouldn't be able to say, I am still waiting on this item to arrive, though I have contacted the seller, and they have assured me it's on it's way, I still haven't received it, it was ordered on Feb. 1st, when and if I receive it, I will let you know what I think. I can tell you it's an excellent CD as I already own it, but it is old and scratched and it skips, so I was wanting to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here........","review":"If your a fan of hard rock/heavy metal your probably gonna like this one. I'm not a fan of it so it just sounds like stupid lyrics and hard guitars. Theres nothing catchy about the songs except of a select few, almost all the songs sound the same,,you can't even hear the lyrics....don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Chevelle's debut album \\"Point #1\\" wasn't anything to write home about in the least; and \\"Wonder What's Next\\", the band's sophmore effort, is worse in every way. Much less nu-metal tuned than before, Chevelle seems to be looking for success with the new wave post grunge sensitive hard rock scene a la Nickelback and Staind, and a majority of the time we hear repetitive melodies and whiny lyrics. These days a number of newer bands think the more they whine the more emotional they can be. It's sad how a number of people think bands like Chevelle, along with Staind, Nickelback, Creed, Linkin Park, Trapt, Saliva, and a number of other groups put real emotion into they're music when they don't; and bands who really do like Biohazard, Corrosion of Conformity, and Black Label Society go unnoticed. All in all, this is yet another album best used as a coaster or in a skeet shoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"I am afraid the only good songs on this CD are the ones already overplayed on the radio. I am usually very picky about CD's I buy, but I made a $15 mistake on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable....","review":"This album is a true work of art.

So tight he could hardly breathe.I tried again, thinking it was me. I triple checked that it was not too tight just definately not loose enough for that to happen again.I found him with the bottom half in his mouth. He had been chewing at it trying to get out.Seems like a great product. Please be extremely careful.

She's had the collar on for a few days now and she still hasn't gotten her bearings. It completely blocks her peripheral view, so she walks into things and steps on it a lot. Plus, she's gotten out of it twice and reopened her wounds. I ended up ordering a new one that's hard and clear. I recommend the same for anyone thinking of ordering for their cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Useless","review":"I wanted to use this to keep my small dog from scratching his infected ear, and to get him to stop licking his paws and causing infection on his paws from all the moisture. Well, it took my dog LESS THAN 12 hours to figure out how to get the thing to fold up so he could scratch his ears and lick his paws. The thing only works if I am there every moment to unfold the thing, and order my dog to \\"stop it\\". It is almost useless. I am going to tape a rim of hard plastic to the outer rim so that it won't fold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collar","review":"This collar improved my dog's quality of life for a long time. He used to wear a solid cone type collar and was always banging into things and getting his fur irritated. This is like a round bib and let him get around as if there was nothing wrong. After a year he finally figured out how to get around the collar. It is unlikely that your dog will have to wear it as long as mind did. You should have no problem with it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for cats and could be dangerous!","review":"I can't imagine that there is a cat on this planet that couldn't defeat this \\"protective\\" collar in seconds. It folds down, and as soon as the cat realizes that, they will fold it down themselves! Maybe there are dogs that can't figure it out. It is made out of very cheap noisy opaque plastic (blocks her view completely) and closes with a string (Dangerous for cats!). I tried it out because my cat was getting surgery and I wanted an alternative to the big plastic cones that the Vets use. Well the Vet made a custom made cone for my cat that fit her perfectly. It was made out of a high quality lightweight CLEAR plastic that allows her to see all around. It is cushioned by her neck and closes with strong Velcro. Yes she hates it, but it is safe and it really does the job of protecting her without putting her in danger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy collar","review":"This collar worked out well for our cat. It seemed to be better tolerated than a rigid collar. After a few minutes, our cat acted as if it wasn't there. It made it more difficult for him to lick his paws, and so, he rarely attempted it. It did not however, make it impossible for him to get to his paws. It was effective for us though, our cat lacking the necessary ambition to manipulate and sufficiently 'fold-back' the collar to get at his feet.

My 7 year old daughter has been nuts about dinosaurs for about 3 years now, and this video 1. made her laugh (a lot), 2. taught her about some dinosaurs she hadn't already heard of (at her age, she thinks she's heard of them all), and 3. captivated her because of all the fossils Dinosaur George has displayed on tables throughout his video. And although this is not an \\"interactive\\" cd/dvd... my daughter interacted with it! She thought it was fun to try and guess the name of each of the dinosaurs before Dinosaur George would say it. She also had a great time playing along with the other kids in the audience or on stage. I just can't say enough about this video. Your money will be well spent! Hooray for Dinosaur George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny for kids, hilarious for adults","review":"I've started watching Fresh Prince reruns on TV with my wife since she never got to experience this show when it first aired in the 1990s (she grew up in a developing country). While I liked the show as a kid, I'm loving it as an adult. One of the great things about the show is that it stays PG for the kids, but pushes close to the edge in subtle ways for adults. For example, the show has some goofy moments, which will appeal to kids. However, the show's funniest moments come from the more sophisticated jokes or references to pop culture that kids might not get (such as Will calling Carlton \\"Arnold Schwarzen-negro\\" right after the latter had pumped iron at the gym). Smith is a genuinely funny actor (in my opinion one of the best actors around), and the rest of the cast is superb. I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"Solid and strong - good quality. We like the color and it is easy to clean.

She takes liberties with her source material such as utilizing the freshman english paper style of pulling quotes out of context and with the ever helpful ...uses them to support some National Enquirer type inferences and some pretty out there theories. It makes for a juicy read, but she comes to some highly questionable if not bizarre conclusions. Even the Orchard House, home of the Alcotts, will not sell this book due to the poor scholarship and that should tell you something. Still best biography is Madeleine B.

Anyone who watches hockey knows that the Sabres have incredible speed, but I find that even with Afinogenov I cannot win a race to any lose puck. Forget about chances at breakaways because the A.I. defense is incredibly fast. On the other hand, your defense is slow and cant check anyone. It is almost impossible to hit anyone or pokecheck the puck, so the most you can accomplish on defense is to let them take tons of shots and pray the goalie doesn't let in more than 5.The new offensive controls are very nice, but winning every game 10-8 is not what a hockey game should deliver to a person looking for some shread of defense.

The analog passing is pretty cool and I didn't have trouble adjusting to it. The only complaint I have is the lack of classic NHL logos; I wanted to create the Hartford Whalers but couldn't because their logo wasn't there.

The team rosters are from last year. They had to change the control scheme to confuse everyone. Graphics and gameplay suck!!! When you score a goal in Joe Louis Arena playing as the Detroit Red Wings, the goal horn does not sound like the real thing!!! NHL 2K7 has the real authentic goal horns. Not to mention they say that this game is revolutionary, when in reality, its just like last years game.

Don't buy NHL 07, its a waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Wings!","review":"look this game is extremely well made and is good, if you are thinking about buying it do it. the only problems with it is that after awhile you may be come so good against the computer in dynasty mode that you have to sim the game until the 3rd period, but its still sweet that way. oh lastly, the salary cap thing in dynasty mode sucks so much. but overall this game is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game!","review":"I think this game is a really good game.

It is about our history, a story that most women are unaware of. Unconsciousness about woman's place in society that leads to global unrest and disrespect is what keeps men and women from communicating and making a better life together.

I have always given him credit for trying new styles, tempos, sounds and lyrical meaning.However, I was surprised that the sound on this blu-ray was linear PCM stereo and not Dolby Digital HD or DTS-HD Master Audio, which I had expected. I have found that the Dolby Digital HD and DTS-HD Master Audio formats for blu-ray movies provide absolutely stunningly clear sound. The sound was good on Americana but just not as great as I had expected. (I now realize that linear PCM stereo is a form of BluRay sound.)Perhaps others familiar with BluRay sound technology could comment.Nevertheless, I highly recommend it for both Neil Young fans and those not familiar with his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"phooey","review":"I was all set to buy it and then I listened to the free tracks....I'll buy his early stuff.

There was good information on the Dark aspects of the moon, But is still can't grasp Arachne and when exactly this happens. My advice is to take it with a grain of salt and enjoy some tidbits"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerat Book, Interesting Viewpoint.","review":"Let me start by saying that I have read all of Asimov's Robot series and enjoyed them tremendously. To me, this book represents a major achievement in the understanding of robots in Asimov's Universe. I completely enjoyed this book from cover to cover, reading it in one night. But the most important part (I think), was how Caliban developed. Never before have we had a look into a robots mind like this, regardless of the Three Laws. The way Allen described the development of the robot was amazing. I hope to see more of his development in Inferno, which I will definitely purchase. In addition, I thank Mr. Allen for leaving Asimov's Universe intact, not changing any of his fundamentals (Except for the Three Laws obviously), and for helping to fill a blank in Asimov's future history between the Spacer and Settler era, and Trantor's rise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Asimov Fans","review":"Allen does a wonderful job of expanding on Asimov's universe and upon ideas about robots and the Three Laws. Anyone who liked the Elijah Baley and R.Daneel Olivaw novels by Asimov should enjoy these very much. However it is a Spacer not an Earthman or Settler that is the main character behind the three books in this series. Like Baley he is a lawman and has to solve some interesting cases. The \\"No Law\\" Robot Caliban is in the background and is not really the central character, but does play a pivotal role in all three novels. It really gets into the relationship between the Spacer and Settler worlds as one civilization is in decline and the other just blooming. The other thing is that he presents a pretty good mystery into the science fiction realm and does it about a well as Asimov did. This is not an easy task. Allen has got me hooked now. I'll be looking for his other works including his Corellian Trilogy in the Star Wars universe. He definitely has talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to Dr.Asimov's Robots","review":"Caliban is a fresh look on well known Three Laws. There were hints in Robot Series (The Naked Sun, The Robots Of Dawn), that the Laws aren't perfect. But only this book showed the main errors, and the price Spacers must pay is terrible... This book is great addition to Dr.Asimov's robots (even through it's a sad one). I suggest also re-read the whole Robot Series after reading that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the mislabel?","review":"This book is listed on amazon as being written by Isaac Asimov, when it was not. I'm fine with seeing a tribute band concert, but not when I had the impression I was going to see the original. Just an analogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting story...","review":"When I first saw this book, I was interested in reading new robot novels set in Dr. Asimov's universe, but I was afraid it would be a bad story. But it wasn't! This novel expands on the conflict between Settler and Spacer that Asimov began in _Robots and Empire_. It's a great story. Caliban is a wonderfully interesting character, and so was Sheriff Kresh. Not only was this novel a fine addition to the Robot Novels, it was also a good mystery novel. As for the next two books, I'm not so sure yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for many uses beyond diapers- leftovers at dinners, trashbags in the car, etc.","review":"My kids are well out of diapers but we still use these when we travel.

They are so perfectly in control of their craft, their prose so utterly devastating in its perfect beauty, that you put down the book and say, \\"Well, crap. I'll never be THAT good.\\" Will Christopher Baer is one such author.That his prose is not only beautiful, but can also be dark, witty, and down right violent, only heightens the pleasure for me.There are sentences in this collection that will make a fellow writer stop to catch their breath. It's the equivalent of going to MoMA and standing in front of a masterpiece.I await Godspeed with the utmost of anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad ass book","review":"this book was gritty, daring, benevolent and just plain great. Will Christopher Baer is now one of my favorite authors. his pace is excellent and it keeps you entertained. i cannot praise this book enough"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This!","review":"Phineas Poe is the most disturbing and unforgettable anti-hero I've ever loved. Without ever doing any of the drugs or even half of the screwed up s**t this guy get himself into, he will still be the underdog you root for. The character will mess EVERYTHING up but do one tiny, miserable act of kindness or humanity to make you love him again. Baer almost seems to delight in torturing Poe but every wrong done to (and by) him is made up for in the end (maybe). Phineas Poe is a noir \\"Rocky,\\" stoic, flawed, seemingly unstoppable. There may be predictable points in the plot, but they are told masterfully. By the end of the first novel \\"Kiss Me, Judas,\\" I was enamored with Baer's writing style. I bought this trilogy on a recommendation b/c from a Chuck Palahniuk buy... Amazon got it right here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Great, but not quite","review":"I absolutely love Kiss Me Judas and Hell's Half Acre. They are 2 of the best fiction books that I have ever read. The style is quick, witty, and easy to comprehend. The characters are all both likeable and hateable at the same time. Fantastic stuff.However Penny Dreadful was a woeful sack of gibberish. The whole concept of role playing rubbed me the wrong way for the start and everyone having multiple names was just too much to overcome.I would reccomend reading Judas and Acre back to back and just skipping over Penny because it didn't have anything to do with the other 2 anyway. Just one fiend's opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, Not Brilliant","review":"I thought this book was going to be phenominal. And, to be fair, it started out with just the right amount of dark atmosphere and stylistic flair that I thought this book would surely be a must read. Unfortunately, after the excitement of Baer's words wear off, there isn't much actual plot to come by in this novel. Furthermore, whatever plot can be found is sometimes unexciting and hard to follow, allbeit interesting. I can say I'd recommend the first of this trilogy, Kiss Me Judas, to almost anybody, what with it's pinache and storyline. Both of these elements remain new and fresh throughout the whole book, and are the strongest they feel throughout all three of Baer's novels. However, once you get two books deep, his style and often insane plots feel more worn out than new and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Christmas Gift.","review":"This is one of my favorite Christmas cds.

Earth worshipping tribes are wiser, kinder and more deserving than the rest of humanity. This book adds a twist but sermonizes in similar vein. It is filled with characters who are at least amoral and frequently monstrous. I long for the days when fiction was entertainment and you always knew who the good guy was. Apparently, that kind of book is doomed to extinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea but Poor Execution","review":"This book started off very well, but the story really lost steam about the halfway point. Robinson's story is that there's another, secret, competing race of humans that live among us and are healthier, more peaceful, stronger, etc. When his characters accidentally stumble onto this fact, it sets in motion a chain of events that start off exciting, but gradually become very repetitive, with the book ultimately falling apart, due to one coincidence too many (I don't want to give too much away here and risk ruining the book for you). Ultimately, what started as a riveting page-turner for me, turned into a book that I felt I had to finish, since I'd devoted so much time to it already. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better as a Guide to San Francisco than a thriller","review":"You know, I spent a lot of time Waiting, too...waiting for the plot to get interesting, waiting for the science to make sense, waiting to warm up to the characters...Sorry, but Mr. Robinson's WAITING just kept me holding too long.

As a mystery, well there really is none, any marginally astute reader will figure the plot out on the third or fourth page. The writer doesn't seem to care if he gets his facts straight or if his story makes sense. As a cautionary tale the writer is over wrought, children are more subtle. If this book was intended as science fiction, well better if we do not even go there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, boring story","review":"I was excited to hear of a concept story of another species hidden among us; a similar idea was expressed in Dean Koontz' Twilight Eyes and in Stephen King's The Ten O'Clock People.

Maybe the book is better, but I found this version a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story idea; it put me to sleep.","review":"Great story idea - parallel species, end of homo sapiens.

Not this one.","review":"As an example, let me point you to page 162, where the \\"hero\\", Artie, whips out his cigarette lighter to see his way up a dark staircase. Convenient, but not how you think. This is a character that doesn't smoke! Not before this scene, and not after. Ever. Beyond that, \\"Waiting\\" is not spooky, is burdened by \\"filler\\" that adds nothing to the book, and is a book I had to struggle through. It's one I will throw away rather than give to anyone. I can't waste their time, and am sorry I wasted mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping suspenseful & well told tale of speculative fiction","review":"Frank Robinson has once again come through with a suspenseful tale that incorporates the best elements of science fiction with those of an action-thriller. His characters, plot and science may each be picked apart--but when Robinson combines them--he creates something that is much bigger than the individual parts.It is now rare that a novel keeps me up all night reading just for the pure enjoyment of it, but WAITING definitely did. A fun and satisfying read. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been More...","review":"This book received so much positive hype, that I couldn't wait to read it. Alas, the story never lived up to its potential. The characters were FLAT, and the story uneven. I kept reading because the concept was exciting and I kept thinking: \\"this is going to pick up and all gel soon.\\" It never did. The worst part was the constant thought I had while reading it that it could have been an outstanding reading experiece if someone like Koontz got hold of it! It wasn't a complete waste of time since I read it on a flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Phoenix, but I had hoped for more. I did enjoy Robinson's THE POWER however. Check that one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premise with potential nullified by clichés","review":"This book was mentioned in Stephen King's reading list (as an appendix to his inspirational \\"On Writing\\"). The premise of a race of \\"superior\\" beings living among us intrigued me. Unfortunately, that was the ONLY reason why I endured the book until the end. I couldn't care less about any of the two-dimensional characters, the corny dialogue, or the repetitious spoon-feeding of plot detail (how stupid is the reader expected to be?). I sped through most of the novel because I was anxious to put it away and move on to a better book. VERY disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and implausible","review":"Someone who picks up a horror novel must, of course, be willing to suspend disbelief, but the concept of another race living among us and maintaining some level of cohesion as a society for 35,000 years without discovery is just a little too far-fetched. Worse than that, it's boring. Toward the end of the story, there were some twists in the plot that I didn't see coming, but by that time I didn't care anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only appropriate for older teens...","review":"My younger teenage daughter bought this book, then tossed it aside after reading a couple of chapters.

Lindsay is not only predictable, but clearly lacks all common sense (who wants a fling with someone \\"special\\" anyway? A fling is a fling. Either you want special, or you want a fling. Who seriously expects to find both, and in only ten days?). Brooke is annoying, and hanging out with her for so long only stresses that Lindsay lacks common sense. Ryan, also predictable.The grammar and wording is also odd at places; this author doesn't seem to like commas. It's like this book is written by a completely different person. Which brings me to another point - Who is Jan Nowasky anyway, it says by Rachel Hawthorne on the cover, but copyright belongs to a different person. Other books I've read, copyright belongs to Hawthorne.I recommend Hawthorne's other books, like \\"Island Girls and Boys\\" \\"Thrill Ride\\" or \\"Love on the Lifts\\" but don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"So addicting!","review":"I loved this book!!

I find myself having to keep pulling them up to be comfortable. The low height does not keep me as warm as I would prefer. Definitely not the size you see on the picture (which has the sock almost up to the calf). What you see if definitely NOT what you get. The picture must have been taken with a child wearing it. Too bad...cause the fabric quality seems good. I'm going to have to keep them anyway as paying for return shipping would cost as much as the product did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product...","review":"The fit is great.

I was expecting them to be similar to hospital socks, but they are okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"The toe seam on these socks is incredibly uncomfortable. They are warm, though, which is why I didn't totally berate the product. I actually bought these for my hospital stay when I gave birth and never used them in the hospital.

Actually along these 400+ pages I found that all the crucial points of the Zionist ideology were omitted or downplayed.Well, nothing much different from what the mainstream medias serve daily about this topic. But then, why calling this book \\"The ***Controversy*** of Zion\\", if the controversy is omitted ?Actually I found this book so far away from what its title announces that I'm starting to wonder if Geoffrey Wheatcroft's \\"Controversy Of Zion\\" was published (1997) to divert the audience from the original \\"Controversy of Zion\\" written by Douglas Reed and published in 1955 that in contrast is deep, higly documented, and addresses extensively the fundamentally controversial aspects of the Zionist ideology.As often, prefer the original to the copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Controversy of Zion","review":"This book was given as a gift.

You might have a few Hansel or Gretel types who dare to pick a small chunk off for tasting which inevitable tarnishes the entire effect that you worked so hard to acchieve.This book pushes the ideas beyond the four walls and wheat chex roof to a area that allow imagination to swell.

I was also disappointed that there were not any sources listed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"If you are seeking the inside secrets to gingerbread artistry, don't expect much from this book. This book doesn't even begin to cover the many gingerbread/food techniques currently available -- and that home builders can use -- which mimic real-life or fantasy -- building structures and contents. I thought that many of the instructions shown were too simple and general -- the reader deserved to read more details, more inside information on how to work with food items to create effects -- especially since the author is a pastry chef! The book's description also promises photos of the Grove Park Inn's gingerbread competition entries. But if you expect to see the competition's top of the line entries featuring incredible details, don't. I looked forward to receiving this book. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I always loved making gingerbread houses, but I wasn't all that good at it, and someone else always assembled the house. This book inspired me to try building my first house on my own. I can't wait to try out all the decorating ideas. I think this book is really good for beginners, like myself. I love how it gives you instructions, tips, and pictures to help you make your own. If you have any interest in gigerbread houses whatsoever, I strongly advise you to read it. The pictures are beautiful, the instructions are clear, and it will have you hooked on gingerbread houses."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview","review":"I've read my fair share of Crete books recently and Forty's effort serves as the perfect introductory source for those interested in this fascinating and unique battle. Written in an easily digestible manner, it contains a substantial overview of the chain of events, plus some interesting minutiae on the various Axis and Allied formations and divisions, weapons, significant individuals, as well as an unparalleled collection of photographs.It's fairly light on text, however, and those looking for something to chew over would do better to examine the works of Antony Beevor and Alan Clark, but as it stands, 'Battle Of Crete' would make a fine addition to any budding war historian's shelves. The volume itself is handsomely printed and of reassuring weight and design, certain to last through many extended readings. It may strike some as a little expensive, but for the breadth of information contained within it is worth the outlay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daddy in tears","review":"I'm only giving this a one star because there is no option to give it no stars.

And last night my doubts turned into a nightmare when my cute little girl who had just started crawling the week prior, pulled on the bottom drawer and it simply fell out on top of her and fractured her tiny little leg.

This graphic novel has such horrible binding that the first time I read it (and I take VERY good care of my TPB's) it fell apart in my hands. Darkhorse really needs to do something about this, as this is the second graphic novel that has fallen apart.This TPB was very good in terms of its storyline, though. Ki-Adi-Mundi is sent to Tatooine to find out what happened to Sharad Hett, a Jedi who left the Order years ago. Hett was seen on Tatooine leading the Tusken Raiders in battle against the settlers. Ki-Adi-Mundi goes to find out what went wrong with Hett.The art of Outlander was above average, as Ki-Adi-Mundi looked really weird in every picture. The story and dialogue was very good, which saved it from getting a 1 (because of the binding).Still, Outlander was a very good read. Just make sure you have some super glue handy while reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Ongoing Series","review":"This is the best story of the Ongoing Series, it has loads of action and lots of plot twists from all different directions. Also a great introduction of the new character A'Sharad Hett. He will play an important role in the next story plus The Hunt for Aurra Sing and The Clone Wars. Also Truman does great stuff with Aurra Sing giving a us a sampling of her backround and her hatred for Jedi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Truman- best Star Wars writer","review":"I bought this trade paperback after reading the excellent Aurra Sing story in the \\"Star Wars: Bounty Hunters\\" collection. I was disappointed that this comic was not drawn by Tim Truman, but his storytelling abilities still come through in this collection. \\"The Exile of Sharad Hett\\" follows the same style of frontier crime and rebellion plot that make the Star Wars expanded universe stories great. There are some interesting plot twists, epic battles, and Truman's take on Aurra Sing, always a pleasure to read. If Tim Truman had drawn this, it would have gotten five stars. The story, art, and characters are still good, and well worth adding to your Star Wars collection. If only the movies could be this good."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit 4\\" lense like it says","review":"Simply does not fit my slr with a 4\\" lense. Product description states \\"fits autofocus SLR cameras and other large cameras with a lens up to 4 inches.\\" I measured my lense and it's exactly 4\\" (18-135mm) and it's not even close to fitting. I tugged and pulled and tried to stretch out the material,.. and if I had pulled it around the lense it would have taken a lot of effort and stretching of the material, and would have put a ton of pressure on the lens. I was afraid that the dramatic pressure (if I did fit it on) would eventually damage the lens. I'll have to return the item and get a different one, but I'm hoping they send the new one without extra shipping charges (since the original one had free super saver shipping because I bought other items with it to get the free shipping). I gave this 2 stars because I think if it actually fit, it would be useful.

I am actually able to close the case, but it's a stretch and kind of an awkward fit. If you measure the bottom of your camera (from the tip of the lens to the back of the camera) and it's 4\\" or less, this case should work. Otherwise, get theZing 520-202 ZXB1 Large Zoom SLR Cover (Blue). Great case, but when they said 4\\" in the description, they mean lens + camera, not lens only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit on a Canon T1i with 18-55 standard lens.","review":"I bought this for my new Canon T1i with the standard EF-S 18-55mm lense attached. Simply stated; it doesnt fit.I would have had to stretch the piece that loops back up over the lense far past it's thread limits to get it on, and if i did... I dunno if i would have been able to remove it at all.I think it is a great idea, I am very dissappointed that i couldnt make it work. I gave it only one star because i had to send it back, never got to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!","review":"After reading the earlier reviews, I was cautious about buying this product. I am glad I risked (Amazon's 30-day return policy makes it an easy choice). My goal was to provide glove-like protection for my Nikon D90 with Sigma 17-70mm lens (the lens is 97mm long including the lens cap and a UV filter and is 72 mm in diameter). This cover fit perfectly well. Granted, it is not as well padded as the Crumpler \\"The four million dollar home\\" bag my camera usually resides in, but the Zing will do just fine for carrying the camera in a larger padded backpack to reduce my check-in and later hang-on-the-shoulder luggage count."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and easy","review":"I love this camera case. I bought it for my Canon 60D, and granted it is a VERY tight fit-- but I still like it. Lately, I have been using it for an old Canon Rebel film camera, and it is so light and easy to use that I will never go back to a regular film case. Would be nice if Zing made a slightly larger once for today's DSLRs. By the way, I love the Zing neoprene lens cases, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy product","review":"The Zing covers are handy for transporting SLRs without the typically bulky cases. Obviously they will afford less protection than fully padded cases or bags, but if you prefer a compact package this is the way to go. Keep in mind that even the large size will barely fit over a larger digital SLR such as the Nikon D90 with 18-105 mm lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goof fit for Lumix GH2 with 14-1400","review":"I had this product before and liked so much for my film camera. So I bought it for my new Lumix GH2 with 14-140.I was worried about case not fit to GH2 with 14-140mm since not much info about this case was available on internet and I was not able to test at a local shop.It works fine and I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case!","review":"This case has done wonders while traveling! I'm a food and lifestyle blogger so I almost always have my Canon Rebel with me. When I first purchased my camera, I knew right away that I didn't want a clunky camera bag. I started looking into camera covers and found this Zing case. It's great because now I can just toss my camera in my purse without worrying about it getting damaged or scratched because it's always protected. I leave the case on the strap of my camera so even if I have the camera around my neck, I just put the cover on it so it doesn't get banged while I'm at events. Definitely one of the best accessories I've purchased so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, Bad fit","review":"I bought this case for my Canon Rebel XSi after reading excellent reviews on multiple websites. According to the description it \\"fits autofocus SLR cameras and other large cameras with a lens up to 4 inches\\". My lens is exactly 4\\" long (18-200mm lens), and the case doesn't come even close to fitting over my camera. I am extremely disappointed as I am leaving for a trip the day after tomorrow and will not be able to exchange the case in time. I would recommend trying Zing's \\"Large Zoom SLR Cover\\" if your lens is longer than 2.5-3\\"; however, if your lens is shorter than 2.5-3\\" I bet this case would fit perfectly! I'm going to try the Zoom Cover next and see if the fit is any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Me, A Boring Read","review":"Try as I might, this was one book I simply could not get into. The authors obviously deserve credit for having exhaustively and meticulously researched their material, and they offer an original spin on the motives behind the mass slaughter and the identity of the assassins who committed it. For that alone, there are those who may feel it should rate at least a three-star review. My problem was the writing, which I found so dull and fragmented that I could not in all honesty give it a higher rating than I have.

When I saw the finished result I was very impressed. They brilliantly captured the horror of the battle of Franklin, and showed why it was truly the valley of death.They also give you a very good look at the men who fought this battle. By taking excerpts from letters and eyewitness accounts, you see the battle from the fighting man's perspective.

Each page has different textures and things for him to touch and feel-- a wooly sweater, squishy sponge, sticky fingerpaints. 3-4 things on each page with little verses to go with.

As a poet myself, the mystical beauty of this book sometimes left me near tears. It has a pristine economy of just the right words, the meeting of one sparkling territory with another, and a sense of hallowed silence, ultimate tenderness and sheer exuberance.

The writing is stilted, the authorial voice is heavy and intrusive. The author tells the reader how the characters are feeling and what their motivations are very blatantly rather than letting the characters reveal themselves through their actions. The hero was deeply unsympathetic(if some creep strongarmed me onto a ship, locked me in a room and went off to fix my future for me, his chances of getting willing action would disappear, never to be seen again), the pairing totally implausible (except for the fact that the heroine was 16, and we were all morons and put up with more than we should have at 16), and, well, the writing was awful.This is not an author I will ever spend money on again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've beens","review":"This book should have been good. The story had everything, a handsome pirate, with scars, a wild untamed unique girl - she's blind - and horses. In my opinion it should have been harder to miss with story elements like that.However, the writing was heavy and hard to read lavishing on the motivations and the feelings almost trying to force the connection of soul mates. In fact, the writing and style almost seemed to place a huge neon sign above the characters head with capital letter SOULMATES. It made it hard to stomach.That and the fact that dragging off a wild girl, kidnapping her and *locking* her away inside the captain's cabin of a ship would not make the heart grow fonder.It should have been good and I should have been excited about finishing and going on to buy other stories - but all I can say is that it was barely tolerable in style and writing and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"All new story for the original BG show","review":"Books #11, #12, #13, and #14 are all new stories based on the original BG TV show that were written in the 80's. This one is the first in the all new stories. It's very good as it marks the return of Spectre, the I.L. Series Ambulatory Sentient Computer (as they call themselves). Spectre is extremely ambitious and finds himself at odds with Baltar's sidekick Lucifer in what I believe one of the best story lines of the book series. Spectre would lie, cheat, manipulate, double-cross, or anything else he can do to further his advancement. It's refreshing to see such a character amidst somewhat \\"boring\\" Cylon centurions.

It is not mixed on turntables but is actually a computer generated mix. To me this completely detroys the whole point of it. Why not show some skills and mix it for real. Since it was done on a computer all that this mix shows is that John Creamer and Stephane K can pick out some songs and choose an order for them to go in. Why not show the fans that you can mix to perfection with your own skills? Next time they might as well let the computer pick out the tracks too and then collect a big fat paycheck.

That's too bad, because all five tracks--augmented here by one alternate take--are outstanding in bridging what came before (the 1960s quintet) with what came afterward (Davis' electric era).For those who are turned off by much of Davis' 1969-1975 music, the results here seem quite organized and melodic (reportedly arranger Gil Evans had a significant hand in the arrangements). The music is clearly in transition, with little in the way of 'straight-ahead' jazz rhythms or walking bass lines. Yet the spirit if not the letter of a quintet jazz sound is in evidence, particular with improvisations still in the forefront. Even so, Davis' interest in the likes of James Brown shows up in some of the drumming, and his interest in electric instruments is fully intergrated into the music. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mademoiselle Mabry has a Fender Rhodes","review":"The beauty and the Genius of this album is how that it not only signals the departure of cool jazz into electric jazz and eventually fusion, but more importantly, how it shows that Miles was already way ahead of the crew! Briefly, although I find the first 4 tracks excellent, it is Mademoiselle Mabry that really blows me away! Miles' playing is so differently lyrical. He plays less but communicates so much more. Although the piece is coherent and, to me, far from a 'ballad', I wonder if after (and I mean years after) Wayne Shorter thought he sounded too 'old-school' for lack of a better expression.

In every other course or book that I have done, it is encouraged to at least guess on a question you are unsure of providing you with 5-8 potential points. Lastly, the online course is misleading.

But in a Best Buy one day I picked up a copy for about $4 and took it home. The first thing that hits you is that this is not the music of the Guess Who of the '70's. This is only the original bass player, Jim Kale and the original drummer, Garry Peterson, and three newcomers who, while talented, in no way continue the sound, style or character of the previous band sound. Like when the Doobie Brothers went through a big change with Michael McDonald, this is on the same order. The songs are well produced and have their own special sound, but it does tend to be a little undistinctive as rock songs go. I found it listenable, but not for old Guess Who fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Not sure if anyone is still considering buying this pile of *, but I bought it for 5.98 & overpaid by 5.97.

See ya in the bargain bin, boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A surrogate band missing key players","review":"The difficulty with the reformed Guess Who as led by Kale and Peterson (the two original Guess Who members represented here) is that they invariably are compared to the \\"classic\\" Guess Who line-up of 1966-1975. Invariably, that comparison will be very unfavorable, because the neccessary ingredient of Burton Cummings (and to a lesser extent Bachman and Winter) is conspicuously absent. Such a tough space! If the band uses the Guess Who name, they're damned as fakers trying to cash in on a name. But if they don't use the name - who's going to know who they are? In the era of resurgence and regrouping, such things, both legally and artistically, get muddy. If they play in my area, I'd see them, no question, because, despite the abscence of certain key figures, it is still the great Jim Kale and the great Gary Peterson, regardless of the lackluster recorded material and supporting musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"In my opinion, if your an aging rocker that decides to relive your glorious past (and maybe cash in a little while your at it) by \\"reforming\\" your classic band without any of the \\"key\\" members that were always the real focal point of the band to begin with, you better make sure that you at least have some semblance of your \\"classic\\" sound intact. Maybe they still do live, but here Kale and Peterson don't, and this slickly produced mess is not worth even thinking about. Sorry Jim and Gary, you were great in the original band back then, BUT the two of you are NOT The Guess Who.

Late that night, Titus hears a sound by the chicken coop and learns exactly what a good farm dog is supposed to do.

The many historians interviewed are diverse in terms of nationality and gender. I'm not quite sure why National Geographic is covering this, rather than something more scientific.This work presents itself as discussing one last battle. However, it swings back and forth from Napoleon's exile to many times in his earlier years. It's comprehensible but people who like their history linear may be frustrated.The work is much longer than your average high school class period, so I can't imagine this being shown to high school students. Still, history buffs may really enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither fish nor fowl","review":"This DVD was a disappointment to me. The instructor skips over the important parts how these various artists create melodic rock solos and wastes a bunch of time on playing solos \\"in the style of,\\" then goes into a \\"put this finger on this fret, then put that finger on that fret, then put this finger on that fret\\" kind of instruction on how to play the solos he just played for you. While mildly interesting, it doesn't go too far in getting across to you WHY he (and the artists he's emulating) put their fingers on the abovementioned frets.If you apply yourself, you'll learn to play the solos he shows you, which sound vaguely like Gary Moore, David Gilmour and Steve Lukather solos, but good luck creating your own Moore-, Gilmour- and Lukather-like solos.

I've done all of the workouts and only the yoga and ab ones are decent- not the best, but they were OK; the rest are a pure waste of time. I understand that the it's suppose to be a 10 minute workout, but that doesn't mean that it has to be rushed. I'd rather do 5 meaningful intense moves than 15 rushed, sloppy ones that will have no benefit. The only good things I can say are that all of the workouts do include a warm up and a cool down, you have the ability to mix and match your own routine, and they stick to being very close to 10 minutes. Other than that, it was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners.","review":"Definitely not for beginners or anyone who needs instruction first. I hated it.

I love that I can pick and choose which workouts to do and that every day is different. I have a whole collection, and since the old ones weren't making me sweat anymore, I went out looking for some new ones. This one looked good and I liked the idea that it had a 'power yoga' workout. I LOVE yoga and needed something that challenged me more.I don't like this DVD because it doesn't challenge me. Some of the workouts I get a good sweat worked up, but the power yoga is a very simple routine that I could do in my sleep. I think this is probably a great routine for someone who is a beginner and wants a simple work out. It just wasn't right for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I had the10 Minute Solution - Target Toning for Beginnersand really love it.

The problem with the book is that it is written by pompus insiders. SNMP is one of the worst standards used on the internet. You could teach a course on how such a rudimentary functionality was obfuscated by impenetrable terminology and poor implementation choices (ASN1/BER for example).What is desperately needed in understanding SNMP is someone who knows what a disaster it is and tries to help bridge the terminology gaps. Unfortunately, the authors actually believe that the terminology and implementation were a good idea. They can't bring themselves to say \\"You know what the rest of the world calls an array? Well, we decided to call them 'columnar objects'\\"The most useful part of the book was learning of the available SNMP parsers, 'smicng' and 'mosey' in an appendix.

I was tasked with writing a MIB and this book did not do much for me. For instance, the IMPORTS clause, standard in any MIB. The author only gave a brief defenition of what it is, no examples, no explination of WHY one imports something! A MIB you write will not compile or work without a proper IMPORT clause.Reading this book takes great effort. Not an easy reas at all and I have been working with SNMP for 5 years and am a Certified OpenView Consultant, and have been for 3 years. There are part of this book that are helpful, but if you are going to be writing a MIB for the first time do not count on this book to help you get it done.

There is no hint of objectivity in this work. The sole purpose seems to be to praise blacks. Toward that end the book is a stream of quotes that have only one thing in common--they say something positive about blacks. There is little attempt to analyze or coordinate these quotes. Quotes will be taken from authors who disagree with many of Jackson's theories but that doesn't bother him as long as the quote meets his immediate needs. It appears that he'll use any quote from any source without attempt at analysis if it meets his limited objectives. Jackson inserts his own unexamined opinions often without any attempt at analysis.

The Neoprene is nice and stretchy, and reassuringly beefy. I dropped the pouch - with my Canon G12 inside it - and there was no damage to the camera at all.The reinforced clip is also tough. Maybe a bit too tough, since I would normally clip the pouch on my trousers' belt loop in a heartbeat - but would take a minute to remove it since the clip works so well.I like the way it looks so ordinary that it doesn't call attention to itself.

As a book that should be a handy reference, I should never have to struggle to figure out how to find the color I want. The layout just isn't thought out. And the way they've broken down the colors leaves so much room for error and omission. I'm sorry, but I don't work in just 10% color increments. I fail to understand the logic behind some combos being broken down in 10% increments and others in 5% increments. And why do none of the combos go higher than 60% black?

Though this book was written in the early 1960's Robert G. Olson's book gives a fairly complete summary and history of Existentialist philosophy. It compares it to Rationalism, Empiricism and Pragmatism in Epistimology, as well as Realism and Idealism in Metaphysics. Olson also covers many of the Ethical implications of Existentialism. He juxtiposes it to \\"Modern\\" Analytic Philosophy. I enjoyed this book immensely because I like comparing rival ideas and Philosophies. If you're interested in that too, or just want to understand the roots of Post-Modernism, or the way some European intelectuals think, then you should find this to be a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not an introduction","review":"I just wanted to learn about existentialism.

Although the description of the case states that it will fit a lens up to 7 inches, the case will not close with the 70-300 zoom. (This lens measures about 6 inches in its fully retracted position.) It does close with the 18-200. The \\"snout\\" of the case is rather narrow and will not fit over the Nikon-supplied hood (carried in the reversed position) for either lens. Because the 18-200 and, to a lesser extent, the 70-300 are prone to flare in some conditions, this is a serious issue.The case appears to be a clever idea that should offer meaningful protection for a small sized DSLR with a short zoom. However, it is a poor choice for a D90 with two of Nikon's most popular lenses. Ratings reflect the case with the Nikon D90 and the 18-200 and 70-300 VR zooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about perfect","review":"Bought this for a week-long vacation to Ireland, where we didn't want to lug around the camera bag we already had. Worked great, really nice to have the camera protected whether it was thrown in a backpack or slung around the neck/shoulder. The only problem I had was the fit of it. The Canon XSi with the kit 18-55mm lens fit, but there was a bit of room at the end of the 'tube' of the lens cover. With the kit 55-250 it fit perfect. At the end of the trip, we were actually a little mad that we had purchased a separate camera bag (which we left at home) because this worked so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight fit on Canon EOS 7D body","review":"Protects camera but is a tight fit on my Canon EOS 7D.

Used it on a trip to the Keys using only a carry-on and it protected my camera fine. I also used it to cover the camera while walking around the everglades as it threatened rain. It carries well with the camera strap coming through the open corners. Only thing that is a minor ding is that it takes a second to get the camera out to take a pic....but it only takes 5 seconds to get the camera out.It fit my Nikon D7000 with a Nikon 18-200mm lens perfectly.

I use it with an Olympus E3 and extended battery pack; pancake lens, or 12-60mm lens. It's better to use this, than travel with a bulky case. Even when I bring my bulky case along, I have my camera zing-covered, around my neck; therefore, I don't have to go in and out of my bag to retrieve.Note: Because most of my shooting is outdoors, even though my camera is fairly weather safe, and this case is too, I bring a small, folded rain cover [tucked inside this neoprene case], as a precaution in case of severe weather."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best zing cover?","review":"I have a friend who got the one with velcro straps that go around the lens and i actually think it is better as it allows for tighter protection. if you don't have a big lens, the pouch is a bit loose and sand/dust... could go in :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly Puts a New Spin on Naifanchi and Sanchin","review":"Since most of what I have to say has already been said, but better than I could, I will keep this brief.If you practice OMA or the JMA derivitives, get this book.The presentation of the sets and their application is awesome.

Flood also provides an analysis of Mein Kampf at the end of this engrossing biography. While the book is mainly about Hitler (who is very much present in this biography) and the development of the Nazi party, Charles Flood provides the reader a great deal of information about the economic and political situation in Germany between the end of World War I and 1923. German resentment toward the Treaty of Versailles is a common theme in the book. We also get a glimpse of future Nazi leaders such as Rudolf Hess, Hermann Goering, and Joseph Goebbels.

Unfortunately after I received the product, I put my dog in only to find that he slides around in it (the ends have a large pocket of space-- too much actually) and that he's unable to stick his head out (as many dogs naturally tend to do) while trying to lie down comfortably in it.

(Animals in heaven is mentioned several times in this short book).Beautiful watercolor drawings, but New Age is my best opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Heaven? is not based on Bible's teachings","review":"I was so surprised that with Maria Shriver's Catholic background that she leads her readers to believe that \\"everyone who is good throughout their life will get to go to heaven.\\" Wrong! We are saved because God loved us so much and sent his son, Jesus, to die on the cross of our sins, thus, giving to those who believe in him eternal life. If we relied on \\"being good\\" no one could ever inherit eternal life. Even though I would like to think that my pet friends will be in heaven, the Bible does not address this. I was very disappointed in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me want to cry!","review":"When I first read this book, it seemed interested because of the way the cover of the book is and how the words she said actually came to heart, at least, my heart because it made me think back how I grieved when my grandfather died in 1998. The book made me want to cry! But really, Maria Shriver is a good writer and I can't wait to get my hands on her next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better theology","review":"Having a godson who just lost his grandfather, I wanted to find a book on death for him. This book immediately came to mind due to the recent press on it. However, having now read it, I can't in good conscience give it to him. Although the book is sweet, well written and beautifully illustrated, it errs on one basic belief of all Christians. The book says if you are a good person on earth then you will go to heaven. The basis of Christianity is that it is not works (good deeds) that will ensure your place in heaven, but a belief that Jesus Christ died for your sins and rose from the dead. Hallelujah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I first heard about this book when I saw Maria Shriver talk about it on the Oprah show. I was interested to discover that a celebrity had brought the topic of heaven into the public arena. When I went to the bookstore to read the book, I was incredibly disappointed. The book is shallow and a watered down version of what heaven is, as spelled out in the Bible. Although there are few books written for young children on the topic of heaven, I found that Kathleen Long Bostrom's book, WHAT ABOUT HEAVEN?, gives a solid explanation of what Christians believe about heaven, based on the biblical references which are included in the back of the book. I am sure that Maria Shriver meant well, but it is always a risk when celebrities think that they can write for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"My four-year-old has many questions about Heaven, but this book raised more than it answered, in a confusing, repetitive, and awkwardly worded manner. The topic is difficult and there is a need for books that address it, but this one is just so poorly written as to be painful to read through even once."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Heaven?","review":"This book was so sweet that it made me cry. I bought it for my son after his grandmother passed away. The book gave practical explanations of what happens when a person dies with language that a child can understand. It is written like a story book and has a beautiful explaination of a spiritual person's belief of heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book that deals with death and the questions children have.","review":"This book was purchased as a gift to a family for the loss of a loved one. Their child had a lot of questions and this book seemed to help the child and their family. We also purchased an extra copy for the local library as a donation so that it may help other children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"This is the story of a young girl who questions death and the hereafter, following the passing of her grandmother. While the questions are important, the story isn't very well-written, and the conversations aren't very realistic, in my opinion. I believe that, if the book were written by an unknown writer, instead of by a Kennedy, it would still be in an editor's slush pile; possibly even in their garbage can. The book's illustrations are beautifully rendered pastels, each of them including various shades of blue, invoking heavenly feelings appropriate to the title. While death is a difficult subject for any child to deal with, I found this book to offer overly simplistic answers to complicated emotional questions. I wouldn't recommend it for a child who is seeking answers about death, or who is dealing with grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Heaven? What a comfort!","review":"Well, it's been 7 years since my dad passed away from cancer. My daughter was 3 at the time and we all had a very hard time.

I understand the Greek style of comedy and these weren't written last year, but nonetheless it seems like it were written for some teen film.The dry humor Sophocles uses was traditional for his time, and what was a hit in the Greek theater, but its so dated. I wouldnt read this book just to read as a novel and enjoy it, I wouldnt anyway. It just annoys me so much to Sophocles write such trashy humor.I dont recommend it, unless you're a fan of Greek theater (which I am not) but in that case, its quite excellent. However, if you are a fan of theater in general, i dont think that you'll be overall pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent But Not The Best; 4.5 Stars","review":"This is a fine translation of Sophocles' great Oedipus trilogy. Fagles has rendered these plays into fluent English with a fine feel for how to vary the nature of the language between characters and scenes. That said, I still prefer the older Fitts/Fitzgerald translations, which are a model of restrained but powerful poetic expression. I think Fagles' translations of Homer are the finest available but he has not done quite as well with these plays. A very nice feature of this edition are the fine introductions to the plays and a short discussion of the history of the texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Translation","review":"I'm a great fan of Robert Fagles, and by no means does he let the reader down with this adaptation of Sophocle's triumvirate masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WONDERFUL!!!","review":"Thanks so much to TCM and Warner Home Video for producing the long overdue and much anticipated second volume of Esther Williams films.I am thrilled that \\"THRILL OF A ROMANCE\\" (no pun intended) is included - my all-time favourite Esther film.This lady has brought continuous joy and pleasure to millions of people with her warm, engaging personality and excellent swimming and athletic talents and the films all boast lovely music scores and songs, and many other talented players.The films were originally produced when Metro Goldwyn Mayer was at its zenith, providing the world with delicious family and general entertainment.Much appreciation also to the previous Reviewer who has provided us with all the feast of information about the very generous extras on the individual DVD pressings.WELL DONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare for vintage Awesomeness","review":"OMG, She is the queen of all water activities.

The focus is more on Howard Keel, and he is in fine voice. Unfortunately, the songs he has to work with are completely forgettable. Nice Hawaii photography (even though the film is supposedly set in Tahiti). Pretty predictable story (granted, most stories behind most musicals are pretty predictable). In light of the better Esther Williams showcases (Neptune's Daughter, Million Dollar Mermaid) and the great MGM musicals, this entry, unfortunately, seems like a poor country cousin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not include \\"Jupiter's Darling?\\"","review":"And \\"The Duchess of Idaho\\", \\"Texas Carnival\\", \\"Skirts Ahoy!\\"?

I'll admit, these aren't great classics, but if you liked the original set, there's no reason to get this one. Thrill of a Romance is beautifully filmed in Technicolor and has Van Johnson. Fiesta is a rare Williams movie in which involves no swimming, but still enjoyable. This Time For Keeps might be the weakest of the bunch, but what the heck! Pagan Love Song is wonderful and hilarious, Just like Easy to Love. Million Dollar Mermaid might be one of Esther's best movies and is actually a biography of Annette Kellerman.

So far I've gone through Carver, Hemingway, Cheever, and now O'Connor. Of the four, I'm most impressed with O'Connor, which is saying a lot! For my tastes, she has the perfect combination of interesting plot, deep characters, substantial themes, and literary chops (symbolism, metaphor, etc.). Her stories are a bit \\"weird\\" and also heavy on religious themes, so they may not appeal to everyone. But just for her sheer brilliance as a writer, everyone should read a few of her stories. I recommend Revelation, Good Country People, and Everything That Rises Must Converge."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD WORK BUT USER UNFRIENDLY","review":"If you are looking for a comprehensive collection of Flannery O'Connor's works search no further. This excellent volume contains all of the best of O'Connor's writings in addition to her letters. You couldn't ask for a better resource for those who are O'Connor fans and for those who are teaching any courses about Flannery O'Connor.The major criticism that I have of this book is not content but the way it is put together. Ordinarily you would have an index in the front of the book. In this case the index is at the end and the stories are not in a systematic order to make it easier for the reader to find. I am surprised that there is not at least a one page introduction about the author to help put her work in historical perspective and introduce her to new readers. Those are the \\"major\\" technical flaws that I find with the book otherwise it is a must have volume to have in your personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"KMC makes quality quality chains. I bought a z510 2 years ago in orange and it has been the highest quality chain I have ever had the joy of riding. It is precision made. I would stay away from the lower end models. When it comes to bike parts like this, that 10 dollars will sacrifice pure build quality. I have snapped about 4 z410 chains on a couple of my bikes in the past 2 years. I was pretty hard on them by popping constant power wheelies but that will never happen with the z510.

Well to hell with the fat heavy z chains I say! They're cheap as you can see with the broken chain experiences related here and they slow you down. Plus the standard size 3/32 chain fits in chainbreakers if you need to push in a pin rather than using the so-called master link.

Factory lube is adequate. Installs easily just like any other chain. I don't see any reason why the chain would break, as other reviews have stated, if the chain was properly put together. Use a chain breaker to get fasten the cahin, instead of using the master link, if you are scared of that though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fixie/SS chain","review":"This is my standard chain for the fixies/single speeds I ride and build. I've used them with and without the master link, and never had a problem. The selection of colors is really fun, and the color stays nice through pretty serious abuse.

The outer plate on one of the links broke off of the pin. The only thing holding the chain together was one plate on the other side of the link. This isn't safe to ride on and luckily the chain didn't break while I was riding it. My bike is a fixed gear and I didn't have a break on my bike until recently so skid stops probably had a big effect on the chain, but it still shouldn't have done this.If you want to know if I remember correctly the only time I broke the chain was when I put a smaller chainring on my bike.This could be a good chain if you need a single speed chain and can't spend a lot of money (but 20 dollars isn't much more), but I won't be buying this chain again.

Many of the stories where so heart felt, and this is due to my relationship with my late mentor, teacher and friend who passed in the fall of 1999, he left me with some big shoes to fill. One story in fact was of a boy who sought the greatest master of Jujitsu, who in fact was a friend of the boys father who was killed by Ronin Samurai. This story was told to me by him (my instructor) way back in 1994 as we were working on the theory of Aiki in the dojo, to read in in this book took me back to those long and aching days in his Seishin Dojo. This book is a great read for those seeking to understand a little more of what is Jujitsu really is and how works from a mental point of view than a book of techniques. If you have a chance pick it up and add it to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disapointed buyer","review":"This book was full of useful historical and anatomical knowledge, however the application of the techniques was poorly designed. The author could have been more practical and included photographs instead of poorly draw characters. It was extremely difficult to distinguish whether I was performing the technique properly or the author had drawn the picture poorly. However, on a positive note, the history and striking targets listed in the book were excellent. But then again, how could I practice the techniques when I had poor visual aides to assist me."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me","review":"This book is not a good self defense book or a good book on jujitsu for that matter.

My dog is 16 years old! and did not chew on it. It's ashame because before this I had no problems.

Menton has a lot of experience working with individuals who have experienced the loss of a loved one, but, unfortunately he does not give a lot of practical information on how to deal with ones grief. He relates many stories, but his book never gave my anything I felt I could use in helping me deal with the death of my Mother this past Christmas except that no one should tell me how long I should grieve, and that there is no wrong way to grieve.

Being impressed with the performance despite the crowd's general apathy, I checked out The Aggrolites' albums the day after the concert and man was I impressed. I listened to their self-titled album first, which I have to admit is a notch better than the debut that is \\"Dirty Reggae.\\" However, all the songs on here are worth at least a few listens, and some have real sticking power.Stand-out tracks: Jimmy Jack, Black Lung, Pop The Trunk, Lunar Eclipse (probably my favorite; The Aggrolites do some great instrumental songs)Oh, and see them in concert as soon as you can.

Salvador Dali can be an interesting writer, and some sections of the book demonstrate this. The early chapters of the book covering his childhood are difficult to trudge through between irrational events and memories and ones that seem plausible. It is not a very good autobiography for recording ones milestones, but I suppose it recorded things that appealed and became ingrained in Dali to become motifs in his art, such as crutches for instance. As the book progressed Dali's philosophy became a little more clear and the book a little more interesting, especially as he and his wife Gala visited America and the world was prepping for World War II. All in all, I would rather have read a straight forward Dali biography than his convoluted auto-biography. You have to be a very tolerant reader to put up episodes that are difficult to visualizse or understand and to keep asking yourself, \\"Is this true or is Dali dreaming it up?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A striking book of genius, art, and eccentricity","review":"This book is the ultimate in thought and surrealism.

I love the words to the song because it gives me hope when I am feeling down to keep trying. I feel it is important to have music that can give you hope. That is the beauty of music. Music can help you no matter what mood you are in. I feel that music is so important to life. It is part of our culture. No number of words can describe what meaning this song has to me.

A well balanced mix of originals and covers, highlighted by his cover of the Janis Joplin classic \\"Piece of My Heart\\". A world class guitar player and passionate singer, Sarno dishes up a heaping helping of blues/rock that any fan of this type of music should enjoy. Included is a version of \\"America the Beautiful\\", dedicated to the memory of his late uncle who perished during WWII. While the song may seem out of place materially on this disc, it is a window into the character of this performer. With another CD due out late this year, Tony Sarno appears to me as a rising star in the field of blues/rock. Good people recording on indy labels need and deserve the support of the listeners, so if you are a fan of this style of music, I encourage you to purchase this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"the boy is real","review":"I used to play with Tony in the 80's in New York.

His prissy, \\"NOTICE ME\\" prose doesn't work in a full-scale biography, and his, er, interpretations of Warhol's art are often painfully embarrassing to read. Typical femmy claptrap from the author of the ridiculous Jackie Under My Skin. Will book publishers ever wake up and learn that no one cares about this kind of \\"writing\\" - especially in today's much-changed world. It's completely irrevelant and insulting to other, empathetic, compassionate people. Would that Koestenbaum were such a writer. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"There is no other word capable of describing how utterly pointless, random, and pretentiously written this book is. Wayne Koestenbaum has produced the single worst biography I have ever read. Not only is the writing style painful and full of semi-fancy language used as a subsitute for content, but the book skips over major parts of Warhol's career, concentrating instead on his many movies. After mentioning the Velvet Underground, Koestenbaum writes \\"Their music has many admirers, but it may be the aspect of Warhol's world with which I have least sympathy, and so I will beg off any attempt at analysis.\\" The utter ridiculousness of this sentence speaks for itself.One of the most infuriating things about this book is that Koestenbaum repeatedly attempts to make connections between Warhol's works that do not exist, and to analyze his art in ways that don't make sense.Do not make the same mistake I did and waste time and money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight","review":"This is one of my very favorite books. Wayne Kostenbaum's trademark rococo prose enlightens and delights. Clearly enraptured with his subject, he pulls out all the stops: free-associative, linguistically complex interpretations of Warhol's subconscious motivations and sexual neuroses abound. I cheerfully allow the author every metaphorical , grammatical, and Freudian excess, because here, at last, is someone writing about the 20th Century's most notorious and influential artist as if he were human. Significantly, Kostenbaum ushers the reader into an intimate, reverent viewing of the several important, rarely seen, and shamefully under-appreciated films Warhol made the 60s. You will either love this book, and want to revisit it again and again, or loathe it and not even be able to finish it.

The book is a quagmire of self-loathing and narcissism, it's the literary equivalent of being led through a maze by a blind person. Warhol's life story is one of hard work and dreams.

The rubber is exactly that of a basketball: thick and unforgiving when it hits you. Because it doesn't give, it's also not the best ball for kicking. Keep in mind that it's 8.5\\" too, making it difficult to get a square kick.I tried this for a few minutes and then decided I didn't want to risk someone getting hurt. I went out and bought the 10\\" red ball, used it for our game (a few hours with full-throttle kicking) until it transformed into an egg shape, and chunked it. While I prefer durability, the build of this ball just made it unusable.Not at all recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping problems ?","review":"I would not recommend ordering this item unless you can wait a long time for it to be shipped. Ordered it almost two weeks ago, and every time I check on it, the shipping time frame gets moved out. If the book is back ordered and there is a problem, it would be nice if amazon was up front about it. I need this text for class and since I was counting on it from amazon, the bookstore is now sold out. If I had known there was a problem I would have paid more at the bookstore and at least been left in a lurch. I have always had good luck with amazon in the past but I must say I am exceptionally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strict NO for starters","review":"The author presumes that the reader has an advanced knowledge of calculus even though the book is intended for use by undergrads.the content in the chapters of the book are not enough to solve the questions at the end of ech chapter.if you are looking for an introductory course in NA dont even think of using this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really need solution about C-language","review":"I bought this book september and studied hard. I tried to solving book's problems (where those was in backward chapter) using C-programing language. but those are so difficult to solve to me. so I really need a solution about C-language. If anyone has the solution manual, please email me. snoopy5@netian.com(south Korea)If Anyone give solution, I'll appreciate a little. Thank you for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst textbook. Please don't choose the course if this is the required text.","review":"This book basically gives no proper examples and solutions. If at all there are examples, they don't show the steps in between. The problem is given and there are 2 or 3 intermediate steps and then he gives the answer to the problem, but the problem might be having around 10 or 12 intermediate steps. I din't find this book helpful at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The book is a chore to read. Many excersizes reference other parts of the book, requiring you to flip back and forth between sections. The proofs are almost all hand waved. The book has obvious typos as well. The book is more appropriate for a high school course than a college one- if you are a mathematician, you will find this book offensive. Buy if you need it for a class, but as a student who was subjected to this book for an entire semester, I highly recommend against using it.Oh, and the cover is hideous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable book","review":"This book requires mathematical maturity. In our class most people found it very difficult to read. In the Introduction it says, that book is recommended for advance undergrads or begining grad students. I do not recommend this book for anyone interested in Intro to Numerical analysis. The Prof. teaching the class often handed out his own lecture notes, to spare students the frustration of reading this book. You will need the knowlege of Linear algebra, Diff. equ and solid knowlege of calculus to be able to folow the text. However, i guess for someone with advance knowlege in math this book may seem more beneficial, and they may be able to appreciate it more then i did. Best of luck in your studies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Being a university math major, first time in my life i have ever came across a math text with practically no solutions in the back of the book. Since the text is so complex you never know if your doing things right half the time with no answers to assure yourself. Horrible math book, made for a tough couple of months..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good with windows","review":"I have an 828MKII and used to have one of these. I thought buying my gear from one manufacturer would make stuff work. I was wrong. BSOD everyday until I disconnected the micro epxress. Now the 828MKII runs fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect first watch for son!","review":"My 8 year old son has had this watch for 8 months and it has never left his arm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"The booklet is pictures of postcards mailed to the deceased, sans address. I'm not surprised they hit the circular file instead of being returned. The art is awful. The description was much funnier than the book turned out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paint the Town Rocks!","review":"This is by far my favorite album that I own. Outside of a Dream, is one of the best songs I've ever heard, the lyrics, and sound are amazing. I find myself singing the chorus all the time. Once you get this cd, you'll find yourself listening to it in your car, and then taking it back inside with you, so you can hear it again. Also Keg on my Coffin is such a cool song. What I love about the Push Stars is that their music is so catchy, and has a great sound, but also the songs are meaningful. It's not fluff. Chris Trapper, Ryan Macmillan, and Dan McLoughlin are the finest musicians of all time. I'd definitely reccomend this album to anyone who likes music, and you should definitely try to see them play live. Paint the Town is a must own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great album","review":"I bought about 1000 cd's in my life so far and this is one of a few cd's that I can play, from the beginning to the end, without skipping any track.Awesome, the Push Stars got me hooked forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trompe L'Oeil: Techniques & Projects","review":"The only reason this reviewer gave 2 stars is for the faux finish stone effects.
