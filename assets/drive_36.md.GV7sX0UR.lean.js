Since I travel a lot, I like to watch movies on my laptop which is the reason for the two format purchase! But now, no way to do that.

Kristen Stewart has only one facial expression (disoriented anxiety) and I liken it to Harrison Ford in 'Regarding Henry' -- after he is shot in the head. Why is this person so irresistible? I suppose this would be cleared up if I read the book but I cannot imagine willingly interacting with these characters again. There was no chemistry between Stewart and either Edward or Jacob - and I believe Stewart is involved with Pattison in real life. Perhaps they sleep in twin beds. The only pleasure I derived was from the hilarity of the werewolf uniforms: regardless of the temperature, here they come again, clad only in long shorts. In short, it's awful and should only be seen if you have a crush on one of these actors but not if you have any interest in acting, plot or enjoying yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO. NOT.

Is it blind lust for the actors, or blind loyalty for the Books? I don't know, but the acting was HORRIBLE. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the acting on CW's The Vampire Diaries, blows this movie away. After being forced to watch both that show and this movie, I have to say I appreciate the Vampire Diaries show a lot more after seeing this garbage. Yes, I've read the Twilight books, and I can understand why those books have done well. So perhaps I am a bit biased that I hate the bad acting and bad casting, But I've really tried to give these movies a fair chance, and I am amazed how much praised this series gets even though it is mediocre compared to the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not subtitled in spanish","review":"i bought this for my wife, but she like to see the movies in Spanish. it says that it is subtitled but its not. all the other twilight movies i have bought her are spoken in Spanish. so i gotta get her another one now to make up for this.im sure the quality is good just never watched it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very disappointed","review":"I just received this DVD.

There were some things that were a little to fake and i wont spoil any scenes so you will have to watch it for yourself. Overall it was a good movie and i hope that Breaking Dawn will be more like the book since it will be in two movies. I will say that if you are debating on buying the movie you should probably rent it first or borrow it first, then decide if you liked it well enough to buy.

And if you're a teenage girl (or think like one), you will likely like this movie. But for people who like a movie with plot and character development, you're in for a long 90 minutes.First off, the characters are not believable. Every time Edward says EXACTLY the right thing that Bella wants to hear, it just doesn't seem realistic. Sorry, ladies, but no man is that perfect.The best way to look at this movie series is almost soap opera-ish. It's all glamorous, over the top and just not very believable. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect realism from fiction. But I still expect well constructed characters with strengths and flaws. That's really that main issue with Edward. He's all strength and no flaw, which isn't believable and it isn't very fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"after this movie series they will not be able to be inany movie","review":"just what the title says. is this a vampire series or a soap opera. the lamest thing out there. do not waist your time and money. you will thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is terrible","review":"i strongly dislike this movie and i strongly dislike the twilight saga and i strongly hate stephenie meyer for destroying the love of reading this movie and book series seriously is terrible do not waste your money on this dvd buy something else instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was unhappy to find that Edward and Blade did not fight","review":"I really like Vampire movies.

In terms of the 2-disc version though, the documentary is sorta short for being six parts and the \\"Jump to\\" part is cool, but all in all, it's skimpy compared to the special features on the New Moon DVD.

It follows nicely from the books and I'm not at all left explaining any scenes to my husband since they explain it all instead of taking bits from the book that seem randomly added or leaving it unexplained. I would love all the movies to be 4hrs long so the whole book is played out infront of me, but they don't do that.

Director Catherine Hardwicke brought the characters and the town of Forks to life with finesse and style. The directors of the 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse' have done little more than flatten the characters into two-dimensional comic-book fodder.

Don't compare the books to the movies and just sit backand enjoy the slightly altered storyline. They are still good and I enjoyed them.

In addition, the skill of the musicians is readily apparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historicism","review":"Hamilton's book advertizes itself as an accomplishment in finally clarifying for us the confusing and controversial notion of \\"historicism.\\" It provides a good survey of the key figures and philosophical commitments in the history of historicism and attempts to deal with the stakes involved in contemporary investments of the concept. But Hamilton's text turns out to be, at best, a kind of apologia and, at worst, a \\"how-to.\\" Consequently, his assessment--and understanding, I'm affraid--of historicism is delivered from the position of a believer and advocate. This contributes to the reproduction of a lot of conventional mantras about historicism, such as, for example, that it somehow represented--and still does--an \\"anti-modernist\\" position. We are still modernist, in a sense, and this is why, as this book demonstrates, it is difficult to think outside the framework of historicism. A provocative book, but not deserving of its authoritative title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seay put Cutlery /Bowl Set","review":"Does not stay put!

However, although Tally is having the time of her life, drinking the night away and going to tons of parties, which include the occasional hangover, the reality of her life suddenly hits her smack in the face. Her enemies from her previous life show up unexpectedly, along with something that will change her life forever. However, Tally picks up some crucial information that the authorities will kill her for if they ever find out. Tally must help her friends and cover up the evidence before it's too late. Or else, the answer is simple: game over. I personally loved this book, and if you like sci-fi like me, you'll be thrilled to hear the story of Tally and the others go on. This is a book that I think has surpassed many futuristic books of its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best book however dissapointed","review":"This was the best book ever!

As you find out something has happened to these teens to make them stupid to keep them quiet. Tally has been made pretty because of what she knows and now the members of the Smoke are trying to get her back.The only problem I had with this book was everything lingered on her being stupid and \\"bubbly\\". There was so much more to the story than her being stupid and I think the author needed to cut the stupidness and get on with it.I liked the book a lot but he didn't need to put so much teenage, stupid stuff in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first?","review":"Upon finishing the Uglies I knew I must have the second book in the Uglies trilogy. After reading the Uglies I thought there couldn't possibly be any way that the other two books were better than the first. How wrong I was. Pretties was quicker paced, enthralling and more informative than the Uglies. Although I was quite disappointed that the smokies weren't involved openly in the book so much, the author still did a wonderful job. He also did an amazing job introducing the character Zane. It felt like he had been there the entire time. There was more urgency in the Pretties it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Scott Westerfeld portrayed the Pretties in wonderful light I felt as if I was struggling with them all. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loved the Uglies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great YA dystopian series!","review":"This book had less message and more action than Uglies. Tally has become pretty and must decide whether or not she wants to stay that way. The author does a great job of making the pretties sound vapid. The way they talk and their pretty slang was so annoying I almost couldn't stand it. I picture them as a cross between Stepford wives and the Heathers. There's not much I can reveal about the plot without spoiling it so I won't but I will say it ended with a doozy of a cliffhanger and I'm looking forward to Specials the last book in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"I read the book before, then one day after few years later, I wanted to read the books again. SO I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book","review":"Scott Westerfield keeps blowing me away with this series. I love reading about the adventures of Tally and her friends as they search for what is right. This book is so amazingly intriguing and had me up well into the middle of the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great continue","review":"Uglies had me hanging on to every word, and I also enjoyed reading this one. Tally is a sixteen-year-old girl who was turned pretty in this book, and therefore, as said in the first book, parts of her brain are blocked out. I was disappointed by how she could just move on past her normal life and all the friends that she left behind so easily, but I guess that's just from my point of view. Overall, Scott Westerfeld wrote a great follow-up to Uglies and I look forward to reading the third book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slam dunk second!","review":"I will keep this short and sweet. The second book in the Uglies series bypassed the first book. This book was everything a novel should be, well written, deeply developed characters, well thought out plot...the list goes on. Nothing was predictable or a let down in this second installment. Tally moved from a character I respected, but didn't know if I liked, to a character I really enjoy reading about. At each twist and turn of the plot I was right there with her, saddened, excited and scared. The author didn't trick with any \\"easy-out\\" threads which completely brought my estimation of him way way up. I had jury duty today and finished the book while I sat there and waited for my name to be called. If I had a glass of wine I would offer a toast to Mr. Westerfeld. Nice job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor","review":"After seeing a couple reviews of Pretties I was beginning to doubt that it was going to live up to the first. I can see where the whole pretty talk can get annoying. But if you look beyond that, you see that the talk is just another aspect to some really dynamic characters that Scott Westerfield has created. I read it quickly and was not disappointed. The plot twists are original and real (the book doesn't feel contrived), and kept you intriguid from start to finish. I see that you can preorder the last one, Specials, already. I would not hesitate if you have been following the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why such a rave?","review":"Boring. As simple as that. I read Uglies and the concept was good enough to finish the book, but Pretties is just boring. I hate not finishing books, but I think I need to this time. Pretties is slow and has no feel of action. There is \\"action\\", but the writing gives me no thrill. This could have been a great series with the concept of the books, but the writer just didnt execute it very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretties","review":"I thought this book was \\"totally bubbly bogus\\" I was so sick of these three words that I found the book distracting! I actually started circling the words every time they appeared, (and that's a lot of circles per page!) I felt insulted, teenagers have a much bigger vocabulary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretties","review":"I loved Pretties. It was a great sequal to Uglies which was also a good book. Pretties was always exciting with not a boring page throughout the whole story. I like the way Westerfield writes, he doesn't go into too much detail and he keeps things interesting. There were times when it got too predictable, but for the most part it was a spectacular book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the Ending","review":"Grrrowl I was so mad when I got to the end of this book. It ends exactly like the first one, I really loved Uglies but the fact that the author couldn't think of anything creative that wasn't a \\"pretty-headed\\" version of the first book really annoys me. I will not be purchasing or reading the final book in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, horrible proofreading","review":"I am currently reading (and enjoying) this book, as well as the series. I love the way the story is playing out and will continue to read the books. HOWEVER, the proofreading job could be much improved. The sentences are missing crucial punctuation and cause some confusion. I have also seen some spelling errors. Again, great book, but the proofreading is quite horrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Once upon a time there was a girl named Tally. She lived an intriguing life of peril and excitement. And then she shows her brave, pretty face. Will Tally turn from ugly to pretty to special?Scott Westerfeld is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. This is the second in the Uglies series and I must admit he's made this futuristic world real for me. When I read his writing it's like I'm literally standing next to Tally as she goes through the events in this novel. Can't wait to start the next book in this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite in the Series","review":"This was by far my favorite of the stories in the Uglies Series with the main character as Tally Youngblood. I loved the conflict of feelings it created in conjunction with Book 1: the Uglies and I felt the story moved at a more compelling pace. I had that feeling of not wanting to put the book down, unlike Book 1 that took off slowly and took more commitment to get through. One of the things I loved, was how Westerfeld portrays the actions and relationships of teenagers, such as Tally and Shay's friendship-one minute everything can be going along just swimmingly and then one small change in perception and you have to reanalyze the whole situation. My other love of this book was the character, Zane. It was his storyline that kept me wondering how everything was going to turn out and the reason I would stay up to 1:30 in the morning reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very quick read","review":"I read this book in around four hours. Its alot like \\"the uglies\\" but with different plot twists. And okay, the guy named Zane in this story, she like COMPLETELY described him as Zayn Malik. Of course, One Direction wasn't even a band in 2008. Weirdness. Anyways, it's definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretties","review":"I found this book to be entertaining and imaginative.

There is more to this book than it appears at first glance."},{"rating":"2","title":"my reaction to \\"Pretties'","review":"I thought that uglies was better but that doesnt change the fact that this was a very good book and i loved reading it. I cant wait for specials to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is terrible!!!","review":"PrettiesI want to be clear here -- the book \\"Pretties\\" by Scott Westerfeld is fantastic. But the Kindle edition produced by Amazon.com is absolutely awful. You'll find at least one OCR error every 2-3 screens. Sometimes there are multiple errors per screen. \\"Um...\\" (which is said a lot) is consistently OCR'd as \\"Urn\\". Many \\"I\\"s become \\"1\\"s. \\"I'm\\" quite often becomes \\"Tm\\". There are random spaces inside of words.This absolutely crap OCR job renders the Kindle's excellent Text-To-Speech function completely useless. You begin to feel like you've completely forgotten how to understand the English language.Amazon -- if you're going to make a go of eBooks, you've got to have good quality content. This Kindle edition should never have seen the light of day. I will think twice before I purchase any more books for the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesomely awesome book -olivia","review":"When i first got Uglies i didn't know if I would like it. But by the end i loved it. I wanted to get Pretties wright away. When i got Pretties i loved it two . It was soooo good and i wanted to keep reading it. Now that i read those two i cant wait to read Specials. I think it is going to be really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretties","review":"I don't even think I can describe this book. I mean, in Uglies we left Tally off where she becomes Pretty. And she is now Pretty, but she gets her note she left herself and her and her new boyfriend, Zane, take the cure. They get cured, and then Shay gets mad because Tally doesn't share the cure with her. Anyways, Zane and Tally get some of the other Crims to run away with them, because Zane is getting headaches from the pill.In the end, Tally is discovered with Zane and they force him to become Pretty again and she is forced to become a Special.I like this book better than the other because I can sort of get a clue of what happens, but it isn't oh so obvious. I mean, she'll have to pick between David and Zane, and she'll have to find a way to get away from the other Specials. But I am so clueless about what will happen and so I can't wait until the new book comes out.Sorry if I spoiled the book for someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets with Sci-fi!!!!","review":"The further adventures of Tally Youngblood, this book is the slowest from the trilogy and my least favorite. BUT it still delivers in action and the adventure. It is more of a social analysis of the pretties and the uglies and the way they live their lives. It deals with enslavement and true freedom. This book is still good, but is the slowest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongest book of the series so far","review":"It's most unfortunate I read this book *after* I read the other three books in the series. (This book wasn't available in my library until recently.) I found this book to have a much stronger storyline than most of the other books, as well as the most enriching and growing characterization, particularly for Shay. I felt she grew much more in this book than in the third one. Also, the intensity of the relationship between Zane and Tally was a strong point and was a nice conflicting point when they met David/Tally remembered about David."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretties: the second book in the trilogy","review":"This was a good book. After the cliff-hanger ending in Uglies, I especially wanted to see what would happen. However, I was somewhat disappointed.The plot is not quite as tight and well-planned, and I thought it was somewhat less creative than Uglies. It became just a little predictable, and I quickly tired of the romantic relationship between Tally and Zane. It just seemed like they rushed into the relationship, and seemed like an unlikely match anyway.That said, I am still a fan of this trilogy, and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes teen fiction and the culture-obsessed-with beauty thing. I am very happy that we still have Specials to look forward too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This book was good, but I think I might like The Uglies better. I liked all of the action though."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Series!","review":"Scott Westerfeld has never disappointed me, but the Uglies series is by far my favorite of his works. The post-apocolyptic setting with just the right hint of romance and abundance of adventure makes it a great read for fantasy lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Inappropriate","review":"When you consider the grade levels the editorial reviews have listed this book for I was shocked.

I just cant make myself read another book from the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FAVORITE OF THE SERIES","review":"I absolutely loved this book out of the entire series.

One of the best by Scott Westerfled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookworm!","review":"Hey Bookworms. Ok so before you read the pretties you have to read the uglies or else it wont make any sense. But im guessing that you have all already read the uglies. So you know that the book is based on the future... I have to say that the pretties is a nice continuation of the uglies but since tally is pretty sometimes its hard to keep up with all the pretty talk. they say things like dizzy-making which means it makes you dizzy so wacth out for that and your all set!Have fun reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"It takes an amazingly good and energetic book to keep me reading.

She and Zane risk their lives to join up with David only to find out that the Specials have a whole new way to find them. Tally once again betrays and is betrayed. I'm enjoying this series. I'm not much of a science fiction reader, so to me this is Sci-Fi-Lite. This book took a little longer to get going, but the story did move a long. Hopefully book 3 will answer the questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretties by Scott Westerfeld","review":"Tally Youngblood is now a pretty but her brain keeps trying to tell her something is wrong will she listen to it?

Now, this might be a weird this to complain about, but where was the school Tally was taught in? Who taught her? Pretties? Specials? Some futureistic-robot?3. I hated, HATED, the words that were constantly used; Bubbly and Bogus. Then Zane said; \\"Bubbly is bogus.\\" Oh god, I nearly lost the plot when he said that.Things that I loved:1. The plot. It's still unique!2. Scott's writing is still impeccable. I could see every tiny detail.3. Tally is a dimwit at the start, but soon gets her fiestyness back. Hoorah!

This record, however, isn't far behind. The first two songs are rehearsal tracks originally released on a Sweedish 7\\". While poorly recorded, both are every bit as good as any of their classic singles. I especially like \\"Friends of Mine\\". \\"The Good The Bad and the Kowalskis\\", which I assume was written for the late Mike Kowalski of U.X.A., is also from the same rehearsal tapes. The quality of the live recordings is rough but not as bad as I had expected. There's lots of classics here, including \\"We Are The One\\" and \\"Car Crash\\". Too bad I was only about 6 years old when these songs were recorded. I would have loved to see them live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dancehall","review":"If you love dancehall reggae like I do, this album is a must. Some of the better dancehall songs of all time are on this album, and listening to it brings back memories of the early years of dancehall music.

I think the producers were attempting to change their sound to adapt to 1980 sensibilities, as evidenced by \\"rockish\\" \\"Liberation,\\" but this too simply does not feel like the Village People that made its earlier hits. However, there are two reasons I recommend this though only to disco devotees. First, there are some good songs. My favorite is the Ritchie Family's \\"Give Me a Break,\\" which I think is their best. The Village People's \\"Milkshake\\" is great in a campy way. Second, one will enjoy the soundtrack more if they have seen the film in all its horrendous glory. No review can do it justice: Xanadu pales in comparison to its hamhanded production and \\"plot.\\" It's so bad it's wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brideshead, bach, and vivaldi","review":"I believe that if, like myself, you like Bach and Vivaldi, you will love Geoffrey Burgon's music from the BBC production of Brideshead Revisited -- it is Real Nice Stuff -- unfortunately it never gets played on radio, and the production (which was Excellent too!) was about 12 episodes as I remember, and PBS doesn't re-broadcast it (I believe they are missing a bet), so simply; just no-one ever gets to hear it!I think that unless you are old enough to have watched PBS in the late 70s you have probably never heard this music.

The Puritans knew the value of theologically correct and deep prayers and this book is a reflection of that. I thought that the old english may be tough to get past (as I have a hard time with it for some reason) but that is not the case with this book. The language flows through the prayers and you easily get caught up in them. I would encourage all Christians to buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prayer Life Essential","review":"Reading prayers from this book should be included in every Christian's daily devotional time.

The contents of the book look like something I am going to enjoy using. However, in the description it was listed as \\"leather bound\\". It is not leather bound, it is stamped \\"bonded leather\\" on the back cover. I probably would have ordered the paperback if I had known that because bonded leather doesn't wear any better than a paperback. You might want to correct that in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, amazing wisdom and gut-wrenchingly sincere prayers","review":"If you're looking for a model on how to pray (outside of Jesus' example in the gospel), this is the book for you. The Puritans seem to have an awe-inspiring ability to capture repentance, purity of thought, sincerity, true love, and genuine desire for more of the things of the Lord than just about anyone else I've read. You can read all the modern emerging church books you want, many of which I love, but these prayers hold up against the test of all time and will stir your heart like very little else. The only other non-Bible book that has had a greater impact on my spiritual walk than the Valley of Vision is probably My Utmost for His Highest by Oswald Chambers. Neither is light reading, but heavy, drenched with the Spirit wisdom for learning what it means to be called by the name of the One who saves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewarding","review":"Every one should have a copy and use it daily it is an ongoing gift that is worth more than the original cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Valley of Vision\\" compiled by Arthur G.

Tanner spent many months in the fast-disappearing Southern old-growth forests in the 30s, and probably saw more ivory-bills than anyone in the 20th century. He describes their feeding, mating, etc., habits and regional differences.The sad thing here is that Tanner was well-aware that the birds were on the verge of extinction, and the tone of the book is quite poignant.I just wish this edition had more material on how the book affected later researchers and some updated material on the possible rediscovery of the bird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Album","review":"light but catchy straight ahead jazz.

Yes, the prose is decent, and the premise is undeniably attractive but, for anybody who holds the drive to Las Vegas close to their heart, these 3 separate tales of driving across the desert toward that glittery focal point called Sin City will all leave you feeling cheated. Why? Well, most of all, the author TURNS OFF THE HIGHWAY BEFORE GETTING TO VEGAS! How can you leave out the final 5 miles!? If you have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into a casino, what in the world are you doing writing a book with Vegas at its center? Yes, the author shows that he knows the road, and what the various mountains are called, etc., but he obviously has no understanding of what compels most of us to take that road so many times in our lives.

This book has no Elvis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Last November, I flew into las Vegas for the first time on a bright, sunny day.

I couldn't believe my luck when I happened across this book. But, the book left me bored and disappointed.

No other anthology can take us through the roots of such a relatively new genre in music.

I have been dubbing alot of my vinyl onto cd when I pulled out my very used \\"The Missing Piece\\", and noticed a few scratches so I went to Amazon and bought the \\"remastered\\" edition.

It's worth the money, but only because there's no competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unorganized collection of information","review":"The book does not have an organized approach to presenting ALE and EDI or it may have one but that is only in the mind the author.

It is not only difficult to read through, but also difficult to understand due to its vague and incomplete explanations of even basic concepts such as IDOCs, error handling, ALE/EDI enhancements. There is little or nebulous coverage of important topics such as workflow and performance tuning.Many concepts have been left unexplained, leaving the reader with the impression that it will be explained later, but is not the case...it is simply misleading.

Its coverage of ALE/EDI is very thorough and complete, it even gives some coverage of the application areas such as SD, MM, etc. I disagree with the previous comments and I feel that this book gives good coverage of ALE/EDI for 4.0, since from the technical perpective there were no major changes in ALE in 4.0 only more scenarios (HR scenarios mostly) and new enhancements to deal with inter-dependent IDOCs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No help at all..only theoretical nonsense & impractical e.g.","review":"How can you write a book about ALE, EDI and IDOC and not explain the fundamental concepts of IDOCs properly? The IDOC section has been relegated to the last few pages with no clear explanation. The ALE is sketchy at best, and the EDI is more than half of the book with mostly useless info. The cover claims to cover 4.X but there is no coverage at all - the info is still 3.0 - no mention of the expanded EDIDD record structure of 4.X at all!

So, uh...I guess I'm a loyal Adobe customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, but...","review":"Adobe assumes that their customers are their objects and may be treated as criminals at their whim. Built into the software is a humiliating exercise that inconveniences the user for greater profits for the company. It involves having to reenter activation numbers and serial numbers in order to use your property. If you have three computers you may only use the program on one of them.

And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien","review":"Having never seen the movie in its entirety, I came into this book without having any preconceived notions of what was supposed to happen, as according to the movie. It was an interesting premise, given that the crew was sent to their slaughter to find out why another alien vessel was warning everyone to stay away from the planet, and just what happened to the people that were chosen to host the alien offspring. The most disconcerting thing was that the alien was never fully described, so even though I had an image based off of what little I have seen, I was also able to think up something rather scary to me. All in all a very suspenseful read for me, since I didn't know how it would end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novelization of the sci fi thriller.","review":"Even if you have seen the un-cut version of the movie, this novelization adds so much more to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it","review":"Mario Moreno didnt get to really act in this movie.

Cantinflas was an orphan with two of his friends and ends up in the show buisness. His father has been trying to find him and only remembers him by the mark on his stomach.

This was a great movie. Special effects were fantastic and the animals were very real, very believable.The story is sweet, endearing and enjoyable for young and old.Oddly enough, I found the only negative to be Julia Roberts. Her performance was a little stiff; it seemed like she was reading each line. It wasn't horrible, but it was a bit uncomfortable.Over all, I still thought this was a great movie and would highly recommend it to anyone.One word of caution; my niece (who is 4 like my daughter) cried endlessly at the end of the movie. My daughter didn't react the same way. It seems that this could be a touchy subject for younger children so be prepared to answer some tough questions (just in case)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I thought this live action version was wonderful! I love, love, love the cartoon/book and yet also really liked this movie version. The voice actors did a great job, however, Charlotte's voice (Julia Robert's) fell a little flat. I think a better actress would have been Christine Lahti. Julia Robert's voice lacked the motherly, loving emotions that were portrayed better in the cartoon. Anyway, that was minor. I was weary to watch this movie because I just hated the remake of \\"Charlie and Chocolate\\" factory because of it's total lack of innocence and child wonderment. This movie, however, portrayed the beauty of friendship, childhood innocence, love for another beautifully. Of course, I still love the cartoon the most!

But after becoming and adult, it's lost most of it's appeal. The main reason is due to the story itself. The pig does nothing basically, but gets all the credit for the spiders work? Come on! If you are going to write a story called Charlotte's Web, shouldn't the story be about Charlotte? Sure the pig is cute, but he basically does nothing! Am I wrong? Rewatch the movie, and tell me if I'm wrong. Now compare the movie \\"Babe\\". There is a story about a pig who does everything in the movie, and truely earns his place on the farm with a lot of hard work. What can Wilbur in Charlotte's Web do? Oh that's right, he can sit under a literate spiders miraculous web all day long and smile pretty for the camera. Anyway, I'm tired and hungry.

Roman Polanski perpetrated it.

Ku'e blends English rap lyrics with traditional Hawaiian chants or a unique hip hop dancebeat with a Polynesian flavor to deliver Sudden Rush's message of cultural pride and nonviolent resistance to the annexation by and assimilation into the United States.

The locking mechanism did not work, and it could not be inserted into the plastic mailbox hole that it was supposed to go through. The entire thing was made out of the cheapest plastic. They probably ran off thousands of these things for about five cents each. After two hours of trying to insert the locking mechanism into the plastic using a sledgehammer, I tried to screw the latch onto the key cylinder. The key cylinder was too short to fit all the way through the housing, so the latch that would go up and down when you turned the key could not be attached. And in fact, once the mechanism was assembled as good as it could be, the key cylinder fell out since the holding screw could not be tightened. Tighten too much and the key could not be turned; tighten too little and the lock fell out. Save yourself real misery; don't buy this product.

I have modest expectations of a $79 bookshelf, but I was still disappointed. The overall finish of the shelves was very poor. They generally were dull and rough feeling, most likely due to insufficient sanding. But in addition they also had an occasionally shiny spot where someone appears to have manually brushed an area to deal with a finishing imperfection. There were also places where the drilled holes had punched through and broke out the wood behind the drilling point. This is a childish mistake for any manufacturer to make. And if that isn't enough - the first box I ordered didn't have mounting hardware, so it can't be assembled.

The story was choppy, the characters only cardboard cutouts that you could care less about. Nothing was in-depth and read like a book thrown together overnight by a couple of buddies over a beer. Even the hero, Ferguson, seemed more of an accident waiting to happen, and inept to say the least, to be leading a special forces strike team.

Though this is MILES more commercial than their earlier work, it's not even close to being the Worst Album Ever. There are at least 3 keepers: The opener \\"Words from the Wise\\" starts with the Gregorian-chant style old GG fans love & then works out from there. \\"Take Me\\" is a sweet love song with nice choruses. \\"Giant for a Day\\" is obnoxiously catchy Jethro-Tull-like fun. The rest are at least inoffensive. Nowhere near as tricky or intricate as the earlier (recommended) FREE HAND, OCTOPUS, THREE FRIENDS, POWER AND THE GLORY, ACQUIRING THE TASTE, etc., but worth a listen for the open-minded...."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT pop music","review":"Hey this album is great. hate to say it to all the gentle giant fans out there. the songs are all good, and friends is a very nice song, not perfect but good.

I usually listen to more \\"pop\\" music than prog, so I enjoy this just fine. As pop songs go these are pretty damn great pop songs. But as prog songs, they aren't even prog songs.

In a quirky look at the entertainment industry, you'll see the behind the scenes drama that arises when Hollywood tries to go green. It's informative without being too preachy, and you'll learn that going green isn't so easy. You'll truly see the stress and conflict that arise when people are asked to give up their everyday luxuries and conveniences in the name of saving the earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative and Enlightening","review":"Overall, I think that the documentary was extremely effective in conveying its message. I think that everyone, including myself, assumes that Hollywood is a green industry. In reality, Hollywood is still very far from attaining a green lifestyle. In this sense, I think that the documentary inspires the viewer to make \\"greener\\" choices in their own lives, instead of waiting for huge companies or organizations to adopt green lifestyles.

By interviewing members of the cast and crew, the doc shows how they want to be green, but don't really want to alter their own habits to do it. Despite the great content, Greenlit struggled to find it's voice. At times the film dragged a lot and some elements of comedy fell flat. The narrative was a bit inconsistent and it wasn't entirely clear how successful they were at making a green film. Overall, however, this was a worthy documentary that did a fine job of presenting a problem and the hypocrisy that surrounds it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening","review":"This was a really informative documentary that didn't take itself too seriously. I really enjoyed watching this movie. I had no idea the amount of waste that the film industry creates. It seems as if a lot of Hollywood stars are big supporters of creating a more green culture but that is not really practiced in their own industry. It was really interesting seeing the difficulty of making even one film more 'green'. But the film shows the complexities of creating a green set and how it can be more costly and make the jobs of the crew more difficult.I would recommend to anyone who is interested in how films are made and those concerned with 'green' culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this really necessary?","review":"Horrible acting is made up for by special effects.The original movie, much better by far, had a tighter story with less silliness and no gratuitous gore.If you're seeking something for the special effects ONLY... then this is for you.If you want a story and good acting then stay far far away.Doesn't even rate to a 'B' movie subcategory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Took forever to come in then did not work.

This film is typical of today's horror movies: production values over the top and storyline and originality lost in the bottomless pit of the phantom zone. The gimmicks, clichés, and the twisted ending are all part of the course in this movie: all meant to gross you out instead of mesmerizing you with intrigue and mystery. The original and dated 13 Ghosts movie of 1960 has a far better chance of mesmerizing you than this over budgeted and poor excuse for a Hollywood bromide."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst movie ever","review":"This is the worst movie I've seen this year. The acting is horrible (Shannon Elizabeth should just stand there without saying anything) and the script tries to cram 100's of good ideas into 90 minutes. Granted, there is lots of potential with the idea of 12 evil ghosts being used to fuel an evil clockwork house, but 90 minutes is not enough time to set everything up for a fulfilling, blood splattering end. Basically, at the end of the flick, I was sitting there wondering how on earth these actors got cast, why the concept of \\"undying, selfless love\\" was written into a horror script and how chemistry goggles can allow one to see ghosts.

But as I emmerced myself in it's \\"plot\\" I couldn't help but to notice that it was nothing more than a different version of House on Haunted Hill. However, unlike House on Haunted Hill, this movie tends to lack substance. Sure, it had a concept behind it, but a bleak one at that.By the end of the movie I was highly dissatisfied at it's lack of a thicker plot. It left me empty and wanting more insight to the story. I won't put any detail in my review about the actual plot as it would spoil it for those that _might_ actually want to see it.I apologize to those that thought this movie deserves 5 stars, but it truly doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy it!","review":"From the moment this movie started I could tell it was going to be a dud. Sure enough, that's how it ended up. The only thing I liked about this movie was some of the costumes/effects that were used for the monsters and such. However, the acting, storyline and just about everything else was a major let down. I gave this movie 2 stars for the simple fact that Shannon Elizabeth was in it (hot), and that some of the costumes were nicely done.

Just one thing, it was OBVIOUS when something (only sometimes though)when something was going to happen.Ah yes, this could have easily- for me- been a 5 star, but:...But overall it IS scary, more so for the younger audiences.

I was afarid this movie would be too gross for me. It wasn't. The trueth is that the movie was too stupid for me. The dialog is pathetically bad, and the story line is absurd. The movie attempted to be shocking, but wasn't really. Nor was it spooky or scarey. I love a good ghost story, but this was pathetic. There was no rhyme or reason to this movie. It was incoherent. Apparently, the producers felt that money alone was enough to make a good movie. They were wrong.I gave this a 1 star, because there are no zero star ratings.The only good thing I can say about this movie, is that it (inadvertantly) made me laugh. A lot.Don't buy this movie, don't rent it, don't even watch it for free.One more note- my wife, found that the constant *flashing* in this movie made her queezy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be a horror movie?","review":"There are so many plot holes in this movie.

This movie failed at everything it was trying to do. It tried to be scary and funny at the same time, which never works anyway, and failed at both.

Then to make it worst the kids family SPLITS up to find this kid in the same area. The entire plot is unbelieveable and does the classic (stuff) bad horror movies do.

That is how bad it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 Snores","review":"I'm no critic, and I still dislike this movie.. The acting was poor.. it's as if they're reading from scripts they've only just been handed an hour prior to filming. The plot was terribly predictable.. even without all of the overblown foreshadowing. The set was amazing and the effects skillfully done, but all wasted by an anti-climactic, snore of a story line.

The characters were mostly really annoying and I hoped something nasty would happen to them, especially to that icky little kid, who used a chirpy tone and gleeful expression when informing someone that his mother had been burned to death, and his boring, bratty sister.

The ghosts start escaping from their containment spells room one by one. That is when all the excitement starts to begin. Thir13en Ghosts isn't a bad movie. It uses a different style of horror (example- the house is all glass and elegant instead of the traditional old messy house on a hill....)

The story is definitely great, and as for the setting it is excellent! The film combines horror, drama, action, and adventure making it very enjoyable, as long as you're in that kind of a mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie! Unfortunately, not scary.","review":"This is a great movie. It's not scary though, but the plot is amazing. I hear that it's a remake to an older version, I haven't seen that one, but I might want to. You should probably rent this movie before buying it, how everybody else's reviews are all over the place. You'll have to see it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD's extras are putting perfume on a...","review":"...well, you know (if you've seen John Carpenter's They Live that is). 13 Ghosts takes the quaint little haunted house comedy by William Castle and tosses it into a blender with A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 and 4 (where it lifts its autoyard sequence) and Dark Castle's high octane remake of The House on Haunted Hill (where it takes everything else) and mixes up a rancid milkshake of a movie. Plotless (I've read the they started shooting the movie with an incomplete script, boy does THAT show) and pointless (having seen the exact same scenario played out in a far better manner in The House on Haunted Hill), 13 Ghosts is an utter waste of time. Stay with the House on the Hill, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"What can I say besides this movie is average AT BEST. Yes, the ghosts look cool but its all downhill from there. The acting is horrendous, except for Tony Shalhoub who gives a typically strong performance. The scares are virtually non-existant save for a few jolts only caused by sudden loud bangs following silence. The story is a corny haunted house-inhabited by ghosts one, upgraded technologically. If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a scary movie, also look elsewhere. If you have you're heart set on a haunted house movie, go with the original (1963) The Haunting or The Changeling (1980). But if you must have a recent one, 1999's House on Haunted Hill is superior to Thirteen Ghosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laugh at those who found this scary.","review":"Even stupider than the first. Yes it's that bad. At least the first was funny. This was just stupid. Nothing scary here. It is a movie you can laugh at with your buds though. Doesn't matter when you watch it, in the dark or 2 in the afternoon. This flick won't effect you at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is one of THE WORST Movies I Have EVER seen","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I am a huge HORROR movie fan. There is no sympathy for any of the victims/characters whatsoever, as they are all rather unlikeable. A total waste of time and money (unfortunately I bought the darn thing) Rent it first if you feel you must, but trust me on this one. BAD, BAD, BAD! It doesn't even deserve ONE star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense and horror done well","review":"There are certain criteria in every horror movie that need to be met in order for it to be a good horror movie.1. Recycled plot2. Gore3. Campy dialogue4. No long lingering looks at the bad guy5. The ever popular don't go in there sceneThis is why Thirteen Ghosts in my opinion far exceeded the cirtically acclaimed Jeepers Creepers. In this movie the spirits trapped in the basement are given just enough screen time to be identified, yet we are not allowed to sit and study them. I was made to jump many times durring this movie, and loved every minute of it. It's sad that it didn't do as well as the dissapointing Jeepers Creepers."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'd like to give it a zero","review":"This movie was not only bad, it was insulting. A family inherits a glass house and discovers that it's really a death trap designed by the devil. Oh and their are some extremely ugly, exteremly angry ghosts in it.The character of the nanny was a huge step back for black actors. She was dumb, loud and at one point does a turntable rap effect. She also spend the whole movie cursing, whinning and rolling her eyes and showing her teeth. Had this been made in 1921 all this would be excusable but for 2001 it was shocking.As for the rest of the movie there are too many plot holes and poor dialouge to make it worth your while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thirteen Ghosts a Zero Movie","review":"Thirteen Ghosts fails as a horror movie in many ways. Firstly, the acting is inadequate even for a B-movie. The writing is poor; this movie has a plot that is paper-thin. The makeup is effective, however, there is no suspense, and in fact the scare factor is on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon. My recommendation is: save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worse Horror Movies Ever Made","review":"This movie isn't just lousy...anybody with no budget and a couple of drunk buddies can make a lousy horror flick.This movie is INSULTING. Though an obviously large amount of cash was thrown at this project, the dialogue is IDIOTIC at best, the jokes are unfunny, and the premise is ridiculous.You know how frustrating it is to see unbelievably dumb characters say and do unbelievable dumb things in horror flicks? All the while spouting innane one-liners? Well, this movie re-wrote the book on all of that. You'll be BEGGING the monsters to kill these idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing","review":"A complete labyrinth of confusion, I could not explain what this movie was supposed to be about in a gazillion years. There's a family whose mom gets burnt in a fire and they are left a house by a rich uncle. Easy enough, but then the house is not really a house at all, more like a maze, surrounded by nothing but glass, glass walls inside and outside, corridors leading nowhere, strange combinations and sequences of events lead to... well, nothing actually. Not only was it really stupid, it was pointless. At least, if there was a point or a plot or a theme or a message, it was hidden very well under a haze of badly put together scenes. Too bad, I was really looking forward to a good horror flick. If you are looking forward to a new adventure in horror, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"lives up to horror genre","review":"if you go to see this movie for its' plot, don't bother. but if you came to see gore and horror at its' best, then grab a couple of tickets. 13 ghosts lives up to its namesake...there really are 13 ghosts that terrorize an innocent man and his family. and boy do they terrorize. there were parts where i was sitting on the edge of my seat saying, \\"i cant believe that i just saw that happening.\\" great movie for horror fans...if you're into gore and violence, then you won't miss out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic remake based loosely on the original!","review":"The newest movie to get a bad remake is \\"13 Ghosts\\". It's based loosely on the original William Castle movie made in the 1960's-1950. Other than that that just about all it shares in common with the original. If you like the other William Castle remake of \\"House on Haunted Hill\\"(another remake that did not to be done, you might like this. This movie is a mess, with too many plot holes. too many special effects etc.. Also why could'nt people watching the movie wear special glasses like they did with the original movie? Having the actors wear them was pretty lame.If you like any of the movie stars fine but I'd rate it as one of 2001's worst movies! I wonder why Matthew Lillard was in this movie? Maybe he has a contract with Warner Brothers?As for me, I wish I spent the movie I used watching this trash and bought the original on DVD. Please Hollywood stop remaking classic movies and just release the original movie instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And I though that the re-make of 'House On Haunted Hill' was bad!","review":"This was worse then the re-make of 'House On Haunted Hill'!Why...?!1. The whole pace of the movie and chain of eventsin this movie were exactly the same as they were in'House On Haunted Hill'!2. It was another gore-fest!3. The actors were not that good!4. It would have been better if we learned moreabout each of the ghosts and where they came from...5. Again the movie does not deliver one good 'BOO'!Again it was another gore-fest that didn't seem to have much of apoint to it...!My grade: F or one star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlucky Ghosts","review":"In theory, Thirteen Ghosts should be an excellent movie of the macabre. You have the hideous ghosts, a supposedly suspensful plot, it should work out but its doesn't. Why? The charcters!To make a long story short, I never seen such an aggravating, dysfunctional group of people in my life! The kids drive you nuts, the adults get on your nerves, if you are not careful you actualy start rooting for the ghosts (who, when you get right down to it, have a good reason for being upset!).Where's Dark Shadows when you need it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matthew Lillard alone is worth seeing this","review":"First of all, I have to say that I am not a fan of horror movies, BUT after I saw \\"Thir13en Ghosts\\" that kinda changed.The cast was very good, especially Lillard, but...I hate that Juggernaut (and Hammer)! (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.)Believe me, this movie will freak you out. Don't make the mistake of watching it alone at night like I did. There are alot of frightening parts, so this is just ONE:Arthur and Kathy are in the hall (Arthur ahead of her). Kathy stops and slowly puts on the glasses. The Jackal is RIGHT in front of her.The music video by Tricky is extremely catchy. I just kept playing it over and over. At first, I didn't like the song, but I guess it just grew on me. I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT! If you don't see the movie AT LEAST hear the song.Overall, \\"Thir13en Ghosts\\" is great. Everyone should see it at least ONCE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The F/X scared me...","review":"Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) is an adventurer and collector who dies under paranormal circumstances. His nephew Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), a recent widower, becomes the heir to his considerable fortune, which includes an amazing house. This wealth emerges in a very suitable moment, since Arthur is struggling financially with two children. However, the house has a terrifying secret that is waiting to be released upon the arriving relatives. Beck uses superb special effects that produce true fear, but they are not balanced with the story leading to an awkward cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"More humor than horror","review":"Definitely, by far, one of Matthew Lillard's better performances as a sarcastic individual. This movie did get overall terrible ratings from most movie critics, but the truth is told by the fans and growing underground love for this movie. I wouldn't neccesarily call it a cult classic, but it is teetering the fine line. Good movie if you want to scare little kids, but overall it's more humorous to those who have a slight incline to the love of the dark side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Horror Movie","review":"This movie had more depth and perception than most horror genre movies. You can grasp the concept of good and evil and the lines are well divided... Good will always triumph.The computer generated house is an amazing piece of technology work. This is something that even goes beyond Spielberg's techniques. Frankly, after you see the movie you'll definitely understand the saying \\"people who live in glass houses should not throw stones\\".Definitely worth a second viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extras Better Than The Movie","review":"The extras on this DVD are better than the movie itself- a bunch of annoying characters- specially the irritating child actor who shall remamin nameless- are trapped in an elaborate haunted house which seems to have been inspired by the \\"Hellraiser\\" puzzle box. The ghost and the house are imaginative and the behind the scenes features go into their creation. Watch them if you want to but skip this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice effects, production design, that's about it.","review":"Tony Shalhoub is a widower who inherits a giant, glass house from his recently deceased Uncle. Everything's great for him and his family, except the place is inhabited by ghosts! Dark Castle's second haunted house thriller features some very gruesome ghosts (particularly Shawna Loyer as the Angry Princess), a neat sliced-in-half gore effect, and an energetic performance from Matthew Lillard, but this movie isn't nearly as enjoyable as its previous venture (House on Haunted Hill), thanks to Steve Beck's unbelievably headache-inducing direction, a silly plot that actually \\"borrows\\" scenes straight from Blade and Casper(!), and the utter predictability and sickeningly sappy \\"love conquers all\\" theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Paper thin plot, bad acting, bad script, bad direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"How can I put this...Oh yeah don't waste your money!What you can expect from this movie is the same thing you expect out of most horror films...a big yawn! I love to watch a truly scary movie and ghost just happen to be my favorite scary topic; but this movie just didn't cut it. If anything it made me wish I hadn't eaten my dinner before I went. I will admit that the movie did get a rise out of me once, but in general I slept pretty well that night...trust me that's not a good sign!If you are looking for a truly scary ghost story I would recommend you see \\"The other\\" staring Nicole Kidman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average acting, great FX","review":"Ok, the acting is not that great, especially not from the living actors, the ghosts do much better job. But that all counts for little compared to the wonderful sets and the awesome special fx. Also, although this is a remake, the story is still fairly original. Put that together and you've got one of the best horror movies come out lately. A must for every horror [person]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy but trashy!","review":"This is a 100% typical Hollywood scary movie and has almost the same technical structure as \\"The House On Haunted Hill\\". The only big difference besides the plot is that \\"13 Ghosts\\" has contents the more expensive visual effects and with Shannon Elizabeth something nice to be focused on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, visually appealing ReMake","review":"\\"13 Ghosts\\" is pretty good entertainment, tightly compacted into a little less than an hour and half, so the action doesn't slow down. The \\"haunted\\" house set is stunning as are the various gory ghosts... Not much of a story but who cares. My only real complaint is with the bathroom scene with Shannon Elizabeth who is exploring the house early on in the action. She enters the spacious shower-room, admires the bath tub, lightly drips some water on her face..but never gets in the damn tub...c'mon in a horror/haunted house movie, there has to be at least one shower/nude scene...and don't tell me that just because the above scene also had the nude ghost in it that this condition is satisfied...a nude ghost with knife marks and blood all over her does not qualify....otherwise...good flick"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This was a pretty good movie. The specail effect really do look great. The plt is passable, bearly adequete. The acting is good to O.K. Some of the plot doesn't make a bit of sense (That guy was dead! Wait he's alive?) but this an easy forgettable movie. I enjoyed being pretty scared throughout and also enjoyed Shannon Elizabeth. Despite what other people think, I think she is a great actress. Just because she plays a ditz in a couple movies (ok 3 or 4) doesn't mean she shouldn't get a chance in other movies. This was a good baby step away from the ditzy roles. (Jay and silent bob strikes back was another, kinda.) I hope she continues to make good movies because I really enjoy her and her acting. As for the movie, it is good except for one more problem. The movie is so loud and has so many sparks and flashes, you will probably have a head-ache at the end. The finally is extremely loud and bright. Shannon Elizabeth makes everything alright, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, boring and annoying","review":"Very big dissapointment this was. Now, the ghosts were well-done but poorly used. The sound effects were so irritating (every-time a ghost appears we get the same noise), the acting was terrible (Matthew Lillard is such a hack) and the story was really dumb and boring. Potentially this could have been a good film with some decent acting, tension, build-up, writing, directing, etc!How many times do I have to watch a friggen pair of glasses fall onto the floor?God this was as boring as an hour in church. Yawnfest."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 Ghosts................","review":"So-so movie. It has it's good parts along with some boring parts but overall, good special effects with the ghosts. There were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch.

Just a OK movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it..much","review":"It starts of with a weird guy using a psychic to capture ghosts. Sadly he dies. his relitives inherit his house, but in it are the 12 ghosts he has already captured. These ghosts are evil, and are roaming the house looking for things to kill. The people are trapped in house with ghosts.Ok..I didnt like it..the old version of it was better, lamer and funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly Mess","review":"This is without qualification one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It isn't even redeemably laughable. It is confused and difficult to follow. Even Tony Shalhoub, who has more than proved himself in previous efforts, and in his TV series, can't help this mess. The only gory or ghastly thing about it is how mangled it has left William Castle's wonderful film, upon which it is based.See the William Castle film instead. It's not very frightening, but it is creepy, and will make you feel like a kid at Halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 Yawns!","review":"This movie was terrible and should be named 13 Yawns.

Were any of them *actually* scary? Does Shannon Elizabeth have any similarity to Tony Shalhoub?

Notice they're doing everything they can to disassociate themselves from this garbage.Hollywood produced some real (...) this year, but even Bones was at least a watchable movie until it's ridiculous ending.

However, WITH THIRTEEN GHOSTS, the idea to remake a classic with today's new and improved graphics was one kicking idea. And it definitely worked. I have no working knowledge of the original but many people have told me that it does in fact stay true to the original plots and characters. I especially thought that the excellent performances only enhanced the quality of the flick even more. I personally think that this is by far the best performance by Matthew Lillard.

It's as if those who made them thought that having a lot of special effects was more important than having a good plot, good characters, good scares, etc... This movie, The Haunting, Ghost Ship, House on Haunted Hill (I liked it a bit though), Fear Dot Com, Phantoms, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Jason X, The Rage: Carrie 2, Blair Witch 2, etc... are all very lame. Many of them were made with big budgets, but they all feel cheap.

It doesn't help that the only film I could find that he gave a four-star review to (ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA II) was one that he happened to have a strong supporting role as an actor in.

The reviews are not only informed, elegant, witty, and to the point; together they reveal a consistent and illuminating perspective on the Hong Kong film industry of the last decade. Fonoroff clearly has his own, Hollywood-derived aesthetic, but in this his judgments always have the ring of truth insofar as the Hollywood style remains the pretension of most mainstream Honk Kong film products through to today. In this respect, Fonoroff's \\"At the Hong Kong Movies\\" is an excellent companion piece to his earlier volume \\"Silver Light\\" (still largely unavailable in the US), which is an indispensible pictorial history of Hong Kong cinema from its inception through the 1960s.

However, real fans of the WWF will love this CD. Just get rid of Dude Love and Sable (which have already been released on Volumes 2 and 1, respectively) and this CD would have been even better. I can't wait for Volume 4; I predict we'll see the new Rock, the Corporate theme, the new Undertaker theme we heard at Wrestlemania, the Raw theme, Al Snow, and maybe some lesser guys, like Blackman, Hardcore Holly, and Droz.

As Baldwin begins writing his screenplay, it seems that the things he is writing start to come true, with tragic results for some of his friends.Veiled in inexplicable ambiguity, EVIL EYES never fully explains what is going on so the viewer is left with no sense of resolution or understanding.

It does not cover 2 burners it sits in the middle of each burner causing the handles to be right ove both burners. Very dissapointing, I love the le creuset normally and was really looking forward to having a grill pan made by them. Unfortuanatelly due to the shape it will not work for just one burner either.

If you are like us and don't want a thousand single-use products in your home, you may really like this grill. We use it in the winter to grill steaks and get those beautiful lines. We use it to grill veggies. (My favorite: asparagus with some olive oil. Then sprinkle with sea salt and garlic powder). But our most recent use, paninis!!! I made a cheese and ham sandwich on italian pugliese bread or chiabatta, sprayed with a little grapeseed oil and put it down on the grill, put a cast iron pan on top of it as a press, then flipped it over and did the same. Our paninis looked beautiful and tasted out of this world!Update in Nov 09. It isn't always easy to keep clean. Still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient size-no problem","review":"While some don't like the size of this grill pan, I find it easy to work with. Just position the middle of the grill pan over the burner and heat slowly for even temperature throughout. The fact that 3 other burners are free while I grill meat on this grill is helpful in cooking other dishes for the meal. The patina does take a while to build but now I use very little (if any) grease to make it nonstick. I found that cleaning works best with a quick soak after the grill cools. Just some dish soap and enough water to soak the grill for 20 min or so was enough for easy cleanup with a plastic brush. Before the patina develops, there is a bit more careful cleanup but this diminishes over time. I've enjoyed this grill for over a year and it is a staple part of my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok","review":"I just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom. However, after using it several times, I would choose a different grill because of the following reasons:#1 The spatter mess - there is virutally no way to prevent splatter when using this pan creating an unneccessary amount of post-cooking clean-up.#2 There is no option of purchasing a lid#3 The pan itself has an odd rectangular shape that does not fit on one burner or two for that matter. Thus, somewhere while cooking you have a cool spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"Anything by Le Creuset is worth the price.

It gives the reader a look into life on a Scottish estate, not focusing too much on any one character, but letting us have a close glimpse of each of the five children as they grow up. It is a \\"real\\" story--life happens naturally, not with too much melodrama. I recommend it for any audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII Family Story","review":"D. E. Stevenson wrote about 50 novels mostly set in rural south west lowlands Scotland in the middle part of the 20th century, with WWII often looming just before or after the time of the book. In this one we go through the war. The story of an estate and its family, it uses Stevenson's common elements of distracted, neglectful, and irascible parents or other authority figures by whom the children are damaged, and must find their way to wholeness and independence. It's fascinating to see the old pre-war way of life (eight house servants to care for a simple family of 7) give way to the deprivation of warand its aftermath. A very easy read with a beautiful setting and great characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more do you need?","review":"This was the only book I used during my clinical rotation in Psych.

The questions in this book is too simple and straight forward. The questions on the shelf exam is very difficult and complex (i.e. a patient with a manic episode 20 years ago now shows up with depressed symptoms. what is the diagnosis?). I would recommend studying First Aid or any other resources and memorizing the DSM4 criteria for all of the major psych diseases for the shelf exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete explanations","review":"Explanations are often incomplete, only explaining why some (not all) of the wrong answer choices are incorrect. Unfortunately, this seems to be most common when there are a couple answer choices that both might be good options--it is in these situations where an explanation of why one answer is better than the other is most important, and it is in these situations where the \\"second choice\\" answer is conspicuously absent. For example, this book states that methadone is the best option for treating a heroine addiction, but even though buprenorphine is one of the answer choices no explanation is given as to why methadone would be a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Travelers-but be careful!","review":"Zagat survey's are a great way of finding out \\"what's hot\\" when visiting a new city. The rankings are usually fairly accurate in large cities like New York. This version takes the top picks from local guides across the country. This can be a little misleading if you try to compare 2 restraunts in different cities, since the rankings are do in large part to the opinions of locals. For example, the highest score for food for a New York restaurant is 28 out of 30. Seattle on the other hand, has a restaurant ranked at 29. Does Seattle have a restaurant with better food than New York's finest? Absolutely not. If you keep this in mind and look at the relative ranking within each city, you will be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but still good","review":"Because this is GH1, i can't say that it's perfect.

I picked it up an tried it without knowing what to do and was convinced it blew.A friend got it and could not stop bragging about what a great game it was. I just laughed at him while he played and thought to myself he looks stupid but wow I love that song. He continued to play great song after great song. He told me to try it and despite my lack of coordination after being told how to play it was suprisingly fun.I was told that the learning curve was pretty good and that if I played it for 12 hours straight I would get the hang of it.We then proceded to play for at least 5 hours and I loved every minute of it.I now own both versions of the game and 3 guitars.One word of advise get a wireless guitar you will enjoy it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Became A Fan With GH2, You Will Like This","review":"The game that started it all. This game has some really fun songs to play and great songs to listen to. If you bought GH2 and are thinking of getting this as well, then you are making the right choice. This game is fun, but maybe not as good as the sequel. This game has a lot of classics, and less contemporary songs, which is an interesting change. The gameplay is the same as the others and just as addictive. Overall, a worthy game to buy if you loved GH2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenager's dream...","review":"My teenage son loves playing all of the Guitar Hero games, but he seems to like the songs on this game the best of all.

I even like to play every once in a while just to make a fool of myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Hero Rocks","review":"This is a great game to play by yourself and is even better playing with someone else in face-off or co-op modes. Great track listing of mostly hard rock music such as Black Sabbath's Iron Man. I would recommend 2 guitars though if you purchase this game. Being able to battle a friend is what really pushes this game over the top, because come on, who wants to play a guitar game with a controller. I went with two wired guitars instead of the slightly more expensive wireless ones just because I was concerned about the wireless guitars cutting out and missing notes. The game plays a little like Dance Dance Revolution in the fact that you have to hit the notes by using the fret buttons as they scroll to you to play the song. This game is a must have for anyone who likes rock music and playing air guitar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the original GH still rox!","review":"I began my Guitar Hero career with the 2nd edition. Once I was sure I was going to be playing the game for a long time I purchased the first one.Although the first edition lacks the depth the second one has (the ability to play as different roles, individual difficulty selection for quick games, being noticed when a song is played perfectly), the first edition packs a heavy punch with some killer tracks that the first edition just can't compare to.Guitar Hero I even seems more challenging than it's sequel. Your fingers will learn to fly at an earlier stage of the game, and you will have no choice but to learn the pull-on and pull-off's before attempting the hard level."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"My kids love this game and we all play together . their friends love it too and say that it is great"},{"rating":"1","title":"The set looks nice, but low quality","review":"perhaps you get what you pay for.I have a few discs that are hard to start playing and one that won't play at all.

Fortunately, each of them has the same quality special effects, acting, and script: lame. I know Superman is supposed to be kitchy, but from time to time, it seems that somebody is trying to break out of the box. It just isn't working, the box seems to be made of Kryptonite, because when they try to break out, it dies.I wish somebody would approach me to write a Superman script. I wonder if it would turn out just as much of a disaster as those 6 films. I mean, maybe Superman is like ketchup: whenever you pour it on something, it becomes the ketchup. Superman is the kitch ketchup. Anything you do with him turns into kitch.There was a Supergirl movie a while back, I think. And there was another film where it wasn't Supergirl, I think it was titled: My Girlfriend is a Superhero, with Uma Thurmann.

It contains all the history and the reasons why the Superman movies' quality went down hill after the first movie. It also has a free offer for all the movie posters. If you listen to the commentary from the first 4 movies you can hear the directors shooting verbal slugs at each other while explaining their sides and opinions of the whole Superman movie arc.

I am thrilled to dive into this massive collection!The only glitch for me is the case of \\"Superman 3\\" which is the same as the box set edited in 2001. I'd like to have it replaced just for the sake of having an extended edition and also to have it in better quality than the previous set (this is the first movie I saw on the silver screen so I want the deluxe edition promised). I don't care about the 2.0 dolby track for Sup's 1 because I got the old box set.The only problem is that I am a french customer and I'd like to know if the replacement from Sup's 3 will be possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"No dolby digital for Superman 3 and 4 ???","review":"This is an outstanding boxset and I have only one complaint. Superman 1 and 2 are mastered indolby digital 5.1 but not 3 and 4, all you get is dolby surround which is what you got with the original dvd release. Still,they are worth getting for the deleted scenes and the audio commentaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbox!","review":"I purchased this box set for my husband -- who has been a HUGE fan of Superman since he was a kid -- as a Christmas present.

I normally don't fuss over extras with DVD's but this was definitely an exception! Only one complaint - though I know Superman III and IV were not well received, I would have loved to have seen them get the surround sound treatment as the first two did. Still, a really great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much hullabaloo over a great set of DVDs!!","review":"Great Collection. Nice price. Ok so there are a couple of omitted features but it's not worth all the hysterical fuss.Some reviewers make it sound like their ENTIRE Christmas is ruined because of a stereo soundtrack and bonus features. Puhleeeeze!And all this actual anger towards BIG BAD EVIL Warner Video for \\"lying\\" to us about envelopes etc is nuts. Y'all take things so personally -- maybe it's time to put things in proper perspective. It's not the end of the world. Warner didn't do this to you, Joe Dvd, to ruin your life. It's just a DVD collection which by the way is fabulous!Oh BTW I'm keeping my \\"flawed\\" collection intact which will probably become a collector's item BECAUSE of the errors.

I love the Superman movies. And the price is resonible. But I bought this set twice, and all of the discs were scratched to pieces in both sets, and to boot had fingerprints abound on them. And I had the same problem with their ultimate Matrix set as well. And in Salt Lake where I bought it, these were gone extremely fast, and so the second set I had to buy was all the way down in American Fork, with accidents all over the road making it take about 2 1/2 hour drive. Only to find out when I got this set, I was not the only person experiencing the same problems. Trust me people. I know it would be awesome to have the bonus discs and documentries, but is it worth the risk? This are brand new! They shouldn't be looking like copies you'd find at the library or video store! You have to decide that. But as for me, I'm never buying one of Warner Brothers \\"Limited Edition Giftsests\\" anymore, it's not worth the headache. Thanks for letting me vent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you all!","review":"Thank goodness for the reviews on the blunders of this set. I have it my shopping cart right now, and will delete it as soon as I'm done typing this. I cannot believe a company like WB can screw up like this. Then again...maybe I can.

Now I have a fancy box set with with NO usable DVDs.

Manufacturing, not so much!","review":"The set comes in a cool tin case and has a bunch of cool extras. The only problem is two of the discs were covered in what looked like a a dusty glue solution that had to be cleaned off. Believe it or not those discs work fine albeit stained. However disc 3 of Superman 1 won't even load. Tried it 5 different dvd players, three computer drives and 2 home DVD players, with no luck. I've read about all the problems WB had with these sets and now I can personally attest to the fact... What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, but a word of warning","review":"Amazing collection, and i don't seem to have the customer service problems that the \\"reviewers\\" who gave it one star seemed to have.

Extremely painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Stuff!","review":"Like the title says, this is the ultimate collector's must-have. What's really cool is Bryan Singer's Video Blog that tracks the days of pre-production to production and post for Superman Returns. An exciting and rare moment with Peter Jackson on the set of King Kong was documented too!!!I have always wanted to get all the Superman films and this collection gave me much more than I expected. The documentary made about the historical and legendary evolution of Superman is an eye-opener and totally worthwhile. You gotta have this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Collection","review":"What a great collection this is, especially with Richard Donner's version of Superman II. However, my Superman III disc is the bog standard one as previously released, not the deluxe version (with commentary and deleted scenes) despite what the packaging and the label on the disc itself says. I've contact warner brothers and am awaiting their response. Has anyone else noticed this, or is it just my box set? But aside from that, this collection is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly Worst DVD Set Production EVER!","review":"And not because of the content of the DVDs. The movies themselves are fine; although deep down inside everyone was a little disappointed in Superman Returns. I have purchased and exchanged this set 3 TIMES! First time, not all of the DVDs were functional. Second time, DVDs' special features fiasco. Third time, the DVDs' case was broken and the discs were loose and got scratched. Tired of this, I finally kept the set that I had on hand. However, it's worth noting that the DVDs were out of order in the case, which makes some peoples' complaints about receiving duplicate discs and missing others more plausible.How could Warner Bros. mess this up so badly? It's Superman for crying out loud!! He is one of their flagship franchises! I have hundreds of DVDs and have never experienced this much difficulty in finding a quality copy of a boxed set. I will think long and hard before buying any more DVD sets from Warner Bros."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply appalled","review":"i am simply appalled at this. i also purchased the original version of this box set and yes, mine had two problems: i had the original DVD release of Superman 3 with no special features (which is really embarrassing considering it has the new Ultimate Collection label on the disc) and i didn't recieve the bonus disc for the theatrical version of Superman 2, i recieved two copies of disc 1. granted, i am happy this version is supposedly the right version of the set, but where does that leave people like me who shelled out the 76 bucks for the original flawed version? do i get a FREE copy of the corrected one or do i have to replace the ENTIRE set? this move makes me not want to buy anymore Warner's DVDs......i will however, but this is still truly disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think The Set Is Fixed Now.....","review":"Just received my set for X-mass, and all the errors have been fixed on my set.

The set has the problem that people have been talking about. Discs 1 and 8 are defective and missing features. Then on top of that problem disc 2 of Superman Returns and The Look Up in the Sky Doc are completely missing from the set. Instead I received multiple duplicates of other discs. Warner Brothers serious mishandled this problem. I called the 800 number and was told that they could send out replacement discs for 1 and 8 but that the others were my problem and I should take this up with Amazon. Seeing as it was Warner Bros production problem, I don't see the logic in that. Warner Brothers dropped the ball on this release and in it's customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"no tin holder","review":"I ordered this product, but when it arrived .

Sklansky's books about limit poker are excellent reads, however, this book is lacking of any advanced poker theory. For beginners, I would recommend any books by Tom McEvoy and T.J. Cloutier. For advanced players, I would definitely recommend the Harrington on Hold 'em books by Dan Harrington, both volumes.

I know he's supposed to be the best poker author, but I feel in this book he gives very few examples of his concepts, and sometimes he spends too little time on a topic that deserves more thorough explanation.

The book was enthralling - the movie true to the book. To watch the personal struggles each general faces when ordering his men into battle and sure death is captured very well. Berenger, in a wonderful performance as General Longstreet, truly captures Longstreet's agony when ordering his men to march across a one mile open stretch into blazing guns. Daniels, as Chamberlain, gives a moving performance as he tries to rally his men to fight for the cause. Probably Jeff Daniels best role to date. Richard Jordan's performance as General Armistead, is the most moving of all as he discusses with Longstreet, his personal dilema with raising his hand against his best friend. Truly a struggle between brothers, friend against friend. Well done! A must see. A must read, as well!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Film","review":"A must have for any fan of the Civil War history. It ranks up there with Glory, another classic.

Lee screwed up at Gettysburg when he wouldn't listen to Longstreet and that was depicted with brilliance in the movie. Gettysburg was Lee's greatest blunder and I'd rather watch a movie showing him as a human being than as some saintly untouchable Southern icon myth.Ted Turner put this movie together brilliantly, especially the largest collection of Civil War artillary ever fielded for an event, over 300 Napolion 20 pound field guns were used in the artillary duel before Picket's charge.Sadly, Richard Jordon was lost to cancer after this movie, what a great actor, I will never forget his performance as Lou Armsted."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY ONLY ONE DISC","review":"You have got to understand. I love this movie. Being a reenactor myself, i take great pride in watching the movie not only for historical purposes, but to also see some of my friends in it as well. BUT WHY one disc?? Why do I have to turn over the disc to watch the second half of the movie. Its a shame. Movie like this coming out on dvd. Its what dvds are specially known for, their compression to have more room on a disc. Why not just have the movie itself on one disc and the extras on another. I would well pay the extra money for it. For that I give this dvd 4 stars. Maybe in the future they will reconsider their fault and make it 2 discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite movie of all time","review":"Gettysburg has to be my favorite movie of all time. I am disappointed that the extra scenes are not part of the DVD, for those explained in a little more detail the Confederate debacle in front of Cemetery Hill. Although there are some historical flaws, and some of the beards are pretty goofy looking, I felt that the movie was historically accurate. I think there should have been more details about the second day then there was. Not once in the movie was the bloody fight of the first Minnesota mentioned (The book passively mentioned it). However, the drama of Chamberlain's charge gets me every time I see it, as does Pickett's charge. To top it off, Randy Edelman's soundtrack is beautiful and appropriate. I have to admit that I have only seen it through one time (However, I have probably seen it a dozen times if I combine the partial viewings.)

When he got command of the 20th Maine, he was promoted to Colonal, just a few days before Gettysburg. An for those that want A.P. Hill in the movie more, well you know there were hundreds of generals there. You can't show all of them. Unless you want the movie to be longer. And many don't. I don't know why, because if you cut out that movie anymore, it's not going to make sence. This movie dosen't cover half of what went on there, just the main points. But it is a great movie. So, watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, if flawed, epic","review":"What could possibly out do the sheer drama of the greatest crisis this country ever faced? Gettysburg is an excellent film, magnificent in scope, filled with truly great performances (did you ever see Jeff Daniels any better than this?). Just a few flaws: the battles scenes were quite good, but I've seen better, and the film occasionally takes its own historical importance too seriously.

There are some parts of Gettysburg that are quite good, such as Pickett's Charge and the 20th Maine's defense of Little Round Top, but the excess speechifying and moralizing, along with some poor casting choices and poor production qualities, hurt this movie badly. Killer Angels the book gets a strong 5 star rating, Gettysburg the movie gets a tepid 2 star ranking at best. Gettysburg is not nearly as good as Glory, but it is mildly better than Gods and Generals.The history of the Civil War is replete with interesting stories to tell, why can't the people at Turner Productions hire the best directors and cast to do the job right instead of cheaply and swiftly ?

I also found that side of the movie dedicated to unstanding battlefield strategy and tactics was extremely poor. There was an attempt to portray the poor intelligence both sides had to deal with, but I found the screen play was inferior in its treatment of what was happening all over the battlefield.

Even though, in the four hours length of it, we are presented with only small samplings of what was a monumental three-day battle that continues to comprise more than any one human being can wholly comprehend in a lifetime, \\"Gettysburg\\" draws the viewer in to where s/he can't help but want to visit this place, walk these hills and fields, and read and learn more and more of what happened there, and how what happened there has continued to define who we are, even now, as a nation.

This movie puts us right there on the battlefield with great men such as Robert E. Lee, Winfield S.

This is my favorite movie of all time. Even though, it is 4.5 hours, it is well worth it. Sitting there watching it, you get sucked into the time period. You can't stop watching it.

Having said that, however, it must be remembered that the battle was fought as a series of blunders and mistakes by the various commanders. This movie makes clear the important results of these errors, and it strongly points out the \\"fog of battle\\" that surrounds any military action; a condition any commander would recognize. As history, this movie is much closer to reality than to fiction, and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Gettysburg","review":"This is an excellent movie for anyone interested even remotely in history and is a must for Civil War buffs! Although, it is a long movie, I feel that it is truly worth the viewing.The first half of the movie seems to move more smoothly and quickly than the second half (which is why I only gave it four stars). The main reason for this, I feel, is the superb acting by Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain and Sam Elliott as General Buford. Both of their performances are truly masterful.The second half moves more slowly but is still worth watching. The battle scenes are extremely well done and I particularly appreciated the fact that the movie was actually filmed in and around Gettysburg and in the park itself.I felt that the weakest characterization was that of Robert E. Lee, for while Martin Sheen's acting performance was technically well done, I did not feel he captured the essence of Lee's personality.Well worth watching more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg","review":"Gettysburg is an outstanding war movie. The story is historically accurate, the war scenes are first rate and the drama of that battle is expertly portrayed. No details were spared in the filming of the war scenes which are not only accurate in every way but emotional and realistic. The acting is superb with great performances by Berenger, Sheen, Elliot and Daniels. The drama and dialogue portrayed by them with each other and their soldiers demonstrates the tremendous leadership and motivational qualities that these great men possessed. The motivational speeches to their men captured the emotion of the time. Finally, the uniforms, accents, language, old photographs and period music are splendid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg","review":"I bought this movie for my husband, because he loves civil war history.

I will try getting someone to update the bluray for me that has internet but I am dissapointed by this especially with the price charged for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Copy","review":"It is a great story, Unforunately the quality of the sound was very poor. Had to turn up the volume and then got a loud buzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg - a Brit's opinion","review":"What (combined with my reading) seems an unbiased and realistic narrative of the battle. The cast is superb (Jeff Daniels in particular) and the cinematography is excellent. This is now quite an old production, and in fact I bought it to replace my VHS copy which had started to suffer. My only complaint with the movie is the characterisation of the British Guards officer as a mildly dim upper-class twit (English term, but you get the message!) Well worth buying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overbearing Soundtrack","review":"The first 2 hours and twenty minutes of this 4+ hour movie had about 2 hours of soundtrack that overpowered the dialogue and the sounds of battle. It was so irritating that I finally had to stop. I like a good soundtrack but this was not one of them. It was WAY too sentimental and over dramatic. And it never clicked with the film. Maybe one day there will be a director's cut that deletes about 80% of the score. Until then, I won't be watching the second half of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BAD MOVIE - a depressing movie about a sad, sad story","review":"I'm not rating the movie itself, or its ingredients, I'm rating the feeling it creates. Of course, in the first place, the story it tells is a terrible nightmare that came true, just like WWI and II.Concerning, the movie : the quality of images, the light, the music, the noise,the soundtrack , the historical reports , the costumes down to the hats, the technology, all the techincal details are prefect, even TOO perfect in a way (how can I dare say that). Most actors are fabulous, the performance is great. Some scenes are excellent, some squarely bad or depressing.However, among all the sadness, I also perceived a lot of underlying irony, and I can understand part of it but I also hate it ; I felt mostly uneasy watching this movie from start to finish.The final charge of the Virginians led by Pickett is terrible and very moving; in one way it is an example of utter courage, faith and sacrifice, but such a big mistake essentially."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film puts us close to the heart of CW battle action.","review":"When I first saw R. Maxwell's GETTYSBURG, it was first run, and the theatre was full to capacity. Most in attendance were re-enactors or historians like myself. Although the film propagandizes to a degree, GETTYSBURG explores the energies that drove both sides during the three-day ordeal in and near Gettysburg, PA, in July, 1863. The Civil War was fought heart to heart as well as hand to hand, and this film's strength-- like M. Shaara's novel, THE KILLER ANGELS, on which it is based-- is its heart. GETTYSBURG might have its greatest fans among history buffs, but it remains an American story worth seeing and seeing again. Show this film to your children. Unless we understand the terror that war is, we will be forever bound to re-engage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!!","review":"I have seen this movie at least 15 times. I have read the book The Killer Angels and the book followed it well. Loved the music and bought the CD as well. Finally visited Gettysburg. It was both an awesome and somber experience.Highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"For me, a good movie is not one that only entertains, but also educates. This movie really started to pique my interest in the Civil War and I don't think I can ever get tired of watching it. I really believe Jeff Daniels should've been nominated for an oscar for his portrayal as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably The Best Military Drama EVER!!","review":"If your a Civil War buff like I am this movie is for you. It vividly portrays the 3 day slaughter by actually putting you into the front lines with Col. Chamberlain or chrging up the hill with Gen. Armisted. Plus, it's not a boring documentary. I must agree though, the mustash's were pretty \\"interesting\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever Civil War Movie","review":"This is without question the absolute best Civil War movie ever made. It is beautifully filmed, expertly directed, and features stellar performances by Berringer and Daniels. If you are a Civil War buff, you must have this DVD in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Sound Compared To VHS","review":"I love this movie to death, in spite of all the flaws mentioned in the reviews found herein. I personally feel we're lucky the producer made this film at all, and that it turned out as well as it did. But I will not dwell on the movie content, and focus instead on a technical point that keeps me from giving this DVD 5 stars. While the DVD picture is superb compared to the washed-out look of the VHS tape, the audio has been re-mastered, and in the new soundtrack the former bold crack of the guns is now quite muddy and muted. The original VHS soundtrack is still available on the DVD as an option, but this is only useful if you speak French. I much prefer the original VHS mix myself, and believe a 5-star DVD should give viewers a choice of soundtracks - all of of which would be in their own language. While I will definitely keep this DVD in my collection, I have also purchased a back-up set of tapes for the long-haul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"A movie truly on a grand scale. Depicting the true horror of this terrible war. America ripping itself apart and inflicting wounds that are still with us today. The only down point of the film was Martin Sheen in a less than spectacular performance as Robert E. Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"6,000 bayonets, being locked into place\\"","review":"I had been anxiously waiting the filming of The Killer Angels, but did not realize that it was happening until I picked up the Philadelphia Inquirer and read a reviewer's account of the filming of Pickett's Charge. \\"It was hot and still at Gettysburg yesterday. And then there came a chilling sound not heard on those fields for 130 years: 6,000 bayonets being locked into place.\\"That this wonderful motion picture was filmed on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg makes it almost perfect. Are there points over which students of the War for Southern Independence can quibble. Sure there are.But as the lights came up for the inter-mission in a theater in St. Louis county -- a theater filled almost entirely with men -- there were sobs. I turned to the fellow next to me and said \\"I first read about Little Round Top when I was 8 years old. I have finally seen it.\\" He could only nod.Get it and treasure it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg (DVD)","review":"I just purchased the movie Gettysburg in DVD from Amazon and am extremely happy with the content. I am amazed at all the information that can be put into this DVD. As another reviewer has already stated, I was disappointed that it was not the extended version, as that version contains many scenes that explain the movie better. For instance, when Lee is discussing the rocky hill that Gen. Ewell failed to take, in the short version you're left not quite knowing which hill, but the long version explains that it is Cemetary Ridge. The extended version is incredible and I would like to see that offered. But that notwithstanding, this movie is absolutely magnificent. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPDATE ON REVIEW ON TIMINGS","review":"UPDATE:I had a reader contact me telling me that the Blu-Ray disc of Gettysburg does indeed have the full 271 minutes. I did get the disc and he is correct. It is amazon.com's write-up that is not correct.However, I am still correct with the Pearl Harbor information in the review.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Why, oh why, can't the studios release the entire (extra footage) feature length discs on Blu-ray? I have the Limited Collector's Edition laser disc of Gettysburg running 271 minutes. This Blu-ray edition is 261 minutes. The director's cut of Pearl Harbor on Blu-ray is also the PG-13 issue, not the R-rated 184 minute issue available on DVD. When films as these are finally released on Blu-ray disc - we should be able to purchase the extended cuts of the films which this format particularly favors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berenger's and Daniels' best","review":"Tom Berenger's Confederate General Longstreet is a superb portrayal, his best work since the near-psychotic sergeant in the otherwise forgettable \\"Platoon\\" and not equaled since. It leads the list of excellent portrayals, including Chamberlain by Jeff Daniels, his best work ever (his speech to his unit was done with Civil War recreators from Maine and powerfully affected them and him). Martin Sheen is the wrong actor to do R. E. Lee but this unconvincing portrayal is not a fatal flaw. The acting, even where license is taken with the historical truth, does accurately reflect the people involved in the struggle. While a must-see for Civil War students, anyone interested in history will appreciate this film. The advantage of the DVD is, of course, the lack of interruptions so the viewer gets a better sense of the flow of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Civil War Movie","review":"This is a good depiction of the Gettysburg Civil War battle.Plenty of action...realistically portrayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"If you see only one multi-hour movie in your life, see this one. The actors (professional or otherwise (eg: civil war re-enactors)) are at their very best. With this DVD edition there are several \\"special features\\", one of which is the \\"making of the movie\\", in which over and over again the term \\"hallowed ground\\" surfaces as an explanation for the level of historical accurateness and character depiction achieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great audio","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. The Blu Ray version showed alot of scenes that were deleted from my original DVD. The audio on the Blu Ray is 5.1 Dolby Digital. To some people, this might not matter but my husband and I have a surround sound set-up in our living room and this Blu Ray was outstanding, just like we were in the middle of all that was happening. It would help if the audio version was posted on the site when advertising Blu Ray DVDs so as not to disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Battle - mostly right","review":"Purchased this for my son-in-law, a semi-serious Civil War buff, but now a busy Naval officer. Watched it together. He said it was the most nearly accurate telling of the battle he has viewed. I only wish I had seen this movie before I visited the actual battlefield years ago.I thought the language was somewhat stilted, but then, I had to remember that was the way people talked ~150 years ago. Perhaps some of the portrayals of the Southern leaders came across a bit too strident, but, hey, I have yet to meet a born Southerner that was not passsionate about the topic. Aside: I married into a Virgina family with down-country roots dating back to the early-1800's.Others watching it thought it ran a bit long, but the battle did take place over 3 days. Buy it and have an extra bag of popcorn ready to toss into the mircowave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martin Sheen ruined the film","review":"This movie was excellent except for the depiction of General Robert E Lee which was absolutely horrible. Martin Sheen's depiction of a snivelling, second guessing, wimp was so off base. Casting Sheen as Lee was a total blasphemy of Lee's character. Regardless of his service to the Confederacy, Lee was an outstanding leader, intelligent and strong, You would expect to see a bigger then life man motivating and captivating his troops while standing strong and true. Whoever made this casting decision made the wrong one. Every other character and aspect of this film was almost true to life...it is an excellent experience if you can get past the scenes with Sheen. ...but, to be truly honest, Martin Sheen really ruined the film for me which is the reason why I have never viewed it again since it was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with 1080p transfer quality","review":"I have the regular DVD in 4:3 Ratio and was looking forward to this Blu Ray release. I even bought a new Panasonic blu ray player just for this movie.Upon first viewing, It seemed like everything is too dark with poor shadow detail, even after color adjustments. I have a Panasonic 1080p plasma HDTV and I can tellwhen picture quality is not there. It is sharp but I think there is something wrong with the transfer to Blu ray. Maybe there will be a REDUX/REMASTERversion released next year. The movie itself is excellent all the way through, no problem with the movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie froze many times","review":"I have Netflix as well and never have this problem.....this movie froze numerous times which took away from the viewing experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"boringq","review":"Got this to show my students and after 20 minutes of straight dialogue, no action, I was so bored I decided against it. I am sure there is value but I didn't have the patience to find it so I was sure my 13-year-olds wouldn't either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sux.","review":"The blue ray version stinks. The original widescreen production was chopped to fit the hd size tv's. It loses alot due to the cropped picture. The addition scenes are worthless, and I see why they endeed up on the cutting room floor. I'll give it away and watch my original DVD copy thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's review (bloopers)","review":"I would like to state that I am a Civil War buff so to speak and have made dozens of trips to Gettysburg over the years. I have also watched \\"Gettysburg\\" dozens of times as well.In watching the movie, I have picked out some \\"bloopers\\" that I'd like to share with you. These all take place in tape #1.1). Watch the roof of Lee's Headquarters. There's an antenna on it. 2). Take note of the patches on Chamberlain's shoulders. He suddenly changes rank after Little Round Top! 3). Immediately following the first day's battle, The Chamberlain Bros are walking into camp where Lt. Chamberlain talks to 3 prisoners. Look at the sky as they enter that scene and see the jet trail in the sky. 4). During the scene where Gen. Longstreet is introducing his Generals to the English visitor, watch Darnell's positioning. As the Generals are being introduced he switches from Longstreets side to Pickets side time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinima memories","review":"Soon after Ted Turner released this movie to the theaters for show my father and I drove out to Towson to see it.It was one of the last things we actually did together as he died a few years later.We're both Civil War buffs among other things. Avidly read much on the subject. Killer Angels being among those books we read.Seeing the movie was logical.We were not disapointed in our expectations. Far from it.It was long but we wished it were even longer as the content was histoicly accurate and well packed. Performances were excellant. Jeff Daniells as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain was super superb. Only Martin Sheen's peformance as Robert E. Lee was better. We loved the music. We loved the costuming. We loved the fighting scenes. Everything was great.If anything could be deemed a fault it is that it is not longer and filled with even more scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg - Learn History while being entertained","review":"Very well done.

It is the most instructive, realistic, with very good actors playing in it ! For once, just like in \\"Gods and Generals\\", the movie is more focused on the southern side, which is not very often the case.I am a fan of this part of the U.S. history, and especially of the South, and I was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-see","review":"An outstanding movie - gripping, subtle, and engaging. Yes, parts of it seem somewhat romanticized for film (Chamberlain's speeches, various wistful glances) but even those are probably not too far from possible truth. One thing which continually stirrs up controversy, apparently, is Sheen's depiction of Lee. I thought it was sensitive, compelling, and possibly quite accurate. Senile? I don't think so. Careless and/or irresponsible? Nope. It is true that his actions in that campaign stirred up his own commanders (who debated it years after the war and Lee's death). I still get chills watching Sheen in this role. Lee's evident sincerity, commitment, and absolute dedication are all apparent. Someone commented that \\"it's amazing his men didn't shoot him\\", or something like that... I think this is a remarkably myopic thing to write... remember - this was just one campaign in a long war, and Lee had won many victories prior (and after)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg","review":"This movie is totally awesome. It had a lot more in it than the original movie did. I feel it is a very informative movie of the civil war. I don't think any of us in this time of our lives know exactly what those fellows went through in that war. We ought to be thanking everyone that has fought in a war for our freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small production film with magnanimous results","review":"Accurate in most aspects, and though one knows what the outcome it's going to be, the film does an excellent job of bringing suspense. The strength of this movie radicates in its objective view, not taking sides and not portraying the confederates as evil. It also excels at absorbing one into feeling the emotions that would've been felt by the soldiers at that very moment. Four hours well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg","review":"Gettysburg is a great movie, and one of my all time favorite war films. When I watched this I had an old love for history rekindled. I then went and read the book that this movie was based off of \\"Killer Angles\\" by Michael Shaara. Then from there I started looking up some of the characters like Chamberlain, seeing as he's not taught in schools, to find he did exist, he was there, he did do that, and from there I decided to study the Civil War. Civil War enthusiasts, will enjoy this film, it's heart touching, and shows you in a vague manner, what the war was like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg CD","review":"This is a great movie.

I would buy an another new movie from amazon and would recommend it to a friend with no reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"The movie seemed historically accurate as told from the Union side. Unfortunately, the movie leaves out many important battlefield events--events like the \\"battle of the wheatfield,\\" or the fighting in the orchard. Much is left out. My main complaint was a lack of passion in this movie--a lack of emotion. The characters walk into the battle like toy soldiers, albeit colorful ones. They seem to take pride in a lack of emotion. On every level, this movie fails to show the stress of battle, the fear, the hatred, the horror or emotion of human beings shooting each other down by the hundreds like cattle on a smoky, choking, dusty, noisy, confused battlefield. Maybe I am missing the point, but I just could not feel this movie--it lacked emotion, and I probably would not watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fix Bayonets!","review":"Until the action sequences and battle simulations, this thing plods. The script is very poor. Martin Sheen turns in another wooden portrayal. It had to be long to cover the three days of battle, but basically the only worthwhile aspect is the action, beginning with the struggle on Little Round Top. Using reenactors and authentic locations was about the only good idea at work in this thing. Despite all that, probably worth seeing, just for the action, and here and there some of the performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"non appearance","review":"since you haven't actually sent me this dvd I don't know how you expect me to review it.

There is only so much violent warfare that I can take in one sitting, and this movie has about one hour more than my limit. The movie is also a lot more sympathetic to the North than the South. This movie certainly makes me glad that I didn't have to participate in the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"I can't belive that some of these reveiwers were watching the same movie that I saw. This movie was OK with history, but too many vorbose monologes for me. Everyone was going on and on with long speeches which told a lot but were way to boring. Martin Sheen was a terrible Robert E. Lee. His acent was not belivable at all, he sounded more like he was from South Boston rather than Virginia. And what was with his hat? Wasn't he carrying it most of the movie? Did they pay someone a lot to do his hair and that is why he almost never wore it? I am a big Civil War person and have a great interest in the time but this movie was soo long that I thought I actually spent the 3 days the battle took. I would have given it a 1 except the history was fairly close to the way it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointed in the quality","review":"This DVD was horrible quality. It looked like a pirated dvd. Very difficult to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This film was on TV a few years ago and I tried to watch it. One of the first red flags was Martin Sheen playing General Robert E. Lee. Egads! What an insult to General Robert E. Lee! Robert Duvall was a much more believable Robert E. Lee in \\"Gods and Generals.\\" And did you know that Robert Duvall is a descendant of General Lee? Yes. Click on the trivia facts link on the \\"Gods and Generals\\" page here at Amazon. Duvall even kind of looked like Lee, which I cannot say for Sheen.I have seen some negative reviews of \\"Gods and Generals\\" saying it was too much dialogue and not enough battle. Thats interesting, since I thought \\"Gettysburg\\" was too much talk, and just plain boring. And sorry to repeat myself but Martin Sheen playing Robert E. Lee puts this movie in the toilet for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong run time delivered on a good movie","review":"There are two run time versions of this movie.This listing had it at 261 minutes which I have only seen on TV and has some interesting added material to the 254 minutes length of the origional release.As I had purchased a 254 minute length DVD years ago I was disappointed to get another 254 minute version on this order.

The worst scene is one where Lee comes riding out and is cheered by the Confederate troops. Actually, this scene was not intended for the film, but was shot of the RE-ENACTORS (who were used as extras) cheering \\"Lee.\\" It's too modern.Likewise there is too much apology made for the efforts of the Confederacy. While the adored Lee (who is played by Martin Sheen as though he was on tranquilizers the whole time) is given ample screen time, almost no attention is paid to Meade, the Union Commander. Indeed, many would think that Col. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine won the battle all by themselves!While better than most films about the war, it is still Hollywood, not history."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the soul of the battle...","review":"I live in Fauquier County Virginia, home to many of those who really were in Gettysburg. While there were indeed some slight alterations attributed to artistic license, the artistic value and realism are incredible. Chamberlain's talk to the 2nd Maine, his bayonet charge at Little Roundtop, and the heartbreaking stories of Armistead, Garnett, Reynolds, and Hancock were tear jerkers. Sam Elliott, bless you for insisting on absolute accuracy in your dress. Steve Pohanka, thank you for insisting on authenticity throughout.

I am a reader, and am so inevitably disappointed by movies that I was completely amazed how good it was! Never the student of history, I so loved Gettysburg that I hastened to read the book on which it is based, The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara. From there, I've been devouring everything I can get hold of on the subject. That's how much impact it had on me!The only possible improvement I can imagine is a different casting of General Lee. Martin Sheen doesn't look anything like him, and his accent was nothing close to Virginian (and I'm not even a Southerner). I agree with the other reviewers who've said Robert Duvall makes a better Lee.All the other castings were perfect. 4 hours isn't long enough...you'll find yourself hating for it to end! I really can't recommend this movie enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price...","review":"Well, if you're looking for an affordable collection of Shakespeare's works (plays and sonnets) to read, then this is definitely the book for you! If you're looking to intensely study Shakespeare and get as many footnotes and literary interpretations as possible, this is NOT the one for you. However, this collection's paper quality is all right, the words are actually readable, and you will find some introductory essays as well as a glossary of terms at the back. The glorified cardstock cover is prone to easy damage (even in the mail getting to me, as I discovered), though it is nicely colored."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bargain!","review":"Quite a bargain for $20, and lightweight compared to other Complete Works that are out there.

In the interest of my student's pocket-books I chose this complete works. The lack of editorial notes makes it unusable in class.

The footnotes are numbered as such and touch on not only definitions, but expressions, historical figures, and locations. These appear at the bottom of the page where the word or phrase appears.

Most of my novels have been of more recent history and I read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era.Frankly, this bizarre underbelly of Hollywood is off the charts. The one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period, the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today.

West draws perfectly the despair and rootless emptiness underlying the pretty smiles, watered landscapes, imported plants and wonderful lifestyles. Reading this book reminded me of how I found the sight of a palm tree disturbing for years after I moved away.West also insightfully points out that the absurd culture has been produced by the transients, not the long time natives.

The book is a character study of the interactions of various hanger-ons at the edges of the motion picture industry. The book is written in a tone of absolute dispair, and it tries to point out how pointless dreams and wishes are. There is no joy to be found in sunshine, oranges, the ocean, life... My optimistic soul wanted to rage against the author and the characters. I guess I can understand how a Jewish man would feel a sense of pessimism in 1939, but I can't recommend the book as anything but an example of the wrong way to see the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is a depressing book.

I was shocked at the poor quality, as though it had been translated from another language. It is riddled with typos, and sometimes they even misspell the main character's names. The formatting is awful and the type is very very small. The book is also strangely large for a novel; this is not a professional print job. I can't believe I even paid money for this print, it managed to make reading un-enjoyable. Amazon, don't you do quality control?

She's been bringing her raucous, rauncy comic genius to gay and lesbian audiences for decades. If you're a fan, she needs no description. If you're not, then you've never heard her.This CD was recorded live at an appearance she made at the C.S.W. Gay Pride Festival and since it was recorded in 1994, there are quite a few time-specific jokes. Bert & Loni, Senator Bob Packwood, Dr. Ruth, Oprah & Rush Limbaugh all make appearances in her routine and none of them are safe from her sharp tongue.My vote for favorite joke: \\"Prince Charles: He may pass for straight, but let's face it. It wouldn't take much of a prison term to get him to do my hair\\"If you're a fan of truly adult comedy with an obviously gay bent, this CD surely won't leave you disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Split Enz were the BOMB!!","review":"Do these guys sound like early Genesis or what?!!

Save your money, buy a nice spiral notebook from the drugstore. The Toddler Journal by Christine Harris took a lot more work and is money better spent. I'm disappointed and am returning the Mommy Journal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mommy Journal: Letter to Your Child","review":"I ordered \\"The Mommy Journal\\" for my daughter to use with her 2nd child. She has the same book for her first child and it is delightful to go back and read some of the thoughts, emotions, and dreams as she observes his step by step achievements from babyhood. She doesn't write everyday - but enough to keep it doable. Someday when he reads it, he will have a fresh perspective on the love his mommy had for him. (and grandmommie - sometimes I write my thoughts and observations of little buds of talents, interests or gifts being developed in him.)We looked around for a similar book for the 2nd child and couldn't find one - so it was back to Amazon to get the same one. <smile> I just recently ordered 5 more - to have on hand for new mothers at our church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quick Journaling","review":"I think this book is so great for quick logs especially while you are trying to chase you toddler around. I just got this book today and I was so excited to start journaling. My daughter does such cute things and I wanted something easy and colorful to write in and this book has both.

I wish I would have found this book earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice but....","review":"Loved the book for my first children (twins!). I had one book for each child, and it worked nice for quick notes or special thoughts to my baby. However, when baby number three came, I found I was no longer able to keep up the first two books, let alone three books. If you have more than one child, I would recommend a single book that could be used for all the children at one time (one that listed date, name of child, location, and a space to write your note). Not as personal to each child. But lets face it - you are busy! However, I have to say overall this is better than the \\"baby books\\" for marking first year milestones. It will sit nicely on your desk or nightstand reminding you to take a moment to jot something down. I have given this book as a gift to first time mommies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought this book would have guided letters for you to write to your child on different topics, but its not. its basically 3-5 blank spaces for letters per page.

I kept it, then went on to buy more substantial and specific ones. THEN I became a mother, and this is the only one I've had time to write in! I initially wrote down my daughter's first words and phrases, knowing I wouldn't really remember the order and dates of them. Now I write down some of her funny 2 1/2 year-old quotes or stories, while she adds stickers or drawings. I even jot down her descriptions of her drawings. This journal is now one of my true treasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suspenseful tale about obsession...","review":"The book, The Vanishing, is a gripping, easy to read story about the formation of intense obsession and how it drives two men in their separate quests. Rex Hofman is a man who is deeply obsessed with trying to find out what happened to his girlfriend, who disappeared at a gas station during their vacation. This obsession is fueled by the intense need to know what happened to her, and it takes over his life, making it impossible for him to maintain relationships with other women. Raymond Lemorne, on the other hand, is a seemingly normal family man who wants to determine the extent of his evilness. When the obsessions of these men bring them together, the ending produced is unforgettable and truly disturbing. It is a unique ending for those who are tired of the predictability that is found in many suspense stories and it explores the limits of how far one will go to find the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Vanishing","review":"If you are thinking of buying this because you liked the movie so much...don't bother. I didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Traveling Music","review":"Many songs on this album will make you want to drive down the highway with the music turned up loud! Neanderthal and Flying Surfers are interesting, artistic pieces that show Danny Click's ability to paint pictures with music. The pace of the album is balanced with Blues Are Too Good For You. Along with his album, Forty Miles, this collection continues to build a showcase of this artist's talent and originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish there was more seasons","review":"hubby has both seasons, had to send this one back because i thought there was more seasons of it but there arent...was a smooth transaction even to send it back was easy..would buy from again"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I loved the whole series--hated to see it end.

Personally, I never missed an episode (which is rare for me and television.) It was intelligently written, intriguing, well acted and perhaps a little too smart for television.Granted Terminator was a sci-fi show and they are risky these days. Furthermore it was continuing an established franchise in a different way. Let's face it though, T2 was marginally okay (Edward Furlong nearly ruined the entire movie) and T3 was terrible. TSCC was a huge improvement! With all the hype for the upcoming Terminator Salvation, I would have thought that Fox would wait to see the box office on that and then make their decision.The decision to keep Dollhouse and cancel TSCC shows that Fox is going to bow down to Joss Whedon on name value alone, no matter what garbage he produces (I may be the only person not terribly impressed by him.)TSCC was a great show and it will be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on TV","review":"this was the best show on TV. smart, dramatic and creative. great acting as well.it's a real shame it got cancelled- they didn't give it the opportunity to reach it's potential. what a great show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I thought the first season was decent so I turned into the second with high hopes but the show never really got beyond mediocre the second year which is ashame.

I can only assume they're being sarcastic, because Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a huge pile of crap, all the way from the script to the cast and production. Utter, complete nonsense. It's an incredibly lousy storyline carried out by cheap dialogue by cheap actors (Brian Austin Green, are you kidding me?) all working together to smear an intelligent and exciting mythology; it's an insult to anyone claiming to be a Terminator fan.

After I watched the last episode I was sad. I was really getting into the show and each and every time that I inserted another dvd disc into my player, I wished for more episodes, etc. Sigh, why can't the networks keep television shows on that people want to watch instead of stupid shows that nobody gives a darn about? Like the other reviewers I want a season 3! Yes, years have passed and all title characters have gotten older - but, it feels like the story is untold. My opinion, anyway. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent entertainment","review":"This show was outstanding - better than the movies; one of the top new TV series of the past five years. The plot brought us new places with twists and turns; the characters grabbed attention and were real. Summer Glau as a terminator was amazing. Sarah and John Connor actors also managed to inhabit these characters, meet expectations and then raise the bar by bringing them alive. Fox please develop a season 3 - I miss this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stand-alone episode","review":"If you've missed the story arc for this season, this might be a good episode to jump in with.

The series is supposed to take off after the action packed movie \\"Terminator 2.\\" Season two of TTSCC looks more like a soap opera than a action packed story. I have watched the first twelve episodes and the experience has been a real torture, sometimes I think I'm watching CSI combined with a lot of boring drama. I even fast forwarded some scenes trying to speed things up, I don't know if I will be able to finish the whole thing. On a good note, I like Cameron, she makes the show somewhat interesting. Some people critized that she looks more like the main character than John Connor, I think that should be considered an improvement instead of a mistake. I wish I could give season two zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ended on Cliffhanger, leaves most story arcs open....bad story telling.","review":"Just to clarify, the series itself is good, although it drags in the middle.But if this was a movie, or a book, it would get a hammering in the reviews for not concluding in any way.You know the great thing about stories, THE ENDING.This series asks loads of questions, opens many story arcs.......and closes ONE.If you've watched the series you'll know what I mean, two characters introduced in this serieshave there stories told to a satisfactory conclusion, and only two.The main characters don't so much have their stories told as......all meet up in the end.THATS IT, they meet, and then a cliffhanger which answers nothing.So I can agree its not (entirely) the studios fault they were cancelled.But when there is any risk of cancellation the classy thing to do is close most story arcs and leave a few open.In fact, the good series do this ANYWAY.So this series leaves EVERYTHING open and closes NOTHING.Disgraceful."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap episode","review":"don't wast you time watching this crap episode .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This episode made no sense no real point to the story","review":"This show started really good but now its like they are all filers or stupid.This episode made no sense no real point to the story.Cameron is useless in most episode now.

Was I mistaken; both season one and two exceeded the movies in so many different ways. First of all the special effects were excellent and showed the improvements that have been made over the years since the first three terminator movies. Character development was also excellent, allowing the watcher to learn a little more about each character as the series progressed. Characters changed naturally over time, just like flesh and blood reality. Unlike TV shows such as the Law and Order series, each episode stood alone as a story and yet was different from all of the other episodes. Series repeating characters often died - it appeared that other than John Conner, no one was safe.

Snoopy for President has two words edited out of the opening line, making it sound like a record that skipped while it was playing! Also, the compilation is not exactly perfect either, as lame covers of sixties classics like I'm A Man (which the Guardsmen cannot do justice to) and So You Want to Be a Rock and Roll Star (which they do as an instrumental! ) are included over tracks like So Right (to be in love) and It Kinda Looks Like Christmas.

Also, the recording lacked the story that was so much a part of Snoopy vs. The Red Baron. In the original album, there was a story to high command's search for a hero that would rid the skies of the Red Baron that led into Snoopy vs. The Red Baron. This was followed by the story of how the Red Baron was shot down and everyone wondered if he was dead, followed by the song Return of the Red Baron. This led into the story of the break down of the Christmas Truths talks and then into the song Snoopy's Christmas. Down Behind the Lines is a natural follow up to Snoopy's Christmas, followed by the Littlest Astronaught and Snoopy for President. Without this structure and story, the recording looses its appeal.

Perhaps it would have been better if there were some way to mount the thing with screws to the wall, allowing it to rest on the tub's rim with caulk to prevent leakage. But even then it might still somehow get knocked off by the occasional accidental bump or jar as people get in and out of the tub.However, since it is so nice, I keep putting it back into place, keeping a tube of caulking compound in the bathroom to make sure I can do quick repairs when it falls off - which it does about one a month at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Harmony for Studying Lives of David and the kings","review":"This harmony is similar to a harmony of the Gospels.

It perfectly captures the music from the SEGA classic, which coincidentally was also created by Mr. Drossin. This picture perfectly chapters the stoned vocals and lethal perceptions of Howard Possard. The album features post apocalyptic grudge sequence and deep rooted blues and jazz sequence, followed by a riveting drum sequence which will knock those spokes off.

If you have a medium sized dog get a large or x-large - take measurements. I have what I consider a medium/small dog (55lb) and the large fit perfect, if not a bit snug. Anyway, pretty cool jersey, although I feel a bit pathetic for buying my dog clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Film Noir","review":"This film, though over 50 years old, is incredibly modern. It is the film that so many crime thrillers of the past 20 or so years have copied shamelessly. And you can't blame Tarantino and the rest for it-- this film is simply terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Kubrick","review":"Besides being one of the best noir films ever made it gives what could be the finest lesson I've seen in how to structure a film. The multiple takes of the heist, all seen from slightly different pespectives and each one building on what we had seen in previous scenes add that indefinable element X that separates the great films from the merely good.Tarantino used this as a veritable \\"How to do it \\"text for many parts of Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown Demands multiple viewings and is not even slightly dated. I would urge anyone who has not seen it and who is in any way interested in the amazing Mr Kubrick to get it at once.Highest possible recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killing","review":"The killing is about a race track heist that of course goes wrong. Sterling hayden is the head of the gang of thieves that pull the heist off. The film is shot in a style that is now famous because of QT. It is intersting to see how films did this 35 years before he even made a film. The movie is extremely good not just for kubrick fans but for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb example of film noir","review":"The Killing is a story about an ordinary man caught up in an elaborate plot to rob a racetrack. Johnny Clay, an ex-convict, carefully orchestrates the plan to take the money, and includes George Peatty in the plot. Under pressure from his wife, George caves and tells his wife about the plan. Unbeknownst to him, his wife is involved with another man, Val. She tells Val of the plan. After the successful completion of the heist, Val shows up to the meeting place of the robbers, armed. Gunshots resound.Good lighting and an understandable and interesting plot help drive this film noir to greatness. The lighting and set design reflect the inner turmoil of the characters as they struggle with their internal greed and selfishness, while the plot keeps the movie flowing and entertaining. This movie surely deserves its place among the classics of film noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killing is Kubrick At His Best","review":"This film is great fun and also is high on the good ol suspense meter.The ending is priceless.Good cast adds to the neatly told plot of race track heist.Superb film is another example of Kubrick at his all-time best."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good racehorse movie.that doesnt happen much","review":"this is one of those old,slow 50s movies.the lighting is poor in places.these guys are going to rob a horse track.thier idea is basicly a number of distractions and a clean getaway.the kids wont like all the drama and thriller stuff.stanley kubrik directs so you know its good.i think its a very good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killing Is Thrilling!!!","review":"Wow, what a GREAT film. I will NEVER stop looking at this film, and will always visit it from time to time in my film collection FOREVER. The actors are excellent, the story is excellent and engaging, the female is hot...what's not to like??? My favorite B&W movie. It's funny, it's sad it's cool. I am so glad it was filmed in B&W. Believe it or not color would take away from the story line. A truely great film in every way that again makes me say GOSH, I LOVE THE MOVIES!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime does not pay","review":"I can not understand how an actor such as Sterling Hayden is not recognized as an outstanding actor. I have enjoyed every movie he has appeared in. The plot, the cast of characters all add up to a really good movie. I would definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete Disappointment","review":"I bought this DVD because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick,but it was obvious a film in his earliest stage of development.The movie is narrated like a Walter Winchell crime documentary or in the style of the old Dragnet program.The only thing good that probably came out of this film was Mr Kubrick remembered Sterling Hayden,and used him later in one of his terrific films Dr Strangelove.A very laughable old film about a racetrack robbery.I don't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterling Hayden at his finest","review":"This is a great movie. Its in black and white and it is classic noir. Sterling Hayden is the classic example of a movie STAR of that time. He is big, tall as a tree, handsome and like a piece of granite. The guy is just a mans man and in this movie he is a criminals criminal. He leads a cast of characters in a robbery of a horse race track. The movie goes thru the set up and the actual recruitment of the thugs and the envolvement of their broads. Ex professional wrestling legend and promoter Kola Kwiriani makes an appearance and is involved in a great brawl against about 20 cops and he kicks their butts. Hayden is the guy that is too dumb to do the right thing and too smart to not try to plan the wrong thing, the perfect crime. He brings along his mousey girlfriend who he is going to take away after the \\"last big score\\".Just love this movie. Its a keeper and a legendary film noir movie. Oh and also... Stanley Kubrick is the director!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Noir!","review":"I bought this movie because Vince Edwards was in it, and I'm a huge Vince Edwards fan. He has a very small part, but the movie is interesting and some of the dialogue is cutting edge for it's time. It has some surprise twists and turns. Fans of film noir will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense and Exciting","review":"The last time I saw this film was in Paris many years ago, on their equivalent of SBS. How lucky we were to be there at that time.The killing is actually a robbery, planned to take place at a horse racing carnival. Sterling Hayden is the leader who has brought together a number of people, each of whom has a certain role to play. The weakness is that one of the characters has an unfaithfull wife. He is devoted to her and does all he can to keep her interest. He knows that she has no love for him, only hate and disgust. She manages to prise the robbery information out of him, then she and her lover have plans of their own.All of the characters are so well written and played that you almost hope that they will get away with the robbery. Do they??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"This is racy stuff, there isn't a second of boredom in the whole movie. 100 times better than Dark Knight.

The songs are fairly short and most of them are instrumental.I bought the belly dancing videos with Neena and Veena. I pick out specific movements that I want to practice. After my workout, I have fun mastering the individual movements using this music.I have wanted to learn how to bellydance since I was very young. This music makes it easy and fun to dance. Great for making up your own routines!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Reference","review":"Putting aside the CD-Roms, the alpha layout of the book itself is wonderful and just what I was looking for. Very concise and and again the book itself is worth the money. It is made to be used as a resource and a reference. I wish other books were laid out this way. After spending hrs and hrs looking thru books I finally found my first choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Account of the War's First Major Battle","review":"Davis has written an interesting read on the Civil War's first major battle: the narrative is interesting without being overly simplistic, the criticisms and praises are balanced for North and South, and the maps are okay (would have liked to have seen more and enlarged).While the book's approximately 270 pages are small by Civil War standards (of course, other battles were larger and had more political developments and changes in leadership as opposed to the time of 1st Bull Run), Davis does a good job of weaving the political climate and military strategy in with the battle descriptions. I particularly enjoyed reading in the book's last chapter summarizing what happened to the battle's main participants after Bull Run.All in all, a good and recommended read as the definitive account of the war's first major battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever! You MUST buy it,even if you dont like Sci-fi","review":"Futurama is great,I'm a huge fan of the series and was sad to see it cancelled.The show was funny and smart,unlike someother animated TV shows out there.But just because it was cancelled doesn't mean we should forget about it!This DVD is the best out of all of them! But hey,check it out yourself,you won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest show to ever be cancelled","review":"Ah, Futurama, the best show to ever be cancelled. With some of the most original and funniest characters on tv (an alchoholic chainsmoking robot, the rich klutz from Mars, the Rastafarian accountant, and of course, Doctor Zoidberg, who defies description) on more than one occasion, I would laugh loud enough to wake up my sleeping dog (whose name is Bender). Expectations were incredibly high for this show and in my opinion, it more than lived up to them. Sadly, fox seemed intent on burying it in terrible timeslots, pre-empting at every oppurtunity, and just neglecting it. With this box set, which includes some of my favorite episodes, this will complete the collection.Comparisons to the Simpsons are inevitable and some characters are quite similar (Fry-Homer, Professor-Grampa, Leela-Marge...) but its still its own show and in my opinion is easily on the same level of quality as the Simpsons.Buy this. And if you dont have the previous three sets, buy those too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last gold episodes","review":"Good news and bad news everyone! First bad news, as you all knowFox doesn't have enough decency to bring it back,now good news!

I thought I'd never say this but, I nearly cried during one of the episodes.The final season, in my view, is the greatest and the worst. Its the greates because its different from the others, its still funny dont get me wrong, but its more emotionaly involved than the others (I know that sounds cheesy for a cartoon, but its true...). But its the worst, because its the last in the series, and that is really really sad.Why would a superb show like this get cancelled? Personaly the simpsons for me has run dry. Yet that is still going... but a show like this with still so much Potential gets cancelled.I do hope it will rise up again, so I can enjoy more laughs with Fry and the gang (Bender especially).Thats just my two cents"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the rest","review":"Don't hesistate to buy the fourth and final season of Futurama. If you like the series, the final season is at least as good, if not better than the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Package design is great, but no Blu-Ray is failure.","review":"I don't know what to think about this. I own the all of the original versions of volumes 1-4 (plus the first 2 movies) on DVD. I don't understand why the last two movies are available on blu-ray as are season 5 & 6 and yet, they spring for this package redesign (which is gorgeous and great) but *no* high-def transfer??Way to hold out on the fans, Fox. It'd would be tempting, but i'll pass on this double-dip (or is it triple at this point?) tactic until the Volumes are re-released in high-def blu-ray.5 stars for cohesive design. 0 stars for DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show ever...","review":"I love Futurama, and like most people, missed a lot of the late episodes becase they were moved around or not shown because of football, which I'm sorry to say I actually love more than Futurama.

I would not recommend this for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Finish to a Great Show!","review":"I won't go off on this review (as it was an umprompted email request), but if you are viewing this product you probably will and should buy it. I think it contains some of the best episodes of the entire series. Obviously the writers became more comfortable with each other and God knows how great the show could've been had Fox given it time to mature like it did with the Simpsons. Purchase this and complete the collection, its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not fret! futurama will be back! There will be a fifth season!","review":"Futurama was a great series, and the fourth season certainly delved deeper into the seldom seen romantic relationships between the various characters. Episodes like, \\"the devils hands are idle playthings,\\" and \\"The sting,\\" definitely exploit the relationship between Fry and Leela, and though they do not provide as many laughs as some of the other episodes, they top my chart. It was a sad day for the fox network when Futurama was cancelled. Although it still airs on adultswim at 10:30 and tbs at 2:00 or something, I still ached for new episodes. Then I learned that after its contract expires from adultswim in 2007, Comedy Central will pick up the show and renew the series, bring together all the voices that made futurama happen and make (at the very least) another new 13 episode season. So do not fret, Futurama fans, Futurama will be back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Futurama, Vol. 4 (A Wonderful End)","review":"This is the last season of Futurama.

Robert Jordan is supposed to be a young blonde man, in his late 20's about, and Maria is supposed to be a 19 year old Spanish girl. Obviously, the movie missed that. The other actors fit farely well, but a lot of the accents were horrible.Also, the book always seemed to somehow use the love between Maria and Robert as a subplot. Robert's conflict with Pablo was just as important. The movie, however, is purely a love story. Overall I thought the book was decent, but slow moving. The movie was worse. Almost 3 hours of nothing.On a final note, to the person who said Jordan should be showing some signs of pain, and that it's ridiculous that he's so calm, read the book.

For the price of the ring I can deal with that though, I mean, what can you expect for $29? The worst part is that it's just hard to wear because it's not comfortable. It would have been better with five stones instead of seven because the two outer stones rub against your other fingers and it gets annoying fast. I'll be returning this ring and will try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice ring, very pale color","review":"The color of the stones is a lot lighter than in the picture. However, it is still a very nice ring, so I am going to keep it anyway. At 40% off, it was inexpensive enough, and it goes with the equally pale stones in the matching earrings..."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 stone ring","review":"it is very nice the only problem with it is that the stones hurt my fingers. they are too separated."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy with","review":"When I received this ring, I put it aside because I was very ill at the timewhen I did look at it, it was past the time to return it. In the picture it looksround, but when i received it, it is more square than round. it justlooks odd and now I have a ring that is ugly and no one wants it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is your training day Officer Hoyt!","review":"Training Day is an awesome movie hands down. The fact that I can watch it with my sweet new blueray player on my sweet new HDTV makes it even better. I have it hooked in to my surround sound and the clip when denzel starts up the monte and that rap song starts playing... oh man, amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Performances but Poor Script Sinks \\"Training Day\\"","review":"After hearing so many good things about this movie, I was greatly disappointed. Denzel gives a great performance, but I would hardly call it Oscar-worthy. Actually, it's hard to say what an Oscar worthy performance is anymore,since so many of the awards are given for political reasons and are based less and less on artistic merit. It was the same with Al Pacino and his award for the very trite \\"Scent of a Woman\\" Ugh. The performances by Washington and Hawke are very good and very steady throughout, but the script seems to be thrown together. Basically, it's a mess. I would have liked to see more of a build-up concerning the deal with the Russians-it's almost presented as an afterthought.Yup, more clarity in the narrative would have made this film a whole lot better...Episodes of the Shield are better written than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"Although the filming and acting is good,...The language is terrible and unnecessary, and almost made the film un-watchable for me. The movie doesnt have a point. For the first hour you wonder were it is going, and then the ending doesnt really resolve any of the subplots that I saw 'sort of' develop. Also you have seen this before a hundred times. Basically a waste of plastic. There are many other movies worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unimpressed","review":"I heard from numerous people that this movie was great. I was so excited when it finally arrived on DVD. Boy did I make a mistake. The acting was very good yes, but the story did not have an ounce of believability. The story about Denzel's character having to pay off the Russians, or whoever they were, was so dull and seemed like a mistake at the point of the film where it was introduced. Watchable but very uninspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"leaves you with a sense of awe","review":"this movie had my mind reeling for days after watching it. It leaves you with a complete sense of awe at the power and manipulation that goes on when someone wants to fit in so badly. the corruption comes though brillantly. great acting and direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST WORK EVER","review":"I think Mr. Washington with his smooth fine chocolate self does any movie a great justice. He is such a good actor. I liked the way he had poor ethan hawk running around doing things he wouldn't do only a great mind could get someone do something that they normal don't do. I like the way Denzel goes and find out what his charater is all about and takes some training to do his job well. I would like everyone to know that I am a very very very big fan of Denzel's and I have every movie he has made so far including St. Elsewhere. so just about anything he does is fine with me, but training day will certainly take you out of your comfort zone because we are use to seeming him in films that he is the \\"good guy\\". I think who ever watches this film will still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you watch it once,watch it!!!","review":"First of all, I highly recommend this movie.Not because of the Academy Award,but because this is a good movie! Ethan,with work like this you WILL win a best actor Oscar one year.Denzel,You acted a fool man! With a supporting cast like Tom Berenger,Dr. Dre,Snoop Dogg,Scott Glenn & Macy Gray you couldn't go wrong.In a nutshell it's about a wet behind the ears rookie (Hawke) promoted to Narc, and \\"trained\\" for 24 hours by Washington. But there's a twist:Washington is a crooked cop.I'll leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than dislike","review":"Dislike is too weak to express my feelings. I bought the movie after seeing reviews and absolutely hated this movie. The action parts seemed contrived. The characters so flawed that no one was likeable. I didn't even like Ethan Hawke's character. He was so weak in the beginning of the movie that his sudden change to a \\"man of character\\" didn't work for me. I just got the feeling that the director and cast decided to experiment with a new genre and it didn't work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't have paid to see this","review":"The previews to this movie are extremely misleading, the film lacks a decent story and is basically a violent shoot em up bad cop flick! Denzel Washington is definately not meant to be the bad guy, although convincing in his portrayal, it somehow did not fit. Ethan Hawkes preformance was shoddy at best.I have not seen very many movies that are this bad, however I rented it for free and yet still feel as though I paid too much!If your into watching two straight hours of violence then this might be the flick for you, however if you are looking for a film with at least a bit of a story behind it, then you should definately look elsewhere because this is certianly not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"It's sad that as talented as Denzel is that he won the oscar for this [junk]. He is a terrific actor, but I guess it was a black year, no way was he better than Russell Crowe. He has done many great movies, for which he deserved an oscar, but this was not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Training Day","review":"This was one of the worst Denzel films I have ever seen. I expected something amazing (after all he did win an oscar for the role) . This film does not compared to the other great work he has done (Malcom X, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bone Collector). I feel sorry that of all the roles Mr. Washington has played this is the one which Hollywood most appreciates.It is the typical Hollywood portrayal of Black men. Negative."},{"rating":"1","title":"training day","review":"what a stupid movie. Hawke can't act, Denzel does his best A-hole, and all with a plot that any rookie cop could shoot holes though.I meen COME ON if hawke didn't know know that he was being set up in the first five minutes he deserves to get busted.it sure show's the poor taste of the oscars that they gave Denzel an award for his worst preformance yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to America's Minorities","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - it's truly deplorable, totally unbelievable. There's no way on earth the sleeze-ball portrayed by Denzel Washington in this flick could ever become the commander of an elite police unit in a major US city - just no way. And if I were a Hispanic or Black American, I would be totally insulted by the way my people are portrayed in this film. ALL of them appear to be low-life, drug guzzling, promiscuous whores and thugs. The only character with any morals is, of course, white. How do these so-called \\"film makers\\" sleep at night? What some people will do for money never ceases to amaze me."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY ENTERTAINING GRITTY POLICE DRAMA! 4 1/2 STARS!","review":"'Training Day' is a dark and gritty crime drama that tells a different side of the men in blue. Denzel Washington takes a 180 and plays one vicious and dirty cop who shows a new recruit on his first day as a special teams narcotics officer how his brand of justice works! The film is slick, well paced, full of action and has a semi-plausible storyline. It does go a little Hollywood towards the end, but it's still a very entertaining movie. The film has an small early role featuring Eva Mendes(in her birthday suit!), giving us the money shot! Nice huh? ;-b The DVD transfer is excellent and has some interesting extra material."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"Tediously written and dialogue heavy. It would have been better as a play than a movie, with so much dialogue. And Ethan Hawke is really miscast...he's frail and pale and totally unbelievable as an L.A.P.D. cop. Denzel Washington's performance is contrived. He's not believable as a hard manipulator. I know he won the Oscar. But I still think his performance falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington's best work","review":"Training Day is a stunning drama about the mean streets of L.A. Officer Hoyt (Hawke) is a young eager cop who joins the elite narc division in hopes of one day becoming detective. His \\"training\\" officer is Harris (Washington), a street savvy cop. The movie takes place in one entire day and as the day goes on, Hoyt begins to see that Harris is a different breed of cop. He gets the crooks allright, but he bends the rules and more than often crosses the line.This role is a departure from Washington's clean cut good guy image. Washington's character is a twisted, shrewd, and manipulative cop. There are also cameo performances from Dr.Dre and Snoop Dog. In my opinion, this movie was about LAPD's infamous Rampart division."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a movie that you can watch with friends over if they want to see it or if you feel like watching a real expensive fictoidic version of 'Crooked Cops'. Denzel Washington is one bad motha... and jus' look into those piercing eyes and you can tell that if 'you' stab him in the back you probably won't live when you try to take two steps. Ethan Hawke plays and excellent rookie cop learning the ropes and doing things that make you wanna say 'stooooooooooopid' but it's that type of curiosity he has that makes Denzel's character unravel his covering of his bad side. Anyways I think this movie is and excellent buy and I am probably gonna get burned owning this copy cause I smell a special edition or something coming on the horizon! Still worth the look though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless","review":"This is perhaps one of the worst and most mindless movies i've ever seen. Their is no semblence of plot and the movie has a feel of aimlessness. It doesn't feel like its going anywhere. Its filled with tons of meaningless violence and macho garbage that are the staple of movies aimed at younger males but it lacks a compelling story to go along with it. The ending where the rookie cop leaves the crooked cop to die and somehow he is let free (though we don't see how) before being shot by russians that are mentioned twice in the movie but not brought into the plot is terrible. On the plus Denzel shows his acting talent, but even he cannot save a film that lacks both plot and meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutley stupid!","review":"I have a hard time believing that people actually thought that this was a great movie. The story was terrible. I dont think that the acting was great. Finally the ending was completly stupid. Overall this movie is completly overrated. I am still mad i wasted 4 dollars on the rental of this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not entertainment,","review":"nor is it even enlightened social commentary.It's just another fantasy movie about a good guy (white rookie cop who lives in suburban LA - what was his last job? corporate CFO?) and a bad cop (black guy with Latino wife living in middle of gang infested jungle - I haven't been there, so can't comment). This movie is a downer from start to finish that left me wonder why I spent two hours with it.Denzel best actor? Not based on this film. The political tide of Hollywood finally turned his way. Sure, the character is scary and creepy, but he's ultimately just another Hollywood fantasy thug.I gave it two stars, because it at least inspired me to comment on the sad state of moviemaking these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Performance","review":"I saw A Beautiful Mind and thought that Russell Crow should have received the best actor award until I saw Denzel Washingtington in Training Day! That performance was not expected from a Denzel Movie. This is why I feel that he SHOULD HAVE WON the Oscar for best actor. I was feeling at first that this was a token Oscar until I saw the move on DVD last night over a friends. I am now purchasing this DVD for my collection! BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE AND DESERVING OF THE BEST ACTOR AWARD (IMO)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Aside from Denzel's character throwing obsenities around every five seconds, this movie did not hold the viewer's attention. Although the events took place in one day, the movie dragged on for what seemed like a week. Denzel has just played the protaganist too many times; his transformation to an immoral cop did not show his range as an actor...it just proved trying too hard to be \\"evil\\" ends up making you look like the exaggerated villian of a melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over","review":"I'm very pleased that I only RENTED this movie. Why this was worth an Oscar is a mystery to me. As the DVD doesn't contain any \\"extras\\" disregarding the usual trailers stuff, this really isn't a Collectors DVD.The movie never gets around to a motive for the actions. There is ths good guy and this bad guys. The good guy could have gone away from the bad guy many times before the action really starts. But why the good guy stays around the bad guy seems a real mystery. Why the bad guy is a bad guy is obviously not interesting as we never even get a hint why someone becomes corrupt and crazy as Denzel plays.The actors are fine (not great) - I have a problem with the story line. It's clear that lots and lots of background scenes have been cut out leaving you with an empty feeling and not really enganged in the movie as it runs.If you don't believe me - rent it first - it's not worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot pace....unrealistic","review":"in all of my 20 yrs working in a major law enf agency and working in every division, unit..etc, i never ran across a guy that even resembled denzel's washington's character....alonznzo harris, and yes, i have run across...characters portrayed by eathan hawke,.....more than i can shake a stick at....!!!1st order of business: enforce the law not break itunlawful order's to smoke dopegetting into a specialized unitand committing crimes.denzel washington's portrayal of a twisted cop is very muchup to par, as like the characters in...\\" the shield\\"after all it's just acting !!!!!!!!!!!don;t ever get the idea that gangs of these bad cop's existmaybe a bad apple or two, they will enentually be caughtand fired...!...........see the movie , buy it...just don't believe it , as reality"},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington and Hawke Power the Relentless \\"Day\\"","review":"This movie will probably be remembered as one of the best urban crime films ever, mostly because of the hellish presence of Denzel Washington, the fine acting Ethan Hawke, and the ultra-gritty directing Altonie Fuqua. The film follows Hakes' character in his first day in LA's notorious Narcotics Division. There he meets Washington, a veteran of the Division, whose morals have been corrupted by years of seeing the worst of humanity, or his appetite for power, which ever you believe, but either way he seems to give justification to every action he takes (\\"Were wolves among sheep, it takes a wolf to kill a wolf.\\") But some of Washingtons' action seem to go far beyond the line, and Hawke questions his reasons for them. The movie is also given a great, challenging script in order for the actors and the audience to question the limtis of the law, and power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Training Day","review":"Excellent movie. Good to finally see Denzel Washington as a villain and not just as the typical hero like his other movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel, Denzel","review":"Not your typical Denzel movie. Mean, hard,bounce you around movie. liked it alot. One of films that I loved the ending!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They messed up the ending.....","review":"I generally liked this movie. Good to great performances overall, but hey, look at the car as Denzel is about to get blown away at the end. Funny that not shortly before both the front and rear ends were totalled in the fight scene between him and Ethan. What happened, did he find a body shop in the middle of the night that did perfect work in five minutes? The damn car looks brand spankin new. This is what's always bothered me about \\"Training Day.\\" If you're gonna spend so much time and energy making things realistic, why not cover all the bases?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Training Day Shows that Hollywood can still get it right","review":"This was a kick [buttox], gritty, dark, well acted movie. Denzel gave the performance of his career, (plus he finally won a best actor oscar) while Hawke finally got to show people how under-rated an actor he really is, in a perfect role for him. The only minor problems were a few scenes at the end, where the writing could have been a little bit tighter, instead of dissolving into more of a typical action flick... but other than that, TD was one of the best films of 2001. Hopefully, Denzel can win another oscar for John Q, and keep making good movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Training Days","review":"An excellent film starring Denzel Washington,Ethan Hawke,Scott Glenn,Tom Beringer(Platoon) and other great actors.

Denzel Made This.","review":"Denzel Washington plays an oustanding Performance.. and one of the best roles hes played. This show wouldn't be good , if it hadn't been for him and his great role play in one of most powerful Crime/Dramas ever told.It shows how LA, california is all about.. in the neighborhood of how society can reflect to others who haven't lived that moment.Denzel made this movie what it is. He can play just about any character. Hes a Legend of hollywood.Ethan Hawke played well too.The movie gets real intense.. and gets you on the edge of more and more interests growing in your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denzel Shines, Average Film at Best","review":"Denzel Washington Finally switched His Game up here.He was becoming the Babyface of Movies where you could tell His Next Line 5 Minutes in Advance but this Film He takes a whole different turn.Ethan Hawke does pretty Good in a Judd Nelson(New Jack City Meets Donnie Brasco)Meets Johnny Deep kind of way.but the film on a whole is very Cliche in spots where it only shows certain elements but misses taken the Picture fully.everything about the film after a while becomes predictable&after almost a Hour it loses steam.while it exposes some interestign Elements it suffers from not being able to hold on&it spreads to thin overall.Denzel does a Solid Job in this otherwise Patchy Film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Underrated Movie","review":"And thats saying alot becuase it got good reviews. Id like to start by saying if you liked this movie, see \\"American History X\\" which is also a very good movie. Denzel desrved the oscar I just didn't think he would get it becuase of the movies content. Buy this movie if your mature enough you wont regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected much more from an actor i admire so much","review":"Training day is an over the top violent movie that excedes credibility on all levels. I could not recommend this movie for its violent content,foul langauage and script absurdity. I have found denzel to be one of today's better actors and wished he had one the oscar for one of his past performances that he could be proud of.Though the movie is intense and carries with it heart pounding performances they are monotonal through out the movie with little to no depth of character. Shock value does not sustain a movie. So even though i am the minority here i can not recommend this movie-- go see Hurricane that was the oscar."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER \\"OSCAR\\" CALIBER PERFORMANCE FROM DENZEL","review":"first of all, CONGRATULATIONS to denzel washington for winning an oscar (finally). i suppose he did not need the little statue to validate his acting. but, it is always nice to see dedicated actors get their just due. training day is not unlike any of denzel washington's other movies, with him turning in a great performance. except one thing: he does not play the hero in this one. from \\"glory\\" to \\"remember the titans\\", the audience has always rooted for him to triumph. in this film he plays a corrupt officer who takes the law into his hands far too often. being that this is DENZEL playing a dirty cop, you still root for him to change his ways and somehow redeem himself by the end of the movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington is a superb actor!","review":"I rented this movie only days before the Academy Awards. I had no idea that Denzel Washington was nominated for best actor for his role in this movie (I swear! Yeah, I must live in a hole or something, but I really didn't know...). I was absolutely blown away by his performance; it's exceptional. Without revealing too much, there is one scene in particular toward the end of the movie, where Washington's character is in trouble and is being confronted by both his enemies and his \\"brothers\\", that goes way beyond mere acting. The whole movie overall probably deserves 4 stars, but I gave it 5 based on the acting. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...MAN UP, YALL...","review":"...if the hole in the ozone had to be epitomized by a single human being then denzel's portrayal here is emphatically over qualified!!!he does the damn thang here fareal yall!!1. dont be squeemish...2. political correctness does not always rule...3. life is sometimes harsh...those are the primary 3 commandments of 'training day'...okay...the ending is a bit flimsy...a rewrite coulda easily have rectified the whole thang, but hey, my name doesnt appear nowhere under the title of executive producer in this movie...but gettin to the end was a fun ride!!! makes me wish i was a crooked cop! (thats a whole lot sexier sounding than being a 'crooked industrial bakery worker'!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"I first saw this movie after the oscar nominations were announced, mainly because i wanted to see if it was as good as everyone had been saying it was. I was pleasantly surprised by Hawke more than Washington, only because I've come to expect Washington being good in any movie. He has proven that in most cases, he can rise above lackluster material, e.g. \\"The Hurricane.\\"Even though the movie wouldn't have been really noticed or good, for that matter, without Washington's great, if a bit over-the-top, performance, it is Hawke's subtly as the rookie, that makes the movie really work.To be honest, the movie isn't as good as it could have been. It has some story holes, and a conventional, predictable ending, but the performances of the two stars more than make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This movie was great. Denzel was a great choice. There was alot of action in this movie. It was above my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You're a long way from Starbucks, Homey!\\"","review":"Training Day sheds light (as it should do) on police corruption as well as on crime and violence in the streets and neighborhoods of Los Angeles.It is officer Hoyt's first day under the supervision and tutelage of LAPD detective Alonzo Harris, when things take a quick turn for the unexpected...Ethan Hawke, Denzel Washington, Snoop Dogg, Tom Berenger, Macy Gray (!), Samantha Esteban (who is HOT!!!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well.In short, the music, the acting, the plot, the setting, and the dialogues are all good.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power corrupts","review":"Training Day - A wicked urban police drama that poses the question of how does a rookie narcotics cop navigate himself out of a web of deceit (and do what is right) constructed by his trainer, who is drunk with the power that his status as a UC detective on the gritty streets of L.A. affords him.Ethan Hawke gives a very honest performance and Denzel Washington shows a side not often seen of his capabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethan hawke and Denzel are superb in this movie","review":"This movie is superb and very powerfull.Ethan hawke and Denzel are amazing in this movie.Of course Denzel would get an award.

My husband says I wear rose colored glasses, so it was much too realistic for my taste. I guess it's one thing to know something like that might actually happen, but to see it is another story. Denzel did a good job, however....can't knock his acting in this, but the movie on a whole left me feeling sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they really give him an award for this trash?!!","review":"This was not a good film. One questions whether the folks at the Academy even bothered to watch this film before they voted on the award for Denzel (who by the way didn't do any better a job with his acting in this film than you would expect from the average actor). If you have not seen it, do so, for it will expose to you the fact that these awards were politically motivated, there really can be no other option...and you will understand after you see this...for it was not talent which earned any awards here. I really do like Denzel in most film, just not this one....and if you see it...I am willing to bet...you will agree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel sure did deserve that Oscar","review":"When I saw this movie at my Uncle's house it blew me away. Denzel plays a rogue cop and Ethan plays a rookie cop to pass a test around Los Angelas for 24 hours. But Denzel's character involves Ethan's character in his schemes. The part I really loved about was that when Denzel took out his double pistols and started going bananas with them at a few ganagsters. The ending was fire when Denzel's Alonzo was fighting Ethan's jake on top of the roof. After the fight was pretty low when Alonzo got shot by these masked assassins really bad. ANYWAY THIS IS A HELL OF A GOOD MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie","review":"I first of all am not a Denzel Washington fan. So my review is a little biase in the sense that I went in thinking this movie was going to be bad....and boy was it. I first want to say that Denzel Washington is a good actor he just doesn't do anything for me. I thought this movie was waaaayyyy over the top unrealistic and I could not in good consious recommend it. For one thing all the singers and rappers in the movie who can't act took away from any beliveable scenario. Ethan Hawkes character was such a wimp he had literally no back bone. Every \\"bad\\" thing that Denzels character wanted him to do he did it. I think this is one of the worse movies I ever seen. And the ending who didn't see that coming a mile away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired cliches and stereotypes.","review":"Oscar winning performance, indeed. This movie is an amalgum of every cop movie made in the last 20 years. There are no surprises, and the plot is transparent.

Save yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad!","review":"i would just write bad 1000 times, but frankly it's not worth it. denzel washington is an amazing actor, here he is showboating to no end, and does a poor job at it. ethan hawke at least doesn't embaress himself, although he was in this muck."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star only because there's no ZERO","review":"this movie starts off pretty good, but then gets completely ridiculous. it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated junk","review":"After Denzel won his Oscar, I rented this expecting a great performance in a great film. I got neither. The film was utterly mediocre and, frankly, boring. Not because there wasn't any action, but because none of the actors gave me any reason to care about the characters. And all Denzel should have gotten was an Oscar for Best Shameless Scenery Chewing by a Lead Actor. This movie, and Denzel Washington's performance in it, are absolute proof that the Oscars are blatantly political and have nothing to do with the actual quality of any given performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clean up the LAPD","review":"I kept hoping for a morale to this ugly movie.In fact, I tried and this is the conclusion I came to: If this movie causes the LAPD to be forced to clean up its act then the movie will have a redeeming factor. The movie is so full of violence and \\"shockers\\" that I became bored with them and was anxiously awaiting it to end. If I had been the rookie, I would have had the bad cop stop the car and let me out when he offered the pipe. End of movie; but, no, we are somehow \\"required\\" to buy into the training day \\"test\\" proposition. The rookie was an idiot at every turn running the gauntlet knowing it was all rotten to the core--for what purpose. The prize? A big home in a better area of the burbs for his wife and daughter while he rolled in filth all day. The only thing he said in this film that rang true was that he should have been a firefighter.If this is LA, California should drop into the ocean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage","review":"Fooled by Denzel's Academy Award I rented this dismal film. The plot is ridiculous, but worse still the characters are just not credible. Ethan Hawke wants a promotion, and to uphold his lawful values, so much so that he smokes dope and drinks booze within hours of commencing his first shift...he has hardly had time for a proper breakfast, and there he is high on PCP, thanks to Uncle Denzel, whom (for some reason) he still adores. From then on rather than characters there are cliches, including insulting racial stereotypes, nihilistic violence, and repugnantly casual misogyny. An ugly and horrible film. Hollywood has entertained us yet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie that Denzel Washington has ever made.","review":"I repeat the Worst Movie that Denzel Washington has ever made. And He has been in some of the best I have ever seen. As a former police officer I was insulted and repulsed by his portrail of this so called dectective. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"violent","review":"i didn't like this movie and no patience to sit through it all. too violent - too boring. not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"Terrible movie... I really like Denzel Washington as an actor but in this movie it was very dissapointing... he is much better when he plays to be a good person that fights for justice and what is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acting is Better than movie","review":"This film was very well acted and highly entertaining, but the reason I gave it only four stars is because I think that there were some writing issues. The movie followed Ethan Hawk's character who wanted desperately to be a cop. So, he meets up with Denzel Washington's character and they spend a dull day tofether fightig crime. However, the more time Hoyt(Hawk) spends with Alonzo(Washington), Hoyt realizes how truley evil Alonzo is. Alonzo, insteadc of fighting crime, gets even with people and he steals from some of them. I reccomend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie!!!","review":"I don't recommend this VHS version to buy.....get it on DVD but hey you got to get what you gotta get... This was a good movie and the plot is very on point.Denzel won a Oscar for this movie and I think he should of considering the talent and the character building that he did for this movie. This is a movie to have in the collection and watch it every 2 months are something. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made the cut.","review":"Denzel's outstanding preformance brought him home an oscar for best actor in a leading role in this fresh new thriller that kept us waiting for a decade to come out. It's so unpredictable and thats what makes it a classic thriller. The cast is great and the storyline makes sense beyond what we imagined it to be. This is a must see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Training Day","review":"Excellent movie, excellent video quality from Amazon Prime. This is why I continue downloading and purchasing my movies here! This movie is a Must Have for your collection, especially for you Denzel fans..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Opens Your Eyes About The System","review":"Training Day is a movie that makes you think about the life of an under cover Narc. There seems to be such a fine line between the criminal and the police officer here and this is shown very well in the movie. As usual Denzel Washington gives a magnificent performance as one who plays by his own set of rules. Ethan Hawke is fine in a supporting role as well.The twists and turns in the story keep you pretty much hooked as the end result is a bit surprising. The violence is a little much in spots and there are a few moments when realistically the story goes astray. Nonetheless, this is very good movie for those fans of action movies and Denzel Washington."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars really","review":"The problem with this film is that is was more designed as a vehicle for Washington to show off his tremedous acting ability than to actually create a solid story. Even the best actor can be limited by a bad script which is what happens in this movie. Denzel Washington is in my opinion in the top 5 actors of modern film, but a movie like this just doesn't give him the room he really needs to stretch out and show off the amazingly varied characters he can create. But, of course, this was the Academy's year to award the black actors (Washington and Halle Berry), both of whom are much better actors than their oscar winning roles showed them to be. If only the academy had given them oscars for the roles they truly deserved, then the academy wouldn't have to award less than stellar roles out of guilt. Any Denzel Washington role is still better than 90% of the other roles out there, but his better roles (Hurricane, Malcolm X) lie in the unawarded 10%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blu-Ray Picture Image, Story Not So Great","review":"Enjoyed the quality of our first Blue Ray HD movie.

Got it on Amazon for cheap and now have it as part of my movie collection. Every guys collection should contain this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruthless, underhanded, for real, !...","review":"Denzel is amazing in this movie, watch this movie twice, the first time to catch the storyline and the 2nd time to actually rate the acting, and Denzel Washington is oscar material in this movie. This movie shows you that the good cops have reasons to turn bad and unfortunately some of them do. They get bigger than life on the streets, because they have the badge, but they also get too caught up in the money and power that they eventually will fall. They bring protege's along and show them corrupt ways and if the rookie isn't careful and remember why they joined the force or the team, they will end up corrupt or dead. This movie was real and the acting was totally outstanding. A must see, and if you are a Denzel Washington fan, you will not even realize that this Denzel the good guy or the lover. How many of our finest in blue or under cover are corrupt?... makes you wonder, watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, come on!!","review":"First, let me say that Denzel Washington puts in a good performance. It's not an academy award performace, but it's good. And it's not his fault. The character is written to be a one dimensional thug, and that's Denzel plays. He's the typical bent cop that turns up in movie after movie. Ethan Hawke's character is a far more challenging role, and he also plays him well.The real problem with the movie is the ludicrous plot. The movie consists of one ridiculous and incredible scene after another. You'll find yourself muttering \\"oh, come on!\\" time and again, especially toward the end of the movie when the story dispenses with what little credibility it ever had to begin with...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this movie. I was expecting big things out of it but I just couldn't see Denzel in the \\"Bad guy\\" role. I actually found myself laughing at times when it was supposed to be serious because it was so funny too see him acting like that. Also I thought that Ethan Hawke was horrible and it is a joke that he was even nominated for best supporting actor. If you want to see a performance where Denzel really shines then buy the Hurricaine or Malcom X"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"There are several movies that I don't understand how in the world people can dislike them. Training Day falls into my second category of Why do so many people love this film. Sure Denzel did a great job (I'm still not sure it deserved an Oscar Nomination...never mind the award). Ethan was a tremendous supporting actor...but the movie was just a series of yelling matches. What was the point of this film? Why was Denzel's character the way he was? There was just something totally missing here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'M NOT SAYING DENZEL DIDN'T DESERVE THE OSCAR, BUT...","review":"ETHAN HAWK'S ROLE IN THIS MOVIE SEEMED TO BE THE MORE AMAZING ACTING JOB. WASHINGTON IS GREAT TOO, AND PERHAPS HIS PLAYING AN UNSYMPATHETIC CHARACTER HELPED HIM GARNISH VOTES FOR THE ACADEMY AWARD. SNOOP DOGG ALSO DID SOME PRETTY FINE ACTING AS A CRIPPLED CRACK DEALER. DR. DRE SHOULD STICK TO MAKING RECORDS HOWEVER. GREAT MOVIE THOUGH, I ENJOYED IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"DJ Precise","review":"I feel this movie was an example of genius acting on Washington's part. Although a contrived story it makes for great entertainment. And for anyone complaining about realism. This is a movie! Realism mixed with unrealistic circumstances is what movies do best. If you want REAL realism throw a rock at a cop."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible movie","review":"I'm sorry to say that this movie was horrible. It is an insult to the policemen and women who serve our streets. While Denzel Washington's performance is good, as it normally is, it is not superb. The script was poor and shoddy. I have to say that Ethan Hawke's performance as the fresh new blood for Denzel Washington's elite Narcotics squad out did that of Denzel's perfomance. Overall this movie made me sick and sorry for even watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother","review":"The movie was just like many other cop files/buddy films. Granted it can happen, but really, we have seen this all before. Greed takes over. We know cops don't make much, we know some have to find other ways. Been there, done that.And yes, Denzel got the big award. But he did better work in some of his past films. Much better than this one. Like Glory, or Courage under fire. Or Devil in a Blue dress"},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous attempt","review":"I thought this movie was a ridiculous attempt at turning a good guy into a bad guy. Denzel Washington isn't very good at pretending to be a bad guy.The movie drags on for 2 hours and has no point what so ever. Personally I turned the movie off after the first 45 mins because I was so bored.I think if someone wants to see a good movie...they should avoid training day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don","review":"A great movie to watch if you find yourself feeling too good and want something to pull you down - make you feel really bad and down in the dumps. What a waste of a great actor like Washington."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denzel is great, the story is terrible.","review":"This COULD have been an interesting exploration of ethics, race, and the war on drugs. Instead you get a very miscast Ethan Hawke (who still does a good job) as an unbelievably naive cop, and excellent performance from Denzel that is nevertheless one-note evil. You could walk away from this movie thinking that Black and Hispanic people are violent and evil and that white people are either highly moral, or if they are corrupt, at least not murderers. I don't like that message. This movie also has one of the WORST ways to save a hero I have ever seen: the old coincidence at the last minute. Trust me, this alone ruins the film. The stupid shootout at the end only confirms that the writer had no idea how to truly deal with the important issues the film raises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oscar?

Come on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bad..","review":"It has every cliched \\"gang\\",\\"bad cop\\",\\"LA\\",\\"Rookie caught between his partner and whats right\\" scene going.

Denzel Washington has one of the most symmetrical faces in Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most mundane cliched junk I've seen in a long time.","review":"Training Day is mildly interesting in its previews and sets you up expecting a clever and scintillating day with a crooked cop. The only thing it truly succeeds at is pulling every cliche out of bad cop film history and throwing it out without even a scintilla of wit. The film is formulaic and very woman-hating from start to finish. Something more interesting to see would be Mamet's Heist."},{"rating":"2","title":"(;D)","review":"The headline summarizes the movie!

After watching this movie, I was saddened that it was for such a horrible role. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Russell Crowe did have a lot of controversary around him at the time of the votes, his performance as John Nash was far superior to Denzel in this movie. I realize Denzel got the award more for his body of work however, it's really sad that they gave him the Oscar for such a poor role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash Day","review":"I fortunately discipline myself to rent a DVD before purchasing one with few exceptions. This was a waste of money to rent, and I would not recommend purchasing the movie. It was typical trash, and if your'e into glorifying gangsters, drugs, slums, and bad cops, and generally, an \\"anything for a buck\\" movie--this may be of interest to you.

Between the offensive black stereotype portrayals, the blatant gaping plotholes, and the outrageously unrealistic action climax this was the worst film I saw in 2001.

My family is originally from the south and even back in those days they didn't act or talk like these two women.I didn't like Gen or Jackson but did like the mother and Matt.

She lost her virginity when she was 15 to a kid who promised he'd take her to the movie. She plans to have sex with her boss who she knows takes a different secretary to his weekend meeting to have sex with her--the idea that she plans to marry him doesn't excuse her. It makes her sound even dumber. Then she has the hots for the nerd in no time.I also disliked her showing people from Tennessee as ignorant idiots who talk funny and have several illigitimate children because the women can't say \\"no\\".Try something else by VLT--her other books are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, fun read!","review":"\\"Nerd in Shining Armor\\" by Vicki Lewis Thompson is a great book.

This is the story of two people who would never think of hooking, but after crash landing on a desert island, they are forced to a second look at each other. A decide that they like what they see.Besides great main characters, Ms. Lewis-Thompson, gives the reader well developed secondary characters that work well in the story. Overall, this is a summer book that you don't want to miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD TITLE AND SYNOPSIS - STORY ITSELF A FLOP","review":"I had every intention to enjoy this book. It had a great story idea-being stranded on a deserted island with a nerd. What a great opportunity for the author to work on conflicts, romance, and smoldering love scenes.Instead, the protagonist is a cheap hillbilly whore that musters up anything but sympathy. Perhaps the book would have improved if she were to become SHARK BAIT!The only redeeming character was the nerd, although he was a little too wimpy for my taste.The synopsis had fantastic potential - but a hard lesson was learned: You cannot judge a book by its cover!THE AUTHOR DROPPED THE BALL!I'll be honest. I never finished the book. It was THAT hard to swallow!I only recommend this book for future romance novelists. This book will teach you WHAT NOT TO DO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome and smarmy","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be a fun read. It wasn't. It was tiresome ... to the point I just skimmed the last half. It was also smarmy as opposed to sexy. Don't get me wrong, I like a good romance novel. But this wasn't romantic. It was juvenile, almost painfully so, and the characters were complete idiots. Worse yet was the author's condescending attitude toward people from the state of Tennessee (for the record, I'm not from Tennessee but do have friends who live there). All I can say in closing is: Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Problematic, but likeable","review":"I had passed on this book a number of times before finally reading it, and I'll admit, I quite enjoyed it. It's a sexy, mindless beach read, and if you go into it with those expectations, I doubt you will be disappointed.Sure, there are problems. The heroine is at times condescending and unlikeable, and as another reviewer mentioned, the hero was too good for her. The writing is clunky and crude at times, and the plot chugs along clumsily.That said, I couldn't put it down. Sometimes there's room in your beach bag for a pointless and poorly-written fantasy, and this fits the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I found myself discouraged several times with character development and found Gen's character rude/unlikable. Why would the sweet/honorable Jack (at times too weak) have such strong feelings for some rude woman? Additionally, I expected follow through in the love scenes. It is part of their foundation and discussed numerous times, but left the reader 'outside' the magic. I am a fan of Mrs. Thompson's work and will continue to buy her books; I just hope this is not an example of future works."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! Loved this sexy, sassy, very different book!","review":"I love romances, all kinds, but it's so hard to find one that's really different. This one really is! The hero is this lovable, smart \\"nerd\\" who comes into his own when he's stranded with the girl of his dreams. Their hot, sensual relationship is wonderfully balanced by the secondary romance between the heroine's mother & boss (just loved that autumn romance!)I also really loved Gen's younger brother--what a great, true teenager.The humor was terrific--sharp and campy, at the same time. Loved the Elvis underwear story, loved the way Gen fell back on her mountain roots to help them survive on the island.Just loved it altogether!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent premise, horribly written","review":"I cannot believe this book has gotten good reviews. After slogging through over 200 pages, I absolutely couldn't take any more. The idea behind the book is actually pretty good (the back cover reads interestingly enough), but the book itself is truly terrible. The writing is stilted and the language crude. If I had read one more hillbilly euphemism I think I might have thrown up. Seriously, no one talks like that and it's insulting to Southerners that the author thinks so.Do not waste your money on this book. It will only encourage the author to write more literary trash like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"total waste of time!","review":"What a waste of time and energy.

On \\"Mongoose\\" and \\"Pigeon Toe\\" the drummer, bass player and one guitar player are allowed to develop a nice amount of head-bang without the singer wrecking things too much but by this time \\"Eatin' Dust\\" is almost over.

I don't like bulky wallets, but the plastic windows always tear, and when I carry cash (which I'm trying to do more now) I didn't have a place to hold it securely.This is the best of both worlds, and is attractive as well.The only complaints I have are that it's slightly larger than I was hoping (but still smaller than a bifold) and that it 'flares out' slightly at the edges. I'm hoping the latter will be fixed after I've sat on it long enough to break it in.Overall, I'm pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wallet","review":"Really clever design with the two pockets on the outside - I have my ID and my CC there and that's usually all I need. The metal clip thing that holds the bills is a bit weak though and pops up a bit too easily, but it's a slick looking wallet that doesn't tale up much space in your pocket.

This lame piece of junk is just a bunch of tired cliches tied together with continuous punches of look-at-how-vulgar-we-can-be that is being marketed as \\"clever.\\" I'm no prude, but this is not even good bad humor.

I admit I was surprised by the very brief but very graphic nudity, but can't imagine the film without it, as it is not what you think and is absolutely hysterical!

I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I felt it was a decent movie...if anything. The difference with this movie(as is with several others...) is the more you watch it....THE FUNNIER IT GETS.I noticed a lot of movies lately become cult favorites...BECAUSE people watch it again and again. Paul Rudd is CLASSIC in this movie and Jen Anniston...though not as great as HORRIBLE BOSSES...still puts in a good performance. I purchased this movie only because I can't stop watching it!

I watch lots of slasher movies including the first 3 from the saw franchise so I am not overly squeamish. Wanderlust however made me so nauseous that I lost my cookies in a big way. They kept describing smells....and then when the main character started talking dirty to himself in the mirror I just lost it. Might just be me but I doubt it. In the outtakes he even said he was grossing himself out. Maybe if I hadn't spent time in a commune myself back in the 70's the descriptions of the smells wouldn't have come across so vividly for me, but I wouldn't watch it again.

As a second lead, great. (40 yr old virgin, for example) But as a lead? no way. Aniston plays a post-collegiate 20-something who is trying to find herself. Of course, Aniston is 40+. And that's only the start of the \\"R U Kidding Me\\" stupidity of Wanderlust.

Plenty of male nudity though, full frontal & everything confirming that the story was written by a female or male who likes other males. Lame storyline, felt more like a movie that was just thrown together in someone's backyard. If it didn't have the stars in it that it has, it have gone straight to b-movie status in the discount area of the video store.

Unfortunately it didn't go far or deep enough and didn't really have the substance for either a social commentary or even a comedy.

I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston, but this movie just plodded along. The jokes were contrived and there was nothing really driving the plot forward. A lot of the characters were pretty horrible. There's a long scene where Paul Rudd is saying foul things into a mirror that just went on forever, and was not funny. I'd skip this one unless you are a die hard fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Movie","review":"If it wasn't for some boobage (tons of old lady boobage, tho.), I would have given this movie only one star.

Like I said, there is 40 minutes of good stuff here, funny stuff, but the rest of the sheeyit that was interspersed into the film made it hard to watch. Literally. There were some scenes where my friends and I were asking each other \\"what the eff is going on here?

The story felt forced and as a result, lost much in the way of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"This is one of those movies that seems like a great idea on paper, but mostly winds up making predictable and easy jokes.

But at the end it gets clear that both are complete idiots (and that is why they are married).There are only few funny jokes.

He was actually really great in this movie, but the story line SUCKED. It had a bazar cadence, with disheveled emotions. The end is especially stupid. What turned me off the most, is how this movie played on the stereo type that all earth friendly, hippy types who live an alternat life style, are in a cult. The leader of the commune in this movie is an egotistical jerk - right from the beginning. This is just such a main stream, cynical view of free thinking, spiritual, alternative, vegan, type of people. This movie just leaves a bad taste in you're mouth.

It actually wasn't so horrible until a little bit in. For once someone in a Jennifer Aniston movie was more annoying than her character. Paul Rudd was horrible. In one scene he's talking to himself in the mirror to pump himself up for sex and saying things like, \\"I'm gonna get all up in that vag.\\" And then he repeats this and the like for what feels like forever in some of the dumbest voices I've ever heard. Not funny at all. I'm hard to offend but this was just BAD. It would be insanely uncomfortable to watch this with any older members of my family. God, it was uncomfortable just watching this alone. Would any woman sleep with this man? The fact that two women in this movie wanted to seemed insane and just wishful thinking on the part of whatever idiots wrote this script.

It's a shame because I was looking for one redeeming quality about this movie, for instance, one liners that are funny...like 'this one time, at band camp':) I was shocked that there wasn't even that.

It can be sweet,inspiring, and extremely uncomfortable all in about 5 minutes. While there isn't anything new offered with Wanderlust, there are plenty of laughs.

Highlights of my lifespan's longest hour include rigid, insipid performances, slapdash editing and a narrative surfeited of immaterial, supererogatory exposition that far exceeds (and inevitably eclipses) a lean and shopworn plot. Only a penultimate scene proves distinctive for its fight sequence, ineptly executed by the standards of exploitation fare. Kubrick's dissatisfaction with his antecedent debut Fear and Desire prompted him to withdraw it from public screenings; had he done likewise with this supreme exercise in tedium, no one save completist enthusiasts of American cinema's most autocratic auteur might vocalize misgivings in concern of its inaccessibility by curtailment.This picture's theatrical tagline reads: \\"Her Soft Mouth Was the Road to Sin-Smeared Violence!\\" Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"killer's kiss","review":"what s stinkeri guess every director has to start somewhereand i guess this was STANLEY KUBRICKS starterwhich was the only reason i bought iti now have all of his films in my collectionbut let's be brutally honest here it stnckwith a capital \\"S\\"i will say i'm gladmr kubrick seemed to haved llearnedfrom his no plot crappy or dare i say itok i will no story what soeverok the only thing about the moviethat resembled a story was the endingwhen the killer \\"kissed\\" hisgirlfreindi guess thats where the title comes from"},{"rating":"2","title":"The kind of film I would have made if only I had the time","review":"Stanley Kubrick's extreme talents finally explode onto the big screen with this remarkable little film about a boxer who saves a young woman from her boss who tries to rape her, he soon falls in love with her and the boss gets incredibly jealous. The plot is not that good at all but thanks to Kubrick, there's plenty of great lighting, suspence and best of all a stupendous fight scene with the arms and legs of dummies.

See it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely an early sign of what was to come.","review":"First off, a quote from an earlier reviewer: \\"Poor Stanley.

This was an enjoyable, if flawed, film, with some great scenes . . . and some real duds. The direction is great (obviously), and the acting is, even at its worst, passable, but the story is lacking in inspiration.

This product works just great. I have used it a few times and it does exactly what it promises. I have a mid-size SUV and it covers the windshield with plenty of material to spare. My guess it would have no problem covering a full size SUV window.I do recommend that you secure the bottom with your wiper blades. It seems like it could have a tendency to get whipped around if it was really windy out. It was a bit of a challenge fighting the wind trying to get this on. But once you know the wind direction, just secure the up-wind side onto your windshield with the wiper blade and inside the car door and it becomes much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"For the price, this product works pretty well to keep the snow and ice off your windshield. The downsides are that it is pretty large (and easier to put on with 2 people), seems subject to tearing, and you have to remember to actually put it on! But it is serving the purpose so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jumbo","review":"This was supposed to be a \\"jumbo\\" sized windshield cover, intended to cover up larger van windows. The picture even shows a woman putting the cover on her van window. When we got it, we tried it on the van and it did not cover any more than the standard windshield cover we already had. Comparing the size to our standard cover, it was a hair larger, but it still did not cover the entire windshield as described. Also the quality was poor. I could have just bought a piece of plastic tarp and cut it to fit the windshield and I would have had something better. I returned it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumbo is a joke","review":"Jumbo to me means that it should fit on a Lumina Van windshield nicely but it doesn't. It would be a great product if it were bigger. First of all when on the Lumina APV windshield, there is about 4 to 6 inches on the top and the bottom that doesn't even get covered. And for the length...it's not even long enough to suction cup to the inside of the windshield. I have to just put one end in the door and shut it and pull the other end and try to tighten the slack out of it and shut the door without smashing my fingers. It works where it is covered though. The suction cups that come with it stink. They don't work when cold, so just go to walmart and buy the medium sized suction cups with hook (3 to a pack) and remove the hooks and put those on. They work much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information Though an older book","review":"The cover on the book that I have is much different than the one pictured.

Imperanon is a melodic-death metal band from Finland. They have a standard, run-of-the-mill Finnish sound, but add in a neo-classical twist; much like Children of Bodom's older releases. The guitar riffing is very noodlely and power metal-esque. Fast pace solos and well thought out melodies. The vocals are much like Petri Lindroos', as a matter of fact, the singer from Imperanon just replaced Petri in Norther. There are also a couple of guest appearances from which add to the power metal sound. The Keyboards are also well heard and stand out, and there is a lot of variation with them as well. The rhythm section is spot on melodic death metal at its finest. It is a worthy release and if your into COB or Finnish metal, neo-classical, and anything with virtuoso playing i would defiantly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"this cd is awesome.

I also want to go to Las Vegas to see the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix Master","review":"I bought this album because I saw the show in Vegas. Though not a Beatles fanatic, I have always appreciated their music. However, the show and this album do make you recognize thier musical genius. By blending tracks from their earliest pieces to those of their later works, you can see how they created a body of work that has never been rivaled. They transitioned from genre to genre as their music evolved from simple pop and rock and roll to more complex lyrics with social messages and mealodies that incorporated tones from around the globe. While other compilations tend to walk you through time and memories, this album pushes you listen to the Beatles work in a whole new way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I just finished listening to it for the first time in the car on the way to work. I was blown away by the how fresh and new the songs are and yet retain all of there original luster. Amazing job done by the Martin father and son team. Face it who else could take the most important and influential music of my generation and move it to another level. I was concerned from reading some of the reviews and articles that this may adulterate the music that provided me with 40 years of enjoyment. Not so, BUY THIS CD! Not just another repackaging of the same songs. Should be a stocking stuffer for every baby boomer."},{"rating":"2","title":"eerie and wonderful","review":"This album brings the Beatles back to old fans and new listeners in very unexpected ways.

It lives up to all expectations: entertaining, high quality sound, and it beats the demo DVD-A that came with the car.This is not a \\"best of\\" Beatles music; it's a soundtrack of Cirque du Soleil's \\"Love\\"...a show (at the Mirage, Las Vegas) built around a montage of Beatles songs. There aren't many early Beatles songs here; they don't fit the Cirque format (if you've ever seen a Cirque de Solei show, you know what I mean) or the 5.1 format (many were recorded in mono).I haven't listened to the stereo CD version since I bought it specifically for the 5.1 format. But based on its content, I wouldn't recommend this CD/DVD-A except for the novelty of the 5.1 playback or for someone who wants to relive the show itself.And, finally, buy the mono box set if you are just looking for Beatles music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remix of Beatles music.","review":"I'm a huge Beatles fan (as my screen name suggests!), and I refused to listen to this CD until now. I'm a purist when it comes to the Beatles -- no covers, no remixes, no muzak arrangements, no alt-rock interpretations, thankyouverymuch. Just the originals. But my curiosity finally got the best of me, so I ordered a copy (truth be told, I just wanted to bring my order amount up to the free shipping minimum), and now I regret I didn't buy this sooner. George and Giles Martin have done a fantastic job remixing these Beatles classics. There are some really interesting pairings -- pieces of \\"Drive My Car\\" coupled with \\"The Word?\\" And it works -- beautifully. It will never take the place of the originals for me -- I don't think George Martin intended it to -- but for me, it was almost like hearing the music again -- for the first time. I love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Re-mix!","review":"Sonically the album was great, was amazing to hear songs of my youth sounding so different but still fresh with Beatles energy. Even the new cuts were great given two of the band members have passed away. This music will never get old and future generations are feeling the same as we did originally in the 60's. My Son loves this music and shares the same joy I do when we listen together."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"LOVE\\" ain't all we need....","review":"This is really just a one-listen curio dolled-up as \\"Beatles Lite: For Lovers\\", aimed squarley at The SoccerMom and DiaperDad set.

The music would be great in the show, not so much to listen too. Most of the songs could be made by a 10 year old slowing and speeding up the tracks on a computer and adding a guitar riff here and there. The song titles are not telling the truth for example blackbird/yesterday, i thought that could be cool, my kids love the black bird song, 6 seconds of the guitar from blackbird than yesterday starts. There is not 26 songs here some are just plain noise with a 10 second guitar riff. If you do not like the beatles alot or are heavily into acid and shrooms this might be a good buy for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatle Fan","review":"This is a wonderful remaster of the Beatles recordings.

Anthology was a mix match of gems and also rejected stuff. The BBC anthology was so so. Like Elvis, the Beatles is the most recycled group ever.I like this one. Although there is technically nothing new hear, the remixes give the Beatles, a fresh new Moulin Rogue sound. The recordings sound fresh and not old.If Elvis can be remixed for the dance floor, some clever guy at EMI should do it. Allons-y!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles LOVE CD","review":"A fellow Beatles fan told me about this disc. I thought it was just another compilation of previously released material, but it's a whole lot more than that! It's a joining together of the Beatles songs and musical passages into a unique theatrical-type program which is extremely enjoyable in its concept and also sounds cleaner with better fidelity. I suspect some first generation master tapes were utilized. If you love the Beatles, you'll probably flip over this baby! If you're not sure if you love the Beatles, this well-produced and conceived CD will convert you completely. George Martin did a wonderful job and I'll bet it was a labor of love....The Beatles LOVE rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the point??","review":"Being an avid Beatles listener, I was curious about what this would sound like when it came out. Let's just say that the version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps is nice. Other than that, I see nothing unique about Love other than a haphazard combination of random songs and studio [...]. Can anyone explain the actual point of this album??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"A little bit of everything. More than a greatest hits Cd. The transisitions between songs are edgy. This is pure Beatles with a modern spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles Extravaganza","review":"Simply stated, this album is remarkable. As the liner notes attest, the sound reflects the extraordinary talent of a \\"young band\\" that merely changed the world. With an articulate and masterful touch from George and Giles Martin, the mixing of so many outstanding Beatles songs into such a cohesive \\"set\\" leads you to believe you are listening to a magnificent new body of work from the group. A fresh and amazing approach to songs that have filled my life for the past 40 plus years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"This CD is not the fantastic, crazy mash-up we've all been waiting for. I eagerly picked this up, thinking somebody had done something weird and wonderful with all those classic tunes, and honestly I couldn't tell the difference in probably half the songs. Sure, maybe some lyrics are slightly different, maybe the music has been moved around, but most of these tracks could be outtakes from the original sessions. Either the mixer isn't all that creative or they just didn't take the time.There's a brilliant mash-up Beatles CD lurking somewhere in the future. This, unfortunately, isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love - The Beatles","review":"One man's opinion, so please take it as such. I grew up with the Beatles, and as a avid fan of the Beatles I can appreciate their music in almost any format, however . . . If you appreciate the genius and artisty of the Beatles, and can never seem to get enough, get yourself the real thing in its original form. If you appreciate show tunes, get yourself show tunes. Love is a mixture of both, and in my opinion fails at both. I never thought I'd think it, let alone express it, but this is a blatant attempt to exploit Beatle music in order to make a few more bucks. As a collection of bits and pieces of Beatles music that was perfect in the original, but remixed here to give it a new look, it fails miserably. Do what you want, but given a second chance, I would avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't LOVE this album","review":"I'm sure the idea of having George Martin and his son Giles re-mix the Beatles's songs must have sounded very appealing to the remaining Beatles, their wives and the record company. However, this idea never lives up to its promise. The transition mixes are a jumble of sounds that scramble one style period to the next. The \\"Benefit of Mr. Kite/I Want You/Helter Skelter\\" stands out as especially bad. The acoustic version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" starts as a potential highlight of the album, only to be ruined by the weepy string arrangement of George Martin, who said he was apprehensive about doing it. The Beatles songs are great, but there is no flow in this album and the transitions and selections from one song to the next are jarring. I liked the music but did not LOVE this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation","review":"This is a great compilation if you are looking for a little bit of everything from the Beatles. A huge Beatles fan friend of mine recommended it to me, and I'm really glad I purchased it. A good mixture from the beginning of their career through the end with a nice mix of upbeat and more mellow tunes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD with cool new versions","review":"When I saw the CD it stated that there were new remixed versions by George Martin. That was enough to make me bite and purchase the CD brand new which is something I never do.I really enjoyed it. Several songs didn't sound like there were many changes to them - perhaps there weren't. However the song that were \\"combined\\" were very clever and worked for me. The different version of Strawberry Fields is a favorite. George's acoustic version of \\"While My guitar gently weeps\\" is absolutely awesome. In my opinion that song could be re-released today as a new single.For the die-hard fans who don't want the originals \\"messed with\\", consider the fact that it is George Martin doing it. That should be reason enough to appreciate it. Either way, I am a HUGE HUGE Beatles fan and I thoroughly enjoy this CD and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Orgasm for the Ears","review":"This was an experience, an orgasm for the ears. I was a bit skeptic about it, thinking it would be like those awful jazz albums with a techno beat. This was far from that and far from awful. I was amazed by how new this sounded. I really felt like The Beatles themselves had recorded this today. I really felt the spirit of the music.I can't say enough good things about this album, except that it made me happy. That is the feeling you get from 'Love' and you can feel it when you are sitting there, submerged in 5.1 surround sound. Brilliant, absolutely Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new take on the Beatles","review":"I love the Beatles but I was getting bored hearing the same songs for the last 35 years. This is the same Beatle music but all mixed together in a fresh, new way with alot of energy. It was all familiar yet new at the same time. Really well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical mop top tribute","review":"No, this album is for the true Beatle fan and celebrates their creativity and innovation rather than their successes. Sure you will get your \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Yesterday\\", but you also get some of the more obscure tunes like \\"Within you and Without You\\" mashed with the bass from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". There are so many small things added (or taken away) from the songs and it's done so skillfully by George Martin and his son that they are sometimes difficult to detect. One of my favorites is the addition of Paul screaming from \\"Helter Skelter\\" combined with the heavy guitar from \\"She's so Heavy\\" being added to the end of \\"Mr. Kite\\". Awesome mash album for the true Beatles fan. If you're expecting a greatest hits album, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry me! Poor me! I bought it....

'They didnt say 'no'!' is Martin's decision, closing the lids! Thus this product. Okay, clever, well done, great sound (yawn), but WHY??????????????This is akin to cutting up family photographs just to insert one's own face. I think it's abysmal, if only for intent.

It was not until I opened it and listened to it and had access to the INSIDE of the jewel case, and voila, the true nature of this CD's origins are made clear - it is a horrible mishmash of sounds and lyrics and junk. I explained my dilemma to the Target customer service rep, but I had no recourse.

It's impossible to pick out all of the subtle samples from Beatle songs as they are sprinkled here and there. Some are very obvious but a lot of the time you find yourself going 'I know that, but I don't know where I know it from; what song is that??'. I think that was the idea.There was a bit of a wtf moment when I popped in the DVD and was disappointed to see the logo on my screen with just the music playing in the background. It would have been better to have some kind of images or SOMETHING rather than just staring at the stupid logo."},{"rating":"1","title":"an irritating mess","review":"First of all, I love a good mashup. DJ Dangermouse did a great job combining the Beatles and Jay-Z. But nobody should get away with taking existing perfection and trying to make it \\"slicker\\".

Second, do not buy this album if you expect to hear Beatles songs as originally produced and released. It's not the album for you, and you will be disappointed. But, third, do buy this album if you want to hear Beatles songs mixed and mashed lovingly in unique ways. The production is by orignal Beatles producer George Martin and his son, and they know what they're doing--with the approval of the Beatles and their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable listening experience","review":"\\"Love\\" is not just another Beatles album, it is an unforgettable listening experience. This is as close as we will ever get to a new Beatles recording. I wish I had a way to contact Sir George Martin and Giles Martin. I would like to personally thank them for what they have done. Every time I listen to this \\"Love\\" I feel like I am 16 years old again.To all the purists who are screaming foul: Paul and Ringo love this CD, so why should anyone else complain? If you don't like it, don't listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pause for thought!","review":"Well, the fans are really divided about this one. As a lifelong Beatles fan I have to say that I think it's worth $10 of anyone's money, but it will mean more to people who appreciate the Beatles significance in the history of popular music. What struck me most about this CD was the incredible improvement in sound quality over previous releases - for example, the bass lines are so clear but so are all the other instruments and voices. If nothing else it gets you thinking and wondering what the Beatles would have sounded like if they had had today's sound recording and reproduction technology all those years ago. They couldn't improve on the quality of the songs themselves - just the way they were recorded and reproduced. And that is what 'Love' does so well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"An excellent compilation and remixing of the Beatle's canon. Fresh takes on still-fresh compositions. No group has ever approached the consistently high standards of The Boys, except for perhaps George Martin himself, who's input and taste underpin this collection. A must-have for the Beatles fan of any age or degree of devotion. It's, uh, Fab!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love That Mash Up","review":"I can't decide whether I like this cd or not..but, I have listened to it a lot, so I guess that indicates something favorable about it. By my lights (and ears) Apple has been uneven in its post breakup releases, with the Anthologies marking an especial low point, but Love is probably a must have for those of us who love the Beatles. Just for the record, there's plenty of more incisive Beatles mash ups out there (on bootleg) that mix up Beatles tunes with non-Beatles music (e.g., \\"Let it Be\\" mashed up with a reggae song). But still, it wouldn't be Christmas without a new release from a band that broke up before your mother was born, would it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Cirque du Soleil and listen to The Beatles !","review":"If you truly like Beatles' music there's no need to buy this CD (no new music !), instead listen to the original music as it was released in the 60s on vinyl, and, later on, remastered on CD. Use a computer to create your own mixing, and, as I did, add post-Beatles material from each of the Fab Four solo career. Of course, the \\"Love\\" DVD Audio version offers 5.1 multi channel sound, but, believe me, the vinyl's Mono version is all I need !Buy this CD after you watched Cirque du Soleil's oustanding show to remind you of it. The show - it's the only way to \\"watch\\" The Beatles now ! Great show, great music - 'will last forever !"},{"rating":"1","title":"That rustling sound in some of the tracks is the money leaving your wallet","review":"I beg to differ. This is a rip-off. The CD remixes may be masterful, but one has the sense that a bright 14 year old with Garageband could do something much like this. Most annoying is the DVD. Expecting old footage, or even something from Cirque du Soleil--after all, the liner notes tell you that that's the premise for this thing? Guess again. There's a single image that remains onscreen for the duration of album, an image that stays before you as you presumably wallow around on your floor marveling at the Surround-sounded remix. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss twenty bucks good-bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles","review":"I don't like the treatment given to the songs.

The answer, of course, is that there is a new generation of money-spending boys and girls who can plunk down $25 to hear someone's garbled retake on that perfection. That the \\"someone\\" in this case was once affiliated with The Beatles does not excuse this money-grubbing, but seems to make it all the more egregious. For God's sake, kids, just get the real thing.

I am not going to fight and try and prove just how much I love the Beatles... Too many of us have made such statements to show to our fellow readers that our review is objective and all that jazz... Let's just say that this album is the final nail in the Beatles' coffin... Making sounds with prerecorded music, so that the masses can watch a bunch of talented - but incredibly uninspired - acrobats do pirouettes to this sterile and pathetic muzak, may convince some of us that there is a transcended value to all of this... Don't be fooled!!! There isn't!!! This album is total crap and bringing life to dead matter just doesn't make it any better... Frankenstein failed and so do these people...

Give it a spin and feel like a kid again."},{"rating":"2","title":"With Our Love, We Could Save the World","review":"I can't even begin to tell any Beatles fan how amazing this album, and show, is. After a long 3 years of waiting to turn 21, my man took me to Las Vegas to celebrate. I had only seen one other Cirque du Soleil show before, but was convinced I would like it just because it was set to the wonderful music of The Beatles. Was I ever right!! This show is so moving, mostly in part to the strict care given to the show's ever-important soundtrack, a collection of mostly re-produced Beatles songs (a few remain mostly untouched) produced by four gentleman, including George Martin, the original Beatles producer, and his son. Any Beatles fan will more than rejoice in this loving mix of the Beatles' best. Be sure to purchase this, especially if, like me, you have basically the entire Beatles catalogue. There will never be a truer celebration of the world's greatest rock band. I love you Beatles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An audio collage indeed","review":"Having virtually every album the Beatles made (that were available in the U.S.), I never had a doubt that they were the best pop musicians in the world. I remember my 70 year old grandmother bouncing to the tune \\"Love me do,\\" as she was ironing. This album is a type of closure for me, for I grew up with the Beatles. I was 12 when JFK was assassinated (1963), and the world was in a dark hole, mentally and spiritually. Then the Beatles seemed to appear from nowhere. They were like voices from above that reassured us everything was going to be alright, and that \\"Love\\" truly was the answer. Unfortunately, like other universal themes, its message still escapes humanity, but its nice to know we have a time capsule in this album we can revisit in our own way and appreciate what the Beatles did for us with their obvious talent (ahead of its time) and timeless message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beatles Remix with Obvious Cirque du Soleil Overtones","review":"If you like Cirque du Soleil, you will love this mixing of classic beatles songs. The album flows really well, but it is obvious that it was rendered for a performance.

If The Beatles were recording today, this is the kind of album they would release. It captures the inventiveness and fun they introduced to music.

I only ask because, apparently (judging from the 1 and 2 star reviews on this page) there are over 80 incredibly dull persons who bought this disk and then complained that this wasn't an \`original' Beatles hit disc. Please, if your looking for a greatest hits disc, this is NOT it. Now, as to this George Martin re-imagining of the Beatles songs to fit into this \`circus' performance, It's really very entertaining and refreshing. I enjoyed the music very much. Good job Mr. Martin! It's not a masterpiece (as it was created for a circus) but it is worth hearing and owning.Four Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"All You Need is Love","review":"Well, not quite. If I hear one more person call this a \\"mash up\\", I'm going to . . .Simply put, this album rules. Sgt. Pepper was FORTY YEARS AGO this year. I remember vividly getting my first Sgt. Pepper CD at the 20-year anniversary of the record, when CDs were still quite new. I still have it. It felt so vivid, fresh and NEW. Well, I had given up hope that anything Beatles related would ever feel new again. The anthologies were good, but they didn't quite cut it. This record breathes new life yet again into the best rock music ever. Try it out in DTS or DD 5.1. It's the bomb. Before those tapes disintegrate, I hope George or Niles can re-master everything in the catalogue plus anything else decent that has never been released. Hopefully my old ears will still be good enough to appreciate it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"New twist on some classic music","review":"We have known and appreciated the complexity of George Martin's producing for over 40 years.

I love it and am looking forward to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles \\"LOVE\\"","review":"I would have given this product 5 stars because the music composition and arrangement and its correspondence to the Cirque was just phenomenal. I have never heard this type of arrangement before with the Beatles library of music and it was very interesting. I love listening to it. The drawback to this particular product was the DVD portion. If I would have known its content I would have only purchased the CD. The DVD only shows the album cover on your TV screen while you listen to the same music that is on the CD. I thought there would be at least some sort of slide show from the Cirque or something more to the DVD than merely one picture of the album cover and music. I still love the music though."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Either LOVE It or Hate It","review":"I fall in the former group. Now before you send the Blue Meanies after me, hear me out. We fortunately have the exquisite originals, so I feel comfortable in enjoying this new treatment of these much loved songs. The only new one I didn't care for was \\"Because\\". However, the other offerings were truly a joy to hear. I loved the layered songs, and though it's nearly sacrilege, I really liked the new \\"Hey Jude\\". It works especially well for those that have less than enough patience for the original seven minute version as it is only four.If you are a Beatle fan, you should add this.

I saw the show in Las Vegas and was immediately captivated by this new arrangement. I'd always liked the \\"White Album\\" version, but this one just melted my heart. When I listen to the CD, I always end up hitting the replay button at least once to listen to it again. The harmonies in the strings are just breathtakingly beautiful. Kudos to whoever is responsible for this new Beatles treasure. The show itself is wonderful. After it was over, I realized my cheeks ached a little because I just couldn't stop smiling!

The mixing is very creative and imaginative, inspired no doubt by similar qualities of the original compositions. What is even more noteworthy is the fabulous clarity of voices and instruments in comparison to the CD format. I was able to hear sounds never before revealed making it a delight from beginning to end. The highs are transparent, crisp but not overdone, while the lows seemingly transcend the audible range and wind up somewhere between your subflooring and celiac plexus as they ideally should! Just a very pleasant journey through \\"Beatle Land,\\" and done so with a nod towards those who appreciate brilliant sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagine Something Over Hyped and Not Imaginative","review":"I'm highly disappointed after hearing all the hype.

When I put the disc in a regular DVD player the \\"audio\\" option pops up and I can choose PCM stereo. But not on my DVD-A player (Yamaha DVD-C750).

I'm not a purist by heart, I'm not upset by this CD release, and taking chances is necessary to explore new musical depths, but this fails. This CD was a gift, and so I guess it's the thought that counts; the buyer knows the Beatles are number one in my opinion. I won't tell them if you won't, but if they want to borrow it and forget to give it back, I won't remind them, either.

It appeared to be a good idea to someone to sample pieces of a lot of songs and then mix them in and out of each other to make something. Unfortunately, it comes out as cobbled and patched, with unsatisfying abbreviations of many songs, and jumps between songs which are mostly jarring. The songs themselves each had beauty, integrity and even dignity. This collection sounds like a bad motel lounge singer's routine. I can discern no sense or purpose in this album, except the continuing need for money from which the Beatles empire suffers. This is a \\"must-not-have\\" for Beatles fans, and if anyone out there doesn't have the original recordings, I'd save my money and buy them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"poo on a shiny plastic disc!!!","review":"Man this is bad - so bad i would rather listen to the Backstreet Boys or Brtiney Spears.

It butchers the Beatles' music in ways I could never have nightmares about. It is an uncreative, pointless album. Most of the songs play as normal, with a few interspersed samples from other songs thrown in for good measure. It's like they didn't even try to create huge differences, so it isn't even that creative. Furthermore, the remixes completely ripped the soul out of the music as originally intended. It rips out some of the best parts of songs, such as the end of Revolution or the chorus at the end of Hey Jude. It uses the crescendo sample from A Day in the Life far too much. In a nutshell, it massacres and dessicates the way these songs should be heard. If you MUST hear this music, copy a friend's CD, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why would we need this? Why, because we are bored with the originals? Not hardly I hope. This Photoshop-like Beatles CD collage is an insult of great works that needed nothing to make them desirable to be listened to \\"again\\". The music never stopped being listen to. This CD reminds me of the crass colorized versions of classic black and white movies just so they could hold the attention of the feeble minded tv brains. The only positive thing this CD does is make it clear that the master tapes need to be gone to again as a source to reissue normal recordings once again as the latest technology is far better than it was when the first CDs were made in the 80's - and only George Martin should do this - without his clever son.

Some of the songs have been very nicely paired down to create a cleaner overall experience, but some of the tracks sound basically exactly the same as the original.

As a result, the songs presented on 'Love' are probably a bit 'George-heavy' when measured vs. the recorded history of the Fab Four as a group. But who's complaining? As a George fan, it's nice to see him get rewarded. He was always the true 'explorer' of the group.That said, the music that stands out on 'Love' is Lennon's. The urgency of \\"She's So Heavy,\\" \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Glass Onion\\" is incredible. It was especially great to hear 'Onion' - I hadn't heard that in years. It's brilliant. And \\"I Am the Walrus\\" - even 40 years later - simply dazzles as a imaginative and technical tour de force.I've not seen the Cirque show, but hearing 'Love' makes me want to book a special trip to Vegas to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles as you've never heard them before","review":"At a small outdoor concert this August, during an intermission, the Love album was played over the sound system. My ears pearked up & listened carefully: this WAS the voice of John, Paul, George & sometimes Ringo, but it WASN'T any of the originally released versions of the song. Since I own all the Beatles, WHAT IS THIS ??It was the Love album, a remix of 26 of the best of the Beatles by George Martin & his son. Songs include the biggies: Hey Jude, Eleanor Rigby, I Am the Walrus, Help, Within You Without You, LSD, While My Guitar Gentle Weeps, Sgt. Peppers, etc.A few songs have very minor changes. Most, however, are substantially changed in some way, tho the vocals generally are what we are all intimately familiar with. One song, Grik Nus (Sun King spelled backwards) is a song that works entirely backwards!All in all a very creative reworking of the Fab Four we fondly miss so much. And well worth the price of an album, esp at the $8 I paid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word.","review":"I'm a lifetime Beatles' fan, and have been playing this 'Love' album frequently since it was first was released. All I can think when I listen to this album is one word: \\"Whatever.\\" It is almost ridiculous how talented and innovative the Beatles were/are. Kinda makes me wonder why anyone else has bothered since..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinventing the Beatles!","review":"George Martin has taken a huge risk and it pays off handsomely. Taking portions of the Beatles vast collection of popular songs and remixing them into one 78 minute musical experience is dazzling. Each song is remastered flawlessly and seamlessly edited into one another with a vast interspersing of original Beatles sound effects and orchestration. While you hear one song with the band, there might be a sound byte from another songs background mixed into the complete experience. It's a non-stop joy ride from the a capella of \\"Because\\" to the finale of \\"All You Need Is Love\\". It's all Beatles and it's all fantastic. The DVD expands on this brilliant idea and reproduces the sound in 5.1 digital surround. This is not the \`best' of the Beatles - it is the \`genius' of the Beatles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I grew up with these guys","review":"It's a very nice album. As the liner notes say it sounds as fresh today as it did 40 years ago. Putting the disk in the CD player is like having a warm visit from beloved old friends.I'm not much of a fan of moldy goldy, but I've been listening to this album, Chicago Transit Authority (Chicago's debut album,) both incarnations of Blood Sweat and Tears, etc. And in one respect it all makes me very sad. I grew up in this golden age of talent and creativity--a time when the music was the thing. These three examples are only the the tip of the iceburg of what was happening in the music business back then.Isn't it amazing (and sad) that with all the state of the art, wonderful technology of today that the music doesn't even approach the art of the Beatles, etc?BTW, I got this on a special, I guess, for only $9.99 plus shipping. Really good bang for the buck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing - I think this is a gem!","review":"I am an avid Beatles fan and have all their official CD releases and loads of their vinyl. Conseqently I am familiar with their music. This album allows you to hear a different spin on some of their most popular, as well as less well known, music. The segues are fascinating and you will also hear snippets from versions other than the officially released tracks. The mixing has, of course, been done on state of the art equipment and is beautifully crystal clear - top marks to EMI for:1) Impeccable original recordings, and2) Preserving those old recordings so well.The clarity allows you to hear into parts of recordings that were previously 'buried in the mix'.I approached this album in trepidation but I have found myself beguiled. Fans and casual observers alike will definitely enjoys this. Roll out the show in Europe please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but there is NO Beatles Spirit!","review":"Granted - they did a good job to restore original records to quite a good quality, but they added a lot of garbage sounds as well. I hardly listened the record one time till the end. Lucky me, I borrowed CD not bought it!

The Love soundtrack is a masterpiece by itself and add to that the awesome 5.1 effects, it's really an experience that if you like the Beatles, you can't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware the hype","review":"i was kinda of excited about this but actually listening to it is a different story.you gotta ask yourself - do you really want to hear snippets of beatles songs? do you really want these artificial mixes and transitions to get stuck in your head in place the original songs?if you need a beatles fix - i would suggest getting the anthologies (especially 2 and 3) and putting them on shuffle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"If this wasn't produced by George Martin, then I'd have been skeptical. It's musical threads woven by the master tailer. These are Beatles songs and snipets of Beatles songs that have a different flavor. This is more than a Beatles fan release. Even the dopes who have never listened to the Beatles might like some of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous","review":"First things first, Love by the Beatles, features music that is all from the Beatles original recordings. That said, the starting point for this CD is very strong. If you can get past the fact that there are what amounts to remixes of many of the recordings. I am a firm believer that any music by the Beatles is great music. Love by the Beatles is no exception to that belief. The sound hear is outstanding. There are many of the classic Beatles songs hear, with some eerie renditions and some excellent. There is an ethereal quality to Strawberry Fields and I am the Walrus sounds excellent. This is a must have for Beatles fans. I rate it a strong four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET IT","review":"AMAZING THAT ANYBODY WROTE A BAD REVIEW.I'VE BEEN COLLECTING BOOTLEGS FOR YEARS AND WAS AMAZED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE INSERTED ON THIS CD - SOUNDING CLEAN AND FRESH. THE BLENDING OF SONGS WAS FANTASTIC AND KEPT ME SMILING THROUGHOUT, NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS COMING NEXT. I ONLY WISHED THE DRUMBEAT CARRIED ALL THE WAY THROUGH ON TRACK 14, BUT WAS STILL GIGGLING ON HOW COOL IT WAS. ONLY 4 OF 5 STARSCAUSE I WISH ALL BEATLES SONGS WERE ON THIS (MAYBE/HOPEFULLY VOL. 2)THOSE WHO DIDN'T LIKE THIS CD SHOULD LISTEN WITH THEIR HEADS PULLED OUT OF THEIR A**."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Shocked!!!","review":"In all honesty I expected \\"Love\\" to be yet another re-packaging of tried and true Beatles classics. Then I heard that it was actually the soundtrack to a Cirque du Soleil show and my expecations dropped even lower. I expected nothing short of total cheese. Wow was I surprised. My review? One word. AWESOME!Give it a listen. If nothing else it's really cool to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing/hearing is believing","review":"Without witnessing the Cirque du Soleil presentation, this album...er CD, loses half of its impact. What goes on between the ears after experiencing the show and then listening to it again is truly remarkable. I'd go to the show again in a heartbeat. Looking forward to the eventual remastering of the Beatles catalogue. This CD is just a taste of what is to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I have, like most people raised in the 60's, every Beatle album made. In every case, I listen to the new release and think, 'yuup, it's them again'. These are usually the same mixes, sometimes 'remastered' but generally the same.Until this one. It is like George Martin somehow got the four back into a modern 2006 studio and made them do it all over again. I have NEVER heard Ringo on the drums sound like this. The vocals are tight and fresh, the mixing is supurb.I am truly blown away by this one. Same songs but they all feel new. Even \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand' live sounds like it was done last week.If this were an album (you young people, check Wikipedia if you don't know what this is) I would play the grooves off it and need another."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beatles Love","review":"If you really love the Beatles, you probably won't think much of this.

I recommend this to any Beatles lover who has most of their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encore!!!","review":"You know it's sad when the best album of the year is a collage of recordings that were originally laid down 40 years ago. But it's a well deserved success. I guess what this album really does well is hold to its mission statement: \\"You will experience this music in a whole new way\\". Not only did George Martin surpass my expectations in the execution, but he was able to give new life to some of the richest, most enduring music on the planet - while satisfying buffs and new listeners alike. It's about damn time the Beatles got some new age treatment. For the first time fans can listen to TRUE stereo & surround sound mixing of (some of) the Beatles catalogue. Crisp, exciting, refreshingly creative. It's as though the Beatles got back together and decided to play an 80 minute studio medley. Bravo. Encore?Best moment: The previously unreleased \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Acoustic)\\", with additional lyrics and a backing score written by George Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In my opinion, the Beatles Catalogue should be left alone and not suffer from such remixes. At times the voices sound out of tune and this detracts from the overall listening pleasure.With the amount of media hoopla surrounding each Beatles release it is difficult to sort the wheat from the chaff. In this case, sadly, it is chaff. Disappointing and definately for Beatles fans ONLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend to any true Beatles fan!","review":"I think it's terrific, gave me goose bumps when I played it the first time. I love the way the songs segue into one another. Good selection of tunes, however, I could have done without \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\". It seems to be a tribute to John & George, which is what it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 great songs - the rest unnoticable difference","review":"i had high hopes for this one. not unrealistic high hopes, but i am VERY DISSAPPOINTED!I really expected some stellar stuff, songs reinterrpreted and fresh.George Martin is a genious, but he bombed on this one.There are apx 20+ songs on here. They are fantastic songs, but they sound completley unchanged. I feel like I just rebought a greatest hits album I already own! The Beatles songs are gourgeous on their own, but the thing that upsets me, is this album was completely FALSELY ADVERTISED.[...]I originally bought this album after listening to the 4 tracks on the beatles myspace[...]Those songs were so gourgeously redone and are truly novel gems.Bad news, is the rest are so minimally altered, you cant even tell the difference.If you are a purist this is fine, it is like being tricked into rebuying another greatest hits album.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"It's a big yawner. Anybody with a reasonably respectable Beatles MP3 collection and a $40 computer program (Goldwave) could have created this album. There is frankly nothing new or imaginative. Not only that, the remixes detract from the originals. This music would likely work well in the context of the show, but fails to stand on its own as an album. All the hype is nothing more than yet another McCartney/Ono Christmas money grab."},{"rating":"1","title":"like painting a fake mustache on the Mona Lisa","review":"Why mess with the greatest music of the 20th Century? To put together another compliation of songs everybody already owns? I am one of the biggest Beatles fans in the world, and this is sacrilege.

In the original recording the song were so beautifully crafted and brought joy and love to all of us around the world. Yes, the have the love, inspiration...Listening to this was just a sequence of annoying surprises, pieces Here, There and Everywhere but NONE in the right place. Was this really necessary?The Beatles\`s music IS the greatest in the Rock/Pop World. This CD is some else's playtime... NOT WORTHY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real worth buying","review":"Besides loving all the material included in this CD, I have to praise the seller for the promptness in sending this item in a very short time.The CD arrived at my address in perfect conditions and the only problem that I am facing is to be able to stop listening to it.This makes me wonder why all the Old CDs by The Beatles are not remastered to this format (DVD-Audio-DTS) because in this way, you are able to catch new sounds in every track they have recorded, something that is simply impossible when you listen to the normal stereo(2-channel) versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this album!","review":"A must-have for any Beatles' fan! George Martin (original producer extraordinaire for the Beatles) and his son Giles have produced an exquisitely mastered product. Highly suggest this double version: CD plus the Audio DVD. Costs MUCH more if you buy it at the actual show at The Mirage in Las Vegas. We purchased this, then went to see the show (which, by the way, has the longest contract EVER for a resident show--ten years!--and we HIGHLY recommend it . . . a true feast for the eyes, ears, and all your senses!), and listened to it while we drove back home. Buy it . . . you won't regret it! Even if you have, like we do, all the original recordings. These newly mastered songs are fabulous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sound quality!!!","review":"I've attended the live show, and I'd had to try the DVD to check out the sound quality. What a wonderful surprise, it's great. I felt almost like in the Mirage's LOVE Theater.

Congratulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE The Beatles","review":"LOVE (CD + Audio DVD)The sequence of grand classical Beatles music, both words and tunes, have been put together with sublime technical skill. The result is breathtaking for the ears. Did think some video on the DVD would have been available but I guess the video of LOVE The Beatles can be purchased separately. So all in all the CD is brilliant! Purchase and shipping from Amazon was spot-on, in a word excellent. Haydn Deane, Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this CD - it is crap","review":"If you are a true Beatles fan, do not waste your money on this CD. It is nothing like the originals. George Martin may think he can remaster the originals but it comes out sounding terrible. It is a sin to try to work some of the greatest songs in the Beatles repetoire into combinations. Had I known this was what this CD was all about, I never would have bought it. This production was made for the Cirque du Soleil and thus was to produce a lot of money. I am beginning to find that their productions are getting too pat and this soundtrack goes along with it. In the beginning Cirque du Soleil was innovative, but like all big money-makers they go stale after a while. This album pulls the Beatle repetoire into the same cesspool. Since George Martin produced so much good Beatles music, it is sad to see him get into this cesspool too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full disappointment!","review":"It would be MUCH better to republish ALL originals AS IS, but in high-res SACD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur job of mixing multiple sound tracks together","review":"I have been a Beatle fan since I was [...]. I even have the White Album on white vinyl. I was excited about the reviews I read so I bought this CD. I was really looking forward to listening to some wonderful Beatles music again.I was so disappointed I gave the CD away. It is a amateur job of mixing multiple sound tracks together.The songs that were chosen for this CD are already very well mixed masterpieces: i.e. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You/Helter Skelter/Strawberry Fields.So 90% of the work was already done before George Martin's son Giles started thumbing at the controls.It would have been nice to see an array of Beatles songs that were not so commercial or heavily mixed weaved between these songs.Now that would show real mixing skill.Its a good thing that George Martin is almost deaf. I don't think he would have been too happy if he really heard what his son did."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! Beatles' purists do not buy this CD.","review":"I had to give this CD 1 star because the Amazon rating system would not accept a zero star rating. By looking at the album cover I thought I was buying a new release of Beatles music like the \\"One\\" CD. This CD is some pretentious idiots' idea of art, to mess up the Beatle's music.

This 40 year old music sounds brand new and it's like a Beatles concert might be today if they could perform one. I wanted to listen to it like when I listened to new music as a teenager. In the basement with the lights turned off and the headphones on. I was so moved by this brand new trip down memory lane, this 53 year old man cried at the very end when John Lennon says \\"goodnight to you's all\\" in his spoken voice. Can't believe somebody murdered him. So many highlights. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" with acoustic guitar and a string arrangement is beautiful. Even songs I wasn't nuts about before are fresh. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" stands out as does \\"I Am The Walrus\\". This mix makes you smile over and over. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cirque Du Soleil souvenir","review":"This disc was given to me as a gift, \`cause I'm known as a Beatle fanatic around these parts. After being entertained by LOVE for an evening or two, I got this feeling that it will end up collecting dust on my shelf soon, along with the Yellow Submarine Remix and Naked albums. It seems like Apple Records is toying with \\"the Beatle fan\\" instead of doing the Beatles catalogue justice, they just continue to razzle-dazzle the public with some amusing, yet rather pointless re-releases.I'm sure this disc will be a great souvenir for the Cirque Du Soleil show, and a gateway to the real deal, but not much more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"already broken","review":"My son loves the doll, but not as much now that it doesn't talk when you pull the string....well he'll say a 1/2 sentence.

The doll itself is fine and looks just like the original, that is where the similarities stop. First of all the pull cord is fake, sure you have to pull it, but it just activates a digital recording. Secondly, the voice is not even close to Tom Hanks. Lastly, the iconic sayings of the doll are not even there, how can this be?

So if none of those things bother you then go for it, otherwise stay away from this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheriff Woody's in Town","review":"My grandson had gotten a large Buzz Lightyear at Christmas and he needed a buddy for good times and a bit of rivalry.

It looks so much like the Woody from Toy Story - much more so than either version of the plush doll that is available.

He loves all of the Toy Story movies, and has had many of the toys, but wanted the talking ones for his birthday. I ordered this for him, and he loves it! He has played with this doll since he opened it, and even sleeps with it now. The only minor complaint is that the hat fits awkwardly and doesn't like to stay on, but that's not really a huge deal.

Having tried many other products, I was pretty much resigned that my pores wouldn't ever look smaller! I don't have bad skin/acne, just large pores and some pock marks from my younger days. But, I gave in to trying this product and it's actually worked. I don't notice the bad smell some of the other reviewers talked about. There was minimal peeling the first time I put on my foundation, but I solved that by using a foundation brush instead of my fingers. I've been using it for almost two weeks, and there is a visible reduction in pore size.

It shows the photos of the clinical trials and how the pores reduced in size. I bought it even though it was expensive and I'm very glad I did. Right away I saw a difference the first time I used it. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and have to say that I can't believe the difference it has made. A bunch of the pores that were enlarged have closed completely, and the ones that were very big have gotten smaller. I'm also using 10% glycolic pads that exfoliates my skin and so I believe that is why my results have been so good. If you have blackheads it will take longer to close the pores because they have to be clear before they can actually close up. It does work very well at removing the blackheads, but if you have a severe blackhead problem your better off going at it with a 2-step approach with the glycolic acid before applying.

You hate and love the characters as if they were real people. Because he writes them as real people. Reading these books are almost like reading non-fiction.

The major character of the book is an abortionist, whom the author portrays as a heroine. The author is obviously a liberal, and strongly pro-abortion, and felt the need to use this genre to advance his views on the subject. Regardless of your political views, I believe that most people would find the use of this genre to be inappropriate to advance those views.

Together with the tales, these additions make this book exciting and easily accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Tales","review":"The Mabinogion is a collection of ancient Welsh mythlogical tales. The first four stories, called the four branches of Mabinogi, form a coherent cycle. The Mabinogion also contains several pseudo-historical tales, ans several early Arthurian stories.

While watching Season One's episodes, I kept saying to myself: \\"I wish I had this music.\\" Well, now I do. And, it is amazing!!! The composer has taken many differnt types of music from all around the world and blended them together into someting epic. He mixes Tribal, Celtic, Arabic, Electronic, Opera, and Romantic Classical music, and Muzac, into a sound that is compleatly unique, spectacular, emotional, touching, violent, and just about every other description that you can think of. The drums get a little tedious, but in all, this is definitly a \\"must hear\\".Of all the tracks, my favorite must be the Celtic \\"Wonder My Friends\\" It's both beautiful and heartbreaking. I feel moved every time I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really is the Best Sci-Fi Show out there at the moment","review":"If you thought the first soundtrack to the mini-series was good then this goes beyond that. This is just pure sci-fi at its greatness, blending an ethnic vocals over dreamscape and moving music. This really works with the series 1 and in my opinion this is one of the best sci-fi shows that are out that moment, even better than its competitors Stargate SG1/Atlantis.Combining sturring score with a series that has greatness all over it, I'd buy the season 1 also with it, its well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of the show, you probably already own this.","review":"To start, I got this soundtrack simply because of \\"Shape of Things to Come\\" and \\"Pascagalia\\". Those two tracks alone are worth the price. What Bear McCreary does that is refreshing is he takes the standard TV music score and turns it from a simple music cue to feel sad or anxious or happy into an experience in itself--something to be enjoyed independently of the action on the screen. Particularly with the pieces from \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\", he creates orchestral pieces that more than stand on their own as simply enjoyable works. McCreary's music adds a richness to the show that hard to qualify; it's just...there being awesome. Not too bombastic, techno, or new agey, it's always just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSG Season 1 Audio CD","review":"Bear McCreary did a wonderful job on this music.

I heard the Jupiter piece on my local classical station and in movie soundtracks and wanted to own it on CD but within a budget. This CD fits the bill. I am not a true classical afficianado (sp?), just an average person who happens to like a few classical pieces, so I admit that there may be recordings by other orchestras that are better and held up as the \\"gold standard\\" by true music lovers.

I had heard that the London Symphony Orchestra version was supposed to be the best, but then I got this version and quickly realized that I already had a better version. When listening to this version I kept thinking the musicians only showed up because they had to and that they were just waiting for the day to end. This version seems to lack motivation, and I think I'll avoid anything else by the London Symphony Orchestra because it will probably be boring.

It starts as though someone is entering a huge gathering of people where everyone seems to be least bothered about each other.These people are completely lost and have given themselves away to the moment. The only thing quite good about Avalanches is their ability in choosing a name for their band and an even better title for their album . The music lacks shape,direction and sounds nothing but monotonous. I have known a lot of music to grow on me but Avalanches refuses to budge from it's chaotic boredom. There is way too much good music in life than to sacrifice my time on Avalanches.

Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty to look at but not much else.","review":"A romance set in 17th century England should be irresistable to me; especially one with such gorgeous costumes and scenery as this. However, this movie not only suffers from an insipid, silly storyline but from bad dialog as well. All you have to do is watch the very first scene of the movie for a shining example of truly awful dialog. I read Barbara Cartland novels when I was in my early to mid-teens and the story reminds me of some of the romantic tales my gal pal and I would cook up just for fun. Even so, I will give the movie two stars for its beautiful and mostly accurate costumes, especially the women's. It is also nice but rather surprising to see revered veteran actors like John Mills, Robert Morley and Gordon Jackson playing smaller roles in the movie.Unfortunately the video tape quality is awful and was almost unwatchable in the beginning. Luckily the tape was a gift and I didn't spend a dime on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker!!!","review":"I wasn't expecting high art when I bought this movie but I was at least expecting good acting considering the cast. This movie was so bad it was funny. I watched with a friend and we ended up making comments similar to those on Mystery Science Theater just to stay mildly entertained. The story was lame (to be expected) but the acting was lousy with the exception of Oliver Reed who was pretty good as the bad guy. All this on top of a truly hokey sound track.

My sisters and I now hold her acting in this movie as the perfect example of pretty, dumb blond who was told, \\"stand there and look pretty.\\"Nevertheless if you have sarcastic taste in movies (as I do, 4 stars) it is a fun movie to watch especially for the early-years of High Grant.*If this is your first foray into Barbara Cartland land, I'd suggest \\"A Hazard of Hearts\\" (1987) with a young Helena Bonham Carter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Despite the fact that the cast includes Hugh Grant, this movie is a waste of time.

To add insult to injury, it seemed almost amateurish in direction and editing. While I realize that most films are shot scene by scene, usually clever editing and splicing makes a smoothly flowing final product. This actually looks like something high schoolers would have done with 8mm reels years ago.

This DVD however is a very bad one. I'm not reviewing the movie's plot, simply the condition of the DVD itself. The entire movie was quite blurry and in some of the scenes set in a cave, I was unable to see well enough to follow the action. Near the end of the movie strange tracking lines began running up the DVD and I've never seen that on any DVD before, only VHS tapes.

We thought for $44. we should have at least had a turntable like a lazy Susan, but it rolls on casters which will mar a wooden table. I want my money back or a replacement, so now I will have to pursue that avenue.

When we opened this we were surprised to see that it does NOT have a rotating base, it has some metal beads on the bottom that allow it to turn...if it is on a very smooth surface and even then it doesnt turn well. The board folds in the middle so the tiles down the middle don't sit well and the plastic board surface is not glued down properly. Also, Super Scrabble is a different game with double the amount of tiles to play and a much bigger board so that a game of Scrabble will take much, much longer to play.For $40 I expected better quality.

The featherweight tiny plastic letters are too hard to pick up and manipulate. This is especially hard when trying to place them on the board in between those little plastic nibs at each corner of the board squares. The plastic letter holders are too lightweight and get knocked over easily. I'll also complain about the double amount of letters available. Sounds like a good idea, but in use it makes getting letters you need more rare... and getting too many of a particular vowel too often. The end result is a game that takes more than one night to finish.

It is basically two pieces of plastic with cardboard sandwiched between them. The plastic is warped so much that the tile letters do not lay flat. The board folds in the middle and the two pieces do not even meet correctly, with one side raised higher than the other. As a result, all tiles placed on squares that run down the middle of the board, do not lay flat. There are several warped areas that lift up throughout the board that will pop if you press down on it, making the tiles pop up in the air.The concept is great. The product is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GAME","review":"It took me a couple of Scrabble games before I finally \\"bit the bullet\\" and paid the extra cost for this Super Scrabble Deluxe Edition.It is well worth the extra money.

The Deluxe version is terrific, the one downside is the board. The seam in the middle lets the tiles wobble that are in the \\"seam line\\" and the little plastic hinges broke the second time we used the board. A very disappointing design flaw! Being creative, I have managed to effect a repair that has made the board sturdier, to bad the design team couldn't have done the same. I also made a platform for the game to sit on as the ballberrings can and will scratch whatever surface the game is placed on, another design flaw.

We also enjoy the \\"Upwards\\" version of Scrabble. We decided to buy Super Scrabble and were very disappointed for many reasons. First the placement of the bonus squares weren't well planned. For example double word bonus squares are too close together so that one word can easily cover two of them. There are too many qualdruples scores leading to scores of over 700 for each player. The main drawback is that with 200 tiles it takes more than 3 hours to complete a game so we end up setting an end time which loses some of the challenges of using up all of the letters. Additionally some of the tiles have faded letters so the quality is poor and not in line with what is charged for the game. We've stopped playing it and will probably donate it to charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Interesting than Regular Scrabble!","review":"The addition of so many extra tiles, plus the quadruple point score, made for a very exciting game.

Then he takes work home with him, showing the young girl his violent side(aimed at some confronting punks, not her) and coupled with the death of his friend and coworker, his seemingly intact world starts to fall apart.I won't go on any further and spoil the film for you, but none of it's unexpected or totally new. Still, I don't regret watching the film and wouldn't mind purchasing the DVD simply because, when viewed just as a fim and not some new hope or whatever, it's a good movie.Definately worth a rent and if you love movies like Leon, Ghost Dog or Fallen Angels, you might want to pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powdered vanilla?","review":"I was a little hesitant to buy this.

SOPHOMORE SLUMP does apply to this CD which fortunately did go platinum.Some of the best songs are the hip-hop RIDE AND SHAKE, BEST OF ME, CASE OF THE EX,TEARS ON MY PILLOW, THE FIRST TIME.

This album will be a bestseller on the r&b charts because she has the above preresquites to make it But the trouble is she sounds like every other below 21 singer today.

And she's right. This is hardly the best this girl could do. Her voice is sweet and soft, which balances well with other vocalists and rappers, so the best songs her are the colloborations. Jadakiss, Beenie Man, and the late Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes let Mya shine while they do their thing. The only solo track here that really works is her smash hit \\"Case Of The Ex\\". The rest of the tracks are far from praise worthy. The ballads are banal and dull. \\"Pussycats\\" is a vile bit of throwaway R&B. To make it worse, she re-issued this album later with her catchy single \\"Free\\", and I'm left with this dud. Some solid tracks, but on the whole, it's not that good R&B by numbers. I hope Mya can pull off a hot third album soon. Good luck to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"She can do it much better","review":"I love Mya, she's very talented and her soft voice is suited for success, she never got the big breakthrough like i predicted though, and to be honest this album is pretty average. It's dissapointing since she got loads of talented and could hit it big with the right producers and songwriters. On this album there are a few notable one's though. \\"Case of the ex\\" her hitsingle was a decent song i still hear from time to time, also the great collaboration with Left Eye(Rest in peace) on \\"Takin me over\\" which is a catchy pop-soul song, most songs are actually soulish mid tempo here, a few ballads like \\"Man of my life\\" and very few uptempo songs.

I know Tull came under immense pressure for Thick as a Brick, but the final result is one of the best Tull albums recorded. Thick as a Brick is a very upbeat song/album and with mulitple time changes and master musicianship, the album never gets dull, or boring. If you have only heard the chopped up versions available on best of CD's then you have to do yourself a favor and buy this album to hear Thick as a Brick in it's complete form. One of the best things about Jethro Tull, is that they constantly push and try new things, whether it's album length tunes like Thick as a Brick or Passion Play, of whether it's trying out new sounds like 80's Tull with Under Wraps. Thick as a Brick is a must have for any rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rock epic","review":"With Thick As A Brick, Jethro Tull gives the rock world the accomplishment it needed: an epic poem set to music. So the liner notes label it, and so it is. Forty-two minutes of non-stop rock and roll complimented by their signature flute sound make this album an experience like no other. Along the way, the style moves across the whole spectrum, from light melody to pounding guitar-driven rock backed by fantastic vocal work. The lyrics are admittedly quite odd, but this is nothing new for Jethro Tull, and certainly detracts nothing from one of the greatest overall albums to hit the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT my favorite Jethro Tull at all","review":"Unlike many Tull fans, I'm not a big fan of the Thick As A Brick album. It's just to grandiose for me. Maybe I just don't have the attention span required to listen to one song for two LP sides. For me, the radio-edit version found on Original Masters is better. My favorite things on this CD are the 11 minute live version recorded in New York City and the interview/commentary.

Hell even Aqualung is better than Thick as a Brick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a complete masterpiece. This is tulls first concept album and forshadowed the progressive faze they would go into for the next couple years. Full of great musicianship by everyone, never a dull moment. Even if your not a huge tull fun but like prog rock this is still an essential purchase. The track starts with Ians wonderful acoustic guitar then morphs into very technical rock. For the next forty minutes the song moves in and out of delicate whispers to thunderous riffs then layers the original theme in and out to unify it all. Like a great symphonic piece this track will stay with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak spots, but great overall","review":"Wow! is all I can say after listening to Thick as a Brick by Jethro Tull. When I first recieved the album, I was quite skeptical as to how much I would enjoy the album. After listening through the album for the first time, I was amazed, yet quite bored of the 40+ extraneous minutes. But after I listened to the album for 3 times, I was hooked on it, despite the fact that there are some slow parts in the album. All of part one is completely excellent, while part two from about minute 30 to minute 40 went extremely slow. But at the end of the album, Ian Andersen really picked up the slack with one of the best endings I have ever heard of a song.

If you don't own it - buy it!At first the album is hard to get into, but it grows on you. It's a shame that the radio stations just don't play the whole album. Side one for those who remember records or track one for those who now have the CD is the typical Tull sound and experimentation with with music. But it wasn't really until I dove into side/track two that I realized the album was a masterpiece. Sit by yourself and crank up the volume. An extroadinary display of talent. The combination of the unique instruments is awesome, especially John Evan's organ playing and the introduction of an electric violin. So awesome I wish I could walk into a big cathedral somewhere and hear the echoing sounds of side two played live with the return of John Evan beating on the keys of a large pipe organ!

An oboe, perhaps. Alternating between babbling about such and such of no interest and whistling into a metal tube seems so artistic, but it really isn't. Jethro Tull is one of the great non sequiturs, like The Who, a band which only is remembered because somebody back in the 60s/70s thought it was so cool back then and is now too embarrassed to admit that they were wrong.

They recently upgraded their software to 2.0, which features a built-in TV guide that doesn't work and a new price tag of 80$, and still crashes.Further, the crashes aren't your normal crashes where the program disappears. The program stays open even if you force-quit it, so you can't use EyeTV again until you restart your computer. Admittedly, I'm using OS X Tiger and I never had this problem on Panther (both on a G5), but nobody wants to use an obsolete OS just to run a TV player.

Not being able to put into a firewire chain is another negative (manual recommends isolated firewire connection). Lastly the unit is overpriced for the limited use and features and poor tech support.

It wouldn't wake the computer from sleep to record a tv show, like it is supposed to. The other problem is that the tv listing the software uses, is not accurate. It had incorrect times for shows. I reported this and they admited it, and said they contracted the listing with another company. Most importantly there is NO phone contact provided with Elgato. They refuse to provide it. You have to email them with problems, and they email you back.....Days later. They say it will work on anything G3 500 or higher. I strongly disagree!

I purchased it through Amazon more as a gesture of friendship - I know the author. I started reading one Sunday afternoon. I felt compelled to finish that afternoon. I have recommended this to others in my men's group, and gave my copy to another to read.This addressed two respect-for-life issues that are every day decisions Amareicans face: abortion and euthenasia. Jim places you in the lives of people making the decisions and shows how faith can change their perspective.I think this would make a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for getting to grasps with basics of ECGs.","review":"This book is written for medical students, nurses, paramedics - anyone who may be involved in interpreting ECGs in clinical practice and whom might not have the best knowledge of physics. It teaches interpretation without necessarily understanding all the physics involved. It is only a little book, yet covers a suprising amount. It helped me to understand ECGs better for my third year MBChB exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing great either","review":"As I stated in other reviews, most of the ECG books on the market are nothing impressive.

They have no hits scored by The Ventures, but is real fun to listen to. Batman Theme is rightfully the same. Some good instrumental covers on this album are Green Grass, Boots, Frankie and Johnny, and Monday Monday. And perhaps the best song on the whole album is The Ventures original, Ad-Venture. Its guitar riffs and hooks are great! You can't go wrong with this album if you're already a Venture fan. If you are completely new to this wonderful group, get Telstar or Walk Dont Run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Pictures, but the information is very out of date","review":"I bought this book to help me learn more about the amazona genus that I was considering as a pet. But what I found was a book written before 1992 which was around the time importation was banned and hand raising and breeding birds within the United States had became more common. This resulted in very little information about todays common amazons. Also, this book described all the the precautions one must take to ensure the saftey of your wild caught bird, precautions that are now just plain useless! Though if what you are looking for is a picture book about amazons, this is almost a good book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and outdated; wonderful pictures though!","review":"As a new Amazon owner I was looking for a species-specific book that would give me detailed information about my blue-front. Unfortunately this book seemed superficial, simplistic, and somewhat out-dated (with some information actually contrary to what is widely recommended now). It has some wonderful pictures, and fragments of useful species information, but overall I think there are better general care books available (certainly more detailed), and this book's Amazon-specific information was sketchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend this book for newbie owners of parrots","review":"Not enough information provided. Suggest investing in a better book with more details"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, and dangerous","review":"The book not only provides scant and outdated information, some of it is erroneous, and quite a part of it harmful. I am quoting the ones I can remember: amazons, like all parrots, do NOT need to be fed grit; not only cherry, but a lot of other types of fruit tree wood are poisonous to parrots, including apple and apricot; acorns and celery are both harmful to parrots, and should not be fed to them. All in all, this is a guide to quickly and painfully disposing of your pet, and ought to be avoided. I don't give it one star mainly because it has some pretty pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit in jack on iMac","review":"This device is a good idea, but, although advertised to work with iMacs, it doesn't. The end of the cable designed to attach the speakers is fine, but the other end does not fit in the jack in my iMac. I tried an adapter that I bought at Radio Shack, and it fit in the computer jack. But, the end of the cable wouldn't go far enough into the adapter to make the connection.I didn't return the cable because shipping would cost too much, and I was tired of the whole project.I did call Griffin Technology, the company that makes the cable, and I was told that they had not made the device for a long time. Maybe the thing will work with older iMacs?Don't order this cable unless you are sure it is compatible with your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"DiAnno keeps it going","review":"Well Paul DiAnno is one of the greatest singers in the world.

Its a very good album with very good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valley of the Shadow of Death","review":"This book was mind numbing. I believe historical books are supposed to have facts and information that is easy enough to comprehend. All that this book provided was the ramblings of colloquial dialog.

Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorite Books","review":"I must have re-read \\"A High Wind In Jamaica\\" at least a dozen times since first reading it in high school. It remains one of my favorite novels. It is a finely-drawn portrait of a certain era, but its depiction of the fears and fantasies inside the children's heads is timeless. Its humor, though definitely on the dark side, is first rate: there are passages that never fail to make me laugh out loud, despite the fact that I have read them many times before. The ending, however, is disquieting, and it is easy to see why this novel is often compared to \\"Lord of the Flies.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"I read this book not knowing a thing about it.

This book has a much more realistic human behavior theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly layered, disorienting, and strangely captivating...","review":"This is a dark and strange book, reminiscent of the much later magical realist style of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.I agree with Francine Prose's description of the book as a \\"profoundly disquieting meditation on the meaning of loyalty and betrayal, innocence and corruption, truth and deception.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"A very strange story, but intriguing.

The only thing keeping this from a 1 star book is the character Emily. She alone has creative and unique thoughts floating around in her head. I'm glad I read it because she amused me so much.

The flash portion is so limited, it took me a lot of time to find out the actionscript code in the entire book. The examples are total junk and not at all useful for commercial development. Whoever gave five stars either know the author personally or have not come across any other worthy book (such as Flash MX Professional 2004 for Server Geeks) which discusses much more on how to access database services than this hopeless book here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and Easy to Follow Examples","review":"This book is chocked full of great examples. The sample code alone is a VERY usefull and worth the money that the book costs.It's for the beginning and intermediate Flash and ADO.NET person alike.

Very complete resource.The complaints I see from other reviewers shows me their limited knoweledge of Flash, .NET, and Action Scripting and it's use it the real world.

Totally agree with the reviewer who criticized this book. Not worth buying at all. There are much better books on .NET. If you are looking for Flash programming look elsewhere. This book is a waste of time and money. Most of the database work is being done by .NET and Flash is used only to make do some silly poor quality graphics. It is indeed a misnomer. Dealing with databases, Flash and .NET is certainly not the authors' cup of tea. The author needs to gain more experience in Flash/Database before attempting to write another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freak Brothers comic","review":"Weird little comic book I must say.

The characterization is wonderful, sucking the reader right into the background landscape. It was a novel I couldn't put down. The main character was strong in spite of the male dominated society she lived in.The modern society watching over Riverworld and protecting it was a wonderful facet to the story, and how a powerful message therein.I loved this story and hope to see more like this from her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"The retail price listed on the tag ($88) is a fantasy price. These pants are not lined, a fact more noticeable given the thinness of the fabric. But they fit well. They are not as ridiculously generously cut for the size as some of the newer Jones of New York and Lauren by Ralph Lauren stuff (size is just a number but it is supposed to convery some consistency that is completely missing from the new clothing marketing framework).These pants are well worth Amazon's selling price ($17) but not the list price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Documentary of a Great Illustrator","review":"What an amazingly intimate portrait of one of the world's greatest illustrators. This documentary contains interviews, personal pictures and commentary by his peers and his family. Who would guess that the fantastical images he created came completely from his imagination. You get to see him actually sketch a feline creature in his signature style. Just him with a pencil and paper. BAM! There it is. This documentary portrays Frank as an unpretentious, hard working class guy with a tremendous amount of talent, and a bit of luck. I'm glad that I purchased this dvd and I think anyone who appreciates his art will like viewing this documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting","review":"If you're a fan of TGP and are wondering if this set is worth picking up, the answer is yes.

Junie has no fond feelings for the new baby -- a real kid might be ambivalent, but not uncaring like this awful depiction of a kid.There is a horrible scene that made me sick to my stomach, where a \\"cry-baby\\" (in Junie's words) boy proudly shows off his crickets in Show-and-Tell. They turn out to be dead, but he thinks they're sleeping. He shakes them and says \\"wake up\\" and they fall into pieces. He cries. Now this isn't depicted as a sad event -- the tone of the book is that it's a real knee slapper that this sensitive boy cries because his loved pets are crumbling into pieces before his eyes.Really, really awful stuff. For people so jaded by TV, where everyone's nasty, angry, and insensitive. Don't buy it for your untainted child -- let them have a few years where they can have true human feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junie B. Jones Little Monkey Business","review":"Junie B.

It won't help anyone to make or understand holograms - its science is confusing and wrong, its techniques are even more confusing and inadequate.As an editor of a holography book myself I declare an interest, but I would have been pleased to see a good book on the topic.

I have not read a better book! This book covers the A-Z of holography and is strongly recommended as an excellent reference book for the technical engineer's or hobbyist's bookshelf. In an extremely readable format, the author discusses the practical and theoretical aspects of holography and it's current manufacturing techniques.

I found this book so much more easier to read than the authorized biography, which weighs the reader down with Karen and Richard's love interests and Karen's insane battle with anorexia. I would have to say \\"Close to You\\" is the definitive Carpenters biography"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric narration of songs, concerts, and appearances.","review":"The subtitle of this book should be \\"The Story of the Music of Karen and Richard Carpenter.\\" The book does not tell the story of their lives, as the title suggests. It is obviously written by a fan who has done a lot of fact gathering from fan clubs, magazines, and album covers. Garcia goes into agonizing detail on the chart history of many Carpenters songs, and no detail on the real lives and circumstances in the lives of the Carpenters. The writing is amaturish. It would be considered an excellent school report, although he describes the sound of an alto flute as \\"picturesque\\" (you can't paint a picture of a sound). Garcia has also provided a lot of facts, in list form -- every song, album, concert, and public appearance made by (the) Carpenters. The illustrations included in this book however, are lovely.Overall, this was a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mental health","review":"This huge novel spans the careers of two pioneering psychiatrists, one French, one English, who meet as boys and eventually co-found a sanatorium in the mountains of Austria, until driven apart by professional disagreements and the outbreak of the first War. For the first 250 pages of this 600-page book, the story holds the interest with warm characters, fascinating settings, and the stirrings of romance. However, the long lectures and scientific papers that Faulks uses to demonstrate the growing differences between the two (one is a Freudian, the other a Darwinian) come to clog the book around the half-way point, and although the two men continue to develop in interesting ways as people, he loses the sense of linear narrative. But Faulks pulls it all together in the last hundred pages; always a magnificent war novelist (seeBIRDSONG, his masterpiece), his WW1 scenes appear almost as a lyrical interlude, with striking cathartic effect, and his final chapters have their own quiet beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanity more compelling than psychiatry","review":"This book had a lot going on at different levels - family stories, history of psychiatry, World War I - and more. It definitely would have benefited by tighter editing (e.g., removing some of the storylines that went nowhere, shortening the medical lectures and making them less pedantic). And some of the scientific suppositions are so prescient that they are not believable. But I was touched by the human side of the story. CAUTION, SPOILERS AHEAD. Having lost a child (though not in the manner of this book), the parents' sense of loss here brought me to tears. And the irony of a man who spent his life studying the human mind losing his, and being aware of his trajectory, was both heartbreaking and ironic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"Having read many of Faulks' novels, I was looking forward to reading Human Traces. It started well, but ultimately was a disappointment.Overall, there is something about the characters that is not quite 'real'. Whilst I was interested to know what happened, my interest was never quite full. There seemed to me to be random characters added for no reason other than to fill a few pages. The course of the story moved like a badly edited film, with long and short 'hops' in time that seemed to come at inopportune times in the narrative.Overall, for anyone interested in Faulks' work, I'd recommend Bird Song, Charlotte Gray, or the excellent Engleby before Human Traces."},{"rating":"1","title":"hh","review":"Vendor was prompt and professional.Item was clean and good value.Stultifying, slow moving, could not finish this tome.Not the Faulks that I know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your valuable reading time","review":"This is an endless, pointless, infuriating shambles of a book.

It is (italics, please) about stones. Very readable, good selection of info is clearly presented and doesn't lag. Has index; photos are charmingly black and white and include kids, an experiment with crystal forming, and even have a definite artistic feel. One star omitted because some kids do not appreciate a lack of color, and I think that some photos would have been more interesting in color in order to show contrast between different types of stones or nuances in the stones themselves.(For some strange reason the front and back covers are colorized.)

I read it to analyse patient-doctor relationship, from the point of view of discouse analysis, and it was useful. Still, as a language student, I suggest that all physicians or medical students read it so that they understand what it means to dedicate time to their patients, even if they work in huge hospitals, and to build a mutually trusted doc-patient relationship.Look forward to reading other readers' opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Meal/Snack Replacement!","review":"This is a very good product to drink as a snack to calm that sweet tooth craving (it tastes like chocolate milk) but is also very filling due tp the high protein content.

Although it's difficult to categorize what genre they belong to, I would call this french jazz, different from American Jazz in a certain lightness of voice, and more traditionally french instrumentation.The blissful and breezy \\"L'amour est un alcool\\" is a jazzy bistro tune, while \\"Dans tes Bras\\" is a circuslike tune that brings to mind the theme song from PeeWee's Playhouse.Swinging from introspection to making fun of themselves, this group shows their talent, without pigeonholing themselves, nor boring the listeners.If you like this album, also check out the Lullaby Baxter Trio, \\"Even Cowgirls get the Blues\\" or \\"Ingenue by K.d.Lang, and anything by Leni Stern."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY True Crime Books I Read!","review":"Although this is one of Ann Rule's first books, it is one of her best. She gives the background of her friendship with Ted Bundy -- and tells how she only gradually was convinced that he was the serial killer 3 states were searching for. She doesn't weight the book down with ALL the details of ALL the deaths (who really knows how many women he killed?), but we learn enough! I especially appreciated the updates at the end -- to tell us the final chapter in this wasted life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one IS the best","review":"I've read every Ann Rule book published, and this one beats them all. Every woman needs to read this book. I personally bought a copy to give to my 17 year old niece before she went to college because I felt so strongly that she needed to know that there are predators like Bundy out there in the world. Truely chilling and riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best there Is.","review":"Ann Rule is one of the premier true crime authors of our time, and this book is the best she has ever written. I first read this book when I was 12. and now, at 21, it has influenced me to pursue a career in the FBI, tracking horrible serial killers such as Bundy. Ann Rule is a terrific author, and this book is one that you will not or will not want to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"This is my first book by Ann Rule and my first real look at Ted Bundy. I had heard the stories and had watched a documentary about Ted, but nothing could have prepared me for this portrait of the killer. What is so scary for me is that I may have trusted him, may have tried to \\"help\\" him when he appeared with his arm or leg in a cast. Ann Rule does an excellent job of telling what must be for her, a difficult tale . Even though I found the book deeply disturbing, I think it is very well done. A definite page-turner, as well as an eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Ann Rule Book!","review":"It was many years ago that I first read Stranger Beside Me and the very first Ann Rule book that I had read. It really intrigued me and ever since then I have always wondered what makes people like this tick? I continue to read her books and have found them very hard to put down!!! I love her style of writing! ~~Sabrina Veley"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relative of a victim","review":"I have read this book several times since it was first released. It is very hard for me to read or watch anything about Ted Bundy since my cousin was his last victim. I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever heard of Ted Bundy. It is scary to think that this kind of thing can happen anywhere, anytime. Ann Rule shows you how you think you know someone but really not know them at all. Even though Bundy finally met his match, it's sad to think we will never know how many victims there really were and what kind of pain and horror they might have suffered. Too bad Bundy's life ended so quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Rule's Best Book","review":"As a true crime fan, I have read many books by countless authors. Ann Rule is the only author who has completely explained the proper definition of a serial killer.This book is a fascinating look into the human mind and a man, Ted Bundy. I would like to thank Ann for finally describing and telling this story.This is a must read for any psychology student and true crime lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"True crime masterpiece","review":"The Stranger Beside Me is the best true crime book I have ever read. However, it is also the most disturbing, so much so that more than once, I vowed not to finish it. Of course, I did finish it, and the story will probably stick with me for a while.The book is, for the most part, a chronological account of Ted Bundy's life. It's fascinating that the author was actually friends with Bundy before she knew he was a killer. The book is filled with devastating accounts of the crimes that he was accused and later convicted of. Rule also explores possibilities of how and when he became obsessed with murder. Interesting reading, but keep the lights on and the doors locked."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best true crime books ever","review":"If you have yet to read this book, I envy you. It was the first true-crime book I ever read, and remains one of the best to this day. Read this book at night, alone in the dark, and you will be terrified. But the book is very multi-dimensional. The victims are not treated as mere props, you will truly feel for them. Rule, a mature woman and former police officer, was taken in by Bundy's charming persona. Her gradual (and very reluctant) realization that he was a serial killer make an engrossing story. The lesson is that \\"charm\\" is not necessarily a god-given personal attribute, but could be the tool of a manipulative human predator. If this aspect of \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is of interest to you, try reading \\"The Gift of Fear\\" by Gavin DeBecker. It contains a lot of fascinating information on identifying the tactics of manipulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"Ann Rule captured the personalities of Ted Bundy. Great details of how they captured him. Better than the movie. Highly recommended if you are into true crime stories"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiped Me Out!","review":"OK, I thought I had lost my innocence years ago but I was wrong. I'm pretty sure that this book took whatever was left.I wasn't expecting to be surprised like this. That this person existed....that would be enough. That the author was an intimate friend, destined to become a true-crime writer and involved before Bundy was a suspect is just mind-blowing.I'm not exactly sure what this book did to me. It was largely at an unconscious level. And it was intense. I still find myself frequently drifting back to thoughts and feelings about the book.I recommend reading this when you think you have already figured everything out about who to trust...or if you are finding the world at all boring.or if you just want to read *THE* masterpiece of true crime. I don't think Mailer or Capote touches this."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can tell Ann Rule was Ted's friend","review":"This book was well written and researched. Ann Rule talked about Ted Bundy from the point of view of not only a concerned friend but a well informed crime writer. Good book, easy to read. Alot of information. This was actually the first true crime book that Ann Rule ever wrote. Pretty strange that it would be about her own friend that happen to be a serial killer. Which just shows that Ted was an intelligent man who was only inspired by other intelligent and well informed individuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling to say the least","review":"This book is amazing. Rule strings you along throughout, and not until the end does she even name Bundy as the actual killer. This book made me wake up in the night in a cold sweat and I still couldn't put it down. One knock. Although I realise its part of the story, I wasn't fond of the constant switchings into Ann's life. She might have been able to make the book without it; she might not have. Either way, this book will keep you reading until the last page...three times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best true crime books I've ever read!","review":"Ann Rule sees both sides of the coin--she tells the story about a friend who she worked with and socialized with. She also tells the story about a man who terrorized dozens of women, and received his just punishment. This friend/man was one in the same--Ted Bundy. You can feel Ann's trepidation as she discovers someone she likes and admires, is involved in some of the most heinous crimes in history. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"This is the first Ted Bundy book i've read, but i am impressed with the amount of information and detail i have learnt about him. At times, its a bit over the top when its to do with the author, but about Mr Bundy himself, its pretty good. I'd recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can not get into this book.","review":"I do not know what it is about Ann Rule's writing style , but i just can not seem to get caught up in her books. And i really want to read a book on Ted Bundy. I have picked this up more than once trying to get into it but it just seems to drag for me. However i would prefer that to the embellishment so many \\"true\\" crime writers seem to put into their books. One day i am going to force myself to read this and maybe i will feel differently once i get through the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"Far too sympathetic a portrayel of Ted Bundy. The book has a wistful what-might-have-been tone to it.Ms. Rule claims that Bundy walked on his own two feet to his execution. A report from the prison, perhaps published after Ms. Rule's book, said that his legs collapsed and he was carried to his death. It would be nice to know he felt even a fraction of the fear he gave his victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"Book is unbeliveable...no one would feel that way about a killer!!

If you are interested in Ted Bundy, or true crime in general, this is a very good book to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Rule - Not \\"Beside Ted\\"","review":"I did not enjoy this book - I felt that Ms. Rule WAS in love with Ted Bundy and the fact that he wanted everyone but her, scorned her in the end. She \\"had\\" a poor writing style there are extreme inconsistancies in her grammar - and she rambled for pages and pages about uninteresting topics and people related to law enforcement. I did not find her book insightful at all and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Bundy","review":"too much about ted bundy, not enough about the victims. countless books have been written about this bundy parasite and nothing written about the victims except their death. ann seems to be honering bundy for some stupid reason. she almost tries to make excuses for him"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Rule Got Lucky","review":"Ann Rule got lucky with this one in that she just happened to be associated with Ted Bundy when they worked together at a crisis clinic. If not for Bundy, Ann Rule would have gone nowhere as a writer. She has no sense of imagination or pace, and her books are always BORING! If you want to read a really great true crime author, read anything by Jack Olsen, may he rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This was my second Ann Rule book and it will not be my last! I was looking for something creepy yet interesting to read and I found it all in this book. I couldn't put it down for a week. If you like to read true cases this is the book for you, no doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great book","review":"This was a truly great book. Especially for me because I'm the type of the person who has to really get motivated by a book to continue to read it. The whole idea of tracking a serial killer and the killer ending up being your best friend is just an unbelievable plot. Also the setting never stayed the same, Ted Bundy was always on the run bringing us to different states and climates making the book very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Ann Rule and her most interesting true crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bedazzled by Bundy.","review":"The author's relationship with Bundy makes the book riveting; it's also its great shortcoming, as we are introduced to Bundy the charming scoundrel, rather than Bundy the monster. Ann Rule states that she would have gone for Bundy herself if she had been younger, or chosen him for her daughter if she had been older. Rule waxes eloquent about Bundy's attributes; he is brilliant, charming, handsome, dazzling, a prince among men, a star in the Republican firmament. Could such a beautiful man be all that bad, really? She was enthralled by him, and it certainly shows. It's a sad fact that we are seduced by outward appearances and charisma, rather than discerning the true character inside. Bundy was foul to the marrow, but he had a smile to die for. And many women did just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring...","review":"This is partly my fault because I was wanting a book more about Ted Bundy but instead got a book about the author and her feelings about him which I could care less about. Also, she seems to regard her relationship with Ted Bundy much more highly than it actually looks like it was. She think somehow that if she had the chance to talk to Bundy before the trial that he would have confessed to her. Please. Who is she kidding? And sending him money and worrying about him all after she found out that he was THE PRIME SUSPECT in these murders/rape is really weird. She thinks that she's different from those other women who were in love with Ted Bundy but she's just one of them herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"A well-written, from the heart book with a perspective only the author could have.

After reading this book I went and read all of his other books, that is how much I enjoyed this book. This is a \\"WOW\\" book. It has everything. Story after story and example after example. The references that he gives are not your typical examples, but rather some brilliantly selected issues that just makes you want to put the book down and go...\\"HUMMMM\\".

All the arrays start at 1 instead of 0 which makes the code useless the way it is written - user must modify it. No const attribute is ever used. And this is plain C so if you write a C++ code and hope for seeing exceptions or references, forget it. You are better off buying a book and writing routines you need based on the published code.

Nowhere even close. April is not a good VCA name like Heaven, Dawn, or Ruby. The titles did not make sense. April wasn't a real heroine. There were no horrible, dark secrets (her father's secret was laughable) and no real family secrets at all. This book focused a lot her stumbling (and unrealistic) explorations of her own sexuality.

April is a girl who finds herself in quite a few tragic and unpleasant situations, but not anything near the horror related in \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" or even more recent works like \\"Melody.\\" Sadly, V.C.

Let's see, a jealous 'relative' who dropped off their kid for someone else to raise coming back and raising cain? A lecherous boyfriend of this 'relative' who I somehow suspect will have something sexual to do with April. Sound familiar?Sadly, the most interesting character, Peter Smoke, was delegated to another stereotyped 'bad boyfriend' role.

The results have been generally good. The instructions are a bit spotty, and required some experimentation on my part. In particular, it does not appear to me that the iMic has a preamp, so it needs to be hooked up to my receiver's output. In addition, the software is also under-documented and took some trial and error. However, the overall process took only about 1-2 hours.More importantly, the results are quite good. I have digitized only a few tracks so far, but I am very impressed with the sound quality. Overall, I recommend this product; however, if you are clueless about audio hookups or fiddling with software, you may get a bit frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job","review":"Works great.

The people the young South Seas islander hero must outwit and outrun in order to return to his homeland are terrifying \\"blacks,\\" \\"savages,\\" \\"eaters-of-men.\\" This stereotyped characterization might have been acceptable to some in 1940, but society has since come to realize the harm it can cause to Black children's self-image and other children's attitudes toward Black people. To ethically introduce this book to a child requires either blacking out offending words (!) or prefacing and interspersing the reading with lessons in sociology and history, and even then, there's no assurance that damage won't be done.

Mafatu decides to face his greatest and deepest fear--the sea--and sets off on an adventure, ending up not only conquering his fear of the sea but successfully confronting such life-threatening challenges as a hammerhead shark, a sharp-tusked wild boar and, finally, angry man-eating islanders. It is the kind of story where just when you think things can't get worse, they do. But Mafatu finds out that he is able to overcome every challenge and returns to his home island in triumph.Mafatu's story should be required reading for children preparing to face a world every bit as dangerous as the open ocean and filled with hazards no less serious than sharks and cannibals."},{"rating":"2","title":"call it courage","review":"call it courage is one of the best books for any person who likes a good short book.The book is about a young boy named Mafatu his name maens stout heart.

Mafatu's only freinds where his dog and a bird. One day, to prove to every one that he could go in the ocean he went out on a canoe, but a storm came and he and his dog ended up on an island. This book is about this boy and his dog on the island and trying to get home. I did not like this book very much. It was not funny, and it didn't have much action. I also thought that the plot was pretty boring. It did have some good parts. This book would be good for you if you want to learn about the Polonesian native's culture.

After one of his best friends called him a coward he sets off on a journey for courage.During a storm his canoe is wrecked and he washes up on a mysterious island. For shelter he builds a hut of bamboo and in case he needs a quick get away he starts building another canoe.

I take tons of supplements and use magnets as well as the Q-ray ring/bracelet but this is the first item that seemed to immediately help decrease the pain in my joints. I'll have to see how it fairs as time goes by but if constantly wearing a rather ugly necklace is the price to pay, so be it.

If you like hearing Bob Dylan as a livestock auctioneer, maybe you will like this, but if you are looking for anything like Roger's album \\"Land of Pure Imagination\\" keep looking. I have never been so disappointed in a cd in all my life. This is horrible. The sound quality is also poor. I can't believe this is the same guy who did \\"Pure Imagination\\" . Also there is a lot of \\"language\\" - cuss words and such.This is by no means a commercial album - in case you are wondering.

Highly underrated. \\"Rapper's Reprise\\" with the Sequence (including the young Angie Stone) is not so hot, but the slower tunes \\"Passion Play,\\" \\"Bad News Don't Bother Me,\\" and \\"Here I Am\\" in particular, show that the gang were not half bad as singers.

Let's get started.First, the characters are so feeble and unsympathetic I foundmyself not caring what happened to them. From hobosexual Karlto mediocre Mary, and oh yes, Dot. Dot is a not-so-gentlereminder that the characters in some novels should be spayedor neutered before they get a chance to randomly breed. Thereare 2 characters of interest (Russell and Fleur), but theycontribute about 3 pages to this monstrosity of a book.I had to read this monumental waste for a literature class. Inormally like to read, but this book nearly beat the readingbug right out of me. Even if I had not been required to readit, I might have finished it anyway in the expectation thatsomething interesting would (finally) happen. Bad news, folks:it never does. The same utter pointlessness continues right onthrough the last page.I don't want to keep you hanging by a thread here, so let me getright to the point: This book is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthy characters, darkly humorous.","review":"From the beginning of the book you care about the characters and what will happen to them.

Wait, it can't end yet.&quot"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading. I was so disappointed in this novel. It did not meet my expectations. I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly. The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la \\"Weekend at Bernie's.\\" Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Determinedly bleak","review":"I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished \\"Beet Queen\\", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. \\"Beet Queen\\" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leese!","review":"This book is typical of a lot of the nothingness that is passing as literature these days. The characters are flat and emotionless, with minimal dialogue. I think the author must have written a bunch of absurd plot twists on bits of paper and pulled them out of a jar as she was writing. A mother abandons her children by jumping on a stunt plane at a fair. Two orphans get off a train, the boy sticks his face in a bush, gets attacked by a dog, jumps back on the train and doesn't see his sister for 20 years. The sister wakes up with her hands glowing blue. A guy is having a conversation, the suddenly starts jumping on the bed, flips off and breaks his back. Readers that think the metaphors are deep and meaningful are simply afraid to admit that they just DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE! Why is it so hard to find a simple, entertaining bit of fiction these days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People as tortured as the landscape","review":"Erdrich has that special touch, to make surreal situations so very believable. I love the parallel drawn with the plane rides, how in one case it is a beautiful woman running away from responsibility, and on the other it is a not-so-graceful woman running away from scorn.

But this book left me cold. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters or about the town. I felt that we were just given snippets over a period of time but no real continuity of any story. And the snippets we were given seemed to show everyone at their worst. About half way through, I just quit...too many good books out there to waste my time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered bits of people's mostly empty lives","review":"Written from several viewpoints that don't always make sense (sometimes unknown narrator, sometimes first person and known narrator),this books jumps from one bit of a person's life to another, with little about each one.I kept reading it because I hoped to learn something about North Dakota, and I did, a little, but not much; and I kept hoping it would get more interesting and complete, but it didn't.It is sort of like a photo album with a few notes under the photos, but no real story,other than that most of the characters continue to make bad choices, even when they know they are doing it.There is a lot of anger, fear, disgust, loss,fatigue, cold, resentment, and very little love, comfort, humor, support, warmth, or respect; just another story about mostly meaningless lives with very little resolution.Disappointing, and makes me very glad to not live in that kind of community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a laugh on the entire cd","review":"The only thing funny about this cd is the title.

There was one image in the book that was o.k. and the photographer even said it was not planned, he just tripped the shutter as the subjects were playing around. The shots that he staged and set up are just terrible. I will stick with getting information and inspiration from \\"Hollywood Portraits: Classic Shots and How to Take Them\\" by Roger Hicks and Christopher Nisperos and also \\"Fine Art Children's Photography: Techniques and Images in Black & White\\" by Doris Carol Doyle.

I'm sure if I actually understood the language better, I might actually get some of these jokes.But, mainly, I watched it for the truly bodacious Grace Renat, who looks like a brunette Loni Anderson, except with (believe it or not) even bigger boobs.

This was the next one I read (out of sequence, I know), and in the wake of her debut... so disappointing. The title is misleading, the pace is slow, the ending fails to satisfy. So much of the story seems like filler for an uninspired plot.Moreover, Faith evolves in this installment into a shallow character even as Page tries to make her dynamic. As a mother of 2 myself I was hoping to find a food snob who could juggle it all, but instead I met a mother whose primary objective seems to be to find other places for her children to be so that she can better indulge in reading a diary she finds and shares with the reader (more filler).I thought this was a strategy similar to moving Jessica Fletcher to teach on a city campus in NY, but Page departs from more than the village of Aleford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book!","review":"I love this series, Faith is a wonderful character and never gets stale for me. This book appealed to me because it dealt more with relationships and didn't have a boring subplot as did The Body in the Lighthouse. I was intrigued with Faith's range of emotions about Richard and Tom and enjoyed reading the diary entries of Dora. Without giving too much away, there is a twist in this book regarding the title that differs from previous Faith Fairchild mysteries, I was a bit confused until I was about 2/3 through the book. Personally, I wish Tom wasn't such a stick in the mud, Faith seems too young and vibrant to be with him. Also, Faith must have amazing metabolism as she eats her way through this whole book and never seems to have to work it off. This is a nice, light mystery and a quick read. I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Aquarist's Bible for Livebearers","review":"All of the Aqualog books are excellent value, although they are not particularly cheap. They are full to the brim with first class colour photographs and to reproduce these in a book is an expensive process. Whether they are about the beautiful Livebearers, new strains of which are coming into the aquarist trade or in this case arguably the most beautiful freshwater tropical fish species, they are the most comprehensive identification books you can buy. They never become dated because as new fish become available to the aquarist trade the books are updated. There is plenty of literature on Livebearers but none better than this.Normally the books do not really deal with the basics of fish keeping, there are many and varied books that do that. They are in the main a fish identification encyclopaedia. But for those aquarists who are particularly interested in a single species or group of fish they are indispensable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Me want to Gamble","review":"This book is awsome.

I didn't see Uston mentioned once in the book, whic is odd, especially in the tehcnical appendix by the team leader. If you like these kind of stories, you might want to try and find the Eudemonic pie (Thomas Bass, The Eudemonic Pie (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1985)) which is out of print and is again supposedly a true story about some santa cruz students who built embedded wireless roulette prediction computers that they mounted in their shoes.

For example, the author states that their betting system was developed by MIT students in the mid 90s. However, this exact system was described by blackjack expert Ken Uston in his 1992 book \\"Million Dollar Blackjack\\". Uston states that he used his system throughout the 70s and 80s to make millions of dollars. Additionally, the author's melodramatic tone becomes annoying after the first half dozen pages.

It just reads like it. This is what defines the term \\"page-turner.\\" You just won't be able to put it down. I seriously doubt if this will ever be made into a film, considering the subject matter and how Vegas investors most likely have ties to the entertainment industry; but, it would make a GREAT suspense/action thriller. No, I take that back: it IS a great suspense/action thriller. My only beef, if I had to have one, is the somewhat weak ending.

Reading it makes me regret that I never had the opportunity to do the same thing.The book did have some problems though; I found the way that the author liked to intersperse the book with chapters from the present to be somewhat annoying. For example, there is a chapter where the author (and not the protagonists) interview a security official at a casino, to have him describe their \\"card counter countermeasures\\". The author was trying to foreshadow and build up the suspense, but I found it to be filler. That particular chapter should have been in the appendix, in my opinion. Sure there was some backgrounder information in such chapters, but that could have been a foreword."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put the book down","review":"This is a great book that will keep you reading it until the end.

It walks you through the events as seen by one of the kids, how he got into it, what he did to stay in it, how he played blackjack with NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and how he ultimately was forced out of the action. Anyone who has ever gone to Vegas has dreamed about winning big, what these people did was amazing and even more amazingly it was legal!

Still, I am recommending the book. It won't necessarily add to your body of knowledge, but it will keep your interest.

My favorite part in the book is when they go gambling at Moheagan sun in conneticut. I really think this novel will make you want to go to Vegas and play blackjack.

His writing is lazy, unconsidered, and is absolutely RANK with the smell of embellishement and outright fabrication. There's simply no way to take writing this atrocious seriously; the fabrications and embellishments are so transparent, the mind boggles at how he got this sold as non-fiction.One last note: Mezrich never states that he changed names or places to protect anyone. According to the book, the protagonist was in the Weston, MA public school system until high school. I was in the Weston public school system at the same time; in fact, according to the chronology, Mr. Lewis was either in my class or the one below me. I have the yearbooks from Mr. Lewis' last years at Weston. He's not in any of them, not anywhere. If Mezrich changed his name, fair enough. If not, who on earth is this guy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS BOOK!","review":"Be prepared to lose some sleep after you open this book. It's the engrossing story of how a small band of MIT students managed to work as a team playing Blackjack and win $3 million plus from Casino's in Vegas. While the students did nothing illegal it becomes very obvious that the Casinos were less than amused with the student's success. The stories of what the Casinos did to try and stop the students ring true and may discourage a reader from learning how to count cards. Congrats to the students for using their smarts in an innovative way. Would have given the book five stars but the authors need to ingratiate himself into the story was annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best on the subject","review":"This book was mostly fiction. The MIT students did succeed in counting cards successfully but the author embellished the story to the point of fiction in many cases. Nevertheless, it is fairly interesting as a light read although not very well-written. For a much more interesting look at card counting read another book called \\"Striking It Rich: Golf in the Kingdom with Generals, Patients amd Pros\\". I enjoyed this book immensely. It was written by an MIT grad who actually did the card counting and it shows. It is also about MIT and medicine (the guy is now a plastic surgeon) and golf (he is a pro golfer also) but the chapter on his former life as a card counter is fascinating and much more informative that BDTH."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast read","review":"great book. fast read. lots of action, the story never slows down. i would recommend this book to anyone. i could not put it down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this because it is such a fascinating story. What I got was just a fluffed up movie script without any character development. I don't even really care how much of it is fiction/nonfiction, but the book is just so shallow, it's sometimes hard to keep track of all the characters. At times there are names mentioned in passing, who are apparently part of the \\"team\\", but I have no idea who they are.\\"Kevin Lewis\\" is a likable protagonist, but due to the lack of character development, I began to stop caring about him towards the end of the book. Part of the joy of reading books that are turned into movies is getting more insight in the people behind the characters. The deeper you dig into each individual person, the chances are an engrossing back story is there. The author just didn't bother to take the time to do this and it hurt the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great Story! keeps you intrigued on what happens next and how they beat the house! highly recomended"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Night's reading","review":"This is a fun book. You don't particularly get the feeling the author had to work that hard, although it sounds like he had a few scary moments of his own. This is light reading, but worth devoting a night to, just for the excitement of wondering if they were ever going to get caught. Doesnt really approach the topic from all sides, really just the MIT students viewpoint. I didn't see any quotes from the so-called goons or anything. If you can't get to the casino to play some black jack, the next best thing I guess. Can't believe they made that much money, even with their system. Could identify with the guy who lost two hands in row for $50K, probably happened more often than admitted in this book. Okay though."},{"rating":"2","title":"BASED ON a true story","review":"This book is a DRAMATIZATION of events that actually happened; it's not a detached documentary. That said, it is a very good dramatization. The author obviously embelishes, at least on the details (many of which are not at all the kind that would be conveyed in an interview, and many of which are based on hearsay within hearsay), but even if this were pure fiction it would be enjoyable to read. Although it is impossible to know to what extent the basic story it true, it sounds plausible enough that one believes it could happen.It's written in a casual manner, so you don't have to be highly educated to understand the language, and this style works for the subject matter.I listened to the audiobook version, and the reader was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Gamblers Dream","review":"Read this book in 2 days.

The gaming action, the description of casino security and other anecdotal evidence points to a juvenile thriller in the making. The best part of the book is the description of the noodle heads getting the living crap kicked out of them by a couple of goons sent to the Caribean by the evil empire of casino owners. I've never wanted the \\"hero\\" to take a fall so badly in my life, and I love beating casinos for big wins. I'm just guessing, but somewhere between 10 and 50% of this book never happened, and the stuff that did happen is fairly boring. Don't doubt that card counting works, but do question how a tribe of skinny dweebs from a math college got past the Vegas casinos systems for so much cash. Pure drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of being lied to","review":"Looks like Ben Mezrich can join the ranks of James Frey, Dave Pelzer and Kathy O'Beirne, who write fiction but call it non-fiction. After reading this book I decided to do some online research. Didn't take long to find this comment in Wikipedia \\"In 2008, Boston magazine and The Boston Globe investigated the accuracy of Mezrich's non-fiction, identifying occasions in his blackjack books where scenes were invented out of whole cloth.\\" Very disappointing to discover another best seller that is so fabricated yet purports to be telling the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegas Baby Vegas","review":"If you've ever seen the movie Swingers, thats all I kept thinking about.

Aside from the gambling 'strategy' that is obviously the subject of the book, it is good reading on how Vegas works - no, how it REALLY works.A quick read, I read all but the last 4 chapters on my flight from Boston to Dallas and it made me wish I was better at numbers so I could hop on a flight to Vegas and try out what I'd read.A great book about Vegas - I hope someone turns it into a movie because it would really be exciting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Page Turner, and That's the Good News","review":"After having read Mr. Mezrich's \\"Burning Down the House\\" I feel that I could go down to Atlantic City and make a killing at the blackjack tables. (Yes, I know, a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.) At the same time, I also do not feel that I learned very much about human character, or, for that matter, even the characters in this book. The story suggests that we are going to learn about \\"six\\" M.I.T. students, but it really only focuses on one - and, even that character, we truly do not get to know. I can't argue that this was not a fun story to read (though at times it became repetitive, even predictable), but it was also as disposable as a magazine article - and from a second-rung magazine (i.e. People, Sports Illustrated) at best. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, but a bit too much...","review":"I loved the book! Being a lover of gambling, and blackjack in particular, it was jsut a FUN book. Despite that it is based on true events, I have little doubt that it is written in a very melodramatic way and greatly exaggerated at parts. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.

This is apparently fact that reads like fiction and will catch up the reader in the story of how some kids from MIT learned card counting and how to hit a big time casino as a team, each with their own roles and walk out with millions, over time. Black Jack is the only gambling game played in casinos where it is possible to gain an edge on the house. The explanation of card counting gets a little thick for me, but then I didn't go to MIT. Of course, it is not all roses for as the team gets more successful the casinos fight back.

This was inventedover thirty years ago. They played in teams. Again,a lot of people have done this. I believe this was alsodone in the seventies. They got caught. Not evidenceof great skill there.

The book was finished by the time I landed at Dulles. I have a 14 year-old math wiz that I can see being drawn into the high stakes game. For Ben Mezrich's first outing in non-fiction, I feel he did a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, quick read","review":"This is a book that you can finish in a few hours prior (or enroute?) to your next trip to Vegas. It covers the story of a team from MIT that (for a time) beat the house in Vegas and other casinos.It's a lively adventure that explains the techniques used in an easy to understand manner. It also covered why these might not be valid anymore. For a book that's about \\"beating\\" the system, it accurately captures the reality that eventually the casinos always catch up.Not fine art or higher literature, but a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, poorly done","review":"After reading an excerpt in Wired magazine, I excitedly ordered \\"Bringing Down the House\\". Overall, it's a great story: supergenius kids living a rockstar lifestyle in Vegas, but unfortunately Ben Mezrich (author) comes up short. This is his first attempt at non-fiction, and it shows. Some flashes of actual interviews and unfabricated dialogues appear throughout the work, but it left me disappointed in the end.

Whenever Mezrich writes about something where I have personal knowledge, he seems to be fabricating information. This applies even to simple stuff, e.g., he talks about people \\"graduating from MIT with honors\\", something that is possible at Harvard, where he studied (one hopes he did not study journalism or factual research there), but not possible at MIT. He talks about some of his characters being MIT engineering majors and being elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society, whose own Web site states clearly that \\"To be eligible for election, students must have pursued a broad program of study in the liberal arts and sciences\\" (i.e., engineers are not eligible).Mezrich and his publisher get many facts wrong that they could have easily checked with Google and Wikipedia.

Finda broker who can say that.\\" Leaving aside the fact that their ownnumbers of hands played, bet sizes and edge would imply a farhigher return than this, anyone with a basic understandingof finance was making a bigger return than this in the midnineties.

Anyone who has ever lost in a casino will appreciate seeing the house get taken, particularly as a result of their deep-seated prejudices.Most of the critics are off base and don't know jack about blackjack. For example, the reason they exceed the 1-5% advantage of most counters is that they only play when the deck is rich, whereas most counters must play whether the deck is rich or poor.

I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in gambling, short of compulsive gamblers who would take this to heart. Readers also need to keep in mind that this 'stunt' (for lack of a better term) was a highly organized team of very smart students who practiced religously.

The grips are comfy (and have never fallen off), it punches through a few pieces of paper smoothly, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE that it catches the punches instead of dropping them all over my floor (I then save those for the kids to use wherever their artisitc creativity takes them).

I suggest that Amazon put a large warning message on this product to let shoppers know prior to purchase that this is not \\"Original Sweet & Spicy\\" Good Earth. The original tea doesn't have artificial flavors in it. Also, I looked online, and this company has very suspect practices. The 18-bag box of tea has artificial flavors in it, but the 25-bag box does not. I don't trust the tea maker, and their business practices are creepy.

I have cancelled my subscription - in the past 3 shipments, there have been so few good bags I can count them on one hand. The rest well, frankly taste like crap.

LIke other reviewers, I compared ingredients and found: artifical flavor (instead of natural), papaya leaves (instead of papaya), rooibos (instead of red rooibos), panax ginseng leaves (instead of panax ginseng). The tea Good Earth is now selling is flavorless and flat. I noticed it right away from the very 1st cup. My husband, who adores cinammon, also noticed a significant change in flavor.

In almost all of the tea bags in ALL of the boxes, you saw that the tag, instead of being plain paper, had a shimmery, strong smelling substance on it that rubbed off on the tea bag. I choked through the tea, not wanting to waste it, but ultimately, I just don't like it anymore. This is definitely the \\"artificial\\" part of the tea, and it just doesn't taste the same anymore.

Many of my peers would walk by and a bag would end up in their cold, tired hands as they headed for the hot water tap.Then I ran out and bought more boxes.So. Disappointing.Now, it takes two bags to achieve about 50% of the flavoring that one bag would achieve. There's now a watery, dirty taste to the tea.Unfortunately, what used to be a tea worthy of 5 stars has now dropped to 1. Maybe. Can we do less? So sad.The search for a replacement is on.

This stuff does not taste like tea at all. It is REALLY sweet (not sure how, there is no sugar or artificial sweeteners). Its as if they just grind up a bunch of cinnamon and put it in a tea bag.If you notice, most positive reviews here are from people who do not like tea normally.

On the website, \\"Natural Flavor\\" is the third ingredient. On the boxes I received \\"Artificial Flavor\\" is the third ingredient!Good Earth was recently purchased by the Tata Beverage Group. Apparently they have chosen to enhance their profit on what used to be a quality, 100% Natural product by using inferior ingredients. I'm sure as educated consumers become aware of this change, this item will rapidly drop from it's #2 selling position at Amazon. As always, Amazon's customer servicewas excellent.

It has been my favorite herbal tea for as long as I can remember, and I traditionally have a cup after dinner. When Costco stopped carrying a few months ago, I turned to Amazon and got six boxes in one order. Big mistake. Since the manufacturer has changed hands and the box went from light brown to purple, the tea also got seriously degraded. The difference is astounding, as I still have old tea bags from the last manufacturer and was able to directly compare. There is a distant hint of the old flavor that I pine for each time I take a sip, but what I am mostly met with is a harsh and unappealing flavor, and the longer it brews it just gets grosser rather than sweeter and spicier. It's tough to explain in words this distinct difference in flavor but trust me, it's disappointing. It is no longer the Good Earth that we all know and love so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial sweetener most likely Splenda.","review":"This is a super sweet tea that tastes like you're sucking on a \\"red hot\\" candy. Because none of the ingredients listed on the box are themselves super sweet, my best guess is that the \\"artificial flavor\\"/AF listed on the box is Splenda.If the AF was Stevia, they wouldn't need an AF disclaimer because it is natural ingredient; if it contained the other two artificial sweeteners in the pink and blue packets, they would have to include a PKU disclaimer on the box, which they do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it used to be","review":"I have enjoyed this tea for 25 years. Something changed at some point. Recently reading the ingredient list I noticed the second ingredient is \\"Natural Flavor\\". What is it? I wrote to the company and received a pat answer that it is a 'proprietary blend' and they can not divulge the actual ingredients except to your enquiring physician. It could be that it is just an ordinary flavor enhancing recipe similar to MSG or it could be worse. Might our bodies think it unnatural? Do they mean 'natural' as in from planet earth?

I lived in a northern California town where there was a Good Earth Restaurant. I first had their tea there. It was like no other tea in the world!!! The new Good Earth Tea has artificial ingredients which really alter the flavor! I've read other reviews that say the non-caffine blend has no artificial flavors, I haven't tried it, but will soon, as I miss the old caffeinated one. Maybe I can make a pot and add a couple of black tea bags to the mix if I need to wake up. Anyway, it is very sad to see a quality, one of the kind item altered when it is acquired by a new company, who is trying to save money. How does that work anyway? You lose the old loyal customers and probably gain few new ones as they won't like the taste of the cheap, altered product either.

The last time I order it was a little different but I could still drink it. Now it's not the same at all and I'm so disappointed. It's not even drinkable. I'm going to contact the company to see if they can do anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Good Earth tea","review":"The Good Earth Sweet and Spicy tea used to be my favorite tea- it was naturally sweet so I never had to add any sugar or honey. However, after receiving my current shipment of tea, I noticed that the taste was significantly different than the taste I was used to- the tea just didn't taste very good at all. I couldn't figure out why until I read some recent Amazon reviews mentioning that Good Earth was recently purchased by another company, which must be using inferior ingredients. Such a shame. I appreciate Amazon's great customer service- I received a full refund- but unfortunately had to cancel my subscribe and save subscription. I hope this inferior Good Earth tea will receive many complaints which will lead the new parent company to go back to the original ingredients for the tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to see it go!","review":"I have been drinking and loving Good Earth Tea for years. I make it cold in the summer and hot in the winter... everyday! I ordered a case from Amazon last week and upon opening the first bag, I knew something was wrong from the smell but tried it anyway. It was horrible. I called Amazon and as always, they were wonderful about refunding my money. Then I called Good Earth and found out they changed the ingredients and some boxes are the old flavor and some are not. They said they now have 3 blends. Well, I can't begin to figure out which one I am getting so I am onto trying other types of tea! So it's been lovely but no more Good Earth tea for me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the original","review":"I have been a drinker of the original Good Earth Tea for some time now and when I saw that Amazon had it I was thrilled. I noticed that the box was different from what I had been using but it said it was the original blend so I went ahead and bought it. I just had a drink of it and poured it out. It was awful, nothing like what I have been buying. I'm so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet without sugar?","review":"I've now \\"subscribed\\" to get this stuff replaced every few months because I go through it so quickly.

I'm loving it for Christmas, though to be honest I drink it all year round."},{"rating":"2","title":"L.O.V.E. this tea","review":"This is my favorite tea. It's got a natural sweetness to it that beats any sweet tea I've had. I use it to make ice tea most of the time. Great price on Amazon too!Update: I don't understand why the 18 pack boxes have artificial ingredients listed, and the 25 pack has natural ingredients. What's up with that???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too sweet and concentrated!","review":"I tried Madagascar vanilla red by Celestial which also contains Rooibos. So I thought I'd give this a try due to the great reviews. First impression tea is way too sweet and can't wrap my mind around what ingredient causes this sweet taste. If you like your tea very sweet and concentrated then this is the one for you. After trying both teas hands down Madagascar Vanilla Red is way tastier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Tea","review":"It is evening. The chill in the air is bighting my toes. I desire something sweet, spicey, and warm. Not wanting to add to the holiday caleries, I choose tea. The warm speicey taste is perfect. You can add honey or milk, but it is perfect just the way it brews. I am heating the water now. Can't wait for the welcome wistle. Try it, I think you will fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Earth Original Tea.","review":"I drink this tea first thing every morning. If it isn't available, I'm cross--my day is incomplete. It is spicy enough, but not too much, and there is just enough caffeine, but not too much. It is sweet, but not too sweet, and often I just go out without my cup of black tea to follow, and I don't miss it. It's as good as it has to be! I order enough at Amazon to get the free shipping, usually about 3 months' worth. I don't have to worry about running out, or finding it again. I've had good luck with Amazon products: mostly I order tape recorders and DVDs and books. All arrive in a few days, and I've never had to send anything back. And it's easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"spicy sweet","review":"Tastes as wonderful as it smells, cinnamony. I drink it every day at work. It is delightful. It is a very happy tea.

This is the PERFECT tea to warm you up as temperatures drop. Bummed that the 25-count box isn't available to us AmazonPrime members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Earth Tea","review":"I like this tea quite a bit, one of the few drinks that require no sugar to make it more drinkable. Was dismayed when the local Seattle retailers decided that they could charge premium prices for Good Teas, so Amazon to the rescue with more reasonable pricing. Seattle runs on caffeine but I like to take a break now and then and this tea fits the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tea","review":"This is a very interesting tea because it requires no sugar.

Good Earth tea is naturally sweet and spicy, delicious -- but the case I ordered from Amazon.com is tasteless, like drinking a cup of plain hot water! I noticed that the freshness date is still good, but I also noticed that the papers attached to the tea bag strings are dark and sticky. I think that this case of tea was not stored properly, and perhaps it was exposed to too much dampness or climate change? The little paper labels, which each have a unique inspirational verse, were almost illegible. Unfortunately I can't return the tea, so I think I will let the Good Earth tea manufacturers know about it. Perhaps it was an error made on the part of the manufacturers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"This tea is delightful! Sweet cinnamon dominates.

I order twelve boxes of it, and love this tea, and plan on order more in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Taste has changed","review":"I have been getting the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Caffeine-Free tea for several months now on a subscription (pack of 6), and usually drink two to three tea bags a night. I don't know when they changed the tea to include 'Natural and Artificial' flavors, but the taste of the tea I got in July has totally changed for the worse, and I can't drink it! The only way I can describe the way it tastes is that it reminds me of burnt wiring. I opened up a second box (of the six) and tried one of tea bags in that box, and it's the same thing: it's undrinkable.I am really bummed out, because it was my favorite tea. Unfortunately, it can't be returned, so I've got boxes of the tea that I can't drink.I may try a box of the Organic Caffeine-Free version, but from the reviews it doesn't sound like it's got as much flavor as the Original blend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be excellent, formula changed","review":"This used to be my favorite tea, but the formula has changed. I've heard that if you can find the tea in the original pale yellow box, that it is still the old (good tasting) formula. Read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info (and notice the dates on the reviews, good and bad). It used to taste like a liquid fireball candy, now it tastes like hot water with black pepper."},{"rating":"1","title":"More on \\"not natural\\"","review":"I purchased organic Good Earth (at a \\"whole foods\\" type of store) but not in the packaging shown. I was disappointed in the flavor because it just seemed as though it used to be so much immediately spicy and flavorful and sweet. Then I saw this package in another store and purchased it. When I tried it I found it was more like what I had been expecting. I compared ingredients between the two boxes. Lo and behold the tea in the package shown had \\"artificial flavor\\" as ingredient #3!! Wow! So that was the ingredient that made it so appealing. I had never read the label on the old Good Earth that I was so \\"addicted\\" to!! Needless to say, I am just fine drinking the organic Good Earth with all natural ingredients.

Not any more. I don't know what changed but I ended up dumping most of every cup down the drain. Headed out today to find a new tea. Very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"My order from amazon had bitter flavor","review":"I won't buy this again from Amazon. I don't know if it was cooked or old in the warehouse or something else, but this was bitter and undrinkable, and completely unlike what I get in the store. At first I thought I had a bad box so I tried bags from the other boxes in the shipment, but they were bad, too. I had to throw out 5 of the 6 boxes I bought.I am a very big fan of this type of tea and have been drinking several cups a day for years. After buying it from Amazon I was worried the manufacturing had changed altogether, but I bought a box at the grocery store to check, and it was still good (though the flavor was not as strong as it was in the past). Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Usually Not A Black Metal Fan","review":"Emperor, Opeth, Katatonia...none of these bands do anything for me. I am an avid listener of all types of darker music...but for some reason black metal always seemed like machine-gun snares, jackhammer riffs, and screechy vocals. Not the case with Cradle of Filth. Their album's darkly erotic melodies make it (to use a cliche) \\"good to be bad.\\" The soundscapes presented can best be seen on Malice Through The Looking Glass, Dusk + Her Embrace, and Funeral In Carpathia. Hands down the highlight of the album is the opening riff in Malice Through... Though Emperor's screechy vocals have always rubbed me wrong, they're much cleaner sounding with CoF, and go along perfectly with the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLEAN, GOOD HOME MADE...WAIT A MINUTE!","review":"If you have any sense at all, you would drop every black metal cd you ever have and get this cd. this has to be the best black metal album ever produced. if you listened closely, you will notice that amount of tracks they have able to cram into every song. KIT WOLVEN and COF really did it with this album. you will not regret buying this cd.1st time listeners may be put off by the album's epic grand style of music but it grows on you.to all that dissed dani's vocal...well...maybe you guys should listen to metallica?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Gothic/Metal albums ever to come out of Europe.","review":"This British based band's third album is a blend of Gothic and Metal. Heavy with vampyric overtones and orchastral tracks it will send shivers up your spine and leave you wanting more. If you like this \\"Cruelty and the Beast\\", their fourth album will drive you insane, with the entire album focusing on Elizabeth Bathory, going into graphic details about her crazed 16th century life. You would swear that this band has been to Hell and came back to share it with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT Black Metal","review":"IF you want great epic black metal go take a look at Burzum or Satyricon.What we have here tho is what to me sounds like extreme gothic music with black metal influences. And my gosh is this a great combination.A friend of mine said that Dani's considered the most talented rock vocalist in the world and I agree. He can do amazing things with his voice. And no, the screeching doesn't bother me at all. It sounds like a true man or demon in agony.What I like about this CD is that it sounds really epic and romantic. I love the keyboard melodies. They compliment the atmosphere the guitar riffs set. Brutal yet strangely beautiful in a really twisted way.Visions of castles in the fog and werewolves howling in dark woods come to mind when I play this.This strange fusion of gothic romance and extreme music takes some getting used to but once the darkness and desolation penetrates your soul it will be etched on your brain forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for scaring off crows","review":"This cd has its good points and its bad points. Good points are the skill of the musicians; the gothic themes sounded good what I could hear of it---then there is the bad, and it ruins the album, the singer sounds like someome has put his nuts in a vice and is squeezing them. or it sounds like a cat that has been thrown in a bonfire. There is low growls that don't sound too bad, but the high screeching noise the singer makes ruins this ablbum. There is a female reciting poitry!!! Why dosen't she sing, it may have saved this horror, I would recomend this cd to the military to use as a torture device for prisoners"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"After hearing so much hype about this Cradle of Filth band, I decided to download this album off the internet. Man, was I glad I didn't buy it.First of all, let me state that I am usually very open of any metal record. Heavy Metal is one of my favorite genres of music, along with classical and progressive rock. Anyways, when I first heard this cd, I actually liked the guitar riffs and growling vocals. However, the high pitched screeching was a MAJOR turnoff. It sounded terrible with the rest of the music and drove me insane. Also, I'm not big on the lyrics. I'm really not into that whole vampire thing.Recommended if you enjoy hissing vocals and a gothic image. For better extreme metal, I'd check out Opeth or Children of Bodom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrics that spoil a really good sound","review":"To be blunt this album is really, really not that good. I do however think that the music is good, I'm afraid the lyrics just ruin what could be a really good sound. The lyrics are sung in a high pitched, and really quite silly way, they ruin the backing of the other band members. If you are a hard core Cradle of Filth fan by this album now, it is just more of the same, you'll love it. It's just this album really isn't my thing. If your not a hard core fan, only buy this to annoy everyone in your street, or buy it for a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most overrated band on earth","review":"Put this into your mind: CoF is not black metal, never was and never will be. This is heavy metal dressed as black metal. Think Judas Priest or Iron Maiden turned gothic, disguised in black leather with pseudo corpse paint. Clowns and rip-off artists. How many albums can you put out to please the fans (Ha!) so you can cash in the money? False, false, false! Everything on this album spells fake, from Dani's stupid screeching to the Oh so Gothic keyboard intros... This is not art: this is showbusiness. They are the Celine Dion of metal. I threw this CD in the recycling bin. Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust and lack of talent","review":"I bought this album because I was bored and it looked like some kind of Type O Negative knock off. I'm always up for something new so off I went to go play it. I had heard alot about this band in the past, not ever about the style of music though, mainly about their t-shirts. Now I can see why. The music is your typical romp through the typical metal forest and the vocals are beyond bad on the ears.Ok, so maybe they'll have good lyrics I thought. Um, no. The lyrics were beyond shallow and cliche. It was the typical \\"oo satan satan\\". King Diamond did this and it wasn't impressive when he did it. This cd is just your typical romp through mediocre metal and horrible written lyrics and for a bonus they have a vocalist who needs to take some lessons.If metal is your thing though, you may like the structure of the music, it isn't horrible if you aren't looking for anything fresh and you like the whole \\"heard it before\\" thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather listen to pigeons being tortured","review":"This band is a complete joke. Dani Filth's vocals are so ridiculous I can't believe anyone is taking this music seriously - he sounds like a bird being tortured to death. And I am speaking as a doom/black metal fan who considers My Dying Bride to exemplify the best of the genre.Even putting the cartoonish vocals aside, CoF is inferior in every other way as well. The tracks themselves are repetitive and lack interesting hooks. And you don't get a feel that CoF knows how to develop the atmosphere around a song like MDB does.In other words, garbage. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I seen the cover, I was very impressed, song titles did draw me to buy the cd, but my God, how could anyone stand that screaching, I was impressed by the guitar work, but like most metal today, has anyone forgoten how to SING, it was the worst 20 bucks I have ever spent, not inspiring at all, I wouldnt recomend this album to a friend or an emeny, well maybe an enemy, if they could endure the pain of listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhh not black metal","review":"Real Black Metal = Bathory, Immortal, Satyricon, Darkthrone, Dark Funeral, Mayhem, Emperor, etc...Cradle Of Filth = MTV Black Metal Wanna-bes.A Gothic Romance?hah"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't go lower than 1 star?","review":"Get this piece of trash away from me.

If not, puh-leeze. I kept waiting to hear the words \\"I'll get you my pretty...and your little dog too.\\" In fact, 45 Grave (and I suppose, The Misfits and Samhain) pulled off this type of \\"joke\\" better, albeit with slightly less musical sophistication...I will however say this about this release: musically, the craftmanship is pretty decent. Otherwise, try to avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best black metal albums ever","review":"First things first I have to say Dani Filth's vocals on this CD are SICK. The high pitched voice he manages to make is crazy and it sounds really evil. The songs on this album are all long, well orchestrated songs with excellent melody and keyboards. Very melodic, and evil and at times actually pretty heavy. Best songs are \\"Heaven Torn Asunder\\", and \\"Gothic Romance (red roses for the Devil's Whore\\".

BUY THIS DISC NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dani the screech owl","review":"The first Crdale of Filth song I ever heard was Funeral in Carpathia and I fell in love with their music. Dani's screechy screaming is like no other on this album. The atmosphere and the vocal stylings of Sarah Jezebel Deva with the talents of the band make this a 5 star album. Personally I prefer Martin over any of their keyboardist but Damien fits in just right for this album. Ofcourse Stuart Anstis was COF's best guitarist and he outdone himself on Dush and her Embrace. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"This is one of the greatest symphonic BM albums of all time. With great production, and great preformace, Cradle (as usual) is able to create a dark, cold, and suffocating atmosphere.

The other REALLY funny thing is, this cd tries to be all poetic and romantically tortured with it's titles. I mean, The cd is called \\"Dusk and Her Embrace!\\" that sounds like a new kind of perfume J.Lo would come out with!! And just look at the song titles for more laughs: Heaven Torn Asunder?

It sounds almost as though the recording was made in full during live performance, then split into tracks. Percussion isn't crisp and clear, many entrances of instruments are slightly imprecise. Some movements feel disjointed, others are perfectly timed. If you want the feel of being in the audience to listen live, this is a good recording for you. If you are distracted, as I am, by the noises of the audience (or ill orchestra members), you may want to find a different recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little River Band goes hard rock.","review":"The beginning of the end for Little River Band.After ditching lead singer Glenn Shorrock and key harmony man Beeb Birtles,the band decided to go hard rock,but the changes were too much for fans with the album only reaching to number 75 on the Billboard charts and the \\"Playing to Win\\" single only reaching number 60.The band members heavily promoted the album on US radio,even changing their name temporarily to LRB but to no avail.New lead singer John Farnham provides some good vocals on songs like \\"Blind Eyes\\" and the title song,but the hard rock did not suit the bands harmony style.Had they stuck to the soft rock style of the previous \\"The Net\\" album,they might have had continued success,but with the loss of Beeb Birtles backing harmonies and the change to hard rock,it just fell apart.Fans didn't reject John Farnham,they rejected Graham Goble's hard rock experiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the picture","review":"The actual branch is nothing like what is pictured.

Accurately and unbiasedly presented, this is no PC fluff piece, but a true account of the attrocities committted by the United States and its citizens in the aquisition of territory. The account of Colorado's Sand Creek Massacre in which Colorado State Millitiamen literally slaughtered peaceful Cheyennes and later mutilated the corpses for public exhibit was particulary emotional for me - and is the inspiration for the review title.

Dee Brown's book should be required reading for every citizen of this nation. It's that good. I rank this book with Howard Zinn's \\"A People's History of the United States.\\"I read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee shortly after it was published, and its illusion shattering impact has stayed with me to this day. The section debunking the \\"hero\\" George Custer is more than worth the price of the book. Be forewarned, however, this well researched book is full of heartbreak, broken promises, betrayal, genocide, and sadness on an enormous scale, and it is powerfully written. It will affect you profoundly on a variety of levels. Read it, and weep, and know. It's the least you can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal","review":"We hear about both sides of colonial history so often these days that a book like \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" can seem a little trite, even biased towards the Indian side of the story. In fact this book is 30 years old and is the book that _produced_ this shift in perspective--before its publication the Indian side of the story was never part of the mainstream culture in the first place. Still an important work on early American history, \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" is also seminal in its own right. Read it by all means; if you're already familiar with American Indian history, you'll have the proper context to put it in, and if you're not, you need the wake-up call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I am a huge fan of history but really am not a fan of reading. There are are only three books I have ever finished in my entire life, and this is one of them. Usually I get bored and toss them out, or they are just bad books all together. This book is amazing. I wanted a book about the history of the native americans and after reading reviews I felt this would be the best choice. Boy was I right! Much to the amazement of people around me, I couldn't put it down. It gives informative and sometimes heart wrenching accounts of the systematic extermination of the once great Native american nations. It really has taken me aback, I always knew we screwed the Native americans but I never realized it was this bad.If you are a fan of history this is an absolute must read, and coming from one whom doesn't read a lot, that is saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive history of the American Indians","review":"Brown's chronicle of the systemic slaughter and betrayal of American Indians at the hands of the US government is the highly readable and heartbreaking history your social studies teacher never told you about. Dee Brown single-handedly turned back the American myth of the noble settlers fighting the savage Indians and his unimpeachable documentation to original sources has made this the definitive classic of Native American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction as History","review":"It is sad that this work has become the most popular, certainly on college campuses, of the many histories of the conflicts between the settlers and the indians. Dee Brown was a very talented writer and he wrote some valuable histories. This volume, although well written, is not an accurate historical account. Like many \\"histories\\" that appeared in the seventies it is a polemic disguised as a work of scholarship. The book may be summarized as \\"red man good, white man bad\\". Such a simplistic morality fable does not do justice to either the settlers or the indians who were engaged in a great struggle that deserves an accurate retelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indian Apologetics","review":"I suppose Dee Brown is not to blame; after all, he subtitled this book \\"An Indian History of the American West\\". That pretty much says it all for this one-sided, biased, presentation of the clash of cultures which inevitably would result in the extermination of one or the other. If attaining victimhood and sympathy for Indians is the goal, this book succeeds; if the painful truth regarding the bloody massacres perpetrated by both sides is the goal, try a balanced account such as Utley and Washburn's \\"Indian Wars\\". One reviewer stated his desire that this book be made required reading in schools and colleges...unfortunately, that is the case, it's only too bad that no corrective, balanced account is also made required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for every American.","review":"Anyone who is PROUD to be an American should read this book. I feel your opinion may change dramatically! We should be ashamed of the manner in which we have treated the natives of this country. Every effort should be made to improve their situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"zZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz","review":"This book lacked any kind of compelling literature required to spark the interest of any person who reads from the \\"young adult\\" catagory. It is boring. It tries to spark deep emotion with short descriptions that seem brutal and horrific. And yes they are if you are searching for facts, but if you wish to read a book that keeps you interested WHILE at the same time states facts, I suggest you look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the atrocities they don't tell you about in school","review":"I was dumbfounded to find out what actually took place on the Great Plains in the years following our \\"forefather\\", Christopher Columbus' arrival on this continent. The white man all but exterminated the Indians in a quest for gold, land, and other personal property that the natives always shared. They were said to be less than human, but after reading this book, you will learn who the REAL \\"savages\\" were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Read: The History You're Never Told","review":"I'll keep this short. The fact that Mr. Brown uses quotes and accounts from soldiers' own court testimonies lends a great deal of credibility to the book. Although the negative reviews here seem to slip into dramatic instance (ex: Well, my great-grandmother didn't experience that, so the book is flawed.) and selective observation, I would counter that this book presents history that McGraw-Hill is likely to never put in their textbooks.It's a tough, slow read and rather dry which, again, lends somewhat to the credibility of the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee","review":"I was given this book by my Grandfather nearly 30 years ago, but it was misplaced before I got a chance to begin reading.

In it, he tells the history, the very tragic history, of the plight of the American Indian people. This new addition, with its beautiful photos, and added stories and commentary, was fantastic. I would say anyone who collects material on AMerican Inian history has to have this addition to his/her collection!! I loved it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lest We Forget: The True Stealing of America","review":"This book is one of the most detailed and documented histories of how the pioneers, the US Army, and the US Government stole the United States lands from the Native Americans. With the addition of beautiful photographs of the main Native Chiefs of each tribe, the reader gets to know these brave Native leaders intimately. This is a book that should be used to teach the real history of America. The only thing I would add would be maps of the various areas mentioned, as well as marking the various old forts, many of which no longer exist on a modern map. I found myself going to Google Earth to get the lay of the lands mentioned and was in even greater awe of these Natives as they were chased hundreds of miles by soldiers who wanted to exterminate these beautiful people.A riviting book, to be sure that will bring the reader to tears by the tremendous injustices and broken promises by the American government to this proud race."},{"rating":"2","title":"survey, from the victim's point of view, of the old west","review":"Anyone interested in history should read this book. It is full of extremely poignant stories, each of which would make for a great film or TV mini-series.

She gobbled it up and we still discuss it.When I read this book, I wanted to learn more, perhaps read an entire history, about every story or chapter.

It also reminded me a bit of \\"Holes,\\" because it's so engrossing that even kids who don't normally like books (e.g., many boys) will probably stay up late reading it with a flashlight under the covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable for a young reader","review":"My 13-year son still thinks of this book fondly, remembering my reading it to him when he was small. He enjoyed the youth focus, the action, the Judaism and the apparent West Texas setting of some of the story. And the book still is prominently displayed on his bookshelf where he periodically points to it as a tale that he enjoyed hearing and has occasionally dipped into himself since he learned to read on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spans all generations, a great bedtime story too!","review":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden works on many levels. It's an adventure story, with page turning appeal, but also imparts information about Judaism, Apache culture, and the pioneering spirit that drove Westward expansion. It pleases the young adult reader, but transcends all ages. A family I know read it out loud from cover to cover on a Friday night, but adults also enjoy its character development and touching relationships. I recommend The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden as a wonderful Chanuka gift for all generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functions as Designed","review":"I'm still not sure how this can opener works but the rims of both the lid and opened can are indeed free of sharp edges. It's almost like the original seal is pried apart rather than cut. No matter. If sharp edges are a concern, then this unit does the job nicely. I've only had it for a couple months so I can't comment on durability. It's easy to use though. I love tools that work well. This is one of them. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like the can opener!","review":"I really like that this can opener doesn't leave sharp edges. It takes a few tries to figure out how to use can opener but once you get the hang of it, it's super easy to use.You do need to use an old styled can opener for some things (such as tuna) because with this opener, you aren't able to use the lid to drain off the liquid in a can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it worked","review":"I have owned this product for 2 years now. I really wanted to like this product and thought I found the perfect can opener. It worked great for the first couple of months until it started slipping, the can opener would stay stationary even though I was turning the knob. Often times I would have to reposition the can opener and do a do over. By doing so, it creates tiny metal shavings that can get mixed into your food while removing the lid. I contacted the manufacturer to voice out my complaint and they were very prompt at sending me a new one at no cost to me. I received the replacement and gave it a try, I was hoping that maybe the first one I received was just a dud. Unfortunately, the replacement also slips so I am still on the hunt for a good can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Opener?","review":"Wanted a safety can opener and I have kind of a red thing going on so I ordered this 'can opener'. The first one I got would not open any cans whatsoever so I sent it back. The second one opens some cans but not all. It has a hard time opening cans with pull tops like pet food cans. It's uncomfortable to use and just does a poor job in general. One advantage of safety openers is the ability to use the top for storage which is ideal for pet food. I have a cheap generic opener I've had for years but is now getting a bit dull. The cheap one will run laps around this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I had this can opener for about a month before it stripped out.

Out of maybe 5 or 6 I tried, it could not handle one. What good is it if you have to get another can opener?Even when it does open cans, it is not the most user-friendly can opener I've had (and I've only had two cheap ones ever before, haha). It sometimes slips and you have to re-place it and continue, which is annoying and tricky because the spot where you stopped is not easily visible.In short, you have to value the advantages pretty highly in order to overcome the disadvantages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but poor design","review":"I was looking for a can opener that cuts around the rim instead of the top of the can because I don't like lids falling into the food while it is still in the can. The problem with this one is that the handles are stacked and difficult to open/close. You have to slide the handles left to right instead of up and down. Rather difficult and I have strong hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This thing is a disaster. It's not intuitive to use and took many frustrating minutes to figure it out, even with the instructions. (Should a can opener really require written instructions?)

This thing won't fit ergo won't open anything larger than a standard tuna or soup can."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best and Only Can Opener I Will Ever Use","review":"I have had this device for 5+ years. Never had a can I could not open with it. Love the fact that there is no longer contamination from the crud that can build up on the traditional type can openers no matter how you try to clean them. Never lose the lid into the contents, no cuts, no worrie about lid contamination into the contents of the can since it removes from outside. There is a \\"learning curve\\" the first few times you use it because it is different.

They might of given me the cheaper model, it works ok once you get used to it but its not as great as raved about in reviews.

They are fabulous and I will never go back to the normal one. This one works a little different than the others since it attaches at the top of the can instead of the side.

The main reason is because the film refuses to take a position. It doesn't have to be the truth, but just this detective's point of view or position. Instead, in the end, the message is: we don't what happened. Geez, I sat through all that to be back where I started? And as much as I like Brody, his character in this film is dull as dishwater. I care nothing about him or his issues. Why should I? This film shouldn't even be about him. Affleck, compare to his usual flare, did a decent job, but it's still not anything to really write home about. I thought Diane Lane was the most impressive by far. This film will keep your attention if you have nothing else to do, but there are other ways to pass the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie That Was Overlooked","review":"Hollywoodland is an amazing movie, but not as good as I hoped it would be. The film never really goes anywhere since it is all speculation, and the end of the film just ends almost where it began, with nothing being solved. Adrien Brody was amazing in this movie as the private investigator trying to get justice for George Reeves and his mother who believes that her son was murdered. Ben Affleck also did a great job in the movie, especially since he looks so much like George. You can tell when you watch this movie that Affleck is loves getting to play Superman, he just looks like he is having fun. Overall, a really good movie but it does kind of drag a little parts in the middle. Other than that, this movie is a really amazing film. Like I said, this is just a lot of theory and all of them are shown in this film, but no answers are given since no one really knows the truth about what happened except for George himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performances make for an entertaining, engaging film","review":"Ben Affleck shines in an intentionally understated portrayal of TV's Superman, George Reeves. Reeves, who resisted the Superman role and tried desperately to return to more serious acting, finally succumbed to his chronic depression and killed himself in 1959--or did he? In this fictional account, down and out private detective Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) sets out to discover just that. Oscar-winner Brody delivers and excellent performance; his Simo is struggling with his own muddled life, which allows the character (and the viewer) to draw parallels between himself and the doomed Reeves. In the end, the film suggests that Reeves's death may not have been much of a mystery after all, but the theme of a life tragically lost is still evident, along with the hope that things can always change for the better. Excellent supporting performances from Diane Lane and Bob Hoskins round out this enjoyable and thoroughly engaging movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"If your looking for a Hollywood suspenseful thriller set in a bygone era, check out L.A. Confidential - this films was terrible. Excellent performances by Adrien Brody and Diane Lane, along with a slightly above the norm turn by Affleck do little to keep the viewer interested.I had no idea when the film was going to end as I'd ceased to care about any of the characters after the first hour, when it did finally end, I felt a combination of relief that it was over and disappointment that it didn't finish with a grand twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Recording Quality","review":"I just got this CD and was quite disappointed. The song's of course are great, but the recording quality of this CD is horrendous. I ripped it to disk and analyzed it with Sound Forge and the right channel is highly clipped on many of the songs and that makes the stereo balance favor the right channel too much. I have the LP of Walk Don't Run Vol. 2 and except for the obvious record hiss and scratches, the sound is MUCH more balanced and clear on the LP.If you can find these albums on a different label, give that a shot because this label definitely destroyed the quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cleanest rock instrumentals around","review":"the ventures were true musicians.

It's just great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Tom, not the original cast.","review":"I love Tom Waits and was lucky enough to see the musical when it came from Germany to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The performance was chilling, engaging, and moving in every way. I bought this album thinking (hoping) it was the actual cast recording and was slightly disappointed to find out it isn't. Nevertheless, Waits does an excellent job on some wonderful tunes. I love to play it and reminisce about that performance. This is an essential album for the Waits die-hard. I am proud to own it and to have seen the production. I wish I had had the luck to see Frank's Wild Years in Chicago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Time Fan's Favorite","review":"I've been a fan of Tom Waits, since I heard this very album a week or two after it was released. Now '93 may not seem like a long time to most, but at the risk of sounding melodramatic, the music Tom Waits' is able to create feels like I've known it my whole life. And of all his music, this is, in my humble opinion, his masterpiece. I've never understood when people say it's hard to listen to, I can sit and listen to this album, doing nothing else, and be completely entertained. I think people with a mind for theatre can grasp it better, the thought for me of being onstage to a Waits' score is, is...an unreachable dream. This is my favorite album of anyone, anywhere, and pound for pound I think it's one of the best collections of music ever produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama class schmaltz","review":"Tom, leave the schmaltz to \\"The Great White Way\\". Absolutely ,without a doubt, Tom's worst effort to date. It simply is what it is, \\"Broadway\\". To me, trying to listen to this album is completely impossible. Sorry Tom,you're an artist of the highest order and I love all of your other work, but some times even the golden goose lays a rotten egg."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great cd","review":"I think it's Based on Weber's 'Der Freishutz' but I could be mistaken, the idea for it may be a common theme. A Bit like Faust in that he sells his soul and comes out poorly in his dealing with the devil. You also get to hear the Late William S Burroughs sing! The track \\"Just the Right Bullets\\" might be my favorite, but they are uniformly good, I don't find myself clicking through tracks on it. Tom Waits uses different voices through it, it's a good recording, I think you should buy it. I just want you to be happy, that's my only little wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Classic","review":"Upon first listen I felt disappointed with Waits' BLACK RIDER, hearing the same stuff I didn't like on BONE MACHINE (which I realize was/is hailed by many as one of Waits' finest recornding, but for which I still can't seem to get into). However, after a few more listens, and then a few more...etc. I totally fell in love with this album and consider it Waits't third \\"classic.\\" The songs are hauntingly beautiful, musically daring, and surprisingly meoldic. The use of the saw in particular gives me goosebumps upon every listen. Along with SMALL CHANGE, FRANK'S WILD YEARS, and RAIN DOGS, BLACK RIDER comprises the top of Waits' musical output."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had To Respond To All The Glowing Reviews","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews for this CD, I felt that I had to provide at least a partial rebuttal. First, let me say that I've been a T.W. fan for over 25 years, through all his iterations. He is, quite simply, one of my favorite artists. That said, this is the only Waits CD I can't relate to AT ALL. I must have listened to this thing at least 20 times over a two year period before finally giving up selling it. This is the only Waits I've ever parted with. If you like his \\"post-Swordfish\\" style, try \\"Rain Dogs\\", \\"Bone Machine\\", \\"Blood Money, or \\"Alice\\" - damn near anything but this (even \\"Mule Variations\\", if you must). If you love Waits, you'll probably have to try this (like I did), but consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only recording we ever traded in","review":"We have been Waits fans for years and love most of his work.

I couldn't even finish it. I'm a huge fan of Sam Neill, too, and I think he was just horrible in this series. Everybody (Bill Nighy, Joanne Whalley) was horrible. The music was awful, the acting & lines just laughable. No connection to the \\"characters\\" whatsoever. Unbelievably bad. I also finished \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,\\" and thought it was excellent, even though I found the DVDs' glossary too late and didn't understand half of what was going on in TTSS. I'm apparently in the minority here with my 1-star review; to each her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIGITAL TRANSFER TO DVD COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER","review":"I have enjoyed many of the episodes for some years now, and was eagerly awaiting the DVD version. Some episodes are obviously better than others in terms of production qaulity and substance. Overall, I was disappointed in the digital quality of the images. At times, the images and scenes was grainy and too dark. In some cases, the VHS actually provided a better-quality image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reilly Ace of Spies","review":"Enjoyed all twelve episodes very much, particularly the historical context. Acting and characterisations very good and had fun identifying the up-and-comers of British TV. Sadly, Albion once again is shown as perfidious. The additional clip on the real Reilly was a real surprise bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"British Spy Series at its best!","review":"If you are a fan of British spy and mystery series, this is a series for you. I found each of the mini-series very good except 1 of them which had a plot that was not as interesting as all the others. Nevertheless, one of the best overall British spy series. Think of this as the believable version of James Bond. There is some mature sexual content and graphic war scenes. The historical perspective of the world events during the early 1900's is interesting along with the human drama of life as a double agent and spy. Other British series we have enjoyed are Perot, Heat of the Sun, and Midsomer Murders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reilly - Ace of Spies by Sam Neill, Peter Egan, Ian Charleson, Norman Rodway","review":"Enjoyed would be understatement as I really became entangled with the actors & suspense with the main character, Sidney Reilly. Sam Neill seems to be someone who will be remembered for the roles he has played & will play in the future. Nowone is perfect,but this series I am sure, made many followers among the viewers. The main character was a factual person & it appears that the script followed closely the history concerning Reilly as he was a spy for Britain that 007 was patterned after.Well worth buying & viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is in a British Style - Reilly was really an Ace!","review":"Sam Neill plays his part to perfection but had to overcome a wordy British approach to dialog. Afterall Reilly was a British Spy so he probably didn't talk like he was from Brooklyn. The historical facts are very accurate and the props make the scenes zoom you back in time. I had allot of fun watching these episodes.Some people think that Ian Fleming used Reilly as the model for James Bond. There was a WWII Serbian Spy that may also have influenced Commander Fleming. You make the call yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series, DVD better than VHS","review":"This was my favorite when it was first broadcast, and it's still excellent. Great story, intrigue, acting, etc.I don't understand the reviewer comment claiming poor DVD transfer. I bought this DVD set to replace my old VHS videotape set. Comparing the first episode carefully, the DVD quality looks as good as most DVD's, and it is a lot better than the old videotapes (which looked pretty washed out on my player)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perpetually excellent","review":"Until recently acquainting myself with this four-disc collection, I hadn't seen \\"Reilly\\" since c. 1999 on the once-watchable History Channel. \\"Reilly\\" is as good as when originally aired in the 80s, it's excellent acting and tight script perhaps more appreciable than ever. It's interesting to see many actors from Brit TV (e.g. David Suchet, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy) then on the cusp of recognition. Tom Bell, a veteran actor even then, has never been so effective as Dzerzhinsky; Leo McKern is a believable rogue as Zaharoff. Reilly is an anti-hero at best, yet we find ourselves fascinated by and perhaps rooting for him (sometimes, anyway)in his daring, difficult intrigues and adventures. All told, an always enjoyable experience.P.S: I didn't mention Sam Neill's brilliant interpretation of Reilly because it's so apparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent series, very poor DVD transfer","review":"This excellent series is seriously marred by an awful DVD transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real spy story","review":"Saw this TV series in the UK eons ago.

Dean, who compiled the album, managed to sneak in a couple of his solo recordings, with \\"Vegetables\\" and \\"Sunshine Music\\". Those two tracks don't really fit the \\"theme\\" of the rest of the album. Anyway, this is a fun album that features not only hits, but also fun album tracks like \\"Schlock Rod\\" and \\"Bucket T\\". And it's in mono."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled!!!

The 3 point hitch onthe back of my tractor is rated to lift either 4,000 or 6,000lbs -- two tractors. Less than a week after I recieved this hitch I was able to bend the two arm-mounts to the point where I felt it was unsafe to continue to use it.What bent was not the pin itself, but the metal that the pin is mounted on. The bottom crossbar is not built heavily enough to allow the unit to lift moderately heavy trailers. Since the 3 point arms cannot lift more than their rated weights, weights under 6,000lbs tongue weight were too much for this unit, and I suspect that weights of 2,000lbs were probably too much, as most of the trailers were empty or partially full when being moved.I would expect a class 2/3 attachment to be able to handle typical 2/3 loads. this particular one is only suitable for light duty.We ended up cutting off the bottom bar and welding on a stronger support for the pins."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does its job","review":"I got this to take advantage of the shorter wheelbase of a tractor to move a 28-foot gooseneck stock trailer in and out of an equipment shed. It does exactly what I want it to do. However, the tractor has a fiberglass canopy, and the forward dome of the stock trailer contacts the canopy if any turns over, say, 45 degrees are made.

This is deep hypnotic ambient expressionism. Eno's composition expands your consciousness allowing your thoughts to wander a slow open circle around the prairie of your mind. A potent vehicle to surmount time and grasp inner patterns. This is a well phrased composition that despite its long track time does not dilute itself. Vertical slow musical strokes break allowing a relaxing void which together convert into a wholeness, a continum. The structure of this composition depends as much on the silence between notes as on the notes themselves.

When on think of \\"English Humor\\", subtleties, irony and wryness come to mind, but in this movie the gags were predictable and more cringe-inducing than funny, or simply gross. At places Mr. Bean's behaviors were more in tune with a sociopathic retard than a lovable misfit. The entire hospital scene felt tacked on to pad the playing time.

There is a good deal of variation in the sound, from mid 1980 digital to what are undoubtedly 78 rpm discs from the mid 1930s. If you look for note perfect performances, you won't find them here. But they are lively, spirited, and convey more music and emotion than many a perfectionist can.Jan Ekier was apparently recorded at the 1937 competition. Adam Harasiewicz, Martha Argerich, and Dang Thai Son were recorded in 1955, 1965, and 1980 respectively. Yuval Fishman, Kemal Gekic, and Jean-Marc Luisada all performed in 1985.Louis Kentner was recorded in the 78 era, but I can not tell from the liner notes when.Anyway, I just close my eyes and get carried away by the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts to listen!!","review":"I bought this CD expecting world-class performances without spending much money cuz the title says \\"Great Chopin Performers\\" ...instead I had to listen to lots of mistakes and unstable performances and inconsistancy in tones from bad recording or something.

If you would like something that is very neutral, but not super plain, then these would be great. The biggest problem with ordering Corelle through the mail is that many times the dishes aren't sufficiently padded, and you end up with breakage. As anyone knows who has used Corelle, it's not like breaking a regular stoneware plate. It shatters like glass, and when you open the box, it gets tiny pieces EVERYWHERE.

Traces the development of Whitman's fascination with death and his internal struggle between his faith in immortality and the constant doubts that impinge on this faith. A definite contribution toward understanding Whitman's inner life.Analyzes virtually every poem and poetic passage that is concerned with or colored by Whitman's attitudes toward death andilluminates these poems and their language. Sets the poetry in the context of Whitman's discussions of death and of contemporary discussions and theories of death.The book is itself a worthy meditation on death. Recommended for Whitman fans, for readers of poetry and for general readers.Ted Malone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid wraps","review":"I really liked the length. Made wrapping WAY easier!

It reads like it's written by a twelve year old and was given to the publisher in its unedited form.

I tried the techniques of rising up above my body and entering the crown chakra of my 'patient' and visualising the sick areas of their body and extracting the programs from the DNA.However I think I need more practice. And whatever you do, be careful with the medical advice she gives. Some of it is doubtful and poorly researched. Including extracting metal government implants from people.

On this album \\"In The Heat Of The Night\\" #12, they have some originals and covers. \\"Heartbreaker\\" #23 broke this band, it was played a great deal in late '79 and early '80. \\"My Clone Sleeps Alone\\", is one of my favorites from this disc, nice piano, and has a good new wave sound. Their 2nd single had kind of a Blondie feel to it \\"We Live For Love\\" #30. On the covers I liked the John Mellencamp hit \\"I Need A Lover\\", which the band did a great job. Their take of the Alan Parsons Project tune \\"Don't Let It Show\\", is pretty good. And then you get The Sweet re-make of \\"No You Don't\\", which is just top notch. Pat and the boys would hit the moon on their next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that started it all","review":"I have been a serious fan of Pat Benatar since this, her first, came out.

Overall a good book, though I do have one quibble, the person who did the cover might not have met a Down Syndrome person because the girl on the cover doesn't have the Down Syndrome facial features.

Much better than Wild At Heart or Fire Walk With Me or Dune, I think. Not quite equal to Blue Velvet or Eraserhead, but pretty close. Unlike Lynch's \\"failures,\\" this film isn't dominated by scenes that stand alone, superior to the film as a whole. The whole thing comes together in an inventive structure that is as integral to the work and as interesting as certain stand-out individual scenes. The biggest criticisms leveled at Lost Highway have been aimed at the seemingly incomprehensible narrative, but the same criticism can be leveled at, for example, the literary works of James Joyce. Why are films held to a different standard than literature? I don't know, but it is a key to why film critics in general are some of the dimmest, least perceptive people out there. My only question is why the heck isn't this thing on DVD by now? What a shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God knows what this man is thinking about.","review":"This film is very intellectual, very intense, and I imagine similar to taking large amounts of heroin. Nothing really makes sense, but provides an interesting trip along the way.I found it quite disturbing, particularly the guy at the party telling Brad that was at his house right now, and the whole filming of them sleeping thing. It was extremely cold and distant, and the soundtrack really added to the overall severity of the film, contrasting between bellowing Tool and silence.I liked it, but certainly not one to watch alone or when you are tired. It will just be a seemingly illogical waste of time, for the 'storyline' is far from fed to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Form.","review":"I'll admit it took me 2 and half screening of this one for me to actually get it. At first I thought it was just a mood piece, but actually there is a Plot and a coherent narrative, it's just not readily apparent.This may be Lynch's most literary work and absolutely reaches back to Eraserhead and Elephant Man for it's approach, but if you could get into the head of Eraserhead, Naked Lunch, or Videodrome, and make sense of the stories then this one is only slightly more chalenging.The film doesn't exactly play fair in many respects, but then again we don't really want Lynch to anyway, and it never really tells you that this is not an objective narrative. Figuring out what Lynch is doing and what is being said is difficult and Dave really makes you work for those nuggets, but thats the fun here.Again, not a film for everybody but, if you can handle very subjective cinema, then you've got a chance.Long live the fighters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a current & relevant film now and always mysterious","review":"the laymans review. the lost hiway is not a movie for those who have to \\"figure out\\" every mystery in life. the lost hiway is not a movie for those who need explosions and a constant soundtrack barrage. the lost hiway is for the movie viewer who enjoys submitting to the unknown. it is for the viewer who enjoys crafty films that keep you wondering and \\"subtlely force\\" one to think. the lost hiway is for a viewer that will watch a movie more than once and get more ideas from a number of subconscious clues(or are they?) the movie is mainly for those who care enough to let a movie go where it will and love it like an errant child. watch and watch it again. it can only grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please review the PRODUCT, not the movie itself.","review":"People, PLEASE don't continue writing book-lenghted reviews for the movie itself instead of writing them for the PRODUCT shown here.

And it's confusing because the plot is non-existant.Now don't get me wrong, I like offbeat films. I liked Tetsuo and Tetsuo II. Things don't need to be explained to me point-blank for me to like a movie.

It didn't work for me because I didn't care about Fred and maybe thats why I didn't care for the flick. I think the director should have had a little more of the background on Fred at the beginning and it could have worked. But I think anybody who walked into the theatre 30 minutes after it started and then walked out 30 minutes before it ended probably know more about the ending than those who watched it over and over again. Who'd want to do that.

Then, the dialogue i find is boring, and does not help develop the characters, i think the script would probably be be about two pages long.

It looks horrible. I wish I could rank the film seperate from the DVD quality -- since I can't, I am going to put 1 star due to the transfer; if I could put a lower rating, I would. That's how unprofessional this transfer is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this DVD!!!","review":"This version of Lost Highway is a 'pan and scan' version. For those of you who are not familiar with this 'cropping' device, it essentially cuts out pieces of the frame in order for it to fit on a television screen, effectively changing what the director had intended for the audience to see. This version is in no way viewable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUTURE CULT CLASSIC!","review":"Man suspects wife of cheating on him. Man bumps in to creepy guy at party. Man kills wife, but can't remember it. Man transforms into another man. If this sounds baffling, be warned: it's only half the plot!

This movie sucks you in, envelops you beckons you to search your own depths for answers. because the plot was not pretty, clear and obvious makes this movie great. its what modern cinama needs. hollywood has been putting out some pretty crappy movies latly lynch should be praised for giving movie lovers a breath of fresh air. the lost highway explicitly defies the beaten path of mainstream cinema. i for one cannot wait for another lynch title."},{"rating":"2","title":"weird an odd movie. i like it!!","review":"this movie was odd an great. at first i was like what am i wacthing? then at the end i was like whoa!!!! thats some crazy s***!! i loved it. an i can see how ppl say it is like a masterpiece painting.it was like a beatiful,scary,fun dream all at once. an i'm glad i can take it agian an agian. check this movie out, it's a trip.(plus look for marilyn MANSON as a porno star! that kicked a**!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Running on Empty","review":"You can't always know what the other guy's thinking, but this seems to be the pivot point upon which David Lynch crafts his essentially noir tale of fractured identity and broken dreams.Bill Pullman figures prominently in this film as a sax player who, through a particular psychological breakdown finds himself inside another man's world, feeling his feelings, and thinking his thoughts, many of which are of violent actions approaching murder.To attempt any reductive rationale for the Lynchian style is to do a great injustice to both the director and viewer, since part of the dynamic of the film is based on our own perception of reality and how it is visualized in the film.Watch the movie with glee, and a decent helping of sugar- it's a wild ride down a lost highway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't make a lot of sense but so much fun to watch!!!!","review":"I felt very confused after watching this movie for the first time. I then went in search of explanations from other viewers and learned that I didn't really miss anything-it isn't supposed to make sense! After realizing this, I am much better able to enjoy the eerie weirdness of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Lynch movie","review":"Ok I like David Lynch movies and TP so I'm biased a bit. LH is another good Lynch movie. It's not linear and there are several ways to interpret how the different story lines are related. I won't mention how I interpreted it to avoid spoiling it for others. It reminds me of a movie I saw in middle school about a Civil War deserter(?) about to be hung at a bridge when he imagines a different reality. The soundtrack is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not official american release","review":"Buyers take note- The seller states that \\"This is the PAL Region 2. Multi-Region dvd player will play.\\". None of the other reviews make this distinction. Your normal american dvd player will not play this. Hopefully someone with a multi-region dvd player will actually buy a copy and review it so we can get a clue what the quality of this copy is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either love it or you hate it.","review":"This movie is difficult to explain and just as difficult to understand, but I absolutely love it!! Lost Highway is a movie that you can see over and over and notice something new or different every time. I keep checking this page to see if they've introduced it on DVD yet, but so far, nothing. I've worn out two copies of it on VHS already and am on my third quickly wearing out one now. David Lynch's Lost Highway is in the same category as Natural Born Killers, in that you may be one of the lucky ones who can't get enough of it or you may see it and just warn everyone else away from it.Please at least see it once, if you haven't already, and then maybe you'll begin to also understand the artistic quality in this wonderful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired.","review":"This is David Lynch's most uninspired film, and his worst, second only to Dune, and that's saying a lot. Bill Pullman and Patricia arquette are the worst casting choices, especially coming from a man who I think has assembled some of the most interesting casts ever. I'm convinced that Bill Pullman was cast in Independance Day just to make the aliens look real, next to his wooden and superficial performance. Fire Walk with me was brilliant, emotional, terrifying, heartbreaking. Lost Highway looks to me like the wet dream of a disinterested, but dirty old man. I really lost faith in a great director as a result of watching this film. He has misfired before, sure enough (Wild at Heart, Dune), but at least those disasters showed glimpses of pure genius. Lost highway looks like a REALLLY long Marillyn Manson clip, without even the substance Manson has. Soundtrack is great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyncherei","review":"About as comprehensible as one expects a David Lynch movie to be, but not completely unwatchable (I finsihed it!).Robert Blake appears to have been made up to look like Lugosi doing Dracula (sans cape). This is perhaps intended to be a clue to something or other.The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. In turn, the best part of the soundtrack is This Mortal Coil (with Elizabeth Fraser's chastely sensuous voice) performing a haunting cover of Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren.\\" Predictably, it's missing from the soundtrack album."},{"rating":"2","title":"insane Pyshc Thiller, or devilishly complex mystery","review":"This movie left me bedazzeled for a week.

Modern film noir at it's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me back my cell phone","review":"The best Bowie track off of \\"Outside\\" provides bookends for this story within a story within a story within...Were you to really unravel the plot, you would arrive at an endlessly repeating maelstrom of a doppelganger porn gorefest with slight variations on character. The valium-fogged padding around in Lynch's hideous LA house sets a pace that is frustratingly engrossing. And Richard Pryor runs a garage.After the fourth or fifth trip out to the cabin in the sand, one welcomes the death of most of the leads as a cathartic end to the increasingly inane intrigue. But how can you not love 2 Patricia Arquettes? AND Gary Busey as a tearful, Zen, motorcycling suburban dad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah... Blah...Blah...","review":"Went to see this movie and was expecting a good Lynch-fest like Peaks and Velvet - got junk instead. No story... no character development... no plot... no introduction... no resolution.. no conclusion.. no nothing. Just alot of blah..blah..blah. Like what are you supposed to come away with here. I came away with no interest in this guys films anymore. I like his other stuff, even Eraserhead had a story. This thing? Sorry bud - no ceegar."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time","review":"Lost highway has finally been given the treatment it deserves in a two disc special edition released in Australia (region 4) gone is the 2 channel soundtrack replaced with 5.1 and in DTS! You will either love or hate this film as with most of David Lynch's works theres no in-between. And while on the subject of Lynch when the heck is season 2 of Twin Peaks going to be released?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember, its a David Lynch Movie.","review":"Okay, I know this one is way out there. Trying to decipher what its all about is an exercise in futility for us common people. Let the brainiacs figure that out and enjoy this one for its surreal images and masterful choreography. I don't understand the plot but I still love this movie. I don't know if that is possible, but when watching most of DL movies you've got to learn to enjoy it for what it offers: emotional and stunning visuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan and Scan","review":"Just thought I'd warn all the connoisseurs that, yes, this is in fact the pan and scan version. My advice: wait for the new U.S. release. As for the movie itself: standard David Lynch fare: entertaining and incomprehensible--good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"\\"The Lost Highway\\" is by far one of the best movies I have seen. Bill Pullman is cool in this movie, and Patricia Arquette well she is self explanatory. I haven't quite understood why nobody likes this movie because me and my friend thinks it is one of the best movies we've seen in a long time. I find this movie very hillarious, especially the tailgating seen, me and my friend was rolling on the floor after that. Not only is Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette great in this movie, but there are other actors such as Henry Rollins, and Richard Pryor that make this movie even better. In my opinion David Lynch did a great job in directing this video, his best work yet! I recommend this video for anyone who likes sick humor and a great suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain tingling","review":"most people dismiss this movie because it's hard to understand the first viewing. Which is sad. People don't understand it. lynch himself has said that he loves mystery. he wants the viewer to use their BRAIN and not have everything spoon fed to them. There are many ways this movie can go, but none of them make sense. i guess we sometmes have to accept things that are \\"impossible\\"? lynch has said that this film is about the \\"human condition\\"...looks pretty decayed to me. it's a brilliant film that lingers in my mind long after i've finished watching it. his mystery is certainly one to watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"DagviLoLcynhsHwiayh'st (Unscramble it yourself)","review":"The above pretty much sums up the movie.

Until the last moment, I was somewhat intrigued by the incomprehensible story, waiting for answers. It was extremely difficult to stand the many unpleasant and disgusting scenes of the movie, yet I was hoping that at least it was all for a purpose. However, when I discovered that all of this was only for its own sake and could never be explained by anything other than \\"life itself\\" (probable meaning of the title), I could find no excuse for the existence of this work. What kind of life is this, anyway?! Musically, this is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen, but when the beautiful sountrack is wasted in such a pathetic way, it does not redeem the movie too much. Definitely the most unpleasant film by David Lynch so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst film I have ever seen.....","review":"While Lynch fans (who are these people???) will lap this film up, I was alternately bored, humiliated, riled, and depressed. Nothing, and I mean nothing, makes sense and before some pretentious wiseguy tries to tell me about postmodern nihilism or anti-narrative otherness, let me say that while film can be an instructive tool, it must also be entertaining and I can't imagine who would want to curl up with this waste of time at any point in their day. I would describe plot elements, but they would be irrelevant. Proceed at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I know many people here enjoyed this movie, but, personally, I found it a let down. After hearing so many good reviews about David Lynch's work, I decided to give the movie a spin.While the music was chilling and well-composed, the cast \\"stellar\\", and some scenes quite disturbing, the over-all effect was convoluted and confusing. I had trouble following this loopy script, and spent much of the time getting up to refill my Coke cup.If you want something dark and unusual, go with Jean Pierre Jeunet or Terry Gilliam, or even the early Chris Carter. If you want to annoy yourself, go with Lost Highway.Note: on it's own, each aspect of this movie was great. The acting was great, the photography was great and the scary lipsticked dude chilled my blood. Put together, however, only distracted from what could've been a great short story or novella. I think Lynch has a wonderful and fascinating mind, but would probably be better off writing novels over movie scripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Must Pay","review":"When I saw that this DVD is not avaialable in widescreen I chewed off my left leg. Someone must pay. It is a crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"lLost Highway-Lost picture!","review":"What a great shame this beguiling movie has been given a dreaded \\"pan and scan\\" release. The widescreen format is especially important to convey the unique sense of tension only David Lynch can achieve- through directing,lighting and set design.

It's a shame, to say the least, that such a piece of art could be demeaned in such a way by the horrid quality of this recording.

The sound (Dolby, supposedly) is little better. It is basically unwatchable. Another user review says that the DVD is somewhat better than VHS - I would say the image quality is on par with VHS, and certainly not worth the four stars that reviewer gave it; I cannot imagine how any DVD could be worse than this one.I am sure that David Lynch had nothing to do with this hastily cobbled together sham. He fine tunes his DVDs (even to the extent of removing chapters from \\"The Straight Story\\") and I am sure he would be furious to see his movie butchered in this way.This DVD is of the quality I would expect if I bought the damn thing from a street vendor in Shanghai; ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!","review":"I bought this DVD without noticing it wasn't widescreen because the store sticker was on top of the info. I was pretty mad when I got home and realized this. Then I sat down to watch it. I got hysterical. This is the worst DVD I have ever seen!!!! The compression looks like a bad internet stream, there's a faint white line that flashes randomly across the picture (like a ghost image), the sound is ordinary at best. I don't know who did this hack job but I certainly intend to find out and complain. I'm sure a high school kid with an iMac would've done a better job at compressing this movie. It honestly looks like a copy of a copy of a pirated copy!David Lynch is one of my favorite directors and I just can't believe he approved this.

Even taking into account that the middle of the movie may be the desired recollection of the main character, Fred, or that the movie purposely mixes-up scenes, this movie, The Lost Highway, is still garbage. The first act with Fred as himself is boring!David Lynch is a fine director, but his screenplays and ideas are just plain dumb. The avant garde crowd may think he's a genius but it takes the average Joe to point out the truth: most of David Lynch's movies are really stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a doubt, the most horrendous movie I've ever seen!!","review":"So painful to watch . . . I'm still recovering."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll level with you people...","review":"David Lynch sucks. His movies suck even more. He patches together a series of overly dramatic shots, some labored dialogue and a sprinkling of nudity and calls it art. His movies are merely an opportunity for him to wallow in his own self-aggrandizing \`creativity'. Don't fall for the hype.The only redeeming quality I found in this film was the music. It was actually good, but it was good before it was added to this terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point ?","review":"This whole thing about Lost Highway as something to watch over and over again is ludicrous.

One of the worsest movies ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, tedious, dull etc.......","review":"Let me first start by stating that I am huge David Lynch aficionado. I like all of his films ( I will vehemently defend Dune and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) except for this disappointing effort. I like films that meander and are nonlinear in structure but Lost Highway is just boring and headache inducing. I recommend taking dramamine before being subjected to the sledgehammer aesthetics that Lynch throws at you on the screen. Also does the film have a point? Perhaps, but I was in so much excruciating pain to even care about the characters or try to dechiper the plot. The other friends I watched this with were either asleep or checking their watches for when it would be over. This film is nowhere in the class of Eraserhead, Blue Velvet or Wild At Heart. At least Mr. Lynch redeemed himself with his next effort The Straight Story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film...has...many..........pauses.......................","review":"I think that guy in white makeup is Pullman's unconscious, so Pullman does in fact murder his wife (they're not exactly giddy honeymooners). At this point Pullman loses a few sheep in the top paddock and re-invents himself as the Getty character, a construction that eases his guilt and creates a fantasy scenario for a new love, unfortunatley he's a bit obsessed with old lady so that even here Arquette's character can't love him. I'm probably way off here. I have a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precursor to Mulholland Drive","review":"I hated this movie the first time I saw it. Hated it! It was so bad, that I rented it again to see if maybe I missed something. And I still hated. A year passes, I rented again. I loved it. I loved ever moment of it. I cannot explain why, I just changed my opinion.Is it as good as Mulholland Drive? No. But it works well as a build-up...some have even theorized that Mulholland is just a remake of Lost Highway. I don't buy into that, but you can get a sense that Lynch was testing the waters with Dream-logic.See it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Lynch Film","review":"I wonder when I'll ever understand any other David Lynch film than 'The Straight Story'. 'Lost Highway' is a very typical Lynch film: lots of alternative filming and effects, lots of interesting music - it's often like one long music video, really - and lots of beautiful Patricia Arquette. But the story, hmmm... is as usual not for people with normal IQs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Highway not so good","review":"The film quality is excellent and the DVD transfer didn't lose much. The actors are top notch, but the storyline is just weird and difficult to follow. I found the first half boring and was ready to pull the plug, but it got better in the second half.

Have always grind/clenched my teeth during sleep, but only recently was it causing me discomfort during the day, even though dentist saw signs long ago. Love that this is no-boil and has a very light footprint. Stayed in the first night and has for most of the time I've had the product. Your teeth will feel weird for a while after you start using this product but if you once wore a retainer at night this should feel no different; your mouth will adjust in time and you will be fine.

I have tried many different night guards and this is definitely my favorite as far as comfort. The problem I had was exorbitant cost and durability.I bought this in the first place because my dentist quoted me at $500 for an acrylic night guard. Presumably, the Sleep Right would be a better option, but for $40 each, they don't last long. I found that I ground through mine in about 30 days. I would actually give Sleep Right a glowing review if they let you buy the replacement grind pads for a reasonable price or if they gave you a few extra grind pads per pack...but since you have to buy the entire set with the main piece that holds the pads, carrying case, and packaging, this turns into a $500/year investment that is no longer worth it. Like I said, great design, but they are pricing themselves right past the more durable versions you can get specially fitted at the dentist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good guard","review":"I grind my teeth when I sleep, pretty severely. I've had a variety of night guards, from the 400 dollar custom made to the cheap-o sports guards. I keep coming back to this one. Its not ideal -- the front strap in front of the bottom teeth doesn't adjust enough, for instance. But it does stand up to my grinding, and there's very little adjusting to make it fit for me.

Well put!This whole JFK case has been subverted (or \\"faked\\" if you will) to cover up the involvement of those reaching into the very top of the US government.It's very important to remember nearly 50 years later that ANYTHING less would have been \\"Old News\\" by now, pronto.As Jim Garrison once said, it's not a question of whether Oswald's (US intelligence and/or military) handlers were or were not responsible for the assassination -- they WERE responsible.But you won't hear about any of this from the Executive Branch, the Congress or the Mainstream Media because this story still has the potential to undermine the whole US political system, one that serves these folks quite nicely just like it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Krautrock from Detroit","review":"Amazon's product review actually does this one justice.

This one had an interesting title and I picked it up expecting a good read or at least some redeeming quality to the book. Instead, it turned out to be a most depressing book about shallow, inconsequential, trivial people. The only one who makes any personal change at all is Niall. This is a book about wasted lives and was a waste of that portion of my life that I spent reading it. Even her writing did not seem to be up to its usual quality. Personal recommendation? Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written and interesting, but doesn't really go anywhere","review":"It is an interesting story that follows the lives of three siblings.

What is nice about this volume is that there is Catechism reference numbers that correspond to the subjects Pennock addresses at a given point in the book for those who wish to research further.Having looked at many \\"Introductions to Catholicism\\" in order to better recommend books to those inquiring about a simple reference book to better understand their faith, I have found that this works well as both an introduction to Catholic faith and as an introduction to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.The simple Question and Answer format allows for this book to be \\"taken it at your own pace\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"I have read the book and have found it 'so readable'.

McNally wastes a lot of time pumping himself up by telling us about how he won some distance casting contests back in his prime, how fly line used to be labeled when he first got into fly fishing, and other useless info. His section on fly casting is pitiful and provides no real information to a beginner. The funniest part is his fly casting problems and remedies - I've seen better information on an index card. His section on fly tying is also useless.The final offense is that in several pictures of trout, McNally describes how the trout was handled gently and released carefully. Then in the saltwater fishing section, he catches a small dolphin and shows a picture of himself gaffing the dolphin with a caption that reads \\"Dolphins are good eating!\\".McNally might be a great fly fisher but his book as awful. I would recommend the LLBean book over this one for beginners anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think a few photos in color was missing!","review":"Has a very broad content for beginners.

However the Complete Book of Fly Fishing DOES provide enough tips and recommendations that can help even the worst fishermen on our planet which is something I definitely welcome with open arms. I mean if people fish to relax I can totally understand that, but for sport? I never understood why it was so competitive and special for many people. My family likes to compete in special tournaments where the winner of the biggest fish receives an award but... I've never been inspired enough to want to fish THAT hard. NONE of this should stop you from picking up this book however, because whether you're someone who just has crappy luck fishing or someone who only fishes out of feeling like you HAVE to in order to impress friends, this book is for you. Anyone can be a professional now, even if it's somewhat of a disguise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete is right!","review":"just a quick word about this wonderful book: within two months of reading it, and having never fly-fished a day in my life, i took 23 creel-size trout in two days from Helton Creek, North Carolina. this book guided me throug the purchase of all my equipment, and instructed me on all the techniques in using it. in the nine months since i first read this book i have caught all three species of trout, countless pan fish, crappies, small- and large-mouth bass, and one baracudda. i highly recomend it to anyone interested in fly-fishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"verbose but not informative","review":"After reading several beginners books on flyfishing, it isclear that this one misses the mark. Try the Orvis guides.Any of them. Try the curtis creek manifesto, which inabout 40 pages, does more than this book in hundreds.This book starts out good, and actually has some goodinformation, but when it gets down to fishing forcertain species, most of the \\"advice\\" is really justregalling how good the author is at fishing.If you want a \\"feel good\\" type of book, this mightbe the one for you.

In the end she asks the wind to kidnap another child to her house so she has somebody to play with. \\"The Boy In The Drawer\\" is beyond strange. A little girl finds a tiny boy (leprechaun?) in her room who does crazy things like grow tomato plants in her bed. When she tells her parents the only thing they tell her is to clean it up. What's the point? The only story that is cute and appropriate for a young reader is \\"Moira's Birthday\\".

After a little bit of a slow start, the film begins to wrap your interest around the lives touched by the bath house. An adult son living in south China returns to his elderly father's business when he thinks he has died. The clash of modern life with Chinese filial tradition provides a potent mechanism to advance the story. Great comic relief is provided by the up's and down's of daily Chinese life, which is not all that different from what we experience in America.

When the action begins, which is pretty quick, you can't stop watching. There is plenty of action and adventure in this movie, but around the middle of it you begin to wonder how much Michael Douglas can take, or rather, how much his character will put up with it. Unfortunately, though the plot is very clever and much like \\"Total Recall\\", it becomes too improbable to take seriously. I was disappointed in that aspect of it, but that didn't make me leave my seat. I enjoyed it very much, I thought Sean Penn and Michael Douglas did an extraordinary job. Good filler for a late and boring afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL","review":"One of the finest filmmakers of our time has treated us with another fine delicacy of Hollywood filmmaking. David Fincher's finely tuned visuals, mixed with Howard Shore's intoxicating and disturbing original score, coupled with Michael Douglas' well played role, makes for one excellent escape.

A great movie will entertain you, as well as it will leave you with something, emotionally. This is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 10","review":"Combines many aspects of different movie genres, including very effective film noir aspects. It is obvious that the screenwriters and Fincher know what they are doing. The story couldn't be better with lots of philosophical questions and is full of suspense. You constantly want to find out what happens next and throughout the journey you are sceptical that it will be successful but halleluja! Douglas is ideal and I am very surprised that this previous viewer from San Diego was disappointed with the characterization of the film - IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE! Most definite: one of the best American films I have seen - among Highlander, Contact, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"This did not get enough publicity","review":"I think if this movie had been advertised then it would have been real popular. If you like plot twists and trying to figure how it's going to end then this is the movie for you. This movie is about a man who gets a birthday present from his brother and has no clue what it is. Neither does the audience, finding out is one of the best parts"},{"rating":"2","title":"mind numbing thriller!","review":"this movie was a hellava ride. More movies should be made that have so many twists and turns. The ending was a bit far fetched but non the less great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unique Movie","review":"The game is a very unique film and really can't compare it to anything else I have ever seen. It is almost a combination of a horror, suspense, action and drama movie put together in one. Very entertaining to watch yet thought the ending was a little off. It should keep your attention well from beginning to end. A more middle of the road role for Michael Douglas to play but still a good fit for him.Peter J. Miller"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game","review":"This is an excellent movie that really has you thinking and you probably need to watch it more than 1 time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Douglass Film","review":"I thought that this movie was great! I really loved it. Douglass has done it again, without him, this film would be terrible. I know that a lot of people hated this movie, like my friend. But do you know what his favorite movie is? \\"The Avengers\\" possible the worst movie ever made. The people who made \\"The Avengers\\" were just wasting time, money, and video's to record onto. If your a fan of Douglass then rent or buy this movie. You wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel","review":"I agree with the viewer from San Diego.

Director David Fincher delivers a suspense thrill ride of a movie which has enough twists to keep you guessing until the movie ends. Michael Douglas gives his usual believable outstanding performance as a cold control freak who's reality is turned upside down after an intriguing gift to play a \\"game\\" by his brother(Sean Penn). All the elements of a true psychological thriller are here but that is all that this movie ends in having: just elements. The story builds such high power tension and suspense that that to have the climatic resolve it offers as a finale is almost downright insulting. If this were a porn movie, the climax would disappoint all viewers. Suggestion: Michael Douglas has plenty of movie hits to see....I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid movie","review":"this movie does not worth writing review on it. it is a waist of money to buy it or rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow.","review":"This movie was very slow and very difficult to understand the actual plot. I fell asleep within the first half hour of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous philosophy","review":"The philosophy of this film is a very dangerous one: This ist faschism in it's most modern way, blasphemy, man's arrogance in it's most concentrated way. There is no man on earth to whom anyone has the right to play games like that. This is no game - this is brainwashing, breaking the rules, hurting human dignity. No man on earth has the right to do things like these to another - no matter how evil the man should be: God has meant men to be free to decide wether to be good or to be bad. This freedom cannot and MUST not been taken away by man. Or we will find us somewhere in a somewhat \\"brave new world\\"!Summary: How a pity that Nicholas revolver didn't really shoot - all who where taking part in this game should have been killed! They must be supposed to be members of a dangerous sect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pardon me for laughing....","review":".....but how does this dog even rate a DVD version, much less a Criterian Blu-ray release? I saw this POS in the theater way back when and was totally disappointed at how manipulative it was, how transparent it was, and ultimately, how stupid it was. When Sean Penn disappears early in the movie you know right away that he's behind all of it, and then at the end when he pops up and it's all a big joke, I would have shot him right there. Rarely have I left a theater pissed off but to have everything that happens explained away in the end as just a big elaborate practical joke, I just felt cheated. Having a Criterion version of this is the ultimate act of polishing a turd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding story line","review":"well written story with twists and surprises throughout. Michael Douglas and Sean Penn lead us to a grand finale. Michael Douglas plays his somewhat typical \\"Rich Guy\\" role - and plays it well. Penn is perfect as the shady brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trappings Of Wealth","review":"Michael Douglas once again allows a pretty girl to draw him into dangerous waters, expose his flawed thinking, then provoke him to marshall his forces to fight evil. The twist is that she turns out to be a pawn in an even larger scheme. The last 5 minutes becomes a little silly, but there is effective tension and suspense along the way. A \\"playa\\" gets \\"played.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I've enjoyed many movies by the Douglas clan over the years, and this one was no exception.

The ending was so unbelievably far fetched it made my skin crawl. What would they have done if the guy decided to throw himself of the other side of the building, or blow his brains out, or even thrown himself in front of a bus???...PA - LEASE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy movie, no rules","review":"The movie keeps you guessing, right up until the end. The end reveals just how baseless the movie is. Think about it....the movie is based on something that simply put, would never happen, not even a chance. Again, what are the odds that a guy trapped in a taxi cab that goes over a seawall, survives?....same guy falling many stories......survives? Happy birthday??? Awful, insulting. Sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst endings I've seen","review":"Fincher has this thing with endings. \\"Seven\\" was awful until the final 30 minutes, which contained his best work. \\"The Fight Club\\" was wittier than I expected, but the ending was abysmal. And \\"The Game\\" has the worst ending of any movie I can think of right now. If you thought it was a good ending, do yourself a favor -- replay the movie, for real or in your head, and look at how close Douglas's character comes to being killed. Then replay the ending and his reaction when he discovers it's all a \\"game.\\" \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" was more in tune to human nature than this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful !!","review":"Very far-fetched, even for a movie... Insults the average man's intelligence, need not say what it does to the intelligence of a thinking man...Michael Douglas is probably the only positive aspect of this otherwise silly film. Maybe if viewed by an audience of bright-eyed, gullable, 12-year olds, the movie would reach it's full potential with it's so-called surprises.I must honestly say this picture was one of the biggest dissapointments I have witnessed, considering I was looking forward to an excellent thriller, but what I got was a goofy, rediculous fantasy...For anyone contemplating a purchase, please consider renting first. Then, after you view \\"The Game\\", you will understand why any truly intelligent person would NOT make this a purchase...What an awfully overrated movie !!

Onward: Michael Douglas = worse actor than a trained monkey; hearing Sean Penn say \\"touche\\" is plain torture; how Fincher went from this atrocity to Fight Club, the best movie of 1999, is an enigma better left unexplored. On the whole, a film so flat as to be two-dimensional; it has no redeeming features, I assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I have never met anyone who actually liked this movie.","review":"This movie is a flop, plain and simple. The acting is subpar, camerawork is shoddy, and the storyline is incomprehensible. Is there a movie that is more farfetched (besides the Da Vinci Code)? The ending is unbelievable, as in no one would believe that someone would actually go through all the trouble to play a prank on somebody like they did to Michael Douglas. It's hard to believe that famous actors like Douglas and Sean Penn actually signed on to this drivel. They must have liked the \\"twist ending,\\" that only was a twist because it made no sense. Seriously people, how could you enjoyed this movie?! It says it is a \\"thinking-man's thriller.\\" What? The only thoughts I had was \\"Whuhh?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best psycological thrillers ever made","review":"The Game is by far one of the single best psycological thrillers ever made movie wise. Of course it is from the director of Seven, the movie is a slow pace here and there but you have to watch the whole movie to fully understand the big picture. I personally love suspense trillers and try to guess the plotline as the movie progresses along the timeline of the movie. When I first saw this movie I never expected the outcome that occured in the movie but it is one of few movies I can watch from start to finish and keep my intrest all the way threw to the end. So if you enjoy some good suspense triller movies, and trying to guess the outcome of the movie as the movie goes along then this is the movie for you to enjoy and watch on a day off from work or with some pals."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing","review":"The first time I saw this movie, I did not know what to expect and it was quite a thrill ride. The second time I saw this movie, a long time after my first time, It was frankly, a thrill ride. With plots and twists that seem predictable but come out of nowhere at times, the pacing of this film is well done. Technically, its up there with brilliance in the editing department ,especially sound editing. Visually, it is arresting for its flair and use of colors in situations where an ambience and atmosphere needed. Plot wise I would have liked to see more of a connection of the main character's thoughts about his father linked to the actual game that was happening. A morose ending of this movie would have been boredom and it felt anticlimatic but what could a viewer ask? you watch this movie and find out. David Fincer hasn't made a name for himself for nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood Is Back","review":"After watching Seven - I expected to see a less of a Hollywood ending to this one.

If you were lucky to collect films on laserdisc in the 90's you had the chance to own this Fincher classic; unfortunately, you cannot partake of its supplemental material on dvd. It is a JOKE that whichever studio owns the rights will not give this the deluxe treatment. It isn't as though Fincher is some hack - look at what he's accomplished.

Loved it! This is a little talked about gem and Michael Douglas is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmet Expectations","review":"The Game has the potential to be an exquisite thriller if it had remained the homage to revenge fantasies it started out being. However, towards the climax of the film, the rug is rudely ripped out from under the feet of the viewer as we are now treated to a film that decided to be a thinking man's thriller. In order for the Game to be a thriller, there would have to be genuine thrills instead of jaw-droppingly pallid scenes involving Douglas plunging to near-certain death only to \\"miraculously\\" survive. Apparently, the filmmaker has mistaken roller-coaster ride style shocks for thrills of a psychological bent.The pseudo twist ending made the film an incoherent mess and failed to invite the viewer to reflect at all. And I watched this film closely.In summary, the Game is an entertaining watch if its on TV for free and you've nothing better to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!!!","review":"I didnt think it would work that well by looking at the pic, but it works suprisingly well!

Like those singer/songwriters, Husik wraps her pleasing, dusky voice around off-kilter lyrics, buffeted by hazy guitars, percussive beats, and the occasional organ bleat. On some songs, such as \\"Hateful Hippy Girls,\\" she appears to have been possessed by the spirit of \\"Hyaena\\"-era Siouxsie, singing in a lower register over musical backing that sounds vaguely sinister. The highlight of the set is the trippy \\"Farmhouse,\\" which samples surly, raspy-voiced bartender Louis \\"Red\\" Deutsch of Tube Bar fame (\\"Who you wanna talk to?! Who you wanna talk to?!\\"), basis of a long running routine on \\"The Simpsons.\\" Shimmy Disc founder Kramer (Bongwater) produced the recording with his trademark airy, atmospheric touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"dream pop","review":"While Husik went onto more acclaim with her later electonica, this and her next album, Your Bag, are more akin to the V.U., Syd Barrett's solo work, or Josephine Wiggs' early project, Honeytongue. It's all dreamy, languid, echoey, and wonderful. Hers is very personal music - not singer/songwriter confessional but music born of dark dreams, hazey and strongly imagistic. Husik writes great melodies and does great things with her layering of electric guitars. The standout song for me is \\"Farmhouse,\\" which is by turns delicate and ferocious, all seamlessly intertwined. \\"I passed a farmhouse / lit up in a lonely field. / It's so cold on a winter's road, / farmhouses lit up like gold...\\"Many became popular for similar but less striking music.

The beauty of this book is the connection that I felt with the author, who in spite of his passage many decades ago, echoed the very sentiments I felt during my own Hajj, and my own spiritual journey through life. His beautifully woven eloquence, thought, and understanding create a unique tapestry of visions in this wordsmith's hands. The book is in my opinion valid, touching, and opens a portal to the Hajj for those who are interested in the trip. As the author emphasizes, the Hajj is a microcosm in the journey of life, and reflective of his larger journey toward Islam, as a submission to the religion which he embraced. The book is a study in metaphysics, cultural anthropology, and is simultaneously a fascinating autobiographical reflection by a convert to Islam. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The road to Guidance","review":"Muhammad Asad has lucidly detailed his travels in the heart of the muslim world where he discovers true happiness in reverting to Islam.

But of course the second half of the book has lost most of its validity since the bodies have been located. But it is interesting how many people claimed to have seen the Empress and her daughters alive and being used by Lenin as pawns.

Imagine a cup of green tea that someone poured some jasmine-scented perfume into. Or maybe dissolved some jasmine-flavored candy into. I saw someone say it was Pez flavored, and I can agree with that. But no matter how you describe it, it is undrinkable. Second cup was poured down the sink.And it isn't just the initial taste.

I recommend people get one from their local supermarket and try it before buying six boxes from amazon. Besides the taste, the \\"Natural Flavors\\" ingredient also concerns me. Basically, you don't know what you are drinking. Just because it says natural, it doesn't mean it's harmless.

Even the other third wave analysts like Rogers and Maslow still take a more abstract approach: they suggest ideas on how to function optimally in interpesonal relationships, but don't dig very deep into the application, or the how. This book uses practices that have parallels in Zen buddhism and other sorts of experience-oriented disciplines, but doesn't praise any particular system or thinker. The presentation of the material is very simple and informal--taken from live lectures. Thus, nothing is academically obscure. Rather, its as though one is listening to a very integrated human being who is beyond the need to aggrandize himself through helping others. This is a very good book for people that wish to open themselves up to the full experience of living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Insightful Probings into the Human Psyche","review":"Fritz was a genius, and this book proves it.

A bad bad spine chiller (we are talking monster birds attacking the narrator in a haunted house), that has no literary depth whatsoever.

It will just disgust you."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm disappointed..........expectations were high","review":"Bret Easton Ellis is one of my favorite writers. All of his books (except THE INFORMERS) are brilliant. I got an advance reading copy of LUNAR PARK a few months ago. I'm so disappointed. The beginning and the end are AMAZING, but the rest is just a bad Stephen King novel. The whole middle section is extremely tedious, and honestly, pretty dumb. For this we had to wait seven years? What a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"puhhhh-thetic","review":"Nothing special at all about this book. Just a lot of vodka, weeping and a poor stab at ghosts and or demons. I read the countless instances where he was weeping, and couldn't feel an ounce of his sorrow. I read about the demon toy doll and just fought to get through those pages. The terby ripped apart a horse, the toy scratched up a door and then a mound of hair attacked him. Almost like a bad R rated episode of scooby doo.BEE's previous novel, Glamaroma, a masterpiece, makes this book read even worse than it really does. If writing Glamorama almost killed him, then writing this book was just a stroll to the bank in comparison. It's only fitting that in Lunar Park, his dog, properly named Victor, despises him and eventually almost kills him. I'd give this 1 star, but at least the author writes that his desire to create characters like Patrick Bateman has come to an end, which warns that this book won't have any special characters. Which it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"Having read good reviews of this and seen the author read parts himself, the reality turns out to be awful. There is no narrative tension, is aimed at a very low intelligence and at times is simply pompous. It's cynical criticism of rich suburban life in America is breathtakingly arrogant given the poverty of the world. The story borrows shamelessly from everything from cheap horror films, Spielberg, Ghostbusters and of course Stephen King. The main character staggers through the book not noticing the most basic clues until too late. For anyone who has read any half decent books in their life with real characters, this is just rubbish. My suspicion is in fact that it is written as a film script with dollars attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"80% Suburbia 20% Drug Hallucinations","review":"I'm beginning to regard Ellis as the voice of generation X, but this slice of wealthy family life topped with a scoop of Dean Koontz never quite gels (like \\"Imperial Bedrooms\\" never quite blends it's famous characters with the movie industry.) Ellis has stunning powers of observation and fascinating literary language, but often struggles to tie them into a resonant conclusion. Still, it does have important things to imply about marriage and raising children today."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars; aside from which a description eludes me.","review":"This is a tough one to describe, but it's my favorite Ellis novel. Ellis aims this story at the classic horror genre but keeps steering the wagon off the rails into postmodern metafiction, a weirdly false autobiographical indictment of his own celebrity image, and some Cheever-esque forays into modern suburban gothic. If you have a twisted sense of humor, many scenes are genuinely hilarious. Perhaps most importantly, Ellis visits the complex emotions and dynamics of father-son relationships many times and with great effect - building to a transcendent ending to a novel so bizarre it almost feels unfair. In this reviewer's opinion, Ellis pulls it off masterfully and I look forward to reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a huge Ellis fan, I really wanted to like this book, and approached it with an open mind, despite having heard quite a few negative (as well as some highly positive) reviews from fellow Ellis fans.While the first chapter of the book (where Ellis recounts his own life and success) was captivating, I just found the rest dull and redundant overall. This is not to say that it doesn't have its merits - its account of suburban life is spot-on, and the book also gives you a glimpse into Ellis' inner world. For me, this last aspect alone made it worthwile to read, but after finishing the last page, I was missing that \\"Oh my God...\\", staring into space for long seconds moment that I got from his other works (Glamorama, Less than zero)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"I thought this was Ellis' best book yet!

There is no reason to believe that he will ever be anything more than an average writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get into it","review":"I'm a big fan of his earlier work, American Psycho--a very good novel and movie is fairly good with an awesome portrayal of Patrick Bateman by the new Batman Christian Bale.

The first chapter was excellent. There was so much promise. I even got excited when I found characters from the book with their own homepages. There are so many ideas that I love in this book that I was sad to see them wasted. It is intense and spooky... but thats about the only thing going for it. In total I found it to be a mess. There was no direction whatsoever. There was no character development (the main character is so frustratingly oblivious you will want to strangle him).With much of the books lifted from what I attribute to Stephen King novels and The House of Leaves by Danielewski I say read the originals. At least those writers are not completely full of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just went on and on about nothing","review":"Whilst in San Francisco in 2005 was in a bookstore where Ellis read the first few pages of this book at a book signing. Now 3 years later after finally picking up a copy to take on holidays the great expectant read I anticipated never happened. The book just went on and on and never really went anywhere. Every page you turned waiting for the story to step to the next level,but it never does. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"Bret Eason Ellis' newest novel is a waste of time, paper and money. The ridiculousness of the plot line, the bloated egotism and the poor Stephen King rip-off used to gather incompatible story lines makes for a read that a high school English teacher would characterize as \\"needing focus\\".I think this book was an attempt at creating a modern day tragedy. Man fights inner demons. Man fights societies rules. Man fights pressures to be responsible to his family. Man fights, and fights and fights - to what end? Drug and alcohol abuse? A failure to reach any of his goals? Ok - then let that be the story as opposed to having to resort to absorb plot twists utilizing demons to try and pull divisive story lines together."},{"rating":"1","title":"lunar park","review":"very disappointing read - it seems as if he said to self - \\"i will throw together this lame attempt and the public will buy it on the strength of my previous work\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined my view of him as an author with this drivel","review":"This book is SO BAD, and Ellis' writing is executed at such a low level that it is hard to even critique it; it would be like writing an in-depth review of a double cheeseburger at Burger King: it makes no sense.The intro is lazy, self-absorbed, and stupid. You did drugs, drank, wore fancy clothes, blah, blah,blah...: who cares?The middle picks up and the writing between Ellis and his female assistant is the most truthful emotional writing that Ellis has ever done, and then BAM!The book drops off as if Ellis was like , \\"What can I do now, Knopf will pay me on delivery for this book, I'll toss some inane thriller story and call it surreal, yeah, that's it. I'm cool.\\"Utterly pathetic. And I hate saying that, because I thought American Psycho was one of the best books of the late 20th century.He really ruined my view of him as an author with this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunar Park","review":"I thought Ellis tried to use his character's drug induced state to write a \\"shocking\\" story. It was actually a poorly written, self serving, egotistical contrived story. He uses so many adjectives (more than my previous sentence) and descriptions to try to make the book colorful that you could skip whole paragraphs and still not miss what went on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I wanted to put it down after 25 pages, but I kept reading in hopes that it would get better. It did, but it was still horribly unsatisfying, although it had some of the makings of a good read. The relationship development read like George Lucas dialogue, and the name-dropping ad nauseum and contextualized drug use were overdone.Read it if you're a big fan; otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The metafiction aspect of this work was about the only thing that kept me turning the pages to the end. As a long-time fan of Bret Easton Ellis, reading about the main character's outrageous life in the literary brat pack of the 90's was a fun romp, but the story itself was a bit tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It","review":"For a book that starts out with a pseudo autobiography, for a book that features a self-indulgent main character, for a book that draws its themes from a series of obvious inspirations (including Shakespeare), I was pleasantly pulled along. Unlike some of Ellis' other stuff, it was clear to me that the construction of the book was well developed and tightly layered. The tension builds slowly. The book dabbles in straight detective stuff, then veers gently (how is that possible?) into horror turf. Yet when the blood comes, it seems even more real, even more damaging, even more of a catharsis. If you can't get past the self-centered main character, put the book down. If you feel yourself surprised to be with this guy for so long, keep reading because the end is worth the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame.","review":"I was so relieved when I found this book by Ellis at an obscure airport gift shop with no other book options. I was excited to read something on the flight & to really get into a book. I typically have enjoyed Ellis' ideas & his style of writing. However, this book seemed to me to be written as some sort of lame joke. I do not think that Ellis spent a lot of mental energy developing characters or thinking out the plot. It read like a B rated thriller, & a bad one at that. I almost wonder whether he wrote this book to meet contractual obligations of a book contract. Check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lunar Park","review":"American Psycho was sick, twisted and blackly funny in equal parts.

It was boring, arrogant and a complete waste of time. I bought the book for my vacation where i can read anything and I forced myself to read it... assuming it would get better, which it never did.If Ellis really cashed in his chips and moved to the 'burbs, well, he completely lost his edge.If your shopping for a read, buy something from McInerney who can still write without the drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal!","review":"Used library book, but still in good condition.

I could easily have done without this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"Having read all of Mr Ellis's previous works, there is no doubt that they get worse with time. As another Amazon review points out they are basically the same story re-hashed.So Mr Ellis, as you do have a good grasp of the nilhist world in which we live and you can string together a great narrative, why don't you pull that finger out and write the novel that you are capable of?You never know, you might even enjoy it :-) Ho HumUnless you are real fan, I wouldn't really recommend reading this rather introverted and dull diatribe."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but not the greatest","review":"this book started off great - ellis writes in an entertaining fashion as in his other novels (and takes it back to the basics as he claims to do in the opening chapter). as i got into it, it got a bit too fantastical for my liking. if you are looking for a quick 1-2 day read, you can grab this book. my main problem with the book is that i expected to be moved and feel for the characters, but just when i was about to, uncanny freak coincidences take over and ulitmately those take away from the character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"dipping your toes into writing","review":"The text brings back fond memories of essay writing in school. All the timeless advice about how to write a concise article is here. Exemplified by passages from a wide variety of short stories, some of which must surely get any reader's interest. The main idea seems to be to transition the student from being a passive reader to becoming a writer. Part of this involves training the student to read a passage more analytically.

It has a single wide-blade that is supposed to be used for both the beard and the moustache. Without a narrow-blade it is very difficult to define the line of moustache because the wide blade cuts at un-intended places too.2. The blade is so weak that it can't be used to form the outline of the beard cleanly. Hairs outside the outline of the beard can't get a close cut.Why 1 star--For an important thing like this, one can be either completely satisfied or completely un-satisfied, there can't be anything between the two; nobody likes to spend money and time to settle for something mediocre.Within a week I switched to another trimmer and I like it very much. Its Wahl Groomsman XL2, I bought it at Walmart. It has dual blades; and it works great in trimming and removing unwanted hairs (the only bad thing about this is it is a bit noisy compared to Norelco T765)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"This trimmer works better than most in all areas (esp. battery charge life!!!)the only downside i've experienced is that it tends to get clogged frequently and cutting efficency deminishes. so clean it as you use it, and all is well!Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean cut","review":"This \\"basic\\" model does the trick for my beard.

Have just spent 20 minutes of my time trimming a shortish (about 1.5\\" long) beard. This is ludicrous! My old, basic Remington clippers, which I was dumb enough to throw away when I acquired this item, would have handled the job in less than three minutes.

But I did notice right away that (a) it doesn't hold a charge very long and (b) takes a while to do the job, with a lot of passes. The short charge life means one more charger I have to take on vacation. It needs so many passes to do the job it takes longer than it used to take to shave, and the battery starts to wind down before I'm done.

It won't hold a charge at all. Even when it is plugged in, it's not receiving enough power to barely turn the motor.

You have to go over and over and over the same spot to cut your beard with any semblance of uniformity. Also you have to be careful to apply equal pressure each time or your cut could be spotty because of the spring loaded guide. Also as others have said if you want a close trim, you will probably end up looking like a bad joke with plenty of skin showing.The design is bad, and the battery croaked after a few years of use(while religiously following the use/recharge guide).Kind of annoying but probably for the best, since I can get a better unit now.When you look at the selection of 115-220 volt travel trimmers its no wonder that Norelco is producing garbage theres almost no competition.

Who knew Gracie could dance like that? Okay, a bit of Ginger would have spiced up the movie, but I found it a delight from beginning to end. Great laughs, great dancing, great music and lyrics. What more could I ask for? Why the missing DVD, of course! PLEASE!!! I keep checking Amazon, yet still I wait. I am getting old! DAMSEL IN DISTRESS on DVD please!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Fred's Best","review":"A Damsel in Distress is one of Fred Astaire's lesser celebrated films because of that one missing element: Ginger Rogers. Made during the time when one never mentioned the name Astaire without Rogers (or Rogers without Astaire, for that matter), it certainly suffered an enormous public backlash, unfairly so I might add. This is a clever film which takes advantage of Astaire's underrated comedic talents. The Gershwin score is timeless. \\"A Foggy Day\\" is a \\"must see\\" Astaire performance. But for all you Astaire-Rogers fanatics who aren't quite convinced, I must agree that the volatile chemistry between Fred and Ginger is nowhere to be found, but it's still a worthwhile film, a classic in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD","review":"We'd been waiting for this classic movie-musical-comedy to come out on DVD, and we weren't disappointed when it finally did. Everything looks so much better in the spring cleaning of this Astaire, Burns and Allen, and Gershwin flick in which Hollywood goes to P.G. Wodehouse's house in jolly old England where not much makes much sense, but it hardly matters, since the whole thing is more like a piece of music rather than a closely plotted novel. It's all pure entertainment that purely entertains. Wodehouse said his books were like old-fashoned musical comedy rather than modern tragedy, and his novel this movie is based on is certainly typical of the former, and the Gershwin brothers' great songs help to seal the deal. Astaire makes graceful dance look easy and inevitable through \\"Foggy London Town,\\" while Burns and Allen do some of their better routines and more. See the funhouse segment with Gracie in the middle like a bobbing bobbin. It's all so simple that it somehow works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FOGGY DAY IN LONDON TOWN.","review":"The romantic life of Lady Alyce Marshmorton is the subject of much gossip and wagers among the servants of Totleigh Castle, the Marshmorton estate. To win a marriage \\"pool\\" which has been instigated by head domestic Keggs, Albert, a young servant of the estate, forges a love letter from Alyce to American comedy star Jerry Halliday, whom she had met briefly in a London taxicab.... A downright peculiar picture which works better than might be expected. Certainly Joan Fontaine was no musical performer, but the inventive, Oscar-winning choreography by Hermes Pan is stunning: the Fun House sequence is particularly memorable. The film fizzled upon its initial release in 1937. Apparently audiences felt that Fred without Ginger was like corned beef without cabbage: edible, but only if you're very, very hungry.

Since we have so little film of Vaudeville, this movie shows us what we missed. The wiskbroom routine surely came from the stage, and the dialogue between Gracie and George and Fred surely came from the stage. Come on folks. Don't compare this film with Ginger and Fred. Its not supposed to be like Top Hat. I personally like Damsel more than Swing Time which doesn't feature enough dancing in the first hour. Sure Joan Fontaine is lost but she's only 19!!

She sleepwalks through the entire thing, with the possible exception of the rather pretty title song, and only comes to life on ALWebber's \\"Love Changes Everything.\\" The latter is available on other CDs and the former is not worth the price of this collection of messes, unless you are perverse enough to want to hear one of the best voices in creation singing \\"nibby nob nooby bibby bop boopy\\" on \\"Good Morning Sunshine.\\" I just wasted nearly $35 on this disaster.

I do keep business cards in it and it's very convenient since I need a business card handy for each time that I use the Palm for business.The future change that I suggest is a different closure that doesn't require looking at the case, a lot of dexterity to get the little tab into the loop, or if your hands are full it's a little hard.

I love the little slots which I have a credit card in, and my receipts when I go shopping.I am giving it 4 stars because....The slot that you keep the stylus in gets pretty loose over time, because it is located in the crease, and I am constantly losing the stylus. It just falls right out if the Palm is upside down. (one time I had to use an eyeliner pencil for almost a week before I found another stylus)AND, the little loop and thread closer is a little annoying, I would like velcro better.Another reason, which would probably not bother right handed people, I am left handed and the flap hits me in the hand when I am typing away sometimes.Other than this, it is great, and worth every penny. I would have paid $30 for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The second image posted shows this case opening like a wallet, with a space to store cash.

All the elements that made Sparta such a great and unique band have been wiped away for Threes. Like others before me have said, this record feels extremely disorganized.

Natalie displays her top-notch vocal chops on the R&B classic \\"What You Won't Do For Love\\", the stand-out track on this album. Her voice swoops and swerves over a jazz influenced track, making her performance comparable with Barbra Streisand or jazz greats Sarah Vaughn or Ella Fitzgerald. All in all, \\"We're the Best of Friends\\" is a classic, mellow album with fine production and excellent vocal performances from Natalie Cole. Peabo's OK, too. I forgot to mention the excellent \\"Let's Fall in Love/ You Send Me.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate flies . . . .

The book teaches you how to draw Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie's anatomy, and the best thing about the book is if you look at a picture of another character (for example, Apu), you can use Homer's anatomy (not making him so fat, mind you) and draw Apu from there.

I constantly have to recharge them and 2 sets are not enough for my needs- I previously never needed to take my charger with me on vacations of up to two weeks, but if I were to rely on 2 sets of these batteries, I would need to bring the charger for a weekend jaunt with scant flash photography. Don't spend your hard earned money on these batteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The 2650mAh's self-discharged too soon","review":"The Duracell 2650mAh batteries surprised me by being dead when I needed them (I thought they were ready and good for use). It's been only a couple of weeks roughly since I recharged the 2650mAh's prior to my attempt to use the batteries. The astonishingly fast self-discharge rate make the 2650mAh's impractical/inconvenient.

I wrapped it up in a sock and threw it outside. The battery was very hot.I've had the Duracells for under a year and These batteries never really held a charge for long but was good enough for the convenience. I emailed Duracell today to see what they want to do about the faulty battery. I have 12 AA and 4AAA.6/4/10 Duracell has yet to contact me. The problem has been reported to them so if someone gets injured by their batteries they have failed to follow up on a potential problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not charge past 1,000 mAH.","review":"Purchased 3 packs of these. Mine are labeled made in Japan. Read somewhere some are marked make in China?These are the worst batteries I have ever purchased. I tried 2 different charges. Just purchased a La Crosse Technology BC-700 from here thinking that would help. It can't charge them past 1,000 mAH. It is not the charger.Update.. wanted to post that I told the charger to discharge the cells first, than charge. When that failed, I told it to condition it, i.e. discharge, charge, until some change, 3 days of this. This didn't work. Will not hold a charge, will not take the full charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some don't hold a charge","review":"I had bought two sets of these as the \\"4-pack\\". Sadly, half of my batteries don't hold a charge. Since I have the La Crosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Charger, I can check the current voltage of the batteries. After brief usage, some batteries still had high voltage, while others had completely run out!! Consequently, I don't use the ones that don't hold a charge (and the others work just fine). I own many other brands of batteries, but these are the worst. I think the Rayovac have been the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I am so totally disappointed by these batteries that I could simply spit bullets. I bought them for my digital camera about four months ago. I am *not* a big photo enthusiast so only grab the camera for \\"special\\" events like the kids recital at school, birthdays, and so on. Imagine my dismay to find that all eight of these batteries totally lose their charge after sitting for a day or two after a recharge. I've even tried a different recharger....same results. The no-name batteries that came with my camera work like a charm....these name brand tripe are heading for the recycle bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First set to die","review":"I purchased an eight pack of batteries for two Canon flashes.

I put in a third set (recently charged),and they were dead immediately :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice for a camera flash","review":"These are absolute garbage for photography. I read the user reviews about the long shelf like and liked the high capacity rating, but my experience has been the opposite in the 3 months or so I've had them. It seems like they can't hold a charge for even a week, after an overnight charge.

I'll try the Sanyo Eneloops of Panasonics next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't hold a charge!","review":"Bought 8 of these Duracell 2650 mAh rechargeables right before my 2-week archaeological expedition to a remote desert in Peru, because they were supposed to last so long in my digital camera. Wow, did it *suck* that not a one of them held their charge! These batteries are worse than useless - they almost caused me to miss my photo-ops for this whole trip!Good thing I'd also brought along a pack of Energizer Lithium batteries, because they seriously kicked *ss, and even lasted much longer than I'd expected (way over 600 pictures per set)!Never trusting Duracells again!(wish I could give zero- or negative-stars in the rating!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more fumbling","review":"Having these extra rechargeable batteries has been wonderful.

They are wonderful. I have saved a lot of money by investing in these batteries. Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times. It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal duracell alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power. For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power. But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now. I highly recommend them to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rechargeble batteries","review":"This is the best rechargeble batteries I have come across by far.

After a full charge, I can expect to get a solid run out of them (250 photos, 1/4 of them with flash) from my Canon A710IS, but leave those batteries sitting in the camera for a few days???

I'd recommend looking into another product, as I'll personally avoid Duracell going forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product","review":"Bought these a few months back, and they are worthless. They seem to lose most of their charge in a week (or less). In use, they die very quickly.I have a couple older AA Duracell batteries that work just fine ... so maybe Duracell changed something.

The bad/newer batteries are colored green/black and say \\"Made in Japan\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have used alkaline Duracell batteries for years and have always been satisfied with their quality. Recently I purchased a number of these rechargeable NiMH batteries and have been sadly disappointed. They won't hold a charge! The only way that I have found them usable at all is to take them from the charger and use them right away - otherwise they are dead before they get started. Sorry, Duracell, but you have really hurt yourself - and your faithful customers - with this poor product. Even though I have a number of these and they have been used almost not at all I will likely toss them out and buy some other brand that will work when I need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST of the rechargeables.","review":"I purchased a high-end battery charger (Lacrosse)and of the 3 different brands of batteries that I use, these are by far the worst in terms of how long they hold the charge.

And unfortunately, these batteries leak faster than any rechargeable cells I've ever encountered.The nominal charge on all NiMH cells is 1.2V. Usually right after a charge, they'll be 1.36 or so, and even after a few months should be around 1.3. However, all these batteries leak far faster than that. After two weeks of just sitting in a box, of the eight I charged, two were down to 0.94 volts, others hovering near a volt, and the best of them barely reading 1.2.I'm afraid Duracell has permanently damaged their reputation with me because of this. Oddly, I bought an identical-looking set from them two years earlier, and they are still going great. There must be some defect with these -- but judging by the most recent reviews here, it is hardly an isolated incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waist money for them.","review":"They do not last too long.

They seem to work more or less OK if you just need batteries that work for a day or two, but it's an absolute must to leave them in the charge up until the moment they're needed. Stay away if you can.*Edit:To Duracell's credit, when I complained in their comment section of the website, they sent me coupons for replacement rechargeables, which I used to buy some of the \\"precharged\\" (low self-discharge) ones.

I am going to suffer greatly when I have read them all and have to await a new publication!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner!","review":"Each one of the Jack Reacher books seems to be better than the last. I absolutely love Child's shotgun style, and Reacher is definitely my favourite character in the thriller genre. Child's pared-down writing style makes his books beg to be read quickly. And Reacher is the quintessential tough guy. He's always one step ahead of everyone else, including the bad guys, and he's not afraid of a fight in a good cause. In this book Reacher gets mixed up with some Russian bad guys who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. There's a lot about snipers in the book, and that is incredibly interesting. We also get to meet some wonderful secondary characters. I particularly like the ex-marine Cash in this one. A guy right after Reacher's own heart. They are almost like two sides of a coin. Child excels in describing these \\"Buddy-scenarios\\". But Reacher never hangs around with any of them afterwards. He's always on his way to his next adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, intense, and intriguing!","review":"This was my first Lee Child novel, but definitely not my last. Jack Reacher is a fascinating character with an intriguing and somewhat mysterious background which makes for great reading. I also enjoyed reading about sniper training and operations in such great detail. Other reviewers seem disappointed that this novel is not more of a \\"classic\\", but I found it very entertaining! The other characters could have been fleshed out more, but the author obviously wanted to focus our attention on his larger-than-life protagonist. The plot may have seemed far-fetched to some, but it was a great, hard to put down read! I'm ordering more Jack Reacher novels today."},{"rating":"2","title":"he's back in great form","review":"i couldnt put this book down.. he is back and at his best.. great writing, premise a bit contrived but who cares.. what a gem of a protagonist in reacher!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I originally bought a couple of the \\"Reacher\\" books after reading the one in which he was a MP major which I thought was great.

Don't wait for the softcover, this is worth the price of hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but could have been better","review":"I read all Jack Reacher books and for some reason, this one just didn't quite do it for me. I think part of it was the story wasn't as good. SPOILER! The criminal enterprise which set up James Barr for those killing was just too improbable. Why bother setting him up when they could have done the shootings themselves and noone would have been the wiser. I'm also tired of Jack Reacher being a hobo.

Names only and maybe a slight premise of what the book is about but that's all. The book was enjoyable, once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I think I read it in less than a week, which is good for me.

Fortunately for enthusiasts the standard is high. Childs always gives the reader a great story full of characters you actually care about. This story is about a former military sniper who had a serious run in with Reacher years ago. However, when the sniper is arrested for killing 5 Reacher is the person he reaches out to help him.If you are already a Reacher fan you will not be disappointed. If you are not yet a fan do yourself a favor and read this book. You will probably join the legions of us who are hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure shot!","review":"The best of the series! This is the kind of writing that makes one read more. High quality writing, suspense, thrill, an absolutely smashing plot, and most importantly, fantastic character development. Even in the alpha male world of Reacher, the female characters hold on their own. And even being the alpha male, Reacher is human enough. Even being a tank of a man, Reacher beats the odd only with some responsible help.One may think the Reacher series is all about Reacher the one-man-army, but as with the others in the series, and more so in this installment, the suspenseful plot is the real star. So seemingly disjointed, only to gradually converge into a smashing climax! I have heard this novel has now been turned into a major motion picture, but I can guarantee the movie won't even come close to the thrill of this read.If you ever wanted to sample a Reacher novel, make sure it is this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"love Reacher but...","review":"this was a little slow.

Actually I do have to stop occasionally because I'm laughing too hard to read. This one is no exception. Gaping plot holes as usual. Why the heck had Chenko/Charlie been friends with Barr and going shooting with him for years? Just on the off chance he someday needed a sub-par sniper to be a fall guy? And a former Marine (not ex-Marine, Child, you nitwit) who owns and runs a shooting range and only owns one gun? Good thing he was a world-class shot so he could hit a bullseye at 300 yards with optics? Really? 300 yards?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read by Lee Child on Jack Reacher","review":"This story begins when a sniper methodically kills five office workers with six quick shots and then disappears.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome","review":"The book starts off well but begins to drag at the half-way mark and is a struggle to finish.

Jack Reacher is such an improbable hero, I love him to death!!!!! He's unbeatable and resilient!!!The story hooks you from the very beginning and I always want to see how Jack Reacher turns up in the adventure. After questioning the 'sniper' who asks them to find Jack Reacher, Reacher is found on South Beach in Miami with a Norwegian cruise chorus girl. Perfect!!!!! :DLee Child writes a tight storyline and your attention does not waver from side to side at any moment. Reacher gathers together a little clique to help him (including 2 women). The most interesting one is a former Marine named Cash who is one mighty big help to Reacher. Their little banter when they meet was typical Army/Marine. Hope to see this character in future novels. Enjoyed this book thru and thru."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner, Better Than The Movie","review":"This is one of Lee Child's best, so it's no wonder Cruise decided to do the movie. I recommend reading the book first, before seeing the movie. Jack Reacher is at his best. I'd rank some of the other Reacher books as 4 stars.

NOPE! There are pointless conversations, information is revealed by having Reacher explain very basic concepts to people who SHOULD already know these things, everybody ever said nothing - and these are just the stylistic concerns. There's the plot itself - never mind who pays for parking, who befriends an ex-sniper and goes to the range with him for years and pretends to be a s***ty shot in the random event his crazy ass sniper ways might be of use later??I gave the book two stars because I *was* entertained - it's just that my entertainment consisted of passing the book back and forth with my partner while we both screamed at the top of our lungs how bad it is, and drank waaaaaaaaay too much vodka for every time someone said nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Lee Child books keep me up all night and I get nothing done until I've read the whole thing.

The plot was a foregone conclusion mid way through, but the details Child included made the unraveling so much fun to read! Book reads like a movie, definitely. My only issues with the story are the cheeziness of Reacher/female romantic interactions and some of the ancillary characters lacked the depth one gets in the Bourne series. However, I'll definitely continue reading this series of books because of Reacher.. really cool character who is way too good of an assassin with the limited background information given.

I don't think anyone comes close to writing so clearly about a complex set of characters and events.A lone sniper opens fire on people leaving an office building in a small midwestern town. Five people killed senselessly. A major manhunt fortunately results in the sniper's capture; the evidence is overwhelming. The sniper refuses to talk except to say \\"Get Jack Reacher\\"; Reacher by his own design is untraceable but is on his way already...he's seen the national news coverage.

The book has plot holes and technical errors that, at times, require the reader to make absurd leaps of logic to be in any way invested.

Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I found this book at the airport, and since I enjoy Ludlum-type thrillers I decided to give this a shot. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get through the first chapter. I found Child's writing to be downright atrocious. Choppy sentences, and repetitive descriptions may work in children's books, but made this book unreadable for me. Maybe it gets better, but I was just not willing to put in the time wincing through poorly written sentences to find out. Next time I'll stick to the real thing and read a Ludlum book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I absolutely could not get into One Shot by Lee Child. I have never read anything by Child before, and I found that his clipped style of writing did not catch my interest. At no point did I get emotionally engaged in the story; he never made me care for any of the characters, not even his protagonist, Jack Reacher.Granted I did not finish the book, after 100 pages I decided life was too short to waste in reading a book I was not enjoying and put it down. Someone who likes the hard-boiled Sam Spade type of detective novels might enjoy this one, but I need a little more character development and engagement to get interested in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Child should have \\"...said nothing\\"","review":"I'm halfway through listening to this audiobook and have lost count of the number of times Lee Child writes \\"[Character's name] said nothing\\". This may seem trivial but, after the 50th use of this needless phrase, you'll be at your wits end too. Any editor worth his/her weight would have cut out 90% of these phrases as they are amateurish and add nothing to the book. You could practically turn these phrases into a drinking game - drink anytime you hear the phrase - guaranteed good times for all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Shot Movie","review":"I am a big fan of Jack Reacher series and have read all the books, but Lee Child has sold us all out, to make a favorite character into a caricature.

I never knew he had that range of emotion to be able to play the honest-but-wants-to-be-bad Robert and then play the good-but-I'll-kick-your-a** Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz make a great team. McGregor is an extremly talented actor and he makes a great comic actor! One of the best scenes is where he tries making a ransom call, but has to keep starting over because he messes up! This movie has everything: great direction, good actors, a great story, and puts more than a few more than welcome kinks into the romantic comedy formula, which is turned upside down! This film is underrated and if you've heard all the reviews simply see the film for yourself. And even if you don't like it, it's not a bad Friday night video rental.

Just when you think you are catching on, it changes style and tempo. It wouldn't be that bad a road movie if they cut out the angelic interference and made it a straight character film. Cameron Diaz does a good job playing the spoiled rich witch, and Ewan McGregor does ok as the down on his luck janitor. To make a long story short he ends up kidnapping her (or is it the other way around?) And of course they fall in love at the end. The plot takes on a weird supernatural angle with two angels that try to help the two along in their rocky road to romance. And gets weirder with a drunken hallucination karioke scene. You won't know whether you're coming or going with this movie. Although, after all this I have to say that there were some funny moments that will make you laugh, you'll just wish they ended up in a better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love, love, love this movie","review":"Brilliant!

Great in theory, lousy in execution. McGregor comes off so weak and bumbling that he's completely ineffectual as the male lead. It's bad enough that he plays such a complete doofus, but did they have to give him what's probably the worst wardrobe and haircut I've ever seen on the guy!? Diaz's character is such a witch that you don't care whether or not she's happy in the end. Both of these flawed characters could have worked if there had been any character development at all, but mostly the viewer is just supposed to believe that these two people deserve happiness because the fates and divine guidance say so.

Why did they put wonderful actors like Ian Holm, Stanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub, and even Holly Hunter through the embarrassment of appearing in this dud? This movie has characters we care nothing about, is pointlessly derivative, plotless, and ends up putting the viewer through a great deal of pain for daring to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding??","review":"Anyone who thinks kidnapping at gunpoint can form the foundation for a serious true-love relationship has some issues they need to work on. This film has no plot to speak of and gives you no reason to care what happens to the characters or their made-just-outside-Hollywood relationship. That said, the acting is pretty good and the schtick with the angels concerned about their medical costs is funny. This movie had everything going for it and there are a lot of good scenes. The poor overall rating is not the fault of the cast or the writers. The basic concept is highly shopworn and the casual treatment of violence, class, sexuality, and power fails to achieve the biting edge that I've come expect from these wacky cynical GenX semi-indie postmodern comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great romantic comedy","review":"This is for all of you who like romantic comedies, but don't like all the raunchyness of today's romantic comedies. It's not like your \\"Sleepless in Seattle.\\" This has a major twist to it. Two angels (Delroy Lindo, Holly Hunter) must match up Ewan McGrager and Cameron Diaz or else they'll get kicked out of Heaven. The problem is Ewan just kidnapped Cameron...soooo this kind of makes it a problem. Very funny, very sweet, and very romantic. Also stars Stanely Tucci, Tony Shalloub, Ian Holm and Dan Haydaya as St. Gabriel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened?","review":"Only goes to show, you can have very talented actors, a good script but if there is no chemistry between the two romantic leads you got one big goose egg on your face movie.

I can justify the cost because the unit accepts an external micorphone-- something I need since I do a lot of interviewing. The voice recording quality is excellent. Not quite as good as my Sony MD recorder but then I don't have to up load my files in real time. But for music... this is a very weak player. I tested with four different kinds of head phones including the supplied ear buds. No matter how I adjusted the sound controls the tone is either flat or excessively tinny to the point that it hurts. For $195 with tax this is probably going to go back to the store. I'll try the iRiver next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instruction and software, worth a shiiittttt ..... ....","review":"the device itself is very nice and packs interesting features,.

Setting and environment changes have only marginal effects.The player is rather cheaply put together as well. After a week of moderate use, the headphone connection came loose inside the player itself. Result, the player still plays, but you can't hear anything.All in all, the SAMSUNG was an excersize in frustration. Alot of people are trying to get into the MP3 player market and this is just another example of a wannabe that looks good but really isn't.I ended up with a Nano. I'm part of the 'pod', now.Sad, but you can't deny its a better built device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I purchased this product to be able to download music for the gym.

I honest feel that a child could use this product with no problem. Wonderful product for those people that really don't know much about computers.

Press one button to start, pause and stop, then start again where you left off... no CDs or batteries to change. Plays for 20 hours on one charge.

My intrest in quantum pyhsics compeled me to it, once i picked it up i couldnt put it down.i felt he did a great job keeping on the subject, not wondering off too far,(this subject opens all sorts of possibilities). yet, he explord every avenue that there would be concerning the subject. The chapters that went in to time travel made some very good points on how the therory could be possible.(in the aspect of keeping paradoxes from happening).I felt he kept this book in a manner that any one can read, and understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did somebody run out of rejection form letters?","review":"This book has no real content to speak of, but I'd rate it only one star were its contents comparable to that of Einstein's general and special relativity papers. Why? Because the quality of its writing is simply abysmal. This is a book that can't even summarize a Star Trek episode without tripping over its own prose (I'm talking about a simple, non-tech episode from the original sixties series) and wants to explain to you quantum mechanics. My recommendation? Read a comic book instead--any comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Search for Other Words","review":"If I may use the paradox of Schrödinger's cat, I decide to review the book, it must either be a good review or a bad review. Since I can't be certain without actually having written it, the end result must be both a good review and a bad review. That's basically the gist of the book as it deals with time, dimensions and space. For myself, I prefer to watch Sliders. At least then I can consider something grounded in reality, like Quinn Mallory using his timer to open a wormhole to parallel worlds via the Einstein Rosen Pedowski Bridge. Pardon me now, as I attempt to go back in time to before I decided to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Junky] book needs improvement","review":"I recently started reading books on theoretical phycics, so I am no expert in the field. Nevertheless I found the book quite intersting at times but it has one major flaw that is inexcusable: no illustrations. I guess the writer was purposely trying to confuse his readers; I mean, some parts were very easy to understand, written in layman's terms and giving good examples. However, there are parts in the book that NEEDED drawings. Also, the book tends to talk in circles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"D-U-M-B-E-D D-O-W-N\\"?","review":"I'm not surprised people are complaining there are no illustrations here. Perhaps it should come with pictures you can color in yourself and a complementary box of crayons. If we assume, however, for the sake of argument, that this is intended as a children's book, it is nevertheless a very poor children's book. (Very many authors, among them Lewis Carroll, E. B. White, and C. S. Lewis, have shown that it is possible to write for children and still write supremely well.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing, structure obscures cool ideas","review":"Wolf's problem, demonstrated again and again in \\"Parallel Universes\\" and his other books, is that he is a mediocre writer. Provocative, often fascinating ideas fizzle and die in the midst of Wolf's rambling, often barely coherent sentences. He offers speculation as fact -- for example, repeatedly claiming, in no uncertain terms, that quantum physics and relativity both \\"prove\\" that parallel universes really exist; most of us know that the idea of parallel universes is a theory, and a controversial one at that, popular strictly among the minority of physicists. And, in presenting difficult geometrical concepts (right triangles plastered onto a sphere, geodesics on a sphere, etc.), he doesn't offer A SINGLE ILLUSTRATION to make his points. The reader is left to grapple with geometry solely through the printed word -- and in poorly chosen words, to boot. Where is Stephen Hawking when you need him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair, but not for serious study","review":"What this book attempts to do is describe why parallel universes could exist and the implications of those parallel universes. Not only one parallel universe but many, many parallel universes each of which interacts with your present. Most people would have no problem reading this book and coming away with an understanding of why the theory of parallel universes exists. That is the end of the value of this book... you know about the experiment that was the basis for the theory and how the theory explains that experiment.The remainder of the book is poorly written and hard to follow. The theoretical underpinnings are put forward and contradicted at various points.For those who want a very basic introduction, not about the theory of parallel universes, but about the experiment that started it all, this is as good an introduction as any other book that I have read. Not a read for someone who is actually trying to understand the theory and it's implications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understandable Quantum physics","review":"I've yet to finish the book, having one more chapter to go, but from the first page on, I've been floored by the quality of information being given by the author. Maybe someone with a real background in quantum physics might find this book a little childish, but for those of us who can only imagine the infinitely small, it is a book that gives serious insight toward the education of the masses to a new reality. I also like the fact that the author, as any good scientist should do, is constantly questionning the different findings he explains.Overall, a very good book for someone who is seriously curious about quantum physics but doesn't know where to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as smelly as the name suggests","review":"Actor Ann Magnuson and gonzo musician Kramer teamed up to provide some of the most hilarious and original music of the 90s. Found sounds, manipulated tapes, pop culture references, and readings of what sound like Magnuson's dreams float over the pot-stoked mayhem of Kramer's music, which ranges from the shimmeringly beautiful and trancelike \\"Psychedelic Sewing Room\\" to the hilarious and manic cover of Roky Erikson's \\"Splash 1.\\" Chock full of idiosyncracy, humor, and a whimsical irony leavened with just enough earnestness to keep you from dismissing it as a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"uniquely interesting","review":"Bongwater, as the name suggests, could certainly be placed in the \\"trippy\\" category. However, this music is far from juvenile weirdness. There is some serious talent and creativity here, with more than a little wit and social commentary. The musical tracks are very diverse and mostly excellent, ranging from simple and happy to complex and serious. The spoken tracks are very engaging, with Ann Magnusen relating her dreams and conversations.

Actually, I listen to everything from Marduk to Iron maiden. I listen based on the songwriting skills. And on Cruelty, COF demonstrate their incredible songwriting skills. Again, while they don't reach the visceral heights that they reached on Dusk and her embrace, the did reach more heights on this album. However, I felt that the last 4 minutes of \\"Bathory aria\\" were completely unnecessary, and that they didn't need 3 instrumentals; they should just make two good ones instead of 2 ok ones and one good one.

It seems that the producers are just throwing any video concert into the market without caring about the quality, just to make a dollar.

The keypad doesn't give you enough tactile feedback when you press it. And for some reasons some keys are harder to press than the others. This really annoys me since I text message a lot.Other than the keypad, this is a very nice phone. The screen is high resolution (320 x 240) and very bright. IMHO the user interface is not as intuitive as Sony Ericsson's.I tried Bluetooth on this phone and was able to transfer my phonebook from my laptop without a hitch.But for me, the keypad is the killer.

We have played this game virtually every day for nearly two months, and I still LIKE the game! It is simple, with enough variety of game states and unpredictability (odds analysis) to keep the grown ups entertained. The best part is watching your kids actively LOVE math. This game is a MUST for parents with a young child with a voracious intellect.

Enjoyed reading it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ghost of Martin Beck Rises","review":"Fans of the Maj Sjowall/ Per Wahloo Martin Beck series will be right at home here in Henning Mankell's modern-day Sweden. We're on familiar turf as a tray of home-made rusks is offered to detective Kurt Wallander. (What are they, anyway?) \\"The Fifth Woman\\" is a taut, suspenseful, hard-to-put-down detective novel that combines all the best of the Sjowall/Wahloo series with an updated look at Sweden in the '90s. (Perhaps not so different from that Sweden of the '60s and '70s.) And if it's possible, readers of previous Mankells in the series will be glad to know that Mankell gets better with each novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I will not purchase any more books by this author. The author jumped around too much and went into too much detail on things that really didnt matter to the reader. The story was dragged out to much. The plot was interesting and could have been a great book if written better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"The story had a slow start, it was hard to follow the author's train of thought; I kept reading for a while longer but it didn't improve. Needless to say, it went into the discard box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT Enjoy","review":"Was I reading the same book as those who described this mystery as a 'gripping thriller'? There was nothing gripping or thrilling about this book. I did not think the character of Kurt Wallander was developed at all and so I did not feel I understood him or liked him. But in fairness this is the first Kurt Wallander mystery I have read and so perhaps his character was developed earlier in the series. However, it was an effort to finish this 400+ page book. No surprises at all in the end, in fact I kept saying to myself 'why don't the detectives figure that out?'. I did not like the style of writing and found it very choppy. I was fed up hearing about the rain, it was raining, it was going to rain, would it rain. I am amazed at all the five star reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding procedural-- the Detective is pooped and so am I","review":"Detective Kurt Wallander is professionally cautious and thoughtful (dull), personally abrupt, a bit on the insensitive side. Wallander struggles to accept his father's death, and wonders if he can build a new life for himself, maybe remarry, maybe buy a house and a dog. He philosophizes a bit about the apparent rise of violent crime in Sweden. It crosses his mind more than once to give up police work.This is probably more realistic than many detective stories, because there's no Sherlockian detection going on-- just a roomful of cops going over a collection of facts they've gone over more than once already. They're tired. They haven't had any sleep. You really feel their fatigue. And it takes the cops forever to notice clues, long after Mankell has revealed them to the reader. I wanted to scream, \\"Open the drawer!!! Would you look in the freakin' desk drawer!!!\\" and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Woman - A Kurt Wallander Mystery","review":"Henning Mankell has again written a fine mystery that is engrossing and compelling. Kurt Wallander is again revealed as a real human character and a dogged investigator.

Didn't think I had read it before but am enjoying it for a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Mankell/Wallander Read","review":"This wonderfully convoluted mystery kept me guessing and turning the pages past several bedtimes. Mankell's deft character development, particularly of the lugubrious, ever-ailing, almost fatally-focused Wallander keep you rooting for the good guys. The author synchronizes your perceptions with Wallander's as he struggles to fit the pieces of the puzzle together - to the point where you are as gratified as he is when it all begins to make sense. I couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"It is what I call a page turner. Mr. Mankell's Kurt Wallander is some one I think most people can relate to. He has his own problems and demon's to pack around as well as dealing with the bad guys. Well written and scripted to where you may be able to help solve the crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"I found this ponderous at times - I wish it had been shorter and more suspenseful.Mankell includes extraneous details that furthers neither the plot nor the characters. At times I wondered if Ireally cared about the characters - it seemed as if there was not a lot happening in the so called mysteryand not a lot happening in Wallender's life - it would have helped if Mankell had keptWallender worried about his lady love and if we heard more from his daughter. Itseemed occasionally we would hear about them but they weren't important enoughto Wallender - and I know he was thinking about the investigation - but suspenseis crucial I think in mysteries and I didn't think the suspense was well sustained.Frankly, this was too long for what happens in the plot and the characters' lives; Mankellseems to have padded out his book to sell it for more $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storyteller","review":"It seems to me that the stories move faster as newer ones are published.

Since one set of killers already know where he lives, why move Erika there? The list of implausibilities goes on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Builds you up to a big fizzle","review":"The book itself is alright, if you dont mind the author's bland, verbose, and tedious writing. But be prepared for a big letdown because the ending of the book is one of the worst I've ever read. I wish someone had warned me, so I'm warning others. I like the characters, but the book doesnt flow fast at all and it really fizzles in the end with no climax, and it was a big dissappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Step Up From Comics","review":"Greg Rucka, who is best known as a contributor to several comic book series, once again flexes his literary muscles in the second installment of the Atticus Kodiak series. Although the plotting and events border on the improbable, this in part is what helps the book succeed. Like the old saying about life being what happens when you are making other plans, the consequences of the characters actions in this book do NOT always happen the way the reader anticipates them. This adds a touch of reality to this book, that combined with Rucka's tight verbal prose make this an interesting and exciting read, and leave me looking forward to reading more. If you want your formulistic action thriller then you will probably not like this book. However if you want your characters to be fallible and human and struggle to their victories and enjoy lean and well crafted prose- then don't miss FINDER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, I look favorably on this novel.","review":"While I feel that his action pacing needs some work,the very human dimension to Kodiak's character is refreshing. The story was not written as a handbook for VIP protection and this shows, however, as a story with a security specialist as the protagonist it works well. Mr. Rucka's writing style took some time to get used to but I found myself caring about Atticus Kodiak. The stress on quasi \\"realistic\\" action is okay but some cinematic stuff would be entertaining as well.This is especially so in a novel that does take dramatic license with the close protection field. Mr. Rucka has definitely created a cast of characters that I want to read about again as it is their personal journey that is the true heart of the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless.","review":"This book was just pathetic. I did not care about the characters. They were one dimensional and revealed nothing. This book seemed like a rough draft, and ended abruptly killing off a character for no reason. Completely pointless. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The only reason I forced myself to plow through this book to the end (after having started it for the second time), was because of the glowing reviews, and because I had bought it and didn't want to waste my money. With the exception of a few clever phrases, it lacks all of the qualities which make for a good novel: character development, continuity, tension, plot. The overuse of acronyms is disruptive, and the typeface is difficult to read.

Even those who think they are excellent at spelling, can still take a look at some of the exercises. You might find out that there are still words you don't know how to write them correctly.And for those of you who still have a long way to go to master the English language, get a good grammar book and don't worry too much: Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Emily Dickinson had similar problems, just to name a few personalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Roadmap for Site Selection!","review":"This book was referred to me by a co-worker (who happened to be an expert in real estate).

I'm sure that this will force the reader to pick up a book or two by some authors mentioned in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the discussion of Marxism","review":"Popper's criticism of Marxist thought is the real payoff of the two volumes of this work. He writes with a passion that is at times overwrought - especially when teeing off against Plato and Hegel. Whether his criticism of their views is on the mark is incidental to the attack on Marx, and I leave it to the scholars of each to debate the merits of his critique. What Popper brings to the table is a clear exposition of his ideas. He makes a solid case for \\"social engineering\\" (an accurate but unfortunate term) as both a description of the past century and a prescription for addressing the problems with economic and social systems. This is a valuable and challenging book which will reward the reader willing to think through Popper's analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popper?","review":"Popper rules the Amazon roost.

The plots involve little more than the tedious succession of characters that, at the end, turn out to be someone else. Try reconstructing the plot after you've seen it crash into its inevitably boring climax.The photography is wretched, with many face shots almost into the nostrils and lots of traffic scenes to pad out the required time. A little white spot appears in the upper right hand corner of the screen for several minutes at a time. I don't blame the photographers for that, however. That would require ingenuity.The hero is barely more than a faceless bureaucrat, his sidekick might be a zombie (and how about that wig!), and the comic relief focuses on an office worker who doesn't work much! Music? Was there any? The directing is strictly on the amateur side. In short, save your money or watch Frost, Morse, and Gently over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Pelfrey in Westminster","review":"I like British minsteries, but cannot recommend this series.

The plot is so small, that it's bloated to thepoint where it uses the subject of racism as nothing but the elements of entertainment. This film doesn't show racism for what it is, sure it shows the KKK as criminal, secret and venomous, but those have always been it's selling points. \\"The Chamber\\" would work better if it tossed away racism because it doesn't make it into an issue here, only into a form of entertainment like the entertainment we get off of Rambo or a Schwarzennegger flick. How disappointing that instead of raising real thought-provoking issues, \\"The Chamber\\" is just boring and uninteresting. And to think that idiot John Grisham actually wants to take Oliver Stone to court over a great movie that does raise issues and serves as a satire of society: \\"Natural Born Killers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"LONG BORING NOVEL = SHORT MOVIE THAT BOMBED","review":"Chris O'Donnell, Gene Hackman, Faye Dunaway star in this terrible boring movie based on John Grisham's novel.O'Donnell stars as idealistic young attorney Adam Hall who takes on the death row clemency case of his onetime klansman grandfather, Sam Cayhall (Hackman). With just 28 days before the execution, Adam sets out to retrace the events leading to the crime for which Sam was convicted. As the impending death sentence looms closer, Adam works quickly to uncover the family's history for any - hidden clues.There is a serious problem with the book and movie, the book is long and so boring and it's sad to say a bestseller. The movie is short and a obvious bomb. Usually John Grisham books are great, thrilling suspensful fun. While John Grisham's movies are long and good, there at least 150 minutes this one was 1 hour and 53 minutes. What happend here?

It shows how our society has changed and the impact it has on people like the character in this movie. It shows how the political-correctness aspect of how we think and do things has an impact on our lives. I actually felt sorry for this racist murderer, but realize, that he was a product of a society, at that time, condonned such things and incouraaged them, only to do a flip-flop that left some, like the character on death-row wondering: What the hell happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Subject, Great Movie","review":"There are a few fairly recent movies about the death penalty--Dead Man Walking, The Green Mile, The Life of David Gaye. To me, this one gives us more insight into all the appeals etc that lead up to an execution. I was interested to find out that the actual gas chamber at Parchman, Mississippi, was used in the chamber scenes of the movie. It has an unusual plot, in that a Klan killing from the 1960's took this long to come to execution. Murder should never be considered a cultural phenomenon, but the book/movie point out that Klan killings, at this point in our history, were not unusual. This role was so different for Gene Hackman, The Runaway Jury. I've become a big fan of all of Grisham's books and movies. I also enjoy them because they are usually set in/around the Memphis area (since I lived in that area when I was in the Air Force 20 years ago)."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was the screen writer thiinking","review":"Of all the movies made from John G books this was the only one I did not like.First it was the one book John G wrote that dragged as I read itand two the screen writer changed so much stuff,it lost the things John G was trying to say.In hind sit the screen writer should have sat on the main charactors lap during the last scene"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chamber","review":"Excellent seller and item received much earlier than expected.

And the casting. . .did they really expect anyone to believe Faye Dunaway as Adam's aunt. Please. She could have played his grandmother, who wasn't in the book but what difference does that make?

This incarnation of the band bears almost no resemblence to what came before.The band retooled their sound for this album and jettisoned the sociopolitical fare for more standard r&b; fare and the result is something foreign to their former sound.Now, that wouldn't make this a bad album. post-funk synth r&b; was dominating the landscape at the time and this was clearly an effort to stay relevant at a time dominated by Al B. Sure, Keith Sweat, etc.What makes this a bad album is the quality fo the songs. There's not a single song on this album that sounds good, and that's before all the cheesy synth-funk aged it.

I've owned 3 Palms (M105, IIIxE, and this m500) and have had problems with each of them. I had to send my 105 back; used the replacement for a while until I got the 3xE, had to send that back after about 6 months; after it completely broke, I went to the m500. My first one worked fine for almost 8 months, then died. I sent it back, and the replacement died after three months. The replacement I have now (#3) requires a soft reset almost every time I hot synch, and will often reset itself as soon as I remove it from the cradle. I'll be sending it back, and E-baying the replacement, as I have just bought a new Ipaq.Palm's lousy quality control drove me away from a very nice product-- but I won't trust them again.

I wish I would have know this before I brought this model.It realy is useless except to keep notes in. Very disappointed with this product's performance. I can't beleave that with all the people who still have these older palm that are still working can't get any kind of support or help with updates when you update your laptop softwere.

I purchased this for my girlfriend and love the updates that Palm has added to this model over the Vx. For starters the screen on the M500 is much nicer than Vx. The image is clearer and the backlight is a hugh improvement. The Vx screen has a greenish color to it as well as with the backlight while the M500 has a eye pleasing white color to it.Other improvements are the USB cradle, Palm 4.01 OS, and secure card slot. There are not a lot of current uses for the secure card slot but that might change over time.If you are looking for a Palm I would highly recommend the M500 compared to some of the other models. Don't be fooled by some of the lower priced models. Some of the lower priced models use batteries where the M500 has rechargeable batteries, a big advantage. The lower priced models also have smaller screens and are made of plastic. For the extra money go for the M500, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design, poor quality","review":"The M500 is compact, attractively designed PDA with all the great Palm features. However, when it comes to reliability it is less than satisfactory. I bought my M500 in August 2001 and have had 3 replacement units since then and now the 4th replacment unit is failing. Palm Support (after you get by the $.../call threat) has been good, but who needs the inconvenience of the lost time while obtaining and setting up a replacement unit and the frustration of not being able to count on you PDA when you need it? Problems have included locking up, screen turning cloudy, touch screen frequently losing allignment, and battery completely and mysteriously discharging right after recharge. It is also a challenge to initially set up Hotsynch with Windows XP.If the M500 was dependable, it would deserve 5 stars but based on the number of units I've gone through, 2 stars is probably too generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This book contains the collection of the Grimm's brothers original fairy tales, and mostly gruesome in nature, involving cannibal and gruesome acts.

Green Eyes Flashing and What a Night as two highlights. A couple of numbers done by founding lead guitarist David Nelson add a delightful country twang; Jasper and A Good Woman Likes to Drink With The Boys. There's a great little instrumental redition of Turkey in the Staw, and you'll find the solid musicianship of Nelson, Love, Dawson, and Buddy Cage to be right up where you'd expect it.

The power of friendship is also shown in this book. It show that your best friend doesn't have to be human to be your best friend. To me Old Yeller was an average childrens story.

The acting is bad, its recorded like a soap opera, there is no tension, the dialogue is silly, and the reveal toward the end is idiotic. The killer (the one that spoke) was just not believable. He should've followed the lead of the other guy and kept his mouth shut. The reason given as to why the killings are happening doesn't carry the weight of the film by any means. Why the second guy turns on the first one is never addressed. Its just poorly done and the generous reviews must be from people connected with the project.

He wants to fit in but cannot because he lacks courage and physical strength. However, despite his feelings of inferiority, he plays a critical role in saving his people. As one who felt like an outsider when I started to attend a new school, I was able to sypathize with Rowan's plight, I admired his tenacity in pursuing his mission (even in the face of almost certain death) and his selflessness in trying to help those who despised him for his differences. Ultimately, Rowan proved that one does not have to accomplish great things. What does matter is the will to do what is right in spite of the odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowan of Rin","review":"I whole-heartedly agree with the parent from NY who's 8-year old son is a voracious reader.....because I have one too! It is so difficult to find quality books for young boys -- but this series is definitely one that you will want to buy. My son first read this series not long after he turned 9. He's now almost 11 and has reread them so many times that the covers are about to fall off. They are suspenseful without being scary....a great first fantasy series for kids. My only thought with regard to the child reviewers who didn't like them.... maybe they were too old for these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for reading out-loud to a young audience","review":"At this point I have read a large number of fantasy books to my young children (ages 3-7). The Rowan series stands out as above-average for out-loud reading to that age group:- The vocabulary was well suited to my listener(s) ages (with just enough advanced words to increase their vocabulary, but not so many that they lose the ability/interest to follow the story);- There was little violence, but plenty of suspense and monsters- The repetition of plot elements between books (mentioned as a negative in previous reviews) can be used as a tool to prompt young listeners into critical thinking and analysisIf you are a parent looking to read to your children, take a look at this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"I was deeply disappointed in this book. After hearing so many raving reviews, I decided to borrow it from the library. About two pages into it, I knew I didn't like it.The plot was predictable.

Only good thing was that one of the characters had my name. :DBut then again, I am a slightly older reader. Perhaps it would have been more enjoyable had I been younger.

I'm glad we found this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Mix?","review":"This was a very disappointing album. Disc One is a so called \\"mix\\" of funk/rare songs, but the blends are simplistic at best. Some songs seem more like a fade out than a blend meaning \\"beat to beat\\". In addition, these songs had very little commonality between them at all. Not that that is a necessity but a mixing Striplin's \\"Can't Turn Me Away\\" into Ripperton's \\"Lovin You\\" just doesn't make any sense. Maybe I totally missed the concept he was trying to convey. Maybe I should read the liner notes, but I don't think that will change my perspective. I bought this for the mixed version with the hopes that there was some creativity or thematic approach taken. Because I and most music (funk/R&B) aficionados already have most of these songs anyway, Disc Two is useless to me. I'll only keep this because I don't have the Striplin cut. But once that album becomes available, Blueprint becomes a frisbee headed to my friend in Alabama. Keep funkin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated...","review":"Let me begin by saying that I am an avid Gerald fan, and his last album, Essence, is in constant rotation in my cd player. This cd however, is NOTHING like Essence, it isn't even DnB/Jungle/Electronica and should not be classified as such. Upon reading the track listing in my local Virgin Megastore, I saw names like Marvin Gaye and James Brown and I thought that he had remixed some of their songs to a jungle beat. This is not the case. It is old school funk, plain and simple. It sounds more like a compilation you would see on late night TV like \\"NOW! Music Vol 6\\" or something.Conclusion: Do not buy this CD if you like Essence or are into jungle at all. Do buy Essence.

I had to go to Pep Boys to purchase the correct pads, which Pep Boys carries the same line, Pro Ceramic, and it cost me an additional $17 dollars above and beyond what I paid at Amazon, so I am not satisfied with this as it was a huge inconvenience, I had to pay more for the same pads, plus sales tax and then had to deal with the return of the incorrect pads, which I was able to do, but it tied up my funds for a significant period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Television - Live at The Old Waldorf","review":"This concert was available as a bootleg for awhile, but this issue is cleaned-up and much better to listen to. Besides, with this as an \\"official\\" release, the band members can get their much deserved royalties. This was one of the last concerts that Television did in their first run (they disbanded for awhile until 1992) and they are in fine form. Television is unique and defies categorization. They are an ecstatic musical listening experience.There's an excellent website called \\"The Wonder\\" that explains it all for those new to their music, plus two books \\"(33 1/3 series) Marquee Moon\\" and \\"Sonic Transmission\\". I highly recommend the site and books.Now, if only Amazon could get an \\"official\\" release version of the boot \\"Last Live in Portland (July 2, 1978)\\" and the \\"Piccadilly Inn\\" concerts of July 24-25, 1975, I'd be a happy camper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Television - 'Live At The Old Waldorf' (Rhino Handmade)","review":"Here, we have yet another unreleased live Television CD, similar to their 'The Blow-Up' 2-CD (see my review). Both titles are from gigs from the band while out on tour in support of their 'Adventure' album. 'Live At The Old Waldorf' was recorded June 29, 1978. For some reason(s), I tend to like this disc a bit more - perhaps it's because it seems a bit more new wave-ish. However, I would still recommend both CD's for long-time serious fans. Tracks that certainly did it for me were \\"The Dream's Dream\\", \\"Foxhole\\", the awesome \\"Careful\\" and this CD's two well-played epics - the twelve-minute \\"Little Johnny Jewel\\" and the fourteen-minute (possibly Television's most cherish song) \\"Marquee Moon\\". Then to close the evening's festivities - Tom Verlaine and company does a decent cover of the Stone's \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\".

After a month of use (carrying it in my messenger bag), the paint is coming off the cheap plastic casing, and the case no longer snaps closed. I'm incredibly disappointed and would tell anyone considering purchasing this product not to. I'm forced to buy another case, as I threw away the receipt, thinking \\"What could possibly go wrong with such a simple product?\\" I've leared my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Zire 31","review":"I also have problems with the paint coming off the case. Also, the case is really intended for the Zire 21, where the power cable and the USB connection are off the top edge of the PDA: The case hinges at the top, flipping open like a Star Trek communicator, so access to these ports is easy.This is NOT for the Zire 31: Palm added a Secure Digital card slot and a headphone socket to the 31, and there apparently was not enough room for the power and USB connector as well, not to mention the infared sensor, on the top edge. On the 31, power and USB are imbedded along the left edge, and there's a white rubber cover attached to the case to cover those holes when they're not in use. The PDA is attached to the case by applying adhesive velcro strips to the case and PDA, and the sides of the case are too high when the case is open to permit plugging these into the PDA without physically pulling the PDA partially off the velcro.Still looking for some protection for a really good PDA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed Case","review":"This case is poorly designed. The Zire 72 supports MP3 but the only way to use that with this case is either to open the case or to drill a hole in the top to insert the headphone jack.There are no holes for charging or synching. You have to remove the unit from the case.The case has adhesive velcro to attach the device to the case. You have to cut it in two before you install it so the serial number is visible.All in all, this appears to be a cheap third party case that is sold under the brand name."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST JAZZ/BLUES RECORD EVER MADE.","review":"JAZZ/BLUES HAS NEVER BEEN MORE FUNKY, PAINFUL AND WELL PLAYED THAN ON THIS RECORDING.

The twisted trees, saw palmetto, draped in Spanish moss are evocative of a time when Florida was a wild land populated by farmers, ranchers and fishermen.Rawlings writes the story of two orphans Luke and Allie, living in the hammock and how they survive the difficulties of scratching out a living on the land. The story then takes a turn to add drama by mixing the country orphans with wealthy landowners and their own difficulties.This is one of Rawling's more rare novels, and her ability to evoke the natural world is as sharp as it is in \\"The Yearling.\\" The story is a good novel, but I especially love it because when I drive through the citrus growing areas of Florida, the scenery comes alive through Rawling's description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night Light Ruptured","review":"I had 4 of these nightlights in my house, all the same model.

We went to work, and when I came home I noticed one of the nightlights was not working. From a distance, the lens where the light would normally shine through looked black. Upon closer inspection I discovered the nightlight had ruptured, had black stuff on it and smelled burned or hot. I unplugged it and the electrical outlet was also a little blackened.

The unit was black and clearly burned while the smell of the melted nightlite remained in the bathroom.We are very disturbed that this occurred. This night lite by AmerTac is clearly a fire hazard.

I hear guitar work which is unlike anything I've heard before, and have the same feeling about listening to Mr. Payne's artistry as I did when first listening to The Edge of U2 back in 1980.

Beautiful - The first Joydrop song I have ever heard [in the movie \\"My First Mister\\"], which made me find them. Beautiful and bittersweet, this song is something that anyone can relate to.2. Strawberry Marigold - Melodic, quiet, and perfect in its calmness. This one played itself in my head forever.3. Dream Today - Weird Techno-Pop-Rock mix, about the dangers of the modern world, yet full of hope.4. Dog Star Radio - I don't know what's this about, really, but it's beautiful.5. Until - Falling asleep to this song is one of the best things ever.Five out of Five, because I can't give it more.

Robot","review":"Regarded by many as the absolute worst entry in the Godzilla series, this film is pure cheese from start to finish. Of the \\"so terrible, it's great\\" variety, Godzilla and a goofy-looking robot called Jet Jaguar battle Megalon and Gigan (of \\"Godzilla On Monster Island\\" fame). The movie borrows most of its battle footage from \\"Monster Island\\" and other older Godzilla flicks and the big \\"G\\" is thrown in his corniest-looking costume yet. Absolutely pitful in an entertaining way."},{"rating":"1","title":"still coming out?","review":"Looks like this has gone from a pushed back release date...to no release date...and nobody here or on the web seems to have any idea if this is even coming out.

Throughout the movie you see near endless checkered patterning all over things where it was apparently only half-colorized. Many scenes are covered with this checkered patterning. Whoever colorized this movie even colored (actually half-colored) \\"outside the lines\\" just like a pre-schooler does in coloring books. There are even scenes which no attempt was even made to colorize so the movie goes back and forth from half-colorized to black-and-white scenes.

They must both be in the Monster Posse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla vs Megafun","review":"Godzilla vs Megalon has a little something for everyone. First of all Godzilla is in it, second of all there's a giant robot, and it used alot of recycled movie footage way before recycling was cool. It's worth getting just to see Godzilla slide for about 300 yards, suspended only by the strength of his tail, and slam into another monster. Not once but twice. I do realize maybe this movie isn't for everybody. I'm 43 years old and grew up seeing this movie on TV, alot. Before this dvd release I had the old double feature with the smog monster, which was of terrible print quality. So this is a vast improvement. I have all the Godzilla movies and this is definately not the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"I haven't received this product.","review":"I cannot review a product I never received.

So it's up to Godzilla to have a fight with them and save the day (when it comes to novelty value this film is the business). Assisting Mr G is the most uninspiring, pathetic and stupid-looking monster ever to foul a monster movie series. It goes by the name of Jet Jaguar and if jaguars could sue for character defamation then they would do so, believe you me.The costumes look ragged and worn, the sets are shabby and the whole thing is about as exciting as a video on the history of chair-repairing. The original creators of Godzilla were no longer involved by the time this film was made, and it shows - the energy and imagination has gone from the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Godzilla movie ever","review":"2 Words - Jet Jaguar.Forget Power Rangers, throw away Voltron and say bye bye to Transformers.

(that's the plot, folks)","review":"So the new Godzilla film had no plot, eh? Are you telling me this waste of time is what's meant by a plot? It's all just another aliens V humans and alien monsters V earth monsters. Gigan is still as uninspiring as ever, Jet Jaguar is the most dire monster ever in a Godzilla film and would be more at home in some execremental cartoon. Ghidorah seems to have been thrown in, just to keep the viewer's interest in this film, but his costume is showing its age. Half of this film just seems to be made up of stock footage from older Godzilla outings.An utter waste of time. I suppose this is what happens to every series when it runs out of steam. The producers aim it at their only remaining hope for an audience - undemanding kids. But to be honest even they'll be bored by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE worst Godzilla movie ever made!!","review":"This movie is incredibly daffy.

Incredebly brain numbing bad!! Okay, Okay, I don\`t think it\`s quite that bad but it still isn\`t that good. I don\`t find the plot intresting at all and Jet Jaguar is an idiot!!! Plus in the end, Gigan flys away instead of dying. Godzilla also looks like a machine. I also really hate on how Jet Jaguar and Godzilla are friends. I mean, they\`re always handshaking and doing stuff like that. I would rate this movie a one except for Godzilla\`s dropkick scene that\`s 100% Godzilla stlye. Otherwise, this movie stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scoop dis nugget!","review":"First off I am sick of clowns trying to break this film down like they are Roger Ebert. If you are a fan of the genre you know what your getting yourself into. Who cares about the plot and how loosely written it is. I don't care how the monsters get into the ring or why Jet Jaguar can change like Ant Man and grow like a Giant. I just want to see a Monster Street Fight and watch Godzilla throw the leg drop on Meglon! I also want to see an Ultraman knock off who backs up his boy who happens to be a Giant Firebreathing lizard he just met. Hey for all I know this robot is just playing the role of a good Samaritan and preventing a monster from getting jumped by 2 punks.

Maybe Amazon will figure this out at some point, but until then, I wanted to issue a heads-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star? That's over-generous.","review":"It's quite unbelievable and frankly downright infuriating that potentially excellent films such as Rodan, the sixties Ghidrah and the original Godzilla film have never been released on video in the UK, and yet rubbish like this is staring out from every 'sf/fantasy' shelf in every video shop around.The plot, which to be honest isn't even up to the standard of the one in that wretched 1998 film, involves a race of aliens who are attempting to take over the earth with the help of their alien monsters. Well there's original.Once more Godzilla is called into action, along with Jet Jaguar, who has the dubious honour of being the most pathetic, uninspiring, yawnsome creation I've ever come across in a monster movie. The effects are pretty feeble, the fighting is nothing new or exciting and it all becomes very tedious.No wonder some people hate suitmation films if they can only judge them by watching trash like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"The low point of the series, when Toho had apparently decided that the only audience for G-films were not-too-particular 8-year olds. I was unlucky enough to actually see this film on the big screen as a kid back in the late 70's, and it's haunted me like a bad dream ever since.As a 'zilla fan it's hard to choose the most painful aspect. The cheezy Jet Jaguar character? The annoying child co-star? The painful dubbing? The hairy middle-aged Seatopian leader? Or was it the laughable tag team wrestling style monster battle? There's just so much to rag on here!Not wanting to end on a downer, I will say that Megalon and Gigan were at least interesting looking creature designs, it's just a shame they were wasted on a film like this! Recommended only for collectors, or if you have access to a copy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"This movie was simply bad. First of all, they used a lot of scenes from other movies and second of all, it was cheaply made. This movie and the smog monster has to be considered the worst Godzilla flicks of all.

At least the monster do not talk. They shake hands. Godzilla and the robot shake handssssss. This is good for little kids. Godzilla acts bad in this movie. It has no reason why someone would not buy this. This can give an old man nightmares, that is how bad the movie is. The dubbing is extremelyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy good, I MEAN BAD, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"With this movie, the Godzilla series hits bottom. The monsters in this movie are the worst ever. The model work that isn't stock footage is laughable. The battle choreography is unimaginative. The plot is awful. The script is even worse. The characters have about as much depth as the screen their shown on. Adding more insult and injury to a movie already brimming with both, Godzilla looks like something out of Sesame Street! It's not quite as tedious and stock-footage driven as Godzilla's Revenge, but it's a lot worse in all other respects. The campy humour may keep some engaged for the first few minutes, but by the end, the only way to maintain sanity is pondering how to murder Jun Fukuda."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stench of rotten celluiloid.","review":"A permanent resident of the place known as Rock Bottom, Megalon is an offense to the name of Godzilla. This Frankenstein monster of a movie was pasted together using scenes from several better films. Too bad someone forgot the brain. With a Mad Libs script, and new spfx scenes that will make your eyes roll out of your head, this film doesn't even pretend to be entertaining. Pouring a 10-gallon drum of salt onto an already infected wound is a score that was most likely used by the government to get enemy spies to confess. Absolutely, undeniably one of the worst movies ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even waste your time...SERIOUSLY","review":"I'm not going to devote more than a few lines to this most laughable of ANY of the Godzilla series.

That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla Rocks!","review":"Are you a Godzilla fan? If so, you'll love this film! Godzilla always has an adversary to fight that looks like it's going to beat him but we know better! All of the Godzilla films follow the same type of scenario...a new monster comes on the scene & Godzilla has to save Tokyo or the entire Earth! All good fun!

The characters share the size, but few of the memorable traits of Pod, Homily, and Arrietty, the wonderful family that lives under the kitchen. This adaptation is more of a cross between MOUSE HUNT, HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS, and HOME ALONE than anything in THE BORROWERS books. I was very disappointed, and could not get involved in the story. For little kids only, although you should really read them the books and skip the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the whole family","review":"This movie is a great one for everyone to watch together, as it can interest anyone, from very young kids to adults.The miniaturization effects didn't seem particularly advanced - I wasn't wowed by any technical advances I saw. But I would say that they were very imaginably used, making for some cute scenes that were refreshing. They were also carefully done, minimizing the \\"fakey\\" feel and letting you concentrate on the story.The DVD version has a cool \\"making of The Borrowers\\" featurette that shows how the special effects were done, which is fun to watch after you've seen the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Studio Borrowed An Idea, Then Lost It","review":"If you've read the books, as I did (have you read them recently?) this film will disappoint you. It starts out all right, filmed in an amber glow, in a house full of mid-century appliances and kitch, and great sets of life on a miniature scale lived between the walls and out of sight. Then, just as you are settling in, Hollywood rips out the rug, throws out the book, and reverts to a standard action plot: Big bad guy steals the house and the good (little) people have to make it right! Hoo Ya!Not really.Even the heroic music, pounding its way through the action, driving the viewer forward lest he fall asleep or try to hold an independent thought, fails the film. In the end, almost all the movie is out in the big world, with tired old stunts and Hollywood acting as if more will make it better.It doesn't.Of course, there are always the books. Read the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignores the books' plots, but it is still a good kids' movie","review":"It's nice to see The Borrowers get a big budget, as I don't care much for the television versions. If you are a fan of the books, you'll be disappointed that the movie ignores all the books' storylines and is more likeThe Littles. If you can watch it as is, it is actually an enjoyable family film.

Really little. About the size of mice, really. They live in the walls and under the floors of a house, co-existing with humans who never can figure out where stuff goes missing.

Attempt failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corny Cover, Nice Music!","review":"i thought the cd cover was corny looking with the whole kodak theater thing going on and the velvet jacket or whatever that get up he's wearing on it. this is actually a very good cd and it is in heavy rotation on my car cd player. it surprises me it is not getting more radio time. everyone who hears it asks me 'who is this guy' and i say corey clark. they are always \\"WOW, i didn't know he could really sing.\\" i have to show them the cd cover to prove he really has a cd out. then they giggle about the cd cover, but we really like the music. hopefully corey will tour or make some tv appearances soon. i haven't been seeing too much promotion of this cd. i feel like it's my own secret! love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthony are you confused?","review":"I think the reviewer below confused corey with mario who had that \\"relation\\" with paula. So all your hatred to his music is quite unfair. Corey is the kid who got eliminated coz of previous crime on record with his sister. and we know AI producers are so prizzy on those topics. After listening to his songs, I thought it was decent to be introduced to the pop world (no more like those song by ruben studdard..sorry..not really your fan). Give it a chance and at least thank the kid for his contributions to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corey Clark's debut release a FLOP!","review":"Ok don't get my wrong Corey Clark is talented and can sing well but as mentioned above several of his tracks are overproduced and he sounds like a girl in some of them. Many of them are forgetable and some of them are incredibly inappropriate! I would recommend Justin Guarini's CD to anyone before I'd let them listen to Corey's. Don't get me wrong though Corey Clark has some talent it is just not shown on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corey Clark Sounds Good","review":"I don't know if the previous reviews were written by people who like R & B, or just looking for something Idolish.

Perhaps if he spent more time on the music and less time seeking cheap publicity it would have been a better effort. As a musician, it makes me cringe. The lyrics are trite, the dance tracks are overdone, his upper register on ballads is apalling.When i saw that he was trying to build a singing career by slagging off Paula Abdul and American Idol, rather than on the strength of his musical ability, I had a feeling that this effort would be useless. I was right...His 15 minutes of fame are over...time to slither back under the rock"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap music","review":"I'm not surprised he couldn't make it and had to use a scandal to sell anything.I doubt the American Idol people were \\"on his back\\" trying to ruin his career these past two years.He just thinks too highly of his talent and of course it must have been someone's fault that he wasn't making it. This kid has serious self delusion issues about his \\"talent\\" and conspiracy theories.the songs are boring. His voice is rather weak and grating at times.In the same kinda genre, Justim Timberlake's voice is much more pleasant to the ears.Corey does sound somewhat better than he sounded on the show though because of the studio work. He's on pitch at least. But his voice and the songs are lackluster and they sound like bad covers of songs we've already heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER HORRIBLE IDOL OFFERING","review":"I can't believe this guy! I listened to this travesty at the Music Store where I work. It is truly horrible. He sounds like a cross between Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton. It makes you wonder how these kids are getting these record deals. God only knows. What I can tell you is this: At the music store where I work, we haven't sold one single product of his. Another thing, he looks like a pimp on the cover of the CD. I truly believe this guy will step on anyone or do anything to get what he wants. If you want class and good music, skip this one......why ANYONE would want to support this guy and his lame music is beyond my grasp and comprehension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restored Faith","review":"I had just about given up on new artist that come out with a cd. It seems that just about anyone can do it. Then along came this one. I was floored. Where has this guy been? Whos been keeping him a secret? The music flows, the vocals are strong, the harmonies are wonderful. If I turn on the radio, most new artist sound the same. This guy is unique and you will know it is him when you here him. He has definetly been a well kept secret. I won't be suprised when this goes number one on the charts!

Obviously I believed the \\"rave\\" reviews here (most of which are probably phony) and should have believed the 1 star reviews, which I agree is being too kind for this music. I am not surprised to hear that this guy's release has sunk quicker to the bottom than any other American Idol's previous releases. He's even doing worse than Justin Guarini which is really low and we all know how he tanked out!! Save your money and don't make the same mistake I did.

Clark's voice is falestto which should have worked wonders on his cover of Debarge's All This Love,surpsinsgly it sounds horrible. The only song worth anything is his duet with Sarah Stokes (Makin The Band). One would think that if a CD has high profile superstar featured guest spots from the Black Eyed Peas, NE-Yo and Scott Storch it could be reedmed, sadly it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't there a zero stars","review":"Okay...look at the cover...it should tell you one thing...take your time...as obvious as can be.

Better luck next time, kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous...","review":"I had to force myself to listen to this dreadful piece of nonsense. It is one of the worst CD's i have heard all year, almost every track feels like a copy of something that Justin Timberlake and his like would come up with, but anyone else attempting it would achieve better results. That 'Paulatics' song is particularly ghastly, and the lyrics to it are appalling. It is quite clear that this man has no talent seeing as he has had to resort to slander in order to generate publicity for himself.

I listened to this horrible collection at a used CD place because I wanted to see if there was anything at least palatable about his product? With songs like \\"Feenie\\"....what the heck is this all about you wonder??? Please don't waste your time. The extremely distateful \\"Paulatics\\" is an example of this guy desperately needing some lessons in the \\"depth perception\\" department because he can't see the forest for the trees and is proof positive he is only using this as a step toward his 15 minutes of fame. The CD cover itself should tell you that he is no better than the \\"pimps\\" down on lower \\"Broad\\". And if that doesn't convince you, check the Billboard charts and the rest of the music charts where this CD is sinking faster than you can say \\"Paulatics\\". And all the phony five star reviews received here cannot change that fact!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a PENNY","review":"Corey Clark can NOT SING,..well...he can run his mouth good but that is not music.

It's about time a new artist stuck to their guns and created real music. While this is very commercial, I commend Corey for doing his thing. If you look inside the jacket he has either wrote or co-wrote all but one song. This is just incredible for a young man. Unheard of in the industry for a first time artist. I found Look What You've Done To Me a step back in time. That's My Girl with Sara Stokes quite colorful. Follow That Back had the old time funk that you could groove to. Bed of Roses is has that folk feel.Chance to Dance is very upbeat. Out of Control with Scott Storch producer is just that Out of Control. What a great dance tune and a good get up and move to the beat. Truthfully has a latino feel to it. Wow there are literally several songs that could go number one. The vocals are of good quality the harmonies are just outstanding. You will be missing out if you don't get this cd. I recommend this cd to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corey Clark is AWFUL","review":"Wow, do you really want to waist your money on this liar?

A lot of people can't do that. Corey was the one who brought up all the stuff about Paula, who put \\"Paulatics\\" on the album and won't freakin shut up about her. He could have tried to sell the album on talent alone, but he didn't have the guts. Instead he went around telling people he banged Paula Abdul, smearing it everywhere in graphic detail, revelling in telling every dirty little detail to anyone who'd listen. Paula wasn't ever the world's greatest singer, but she got her eight Number One singles all on her own merits. Corey will never be able to say the same. He's not an artist I could ever respect or admire. Helping him get rich by buying his album isn't something I have the slightest inclination to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"KC Music","review":"I have been in the industry for some 35 years. After the last ten years of rap, cursin, killin, gettin my gat, hood rats. It's finally a pleasure to hear a young man with old school backing, singing beautiful harmonies, sweet messages and dynamite lead vocal ability. I have purchased 2 copies of Corey Clarks CD and I gave one to a close friend, who continues to thank me for exposing him to such a dynomite musical adventure. Don't get me wrong I'm not putting down the rap scene, because it has been a vehicle of financial security for so many young artists. It is so refreshing to finally hear a young artists mainly Corey Clark sing, harmonize and telling love stories. It gives music a refreshing new face.P.S. Check it out for yourself.

I don't really care about the Abdul thing, whether it's true or not, it's impossible to really tell. But, I bought this just to see if Corey actually has the talent to back up his TV coverage. He doesn't. This album is horrible, and every song feels like it's either ripping off another song entirely or it's meant for filler. For someone to take that long to release an album filled with garbage...it's very interesting.Basically, after listening to Corey's debut, I can say that whether he slept with Abdul or not, he's talentless and it doesn't really matter. Paula was crazy if she actually thought he was good. I'd say skip this album and go back to listening to your other stuff, because Corey most likely ripped it off already. Only one question really remains: who in their right mind signed this brat?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit CD","review":"This cd has got to be the best I've heard in a long time. It has hit after hit after hit. When you buy this cd ( and I recommend that you do)You won't be disappointed. You can dance all day or just mellow out to the ballads. This guy is hot hot hot. What a powerful and soulful voice. The feeling that just crys out to you in each song is incredible! I have yet to be able to pick a favorite. There are just too many good ones to choose from. I highly recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This CD is not worth your time or money. The lyrics to the songs are lame and corey sounds like a teenage boy before puberty hits. Most of the titles to the songs are a joke also. Many of the tracks tend to be overproduced and make Corey sound like a girl. CD is not worth your time or money. Corey is just another person trying to ride on the coat tails of someone elses sucess by making false accusations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I THOROUGHLY AGREE.....TRULY A DISASTER","review":"Mr. Clark's voice is whiny, pitchy going sharp and flat on most of the songs. Who gave this guy a record deal??? What were they thinking?? No way did I buy this. I just listened to it out of curiosity at the Blockbuster store which allows you to listen to the CDs before you purchase them to see if you like them. The production is terrible and the vocals.....well....I've heard hyenas who sound better than Clark does. I think he's just trying to cash in using any exploitative means possible and yes I am talking about the Paula Abdul scandal. The song \\"Paulatics\\" is in very poor taste which also goes for the rest of the CD. I feel very, very, sorry for people who are being taken in by this no talent scam artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I thought this cd was lifeless and boring. His voice was flat through most of the songs on this CD. The worst CD I've heard in a while. Paula forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"To judge this cd means to judge it only based on lyrics, beat, content, and flow. I believe for his first album he has much talent. With time he will be the bomb! I will buy this at the first chance I get. I love several of the songs on the album. When you can dig more than five songs on an album these days you got a legitimate cd. Keep doing your thing man. The cd is grooving. Can't wait for the second one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated \\"0\\"","review":"If the ratings would go down to zero that is what this CD should have gotten.

Poor things, they can't see the forest for the trees. But the obvious fact is, why is his CD being sold at used places like Amazon for $1.59 as many reviewers have noted here. That is what speaks volumes. There is no way a CD which has been out for two months could possibly be being sold at used sellers at such a price unless they're trying to get rid of them quickly. People need to wake up and face the fact that this CD is really quite terrible and all the five star reviews in the world will never hide that fact. Also, bashing other reviewers by name as I've seen some of these people do will do no good either. The proof is there for all to see. Now, I'll wait for the bashers to come after me so they can prove my point accurately."},{"rating":"1","title":"F- for this CD? How about a big fat ZERO???","review":"This CD has flopped big-time. It has nothing to do with hate. It is just pure fact. Look at the amount of used CDs here on Amazon on sale for $1.58!! What artist with a new release has used CDs going for a dollar??? That ought to confirm that this CD has been a total disaster!! I hope this teaches Clark a lesson......don't step on people on your way up because they're the same ones you'll meet on your way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pretty Boy Needs to Chill and Get His Mind Together","review":"Look, Corey Clark is an attractive guy, alright? But he's not that attractive that I'd go out and buy his album. I actually forgot that he had an album come out this summer. The other day I was listening to Paula Abdul's \\"Forever Your Girl\\" CD and I was like, \\"Oh, yeah! Corey Clark!\\" Let me tell you something: this CD is wack! There's nothing unique about it and it's boring. I thought Corey sounded great on American Idol, but on this CD it's like he's singing underneath his breath and there's no emotion. The only song I like is \\"All This Love\\" and that's because I love the original by El Debarge. In fact, on that song Corey sounds similar to El, but he (Corey) sounds way off key, like he was bored or something. Like I said before, Corey is hot, but I would never pay $1.40 for his CD. For $1.40 I could buy 2 bags of onion rings, Gummi Savers, and a Slim Jim! Anyway, Corey's days of getting over are finished and good looks don't last forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE FIASCO","review":"This is a complete fiasco. Its not even music, just noise.

Not bad for a CD that was just released!!","review":"I had high expectations for this CD which only proves that one should not hold high expectations in the music world today because of the let down that follows. With songs by the titles of \\"Feenin\\" (whatever the heck that is....) its no wonder this CD is being sold at used marketplaces for $1.00. I agree, the bottom line is the music. And in this case, it is overall bland with no distinctive quality either vocally or production-wise. If you want to buy it the only place I've seen it available is here on Amazon and the used sellers for $1.59. Not bad for a CD that was just released."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS IN MUSIC HISTORY!","review":"This CD is very lame. If its so good, why was he dropped from his record label? Why has the CD sunk lower than Justin Guarini's? I thought Guarini was bad but this guy is in for some big disappointments. And not because of the \\"Paula\\" thing. Who cares about that nonsense??? The matter of fact is the music. Is it good or not? These lyrics are banal and trite and the melodies and production values are downright overproduced and mawkish. Add to this an unimpressive voice with a CD cover that reminds one of....oh, never mind....forget Corey Clark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much bitterness","review":"I own Corey's record and a lot of the opinions seem more centered on press and nnot the album. R. Kelly has done worse and he'sbiger than ever. Corey has a good record. Sure, there some stuff on there i dont like. Feenin, follow that back, are examples of that. But Truthfully, So Many Questions,and Bed of Roses are good songs. Give it a chance. The recordis good"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Just So Happen to LIKE Corey Clark!!","review":"Contrary to popular belief, I like this album. I'm not saying that its the greatest of all time or anything, but is very soothing to the ears. the music is very nice and goes well with Corey's falsetto. Generally, I have a 3-song rule in regard to whether i should keep a Cd or not and fortunately, i like most of the songs on this Cd. In spite of the Corey-Paula controversy, \\"Paulatics\\" is one of my favorites on this cd. I thought Corey's version of \\"All This Love\\" was superb to say the least. If u are in need of hearing some smooth grooves, i highly recommend Corey Clark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but fake reviews on this album","review":"I heard parts of this album and it's nothing special - pretty mundane and uninteresting all the way through, certainly not something I'd pay for. The most hilarious thing associated with Corey Clark's album are the dozens of five star ratings here on Amazon, all sounding amazingly similar, even using the same vocabulary over and over again. Also, click on the \\"see my other reviews\\" links for all these fake reviews and you'll notice this is the only album they've ever reviewed. Very very lame. It tells you something about the album, the fact that Corey Clark has to get everyone he knows to post fake reviews. It can't stand on it's own - it basically sucks, but all the fake reviews are hilarious, you've got to read every one that gives it a five star rating. Sounds like the same person wrote all of them. Corey Clark is \\"so refreshing\\" and \\"hits every note\\" and the \\"harmonies are AMAZING!\\" and he's the \\"second coming of Michael Jackson!!!\\" Hilarious stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where has he been?","review":"It has been many years since I have heard beautiful vocals such as Mr. Clarks. Once in a life time we have an opportunity to hear such quality in someone. You can hear and feel what he is singing. That in its self is a rare quality. I am quite sure that he will become bigger and better with age as they say. I can only wait and look forward to more great music from Corey. I for one will be standing in line to get his next cd. I highly recommend this to anyone who really wants to hear quality! Great Job Corey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Album","review":"Okay. Nevermind the ongoing debate over whether you like Corey Clark as a person or not. I am a fan of the show and therefore buy all the CD's that the contestants release. I like some of them, I dislike some of them and so it goes.I bought this album with an open mind. I actually wanted to like it. I have to agree with the people that say that the songs sound largely the same. He has a great voice, however, the music is not that great. The majority of the tracks have the same beat with different words. I was very disappointed.That said .. I will buy any follow up CD that Corey puts out and hope I like it better. Whomever produces the CD should taylor songs to Corey's strengths and vocal style. They just fell short this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF MUSIC IS THE KEY THIS CD IS TERRIBLY OFF KEY!!","review":"So where are all these radio stations that are supposedly playing this piece of junk? They ought to get one of Paula Abdul's old CDs and play them both back to back and let both of them wade in the mire they've produced. The truth is Corey Clark is an opportunist as another reviewer said and he and Paula Abdul deserve each other. You'll like this CD if you like \\"Munchkin sounds\\". Still, you'd be better off buying the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" soundtrack!! Or \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" greatest hits! But Clark does do a great imitation of them both! He's very talented!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corey Clark - American Idol Contestant","review":"I am disappointed in Corey Clark's new CD. Corey Clark is a very talented artist. This CD does not do his voice justice. When he performed on the American Idol Show I thought his voice was amazing. His choice of songs on the show were great. His voice does not come through very well on this CD. I hope that he will continue to make music and sing songs that will show off his voice. The CD itself was done very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"corey clark has no talent","review":"corey clark cannot sing. all the cheap publicity did not help him. he just simply cannot sing. his songs are laughfable and his cd is just a big fat joke. if you seek publicity at least have something to back it up. his 15 minutes of fame has lonf been over and his cd tanked miserably. who did he paid to give him 5 stars reviews? please let be honest i would not recommed it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY","review":"Someone gave me this album, I would not have bought it, but listened to it. It is simply horrible. I support Corey in his effort to clear the air with AI so that does not play in it- I agree with him totally on that- but this is a terrible album- why not just throw your money out the window?

Please do not buy into this kind of titillation in the music business; I for one will not endorse Corey Clark in any of his undertakings. He is a bad example for young people today and the lyrics on this CD more than confirm that fact. Who ever thought to give him a record deal anyhow?

As I say, only the teeny boppers find this guy attractive...and the music....well, quite simply....its horrible.

It's like 15 tracks of the exact same song writing formula. There's a few songs that I liked, but nothing I plan to run back to anytime soon. Corey has such a great ability with his voice - to sing in a wide range, which makes me wonder why the heck he sounds like a woman on every song. He always had that great high register, yes, but he wasn't ONLY the high register on American Idol. This CD is very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply AWFUL!","review":"This disc was simply a waste of my time...very mediocre songs, heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent...Corey's voice is below average....I get the feeling that Corey Clark is IMITATING a good singer with a VIABLE career, and not doing it very well....clearly 'fake it till you make it' isn't working here. The songs all sound the same, I kept waiting for something to get me grooving, but it just didn't happen.I think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential...he either needs voice lessons, a little humility, and some professional grooming (and I don't mean clothing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CD WORTH KEEPING.....APPARENTLY NOT!","review":"I have had fun reading the reviews here.

They never mention the run ins with the law that Clark has had and will attest to \\"their phenomenon\\" in the most glorifying, saintly ways. Why not canonize the man?

Having more than a passing acquaintance with \\"indigenous Buddhism\\" and having lived a few blocks from one of the largest Buddhist Temples in North America ( a Thai Temple in L.A.)the author puts a very different \\"Nouveau/California/New Age face on Buddhism. His quotations from the Bible are out of context and misapplied. I commend him for his desire to get along with others peacefully but his understanding of Christ, what Christ claimed about himself and other concepts from the Bible are flawed. His version of Buddhism, with a decidedly post modern flair is a far cry from what is practiced around the world, including Tibetan Buddhism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 10 pages of coloring","review":"This is fun and great idea for toddler who can't color very well.

The only reason to watch it would be to see the three lead women nude - they aren't even topless!!! The idiot director, writer producer who made this pile of garbage needs to have his head examined - it's against the laws of nature and man to have three nice looking women and not have them take their clothes off. The movie is a complete waste of time - do not watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfunny comedy","review":"If you like watching young women beat the crap out of men for being rude (!) you might enjoy this. Otherwise, there's no real point in watching this. Don't expect any big laughs or any exciting moments. The sound is badly synchronised with the actors' lip movements. I don't know if this is supposed to be funny, like a parody of dubbed ninja movies from Asia.It would be fun to see such a film with reversed gender roles some time. Three young men assaulting middle-aged women for not showing them proper respect. Not because I enjoy watching women getting beat up, but to see the reaction from society. For some reason, women's violence against men is more hilarious than vice versa. Often, like here, it's even justified.I almost forgot. Are you thinking of buying this movie because the three gorgeous girls work part-time as strippers? Don't. They're not even topless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought It would Be","review":"Not much of a movie at all.

I can only describe it as Coyote Ugly meets Batman (the original series). Yes, it's poorly acted and yes, it's got a gossamer thin plot, but it does what it says on the tin; The girls are HOT, the action is as camp as George Takei, but it was quite fun if you watch it for what it is and don't expect too much. I really hope they make a sequel as they left the ending wide open for one, and i'd love to see those girls in action again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking for it...","review":"I've enjoyed Michael Thomas Ford's writing in the past, but this story is poorly written, poorly edited and extremely shallow. I couldn't help but think that Ford was just cranking out a story to meet a deadline. There's no depth of character in any of the main figures. The story line seems to serve no purpose other than to connect the over abundant and graphic sex scenes, some of which are extremely brutal. If your looking for a good story with believable characters...keep looking for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching","review":"I found that Looking for it has a meaning behind it. I mean is Mike the main character was lost and he found what made him happy and you could say this connects with every day life.

For an the way people react seeing the same sex together and this case i felt that you could connect with each character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Given that I enjoy Mr. Ford's essay collections and other writings, I was really looking forward to this book. I won't recap the plot here, since other reviewers have done a good job of that.As other reviewers have pointed out, it's an easy read, a \\"beach book,\\" as it were. But in the end, I found the story contrived and unrealistic, the characters without much depth, and the writing clunky and mechanical. It wasn't completely unenjoyable, but I would have expected better from such an experienced and prolific writer as Mr. Ford.He does create a good sense of the story's setting and location, and I rather liked Simon, the eldest member of the cast. The erotic passages are well-written but their explicitness seems very out of place. Overall, Ford has a tendency to use 10 words when half that number would suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been So Great","review":"Although I read the entire book, I found it more depressing than enjoyable. I enjoy gay and lesbian fiction, but there was so much unnecessary sex in this book that it took away from the actual story line.The scenes with Pete Thayer, a blatant homophobe who harbors homosexual tendencies, were especially explicit and, in some cases, disgusting, and I felt they did nothing to explain his beliefs and his character.There are lots of good fiction books out there dealing with gay men, but LOOKING FOR IT isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I skipped to the end sequence.","review":"Going by the title, I decided to watch this flick thinking it would be good for a laugh. The only shot I saw that did make me laugh was the first shot of the gigantic shark's fin as it passed the ship. It wasn't well rendered which made it more laughable. I'm amazed that someone thought this film was good enough to produce and feed to the public. The lead actor was terrible, way too hyped up and over-the-top, like maybe he'd consumed a dozen Red Bull drinks all at once. The CG effects were 2nd or 3rd rate at best. After the first 15 or so minutes of viewing, I started skipping ahead until I arrived at the end sequence, for the final battle between the shark and croc.

The writing is of epic quality, finding a place amongst the great sagas of history, and the acting alone can move even the hardest heart to tears. It is a travesty and a shame, a lasting blot upon the soul of the cinematic Establishment, that this wonderful film did not garner several Academy Award nominations, nor was it featured at Sundance or Cannes where it belonged, a beacon in the darkness that shines far above the usual mediocrities of mundane \\"cinema.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Edward D.

I was enchanted then, and upon rereading the book over the years, including recently, am still enchanted. This is children's literature at its best. The style is not dated, the story line is simple and the author has the ability of catch the reader from the first and not let go until the last page is turned. Not only do we get a great story though, but we get a great first hand account of our history seen through a child's eyes.

On their voyage through the old country times they run along many troublesome times, they get through them. In the book there are Indians and they moving through different territories every year. The reason I would give this book 4 stars is because I like adventures and old books like this. There is a whole series of this book. I've read the first, second, and third.

This is about a family, Ma, Pa, Laura, Mary, and Baby Carrie who leave their home in the Big Woods to move towards the west. They soon settle on a prairie and continue to build up their new house. A year has past, but then a problem arises. One of their neighbors tells Pa that soldiers are coming to kick them off their settled land. Indians have been complaining to the government.

Laura and her family were, at times, kind of racist against the native Americans. When I first read this book, I was very dissapointed at that but now I realized that Laura was just a very ignorant girl who has been taught to fear them. So if you read this book, you should understand that these people lived in a very different world from us, not just in terms of electricity and modern inventions, but also socially. Anyway, apart from being slihjtly racist, I just don't like this book as much as Little House in the Big Woods but it's still pretty good for young kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little House On The Prairie","review":"Summary: This book was boring and weird. I liked the pictures and the big words they used. My favorite part was when they arrived on the prairie. My favorite character was Carrie because she was sweet,caring and loving.

To tell the truth, I didn't like the book that much and I would give the book probably a half of a star. But, the book was surprising but i still didn't like it.What I liked about the book: I liked the pictures and the big words they used!What I didn't like about the book: I didn't like the characters and the two horses (Pat and Patty) because they were weird!Jazmin Buffalo, NY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little House on the Prairie review","review":"I gave my book five stars because I like the way it tells you what the characters are doing and how they're feeling about their lives.Little House on the Prairie is about a little girl named Laura Ingalls and her family.It tells about their move to an Indian country where they have all these cool adventures and meet new neighbors.

But there's a frilled frog hidden in every picture!! This book is witty, beautiful, and enchanting. I have to buy another 2 copies for friends!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for children.","review":"This book is wonderfully written as if it was true.

I did think Gigan was a cool newcomer to the franchise. The reason I don't like it is because of the stock footage, Japanese Scooby doo gang complete with a shaggy utilizing a corn on the cob weapon and the monsters suits, sans Gigan, being old and worn out. They used the Godzilla cookie monster suit for this one. Yes the monsters have anthropomorphic traits such as talking and teasing each other. Only get this if you want to complete a collection. Too bad because with a bigger budget this could have been a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla is the Supreme action hero.....","review":"another fantastic dip into the world of Godzilla.enough good things cannot be said about this wonderful film series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY, WHY,WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Its me, DC.

I hope for everyone's sake, you'll stay away from these SO CALLED MOVIES!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars for Ghidorah fans only","review":"I was going to rate this three stars but I rated it four stars becaue I am a King Ghidorah fan (he is my 2nd favorite Kaiju, slightly behind Rodan)It's still good but not as good as most other G-films. Gigan is a decent opponent but there was a lot of stock footage. Seeing stock footage badly used in a movie is weird. Normally, movies don't have stock footage. Anyway, G fights Gigan a lot and King Ghidorah helps gigan at times. anguirus tries to help G but ends up getting beaten up through most of the fight scene. The monster/ttack fight scene, from where King Ghidorah and Gigan attack Tokyo onwards, is about 40 minutes long. It would have been better if the original footage were set during the day (because stock footage was set during the day). One thing that would have made this movie much better is if Rodan had been in it instead of Anguirus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gigan!","review":"Gigan is the third best monster ever created! Godzilla and Anguirus were the best, and this movie had all three of them! Too bad they had to put Ghidrah in there to stink it up!

It isn't even an OK Godzilla movie. But having been made a few years after the horrific Godzilla's Revenge and immediatly before the insipid Godzilla vs. Megalon, it comes across as a breath of breathable, if not fresh, air. The plot is standard for the time and fairly unimaginative, and the characters are truly awful. The monster action is at least fairly entertaining, but the only really good part is Akira Ifukube's score, the hearing of which can cause you to forgive a lot of the movie's sins. The final fight scene, unfortunatley, is the worst bit of the monster action, being too slow and dull to really stir anything. Bottom line: watch it, but only if there are no better Godzilla movies available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"I am the biggest G fan in the world, but this one just stinks. Megalon, G's Revenge and Spacegodzilla are worse, but not by much. The economy in Japan at the time was horrible, so little money was used to make the 70's G movies. Stock footage was used also. Of course for all Godzilla fans, there are cool cheesy action sequences, and Gigan was a nice creation, but the story and overall production of the film was not good at all. And Godzilla actually speaks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The monsters talk","review":"The monsters talk in this movie. the title as originally Godzilla On Monster Island in Japan.

In both of the films I've seen that contain Gigan, he never comes across as anything more than just 'another monster'. Godzilla and friend talk in silly cartoon voices and Ghidorah (looking very unwell) is thrown in for no better reason than to help the film sell. Moments of good humour early on don't justify this plotless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute tat","review":"Who chooses which Godzilla films are to be released in the UK? Pop Larkin? We're still awaiting the release of the Destroyah, Biollante, nineties Mechagodzilla and original 1950s Godzilla films over here, and yet twaddle like this waste of time is festering wherever you may go.The plot (if you feel like calling it that) involves a race of aliens who intend to take over the world with the help of a monster which appears to have been put together from kitchen utensils. So it's up to Godzilla and that rather hopeless Ankylosaurus-bloke to sort out the mess, mumbling and muttering to one another in synthesized tones as they go about it.Yawnsome, predictable, laughable trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla comes back in a weak adventure","review":"Well,the film has 2 good things:1) Gigan is a cool monster, and 2)Angilas is used in here for a time,and I like him.Besides that,the movie is pretty bad,from Godzilla talking(no,I am not making this up ),Ghidora looking stiff,and the stock footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best !!","review":"This is better that it has plot, compared to Godzilla vs. Megalon.

Reduced the time it took to swap out wheels and worked great. Hit the button and it quickly broke the lugs loose and if you let go of the button it free spins the lugs right off. Plenty of power and not too big to handle, but it is a big wrench. The carry case is nice - tossed it in the trunk and it came along to the track.

It is a bit large, but works perfectly, is powerful, and has a long battery life. I used it on wheel lugs, up to 3/4 in. bolts. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This impact will do the job.","review":"Before I purchased this Impact Wrench I was skeptical about cordless, electric, impact wrenches, I did not think they could be as good as pneumatic impact wrenches at removeing lug nuts. After reading the reviews and the return policy, I bought this one, got it home and it more than amazed me. It does the job as good as or better than many air-driven impact wrenches. The only downside is unlike other DeWalt cordless tools, there is no electric brake, this is only a minor inconvienience. The case this wrench comes with is perfect for keeping in the car or truck, it even has enough room to leave a deep impact socket on the tool and fit in the case, along with enough room for the charger, both batteries, and storage room for more sockets and other attachments. This tool is great for home, work and road side needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Impact Wrench","review":"Works great, powered off my lug nuts like a pro, unlike some of the other cordless impact wrenches I first tried...

It didn't have quite the power i was hoping for and the batteries don't hold a charge more than two hours,(under heavy use), but it does the job when the battery is freshly charged. In many cases I found I had to break a nut or bolt loose by hand.I also didn't like the reversing switch as part of the trigger. I would have preferred a separate reversing switch. I also didn't like the lock pin on the end of the shaft which requires a separate tool or pin to press down the lock pin to put on a socket. In all fairness, the lock pin does prevent a socket from flying off so it is a safety advantage.All in all, I would recommend purchasing a tool with more power and longer battery life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid tool, extra battery included","review":"Haven't had a lot of time to use this but it is typical DeWalt quality and comes with two batteries.

Also, I don't want to hear sylvian imitate tom waits and sade in the same song (Midnight Sun)or miles davis in another (all my mothers's names). Brilliant trees, Gone to Earth and the Rain Tree Crow Disc are all masterworks from an unusually gifted man. Dead Bee's is just plain dull. Maybe he has choosen the wrong guitarists.

It seems like Sylvian keeps getting more and more interested in making perfect little soundscapes as a means to an end, instead of using the 'scapes as a means for connection to a listener.

Simply, this album is the embodiment of grace. Marriage, children and residing in the U.S. seem to have had a good affect on Sylvian. In this album he shows a profound understanding of the subtleties of funk and the blues, weaving it all together to tell the story of personal evolution, the recess of darkness and shadows into a surrender to grace.

The pictures on the package are quite misleading, suggesting that there is actual fruit to be found inside the biscuits. Not so. Yeah, there's a couple of raisin specks in each biscuit, but if you didn't already know that you'd be hard-pressed to figure out what kind of fruit it was supposed to represent. On the upside? Well, the dog likes them. So I won't bother to return them as she is a good dog and deserving of things that she thinks are a treat. You probably won't find them very treat-like unless you long for dried out wafers with vaguely representational fruit-specks in them.

This masterwork comprising essays from different Catholic thinkers and apologists is clear, exhaustive and convincing for all of its 619 pages with which it smashes sola scriptura.From the fact that sola scriptura was never believed until the reformation, to the fact that the NT itself contains extra-biblical Jewish traditions to the fact that sola scriptura makes the bible the personal rubix cube of the reader, this book will make any Protestant who takes the time to read and actually digest the arguments in it very, very uncomfortable. As a Protestant, I had to be honest an admit that s.s. has no basis-either biblically, or epistemologically."},{"rating":"1","title":"only thing worse then beating a dead horse is the wrong one","review":"the only thing worse then beating a dead horse is beating the wrong dead horse....sungenis wastes 629 pages defeating solo scriptura but not sola scriptura...for a thorough refutation of his entire thesis and the dangers of the partim-partim view of roman catholicsm i recommend keith mathison's book the shape of sola scriptura....i could have knocked solo scriptura in 2 pages and saved some trees to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look no further","review":"You need look no further than 2 Timothy 3:14 to refute the entire premise of the book: \\"the holy Scriptures, are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.\\"This seems to have escaped the authors, who like to give credit for this truth to Protestants, thanks, but it's God's Word not an organized religion's theory---perhaps there's no desire to engage in that losing battle, attacking God's Word rather than a group of mere humans.It's irresponsible to not address that basic issue, but then, the book would end after one sentence--wouldn't it??

How to go through Seminary and just memorize a bunch of facts without understanding what you were supposed to learn (like Scott Hahn, Martin Grodi, etc.). 2. How to build a false picture of your opponents argument, refute it and then claim victory over some thing that your opponent doesn't believe. To anyone who wants to read a lot of words about some fictious belief of the Protestants then waste your time and read Bible Bob's book. If anything, it will be a great door stop.

The Catholic Church has always believed in the Bible as well as Sacred Tradition while Luther and Calvin introduced the concept of sola scriptura (the Bible alone) as the final authority. This book, written by a man who converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, presents the biblical and historical rationale for the Catholic position as well as responding to the common Protestant objections to the Catholic position.

It is essential to every Catholic who really loves the faith or anyone who is not arrogant about their own traditions who would like to know more about this critical issue.

And one of the most informative too. What really sets this book apart from most others on the topic is the detailed account of an American living through the post-war period and the excesses and hubris of the boom and eventual bust. I can almost imagine myself in Nick's shoes as he fights his way to the top of the pile only to slip under the weight of his greed. At the same time, this book imparts a valuable history lesson on just how much of Japan's economic boom was truly the result of hard work and how much was rigged. Until I read this book, I never fully appreciated the level of collusion and stunning, open-mouthed greed of Japan's ruling classes. It seems like another world, one that I can only see through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I first watch American colony : meet the Hutterites it was good but this was not.

These are some of the best lullabies and folk sonnets I have ever heard. Donovan has a gift for creating such lovely images with perfection of phrase. That scratchy old record has been dubbed to tape a thousand times, and the tape gets listened to until you can only hear tape hiss. It will be a real treat to hear them in CD quality.
