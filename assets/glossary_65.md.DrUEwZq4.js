It works well enough for me. It will weakly magnetize my screwdrivers (I did not expect miracles). With my screwdrivers, the magnetism is just strong enough to grab small screws (just what I needed to work on my PC). To magnetize your screwdrivers simply put them through the magnetize square and slowly remove them. To demagnetize my screwdrivers, I found that slowly stepping them down the demagnetizing side works best for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok - but rate it as below average","review":"I needed another magnetizer, as the one I have is over 20 years old and I lost half of it - there was a rubber band type attachment holding the two pieces together. I bought this hoping it would be better then the half of the 20 year old metal one - I was disappointed. It works, but not as good as the half of the 20 year old one. I wonder if I removed the green casing, it might magnetize better, or maybe the green casing is holding it together, so removing the green might break it. Overall, it is ok - but I would give it a below average rating. It is good for small metal screws, but will only slightly magnetize a medium screwdriver. What bug me about this one is that it worse then the 20 year old piece I am still using. Wish I could find the other half, if I did not discard it. And, yes it would be nice to have some directions as to what the right side steps are for. They could have put some directions on the back of the package or a small insert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work For Me","review":"I tried to use this on some drill bits for a small drill I have.

The print is so very very small that it is impossible to read without a magnifying glass. I just can't do it. The sad part is, there is plenty of room on most of the pages for a larger print to have been used. It looks like it was printed with a size 8 font and maybe a size 6 under the photos. I cannot in all honesty say that I have read this book. I have looked at the photos only. If the type were readable, it would have been read cover to cover by now and I would have implemented what I had learned! What a shame that the publisher let this go with such small print. Maybe when the second edition comes out, they will print it larger. I will buy that edition when it comes out. Tim Rudman worked very hard putting this wonderful book together, only for the publishers to blow it. This will be the first book I have ever returned to Amazon.com.

But keep in mind this version wasn't made originally for America it was made for Japanese people and to what I know there were 2 other movies before this one, so without those other 2 movies you don't get the whole story.By the way I'm not goin to tell you about the movie, it would ruin it for you, I will say it's worth the buy!!I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars, The best in the series!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces Of a Puzzle","review":"Ju-On the grudge is about a horrific murder that develops an un-rested spirit which rages in a small suburban house in Japan. The movie constructs itself similar to a puzzled storyline as the movie developed through numerous storylines of the varying characters. For the most part, viewers can easily be confused in the flick, or bored, as it may seem a bit redundant. I thought the movie was well written and interesting in theory. In practice, the movie felt never-ending, and as it drew to a close, i felt betrayed. The movie was unfulfilled, as it never really explained a lot of questions I held at the end. One question that leaves me wondering is questioning whether it is a Japanese custom to enter a house when no one answers. For those interested in Asian horror, try Tale of Two Sisters. This Korean film has great cinematography and story line. It will leave you on edge and taken back at its close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"This movie is overrated. I rented this film because people were telling me that it was way better and scarier than the newly released American version \\"The Grudge\\".I just do not see what is so scary about a naked, meowing, little boy dipped in powder and a woman crawling down the stairs (it's been done before---The Exorcist, anyone??). Is that supposed to give me nightmares? It looked so fake. I ended up laughing because this movie made no sense at all. People are just dying here and there. You would think that after a while of hearing about people missing/dying after entering the house, they'd learn their lesson and would've condemned or burned down the place. You feel no sympathy for the characters because of their stupidity and start cheering on the ghosts instead.Good thing I didn't buy this film and I was able to return it to the video store as soon as possible.

From the first \\"name\\" to the last they all die the same way, oohhh gray person with black, scary eyes...oooohhhh, scary.

The one I was looking for was the original version called \\"Ju-on: The Curse\\", which scared me so badly I still don't go in the attic alone. This version I'm reviewing (and which falsely came up under a search for The Curse) is called \\"Ju-on: The Grudge\\", which was the director's immediate remake of his terrifying film. It seems he didn't think American audiences could handle or understand the original version so he came up with this campy horror film that's not even as scary as the American \\"The Grudge\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome film, likely to give you nightmares!","review":"What's it about?Home-care worker Rika gets a job minding an old woman in a house which seems routine. Rika's underwear takes a ride to brown town when a ghostly boy emerges upstairs and routine takes a back-seat. This house and the spirits that dwell within hold a grudge against anybody foolish enough to infringe.Is it any good?A masterpiece in J-Horror; Takashi's \`The Grudge' is a pulse pounding ride on a ghost train. It scores big with it's slow pacing, building tension one scary scene after another, holding on to our fears and not letting go. Great sound effects, spooky atmosphere and plenty of psychological pressure; just ignore the weak American remake.Best bit?Kayako's horrifying descent down the stairs; those sound effects are so memorable.Did you know?The strange vocal sounds were performed by director Shimizo Takashi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but sometimes hard to follow","review":"I personally loved Ju-on. This is the original movie that the american \\"Grudge\\" was based on. If you saw the american version it follows the original pretty well with a mix of america's sequal. It's in japanese and english dub. The only problem with this movie is that I can be hard to follow because you don't have a strict time line. You find yourself skipping around through characters and ultimately in a time warp. Sometimes you see what is happening now and in the past at the same time and you're not quite sure what is real. Other than that the movie is wonerful a suspense that is definately worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painted blue?","review":"Not Scary. Boring. Disappointing. Grudge by far better.

This film is essentially a string of death scenes cause by vengeful spirit(s). There's no real story. There's no explanation as to why the problem/ghost exists. There's no explanation as to why the house it exists continued to stand even when so many people died because of it. I know cliches like the psychic or priest usually kill a movie, but I think it would have helped this film. The conflict would have at least given the film some direction or purpose. Sadly, some directors spend too much time trying to make scenes on the screen create an emotional reaction but fail to tie them all together with a story arc.

The author thoroughly covers the nuances and shades of meaning of the motion verbs in a compact book that doesn't waste the reader's time. The only problem with the book is that there is no answer key for the exercises. This somewhat limits the book's usefulness if you are trying to study Russian on your own. Overall, this book is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I bought this game at Goodwill for $4.00 and I am seriously regretting buying it. The game started out cute, with calming music and adequate graphics. However, things got bad fast. The music, for one, was too loud, and I couldn't adjust the volume, just turn music and sound on or off. Then I tried the tutorial, and found out how bad the game really was. The screen \\"swivels\\" with the mouse, and the menu at the bottom pops up when you mouse over it. So, you may just want to look down when you accidentally activate that annoying menu. Then, when the tutorial prompted me to change the trains speed by using \\"+\\" or \\"-\\", they wouldn't work, no matter what I tried, the train just sat there! Frustrated, I quit, but to my great dismay, the game had messed up my screen resolution! Now my laptop has black bars on the sides of the screen forever! I have to scroll down on every webpage too! Please, for sanitys sake, don't buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 'customer support'!","review":"Having lost 3+ pounds by end of week 2, I thought I was on my way to good health and proper nutrition, but problems began to arise and there was no 'customer support' to contact! Finding myself very weak, having occassional bouts of forgetfulness and confusion, I must have been getting low blood sugar. (The assigned calorie card for my profile must not have enough calories for me personally to function on). I have since increased to the next higher calorie card, hoping it might still allow me to lose the weight, yet afraid to stay on the diet, fearing reccurence of the unusual, scary symptoms! A phone number with an on-call dietician is needed in case of problems to make this a workable program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair reviews","review":"I have nothing against this product, but SIX of these 14 reviews are BY THE SAME PERSON. This unfairly pads the results and gives a false impression of the product, rather than providing helpful information. It's great if a customer is enthusiastic, but when s/he misuses the review system to hype a product, that's not so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who like balance","review":"I was so big I couldn't excercise when I got my first food mover--used it and over 6 months lost 60 lbs, lost another 10 with not following it over the next 3 months-but remembering how the balance was. That was about 5 years ago, due to some major lifestyle upsets I have only now gained most of that back, but--the food mover is my hope, and the only thing that worked for INDEPENDENT me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most underrated CT album & maybe best period","review":"Great collection of 11 finally crafted 3 minute rock-pop songs. There is not more than one bad song in the bunch. I have 11 Cheap Trick albums and I believe this is their best album. The 70s albums get all the hype and the critics then write off the 80s Cheap Trick. However, I do not feel that their sentiments are justified when one considers this album and Next Position Please. Quite frankly, this is one of the best albums of the 80s. If you like CT and you are sick of hearing Surrender and the like, this is a tremendous album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a loud rocker that won't let you catch your wind!","review":"This album should have been titled \\"One After Another\\", as one loud, thrashy, almost abrasive song after another assaults your ears. Don't try this one if you're feeling mellow. The songs still contain Cheap Trick's trademark melodies, but Robin Zander uses his harsher vocal style on all the songs, including the powerful anthemic ballad \\"If You Want My Love\\". A very cohesive album, all the songs contain very loud, driving drum tracks, and loud, almost screaming, backup vocals. Contains the Sophomoric, yet undeniably catchy and clever lyrical hit \\"She's Tight\\", plus original and innovative songs like the eerie pulsating \\"Saturday at Midnight\\" and the technodriver \\"I Want Be Man\\". Cheap Trick has an album for everyone, and headbangers will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew, that coulda been close........","review":"CT was my favorite band in high school. Heard \\"In Color\\" playing in a record (those black round things) store and had to have it. Followed them for a short time and then moved on. I am thankful that the record store was not playing One On One that day. Fast Forward to 34 years later and I come across these tunes on YouTube. HORRIBLE! Only one or two that do not make me cringe.I suggest buying In Color, Heaven Tonight, and Budokan first. If you like those....expand your CT experience and some day finish it up with this CD....last."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Songs meets Wrong Producer","review":"Early 80's release from legendary power-popsters Cheap Trick doesn't show the band at it's best. The songs are a mixed bag...some ok stuff, some junk. But nothing here even comes close to the clever, razor-sharp Cheap Trick you'll find on earlier albums like 'Heaven Tonight' and 'Live At budokan'.Roy Thomas Baker's production work here is awful. The tight, raw vitality that was Cheap Trick's hallmark sound is replaced here by a sound that feels artificial and mechanical. But my major complaint with this record is the lack of dynamics. The mix is loud and cluttered with layers and layers of grinding, mechanical guitars and screaming vocals. And where's Bun E. Carlos??? It can't be him playing these stiff, mechanical, clanky-sounding drum tracks ! Baker's production work here stands among the worst I've ever heard. Couple that with the band's marginal songs and this one's a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost my overall favorite Cheap Trick album","review":"I had rediscovered this band when I was watching Freaks and Geeks and Gonna Raise Hell was being played in the background. That made me recall when the Dream Police album came out so long ago and I had bought and loved it. But as I don't listen to radio that much anymore it is very easy to lose track of bands these days. But the more I listen to their albums I have to say that they are so SO so So overlooked. What other band has stayed together with ALL members intact and can still tour with Aerosmith. Even though I agree that it should have been the other way around. Aerosmith opening for them. Too bad that their off-humor kind of songs might have put off the fans. But anyway this is one album I would recommend to someone who was curious of Cheap Trick and what a great band they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deathly Boring","review":"Wonderfully staged, with brass musical pieces that act like a sonic massage, but the movie itself only held my attention with a handful of its 50-odd cuts. Critics seem to be more in love with their interpretations of this movie than being entertained in any way. At the very least, this movie should be loved for reasons better than \\"outrageously hilarious!\\" In a dream, perhaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera and printer combo!","review":"We bought this combo after checking out some of the other combonation's out there and this one is great. The setup and install were easy and had no problems at all. The camera works great, although it can only take a few pictures when set at the highest resolution. However, for us, that's not a big deal.The printer is very compact and has a handle for easy carrying. The camera connects on top easily and works flawlessly.The only thing I was disappointed about was that it said it came with a Photo Index card kit, cards to print the pictures on, but it wasn't in the box. We used normal note cards to try it out before buying cards. Not too big a deal, but still."},{"rating":"1","title":"camera has many flaws","review":"I purchased this camera 1 year ago, and I was so disappointed in the performance. The battery life is terrible, I took it to our town's Christmas Parade, and all the pictures are grainy and really poor quality. I posted some so you can see, also when you take a picture you can not take a picture for another good ten seconds. I had a two foot away shot of the rapper Nelly, and the camera didn't take the shot, and I only caught a shot of his tattoo on his arm! Save your money and get a better camera, like the Canon A630 the same price and much better quality, the battery life is fantastic and the night shots are great too. The shutter speed is much better too. I now have my HP in the closet because when I tried to use it on Thanksgiving the zoom would no longer zoom, and the lense does not retract. The only way I can turn off the power is too take out the batteries! I never dropped it or mistreated my camera, it is just not a good quality camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"The camera with a glass chin!","review":"While I agree with others that this camera takes some pretty nice pictures and is easy to use, I've had the same problems as many have noted here. For starters, the thing eats through batteries like there's no tomorrow. I was lucky to get 20 pictures before the batteries crapped out. My biggest problem, however came when my son was handing the camera over to me at the dinner table and it slipped out of his hand. The camera literally fell only 10-12 inches to the table, but that was enough to render this camera permanently inoperable. Be warned: if you are a little bit clumsy or have butter-fingers, think twice before buying this camera! Red-eye reduction is also a bit of a joke with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent camera","review":"I was a little doubtful about purchasing this camera, because I read a lot of bad reviews, but honestl I think it's a wonderful and awesome camera, nice features, easy to use, nice pictures. The only drawback are the batteries, but that is common on digital cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so camera","review":"This camera i have had for a while, and i personally think it stinks. It is somewhat heavy for this range. The mega pixels are only 5, zoom is only 3x, and it takes AA batteries. It's battery life is not very good, it is heavy, and overall i would not suggest it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good camera","review":"I have had this camera since December of 2005.But i got i with the printer too.The printer is very good.But more can be said for the camera.For a few reasons The battery life is very poor.Like it can probley last you 30 mins at the most.And some times if you take a lot of pictures you can use them from the camera.And it will say photo can not be found.And sometimes whene you turn the camera on the screen will be off.And the screen is kind of bleek and dark and blurry too.And the video quality is horrible.And when you are taking a video with the camer the videos are very blurry and poor.And when you take a video you can look at the video on the camera but you CAN NOT HEAR THE SOUND.You have to have a computer to here the sound.And my grandpa has a canon and you can watch the video and hear the sound on the camera too!!!!!And in my opinon HP makes better computers then cameras. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was upset but now greatly pleased","review":"I was upset at Blue House in their response to an issue. They finally responded and the final outcome was way beyond what I expected and the recipient of the product was overwhelmed. What Blue House or some of the other sellers might incorporate is an automated system that responds to the sender a caned response that notifies them that their e-mail was received and they will respond within 24 or 48 hours so the requester is not waiting and getting angry and sending a second e-mail when they are diligently working on getting an answer to the problem. But after their response I was very well pleased with their answer. Will definitely do buisness with them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE JUNK!","review":"This is the most over priced and poorest quality cameras on the market. I have returned mine twice for repairs and now the auto focus is going out.

DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, people!!","review":"I agree, I agree, I agree! Why isnt Third Watch on DVD?

As a NYC cop, I never really took to watching the series in the first run. Now I'm able to appreciate the show for what it is, well-written, directed, and acted entertainment! Every now and then I catch an elusive episode on late night TV, which just whets my appetite for the whole series.I recently caught the episode where Sully forced Bosco to perform crossing guard duty in the rain (been there, done that!) I loved when the little kid asked the macho cop, \\"men do that?\\" and Bosco freaked out!The mixture of humor, drama, real life incidents and totally unbelievably acts makes this series worth watching. I hope it is released on DVD soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of Merchandise","review":"I have just received the first season of Third Watch. While I've yet to watch the disks themselves, I have opened the box and found 3 filmsy cases with all the disks loose, unable to fasten to the plastic holders because most of them were broken. The packaging itself is cheap and while all the disks look okay, I'm not holding out much hope that they will play without a problem. Because it will take a while to watch all 6 disks, I wanted to write this review quickly to inform other customers of the packaging itself. If the disks play without problem, I guess the cheap cases won't really matter but I will have to find alternate source of perserving my disks because they will not be safe in the cheaply made, broken plastic holders I received.Third Watch: The Complete First Season"},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Watch Series 1 on DVD","review":"Third Watch Series 1 is being released on DVD in the UK on the 22nd of April 2006, it is region 2 but may play on US DVD players, go to Amazon.co.uk to view the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring Back Third Watch & Put it on DVD","review":"I simply could not believe it when Third Watch was canceled. NBC canceled one of the best shows on TV; they'll probably replace it with yet another Law and Order, just what we need. Not to mention, they ended it without finally letting Faith and Bosco get together. Something needs to be done, and there are protests going on to get Third Watch back on the air, maybe even on another network, since NBC obviously didn't appreciate Third Watch enough. Please release Third Watch on DVD; loyal viewers have been waiting for years for this awesome show to come to DVD. Please tell NBC how you feel about the cancelation, and tell them its time for Third Watch on DVD.

I too am upset, but would only ask the executives that make these decisions to consider the fan base involved, who have been loyal viewers of this show. There must be a number involved that would make it worth your while to produce these shows on DVD. I only hope that there are enough of us out there to convince you that it would be worth your while.

In fact the dangers faced by people in all of the aforementioned professions are cleary illustrated throughout the entire series.The relationships between some of the characters become romantic on occassion, however not so much that you get tired of it. The female characters are gutsy, which is always a plus. I hate female characters who scream incessantly and trip over their own feet.Later in the series there are also some cameo appears from Tom Berenger and the late Roy Scheider.A series well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Michael Beach in this","review":"This one one of the better dramas that's ever come on TV.

I tend to like the characters from the 55th precinct (the beat cops) the most so I prefer the 4 and 5 seasons but the first season is very good. The writers do a good job of throwing a little excitment into the script and mixing things up so it is not boring at all.

All 4 CD's have many great moments. Two of my particular favorites are on Still Life - namely the sweet \\"Anniversary Waltz\\", and the brooding \\"Inspiration.\\" The latter is remeniscient of Beatle ballads like \\"And I Love Her\\" - but takes that style to a new level. To me, it conveys the thoughts that we don't understand how inspiration works, but we know that it is amazing and beautiful, nonetheless.

It's pretty hefty, but the helper handle takes care of that.Truly makes for one-pot meals.

I made my Asian short ribs in this pan - browned them up nicely, then threw all the liquids in the pan, covered it & baked.

Though not 'inexpensive' in most peoples view, cuisinart is consistently much less expensive than its 'top of the line' competitors.

They offer curriculum suggestions if you aren't sure where to start or what to use, but you do have the freedom to choose your own. The authors state that the time schedules and book suggestions are just suggestions, not set in stone. I think this is a must-read when teaching multiple children. It shows you how you can teach them history and science to multiple ages using resources geared for them. It's one book that will stay on my shelf, except when I loan it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from all the other 5 star reviews","review":"I found the authors' tone as being rather smug (to the point of throwing this book down!)and beliefs rather Eurocentric. There are many gaps left for the reader to figure out concerning grade levels. Many of their curriculum recommendations are religious and being a non Christian I wish they gave other curriculum options. I don't agree with many of their views and I would advise anyone to ck this book out of the library first before purchasing. They don't value computer science/the use of computers as part of their curriculum (ofcouse being a 'Classical Education' guide!) It's an obnoxious book but maybe useful for some. Good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Homeschooling Book","review":"The Well-Trained Mind is the worst home schooling book I have read. I am very thankful that it was not one of the first homeschooling books I read because most of it is impractical, irrelevant and sometimes ridiculous. This book is very narrow and appears to be unaware that children learn by doing, that learning is meaningful, and that there are many ways to learn. The only type of person that might benefit from this book is an exceptionally mature, gifted, daughter who loves to read and whose parents have an unlimited budget for homeschooling. If this is your situation, then ask yourself if you would want to limit her with this teaching style. To avoid disappointment, consider borrowing this book from the library before purchasing it. There are many wonderful homeschooling books; it is worth the effort to find the one that is right for your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Even though I'm not a homeschooler, I've been looking for a way to enrich my children's education. This book is thought provoking, yet filled with a good deal of common sense on the subject of educating our children. I feel as though I were handed a clear guideline on what to do, with clear, concise reasons for doing it that way. This was immensely helpful to me.It is clear that you can modify some elements of it, but that you should resist changing others. I have already started on many of the author's suggestions and my children are eating it up. The author's refusal to \\"dumb down,\\" is a great part of it's strength. I realized that I had underestimated what my children could learn and be excited about. This book also pointed out to me how much I had not been taught in my own education, so it's a little like going back to school for me as well. I can't say enough about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids!","review":"This book is a real revelation. The authors set forth the classical idea of the trivium in a way which can be useful for any \\"home-schooler\\" whether the students are children or adults. This book explains in a very essentialized manner what anyone needs in order to learn how to think - exactly what modern education does not do! As a \\"victim\\" of today's miserable educational system I felt two conflicting emotions while reading it: admiration for the authors' great achievement and the disappointment of discovering just how rotten my own education was.

I warn readers though to read without taking too much of it seriously-- while the resources listed are good, and the ideas about classical education are also excellent, the way in which the author suggest these ideas be accomplished are little over the top.

If the authors have such well-trained minds, why do they take so long to make their points? After reading their tome, I felt like writing -The Well-Trained Mind for Dummies- or -WTM Cliff Notes- just to make the book's useful aspects (e.g., resource lists, approach to history study) more accessible.2. The \\"homeschooling Bible\\"?--please! The only thing biblical about this book is its length. No one book could possibly tell all homeschoolers how to teach all their children. And a book's wild popularity doesn't make it a classic; it merely makes it a fad.And finally . . .3. If this is what it takes to have a well-trained mind, I don't want one. Implementing just a few of the book's suggested methods created a joyless learning experience for my children and me. Training (instructing/drilling) and educating (developing/enlightening) are clearly not the same thing. I'll take an educated mind over a well-trained one any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"I ordered this book after having heard and read many glowing reviews. Unless you are starting homeschooling (or supplementing) with a pre-schooler, you are too late to get much use out of this (very expensive) tome. You will most likely lapse into deep depression upon learning that you are at least three years behind in covering the essential materials if you begin at kindergarden age or later. Moreover, it is the type of learning plan which will be most appealing to those who feel that schools are deficient in testing and drilling, and that memorization is learning in its most perfect form. The references are outdated in many places, many of the materials and books reccomended are now out of print. All and all, an expensive disappointment in a slick and appealing dust jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"One to leave behind","review":"I have almost all the Kansas CD's again (had them when on vinyl), but this one was one I should have skipped over. Without Steve Walsh, something was amis already (go buy the 'Streets' albums), and the over use of piano and sax made this something else... not the memorable progressive art-rock band I know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Die hard Kansas fans will not typically enjoy this CD due to the absence of vocalist Steve Walsh. But, if you listen with an open mind, you will find that this CD is superb! Elefante's compositions are a little more 'pop' sounding than typical Kansas, but they are very catchy, good songs. Livgren's writing is great as always, and Violinist Robby Steinhardt had not yet left the band and did some great work here. Take this CD for what it is and don't compare it to the old Kansas sound and you will find a CD that is very inspiring and much more thought-provoking than most of the intellectual mush in more popular rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm......","review":"I really enjoy this album. John Elefante doesn't have the best singing voice, but he does a good job here. I think the saxophones and the other horns were a nice touch. It's more consistent than AudioVisions and it's also a better sounding album. They sound more like a rock band on this.And, as always, they're at their best when they're rocking out, like on \\"Fair Exchange\\" ,\\"Windows\\", and \\"Crossfire\\". One of my few complaints is that some of the choruses are weak, especially on the song \\"Borderline\\". Also, they should've let Steinhardt sing more. Other than that, this is a very listenable and musical album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best!","review":"Vinyl Confessions, Kansas' first album after the departure of Steve Walsh, still remains one of their best. While John Elefante lacks the power and emotion of Steve Walsh, he is still a very good singer. But as always with Kansas, the real key to their success is in songwriting and musicianship. Most of the songs lack the intricacies of much of their older stuff, but they are still well-written and expertly arranged. Also, as a wannabee drummer, I appreciate how much Phil Ehart's drumming is featured on almost every song. The songs have a sharper feel than most of their older albums, and a band known for tight arrangements perhaps reached their peak in that respect on Vinyl Confessions. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Skewed Point of View","review":"With Livgren's religious conversion came the natural desire to relate his new world view into music (as all artists do). The songs Livgren wrote for this album have an undercurrent of Christian thought that is possibly disturbing for the \\"Traditional\\" Kansas fan. However, on it's own merits I can't wait to own it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Effort, still Kansas, ....this was from the 80's?","review":"Solid Rock and Roll album.Kansas' Vinyl Confessions now sporting not only new lead singer, John Elefante. But a bit of a different Kansas sound. Still, vocal and band driven, but perhaps updated for the 80s. Don't get me wrong, this is not \\"pop/techno\\".One listen and you'll know what I mean. The band is here, tight, crisp production, great musical and lyrical, undeniably Biblical/Christ/Redemption/themed song-writing, along with the emotional strains of Robby Steinhardt's violin.If you are a Kansas diehard, leary of Kansas without Steve Walsh, give this a shot. If you are thinking this is only Kerry Livgren with Kansas in the background, you are mistaken.Its good, classic, progressive rock, miles away from radios' mistaken 80s caricature.Take advantage of the availability of the download it and turn it up.Rock and Roll never died, It just stopped getting promoted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good guide to 'Hamlet'","review":"I enjoy reading basic introductory guides to subjects I have studied or read in the past. I not only love reading Literature I love knowing about it. So despite my over fifty years experience in reading and rereading 'Hamlet' I picked up this guide and enjoyed learning from it. The Guide gives detailed description of each scene of the play and has a special appendix dedicated to describing each major character. I read through the scene summaries and in doing so understood as never before the critical role played by the Ghost in the play. I also learned more about dear Horatio Hamlet's great friend who is a Stoic in his philosophy and who remains alive 'to tell Hamlet's story'.What I missed in the guide is any real sense of what moves most of all in it, the powerful poetry, the remarkable language."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"unfortunately the projects in this book are not that much appealing like the fantastic ones you might find in other series like the \\"american house\\"... the materials are simple i agree, but the plans are very poor, doesn't add to your data bank of ideas, the photos don't help alot, and frankly it is the houses fault anyway, the plans are even worse, the text is very limited.I do recommed that you look somewhere else if you are looking for inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passin' The Faith Along","review":"Received the DVD in very good condition.

I didn't feel much like laughing at anything, and I especially disliked Miner's snide tirades about how crappy everyone is, no matter how successful they are. I feel like this is one of those books that young, hip people like to read with the cover showing in coffee shops, laughing at the top of their lungs so that everyone will know how witty and with-it they are.

Sam looked uncomfortable, and from his darting eyes I should have known he was lying just to get out of that corner. He had a title ready too. It was \\"State Television Has Guarded Us Against Cretins.\\" I told him I loved it, he excused himself and went to the sink to wash his hands, and I was able to leave feeling as if I'd accomplished something for once.

Most people--one would hope!--eventually outgrow the main character's adolescent self-absorption. Why any reader--or for that matter, any author--would want to waste their time vicariously reliving such a pompously uninteresting stage of life for an entire novel is a mystery. What's no mystery is why this character was so unpopular in high school and throughout his life: he's a crashing bore.

I might as well have been reading the unabridged history of the Byzantine Empire, or even Moby Dick! And no one was more sorry than me, after all the good things I heard and read about this masterpiece.

While Mallory established the standard for the Arthurian legend (in English, at any rate), Tennyson's poetry is far more impressive. The stories themselves seem more impressive in Tennyson's sure hands. Unfortunately, I also made the mistake of watching \\"Camelot\\" on video recently; what a travesty. Guenevere is referred to as Ginny, Sir Lancelot is called Lance, and the over-all Hollywood approach is debasing and embarrassing.

It worked well the first time I used it making perfectly round pancakes. However, after a couple of uses the pancakes would stick to the pan and burn. Pancakes may look ready, but then you try and flip them and pancake batter runs out all over the place. I wish that I would have read the reviews before I bought this. They were a real waste of money ( or I guess you could say I got my money's worth because it did save us money by having breakfast at home rather than going out.)

I couldn't pass it up. Then I got home and tried to actually use the thing. The main problem is the huge gap between the two pans when you close them. For sandwiches, it works okay as long as you flip it very quickly. For pancakes and eggs (especially eggs! HUGE mess!!), they fly out of the pan when you flip it. I tried waiting to flip it until one side of my egg was completely cooked, but by that time, it ended up getting burnt, and sticking to the pan. There's nothing like the smell of burnt egg wafting through your house.

The one flat side of the pan is great for hot sandwiches!!! So if your like me and now have two pans out of one, you could get some use out of it! I would not recommend this pan to anyone. Best of LuckA trick to keep pancakes warm: place them in a small metal bowel and put a plate over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should call it No So Perfect Pancake!!!","review":"OK, like most of us, you see a new invention on TV and you spontaneously agree that it's amazing and you buy the invention. Well I saw the Perfect Pancake on TV and ordered one right away. I thought is was a good idea until I used it!!! After waiting 90 days, yes you heard me right... I waited three months to get it, I came to the conclusion that that this is an item I can live without. Here are the problems! 1. The batter thingy would not stop pouring because it gets stuck. 2. It does not cook evenly, even in low heat the pancake was brunt. 3. The non stick stuff came off within the 3rd or 4th use. Thanks Perfect Pancake for adding new meaning to the saying: If it sounds to good to be true, then it ain't! One good thing came out of it... I like mini chopper that came with it free! It may have been a perfect idea but not a perfect product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so perfect pancake","review":"The non-stick surface is not non-stick. Even with Pam spray and melted butter, these pancakes still stick to one side. They cannot be flipped without a spatula and even then, the bottom sticks to the pan. If the surface were truly non-stick, this would be a great product! The pancakes come out perfectly round! Actually, this makes perfect sunnyside eggs (by closing the top, the white cooks while the yolks stay soft). Do not buy for pancakes or french toast though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a \\"rip off\\"....","review":"Purschaed the \\"Perfect Pancake\\" after seeing the ad on TV. Brought it home, washed it and made my batter. When you flip the pancake over to cook the other side....the pancake slides out of the \\"Perfect Pancake\\" onto the stove top. What a mess! Eggs are the same story only harder to clean up after the mess. Yes, the surface is slippery and easy to clean....but don't expect to eat anything you attempt to make. The only thing the \\"Perfect Pancake\\" is perfect on is getting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not buy","review":"I wanted to buy this item but by the reviews I noticed it was junk.

It cooked pancakes okay and forget about the eggs. Every single time I flipped, half of the eggs would spill out onto the stove. When the pan was in use it left a smell of something burning even if something wasn't. Save your money and do not buy this item. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Pancake: Far From Perfect","review":"On television, the Perfect Pancake made perfect pancakes. In real life, what I got was not perfect. The size of the PP was too small to permit baking more than one pancake at at time. If I did not use spam spray first, the batter stuck to either side. Often, when I flipped it,the batter would stick. The batter dispenser was also less than perfect. When I put in the batter, it would leak out before I could release the batter into the pan. Clearly, what I bought was a small pan that could bake only one pancake at a time, so by the time I was able to bake several, the first was cold. Apparently, mom's way was best. Use a big frying pan and save yourself the [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!","review":"I bought this product for [money] at a gourmet food show. I figured it was moderately useful for crepes, things likge that.

Please do not buy it. Not only is this poorly made, it is dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful mess!!","review":"This has got to be the worst gadget ever. The concept sounds great. But after trying to flip the pan over to cook the other side of the pankcake all the contents promply spilled out and extinqueshed the flame on my gas burner.Ok I figured, perhaps once was user error.

Saw the commercials and thought it looked great. On the first try, pancake mix ended up all over my kitchen. It spilled out the sides, as when closing it up, there is a gap between the top and bottom. Read all of the directions carefully, let it cook until it burnt the bottom of the pancake and still ended up with mix all over. Was very disappointed with this item. The only good thing that came out of this was the Perfect Pancake Pourer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect trash maybe....","review":"I hated this item. The worst money I ever spent. It worked fine if you put alot of oil on it... keep in mind this is a non stick surface. Wait until they come down alot more in price.

I use pancake mixes where you basically add water. It sticks and flips the uncooked half of the pancake out to the other side with the other 1/2 stuck to the pan. It would be easier and less mess to use the cake turner. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A ZERO STAR should be an option - Just awful","review":"This product has been the worst thing I ever purchased.

Needless to say, when we tried it out, the eggs slid out of the side of the pan and went all over the stove making a huge mess! You definitely need to use cooking spray or else it sticks to the other side of the pan. Great to make pancakes, eggs etc.! Yeah! all over the stove! all over the burners! Don't waste you money, this product definitely needs to be impoved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put your money back in your wallet","review":"This product was obviously aimed to do two things.1) Make you a fool2) Rob you of $20.00 hard earned moneyI must give them credit though because it is a good idea that many would believe would work without a problem. But as much patience as I had with it, I could not make one \\"perfect pancake\\". Why? Because the pancake would stick on one end, so that when you flipped it over you would find yourself desperately scraping it off before it caught on fire!But if you're money is biting your wallet and you just HAVE to have it, I suggest stocking up on an endless supply of Non-stick cooking spray. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grilled cheese","review":"The only thing this thing is good for is making a grilled cheese sandwich.

We tried it and on the first flip there was batter everywhere, and half the pancake was stuck to the top of the pan. I had to pull out my stove to clean up all of the messy batter down the side. We tried the next pancake and fliped over the sink. The stuff still went everywhere (at least in the sink). What a disappointment, I guess I didn't realize that there was a gap between the two pans when I bought it.I agree with the others that said maybe a good cookwear manufacturer will take up this concept, until then don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand New &amp; Caught On Fire","review":"This item was given to me a couple of years ago for Christmas. However, I was cleaning out my house and came across it. Therefore, I decided the next morning I would prepare some pancakes for my fiancee and myself. Well, I turned the stove on medium heat, like I always do. However, the crappy thing started smoking and caught on fire. The whole house smelt like burnt rubber and was filled with smoke.

Don't know how they pull it off so successfully on TV. The top and bottom don't meet tightly, so when you go to flip, whatever is still liquid pours out the sides.

The bottom is a shallow pan but the top is flat, leaving about 1/4 inch gap all the way around. I can not tell you how many eggs my husband has lost on the stove in the flipping process leaving a yucky, runny yolk mess all over. It is also VERY small. To feed one person at a time you would need to be flipping about 3 or 4 of these at the same time. Since you are likely to lose at least 1 pancake through the gap, even that may not work. A waste of time, space & most importantly, money. Stick to the old fashioned method."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can spell Mustang do not buy this book","review":"This book is good for someone who knows little to nothing about mustangs.For anyone who actually wants to modify one, do not waste your time.

I might disagree with a few points and admit that Murry at times overstates to make a point. But he is allowed to signify! I disagree with the person from pittsburgh. I think Murry can be a skilled polemicist/intellectual himself, but think he'd rather not. But the book was speaking to polemicist and intellectuals in their terms. That's the whole point. They gotten so caught up in their rhetoric that they've forgotten how to see or speak about the human experience in any other terms. It is positive, the book continues to add a freshness and bounce to the stale social science dialogue about race, culture and particularly Blacks.

This video was a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea...","review":"Maybe someone would like this DVD if they are new to exercise or want a very basic and extremely low intensity workout. I bought it because it was cheaper than most other prego workout DVD's and need variety. Kira seems very nice, but doesn't seem to have a lot of teaching experience.

The cardio portion, although it has simple steps, does nothing to get my heart rate going and that was with adding hand weights to it. She gives a lot of suggestions as to how to \\"tone it down\\" and none for how to increase intensity. I was honestly shocked at how short the abdominal portion was, but found those exercises at least a little outside of the ordinary ab routines. And a small side note, she has two other women working out with her to demonstrate pre-pregnancy and post-pregnancy - both of whom are overweight, which I didn't find too motivating. All in all I was really disappointed with this dvd and will definitely be sticking with my Perfect Preganancy Workout, which continues to be challenging each time I do it. My suggestion is to not bother with this one, you'd get a better workout taking a brisk walk around the neighborhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all of them worked properly","review":"I purchased 22 of these to give away as gifts during a Holiday Party. When the carton arrived, I opened one just to see it and it did not work. The second one we opened worked. I held on to the one that did not work and we gift wrapped the others. About a week later I heard from some of the guests that theirs did not work either. This was embarassing, to say the least.

I also did not care for the relatively large \\"Made in China\\" sticker on each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"just revisited this book after having read it 20 years (or more) ago, in the original. It is very eye opening. When I first read it at the tender age of 24, I diagnosed myself as hyperinsulinistic, and got off the sugar. That's not an easy trick, considering the culture of family around me that did everything in her power (Mom, who else?) to sabotage my new diet, and play manipulation to make me feel bad for not sharing in the addiction she raised me on. Now, she's 80, and freshly diagnosed diabetic, and refuses to go on Dr's drugs (made her feel bad), so this book is now going to her. It's all related, it's not a separate thing. Also new is high fructose corn syrup, came out after the book, so is not mentioned.

It has a list of symtoms and gives stories of people discovering their hypoglycemia. Unfortunatly, because it is so old, 1971, a few things are innacurate. For example, he no longer recomends the GTT (Glucose Tolerance Test) for possible hypoglycemics. Not only is this an emotionally draining experience, there is no need. Now he reccomends that people switch to a hypoglycemic diet, which is fully outlined in the book, and see if this alleviates their syptoms.

Many times, the political institutions are left out, for example. Yet, questions are asked about these institutions in the review questions following the chapters. It appears you are given a lot of information on topics you need to know the least and less on what you need to know the most. The author seriously takes a \\"this is just a review\\" approach. I used The Princeton Review for my AP US studies last year and received a four. This year for AP US Government I used to Princeton Review and I'm pretty confident.

It just doesn't work with arrows of virtually any useful length.The first thing I did was to cut a strip of polyurothane and stuff it into the quiver to help hold arrows in place. The strap and clip are useless and I plan to make a strap to hold the quiver over the shoulder at about a 45 degree angle to make the quiver useable at all.

There are lots of loose ends and half-answered questions, and the main protagonist's actions make no sense. I kept thinking, \\"He wants to get Ripley.

In the second volume of the Plenty trilogy, she decides to make mankind's first interstellar voyage. The book starts quite well, and it ends with a great cliffhanger, but the six hundred odd pages in between seem rather unnecessary.\\"Seasons of Plenty\\" is a story of breakdowns, the breakdown of Tabitha Jute, of order and sanity on the starship Plenty, and -- to a certain degree -- of the starship itself. This might have been entertaining if it had not been so very very long, or if the characters involved had at least been interesting, but that is not the case.Sometimes, I felt Greenland was trying to imitate M.

Overall sound quality is very good, bass is good but not excellent, comfort is not great, but you will get used to them after a few weeks. They block out outside sounds which is important in noisy urban environments. Unfortunately, after 3 months, the headphones began sounding like everything was playing underwater.

You can read the reviews for PX200 and judge whether you would like to deal with those issues. But, unlike the PX200, ergonomics of these headphones are incredibly poor.The king-kong sized neckband portrudes so far away from any normal person's neck that you simply can't rest your head against anything while wearing them. They are not adjustable, and look as if you've dropped back fully stretched regular headphones.AND, you will find that you can only get a good seal once the earclips are pinching painfully on your ears. So, wearing them comfortably means you'll have to bear with weak sound.Just as a reference, the earbuds that come with iPod sound just as good as these headphones and are also more comfortable.

The mastering engineer had to have been nearly deaf or amateur - compared to any other CD I own, recent or older, the sound of this CD is unbearably harsh, peaky in the upper midrange, and completely lacking any bass. Not only that, but it isn't even consistent from song to song. The bonus live tracks in particular are unlistenable without breaking out a graphic EQ.Now, perhaps the original master shared some of these characteristics, but here was the label's chance to fix everything and bring this classic recording up to modern standards, and they failed.

Told in the first person in the manner of Odd Thomas, it is the life story of Jimmy Tock (who is a baker of culinary treats, not a fry cook). He must live his life under the certain knowledge that there will be 5 terrible days in his life. He knows the dates, but not the details of each of these events. Excellent, well drawn characters, some you will love, some you will hate. Others maybe you just have pity for. If you like Dean Koontz' writing style, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Expectancy","review":"I loved this book. My favorite audio book. To follow would be the \\"Odd Thomas\\" series. I loved the mytstery and it's characters. I imagined Jimmy Tock as Kevin James(then I realized he could be younger, so I switched to Seth Rogen) Ponchinello Beezo as Jude Law(then Ryan Gosling, to be younger) and Jimmy's wife was always as Amanda Seyfried.

Just kind of a dull, page turning experience is what I walked away with, as I saw things coming from a mile away. The charactors wit seemed forced, and story with the murder, clowns, coincidence/chance meetings, the SUV chase...whoa, just a bit much for me to buy into, even for a book.

Please listen to me- you can get the copyrights anyway so don't worry about the money! Many thanks in advance!Life Expectancy is another great premise suffering from poor writing skills with some of the most stupid witty talks I have come to see in my life, almost to the point of ridiculos.

Koontz piles on sugar-coated \\"smarmy-ness\\" and \\"cutesy-ness\\" in quantites that the F.D.A. would consider lethal. You know the plot's in trouble when an author this experienced resorts to cheap ploys to mislead the reader- I'd expect this sort of thing in a 7th-grade creative writing class. Just as I swore off Stephen King after the miserable Dreamcatcher, I've now given up on Mr. Koontz as well. No soup for you, Mr. K.

This is the first book that was so bad that I could not force myself to finish it. The plot is so contrived that it is not believable, and the dialogue is juvenile. Normally, once I finish a book I pass it on to friends. I would not inflict this book on anyone, and threw it in the thrash where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and in your face","review":"Koontz brings together many elements of past creations but with new charcters and a gripping story of love, deceit, pschosis and warm fuzzies. I seriously enjoyed the happy, though, predictable ending. A top twenty favorite of his works. Read with donuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than some of his newer efforts!","review":"Life Expectancy is about Jimmy Tock, a lummox baker, who has 5 days in his life that holds some significant danger predicted by his grandfather right before his death. The villain is a psychotic clown, and their are a couple other villains which I will not reveal to spoil the readers. There are not that many characters as one reviewer made out to be. (try the stand or strangers which has 2 to 3 times as many characters!) This is a pretty good book, (better than his last few) but If you haven't read Twilight Eyes, Strangers, Fear Nothing, Watchers, False Memory, or Intensity, I would recommend these books over this one, simply because they are little more imaginative and more interesting than his previous 4 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets worse as it goes along","review":"There are a few interesting plot twists in this story, but for the most part, it is tedious reading about a pastry chef and his family and some evil clowns who are after them. Some of Koontz' writing is humorous, but overall, it is a ridiculous book that gets worse as it goes along. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed by this one","review":"Dean Koontz is one of the nicest authors out there. I like his personality more than his books. This is a great premise, but my enjoyment was marred by several small things. Nearly every single time someone asks a question, Koontz words it this way: \\"(the question)?\\" Jimmy wondered. No one ever asks anything, they 'wonder'. Also, I could care less about what these people eat. I've never read a book where the characters were so obsessed with food. And what was the point of all of Grandma Rowena's stories? They seemed like space filler to me. Overall, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Words: Punchinello Beezo","review":"I couldn't get past the absurdity of the names in this book. The enjoyment of the plot was stymied by Koontz's incessant desire to merge so much fantasy into a tale that could have been simply given a more real feel to it simply by naming the characters something less abnormal. You don't have to name them Bob or Mary Sue, but Konrad and Punchinello Beezo do little to inspire empathy. No one can relate to a Punchinello, no matter how much he might be like your least favorite uncle, cousin or school yard bully. Any resemblance to any character, living or dead, burns to ashes in a plot that falls way short of Koontzian standards to which any long-time reader has grown accustomed.The shock and surprise delivered by the conclusion of this book loses some of the punch it would have otherwise had with characters named with less absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"long time fan","review":"First off, I've read almost all of Koontz's books. It pains me to write a negative review on my favorite author in the face of many positive reviews. There are 2 types of Koontz in my opinion, the \\"old\\" Koontz, and the \\"new\\" Koontz, which began around Fear Nothing. The new Koontz is appears to be an exhausted attempt to create a story from uninspiring sources. This book is similar to his last book, Odd Thomas, in the sense that it is a first-person narrative centered around events that occur in the future. This particular book is by far the strangest Koontz book ever written. It's basically about clowns and the life of a man who is a baker. Come on Koontz, I want a story, not just a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Expectancy","review":"Life Expectancy is not like any other Koontz book, but not to say it is good. It lacks the excitement and plot development of his previous writing, all told as a tedious group of flashbacks. Don't even bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really did try to like it!","review":"I've recently started reading Koontz and while I think he's a good writer, I just could not get into this book! It started out well and then became just plain stupid after awhile. I like the way the author uses humor, but there was too much \\"aren't we quirky\\" cuteness about the protagonist's family for me to feel anything for them. I don't usually skim through books, but I finally had to for this one (and when I got to the end, I wish that I had just given up earlier)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Koontz but not this one","review":"I am writing this review to let other readers who either stopped reading this book or did not like know it that you are not alone. I stopped reading about half-way because the plot and dialogue seemed too contrived and unappealing....I thought it was nuts to be honest and could not focus on it to keep going.I do not want to disparage any reader from reading any Koontz book, because I am a big fan and many reviewers loved this book, but if you didn't I don't think you missed the point...the book just isn't for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a huge fan-I don't see the appeal in this book","review":"Dean Koontz is my favorite author, and to date I've read 31 of his books. But this one just didn't do anything for me. I honestly had to force myself, squirming, to finish it. I really bored me, and I just didn't find it particularly funny, either. It's definetely one of my least favorite Koontz books, if not THE worst. Sorry, this just didn't do it for me. I much prefer Intensity, Twilight Eyes, Whispers, Strangers, Hideaway, The Door To December, Watchers, Icebound, The Funhouse, and Lightning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Much in the vein of 'Velocity', I felt that this book was a 'light' read. However, this book is a bit better than Velocity and gets a solid 4/5 stars. The plot feels just a bit silly to me, but that touch of creativity and lightness here actually make for a solid and entertaining read. It's interesting to read about a family that led a different lifestyle than most others and how they were so happy and content. A bit cheesy to some of you maybe, but hey, I liked it.And the whole clown thing and the revelations that came later (poor, poor Natalie and you even gotta feel bad for Punchinello) on were also entertaining if a bit fantastic and some of them rather surprising. Mr. Koontz manages a solid and entertaining read that had me interested from beginning to end. Yep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper For My Library","review":"I ordered two new, not used, copies of Dean Koontz's \\"Life Expectancy.\\" Both books arrived within 10 days in the same package and in perfect condition.

Even so, this book was such a surprise! In all the horror books that Koontz has written, he has obviously been honing his skills as a suspense-thriller author. This book truly kept me awake nights, trying to find out what happens next. I had to force myself to put it down and at least one night, I lost a whole night's sleep because I couldn't leave Jimmy without finding out what happens next. I agree with the reviews that say the family dynamics are all warm and fuzzy, but for me, the real appeal was the hold-your-breath suspense. So many authors get stale after they have written many, many novels. But, in Life Expectancy, Koontz seems to have broken through to a new level of excitement. Here's a virtual standing ovation from an author who, as trite as it sounds, is truly not getting older, but better! Good job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Prepare to be enchanted!\\"","review":"I've read more than two dozen novels by Dean Koontz. This one is a suspense thriller about a pastry chef and his charming family and how they're terrorized for more than three decades by homicidal circus clowns and aerialists. It's also about God, faith, determination, love, and real Evil.It's a thrill ride of a novel. It's also poignant and funny as hell. I have learned something from every book by Dean Koontz I've read. I've learned more from this one than from any of the others. There is wisdom here. There is also one hell of a story here. Read it.Really.And prepare to be enchanted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, don't buy it","review":"This is the first Koontz book I have ever read, and it may be the last. I agree with a previous reviewer who found the narration overbearing; it was simply too much. I'm under the impression Koontz believed much of Jimmy's narration was clever and original, but to me it was just annoying and saturated with far too much emotion. Let's face, Jimmy's a huge fairy. The book would have been much more satisfying if Beezo managed to kill Jimmy. Oh, and here's another thing: Grandma Rowena is a lip-smacking bag, so keep that in mind.It really is stunning that this block of paper averaged four stars. Yuck. Just a pile of yuck with a double side of yuck. If garbage was fire, this book would be fire. I've been using my copy as a starter for our wood stove.In conclusion, I give this book one star because Jimmy gets shot in the leg. If it had been the head, two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I could not even get into this book! It was slow and stupid! I would never even try to read it again let alone buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"convoluted relationships","review":"This book is worth reading primarily for seeing that Koontz has a wonderful sense of humor--the Grandma in the family will have you in stitches! But the extremely tangled, convoluted relationships among the very large cast will make you wish you had constructed a genealogical chart as you went along. Preposterous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, horrible, dreck, garbage. Avoid this book!","review":"This book is terrible. I'm not even 1/2 way through it and I can't stand any of the characters. The plot is totally lame. The dialog smacks of an overdose of Dawson's Creek. It's rife with \\"aren't we witty and clever and spontaneous\\" which fails to amuse. Constant references to cooking and villains who are utter morons and would never have been smart enough to stay alive as long as they have. This is crap of the highest degree. Mr. Koontz, I'm ashamed of you and I'll have to give long thought to ever picking up another novel of yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful book that will leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.","review":"Upon Jimmy Tock's arrival in the world his grandfather foretells 5 terrible days in his future.The days are indeed terrible but Jimmy struggles through them with the love and support of his family.Lately buying a Dean Koontz book is hit or miss in terms of quality but this one is a joy playfully tweaking suspense novel format into a sweet family fable.Full of killer clowns,killer surprises,a couple of dirty tricks,humor and a whole lot of heart.Yeah there's a lot of silliness but this is the rare suspense book that actually makes you feel good about life after reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a big fan of Dean Koontz and was looking forward to another wonderful story. Unfortunately I gave up on this one about one third into it. I got as far as the 2nd fateful day, and by then I was well bored and skipping pages. Unfortunately, I could not take any of the threats made to the characters seriously - they weren't even scared, and as I knew there were 5 dates to go through, surely Koontz wouldn't kill the hero on the first date. I found the whole clown thing ridiculous, I thought Jimmy was annoying (very goody two shoes), and what happens to him was just not credible. If you do want a magic story by Koontz, do read From the Corner of His Eye, False Memory or Velocity, but definitely not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally predictable","review":"While I am not ready to give up on Koontz (I will still buy every book he writes, at least for the near future), this book was totally predictable. I could see the plot twists coming a mile away. But it was a fast read, so I was not too invested in the characters. I would also like to have had more insight into Jimmy Tock--what on earth did Lorrie see in him? I get the feeling that Koontz was just reeling this one out to have a book out at this time of year--it started out well, but went downhill, with short shrift to lots of later parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz gets ultra-silly with this one","review":"I love humor and I love fun, but, I positively can not tolerate silliness in a mystery or thriller. Sadly, this novel from Koontz can be used as a guideline for \\"How to Write an Unbearably Silly Novel.\\" I must confess, I only made it 3/4 ways through, and I simply could not finish the rest....I didn't care how it ended at this point. This excercise in silliness seemed to be written by a rookie with a juvenile and unfunny sense of humor, NOT by a top selling author known for his brilliant chills and thrills, and good humor when it was needed. The paper-thin story was utterly predictable, the main characters were cheesy and shallow beyond belief, and the attempts at humor quickly nosedived into the most repulsive silliness I've ever experienced from a usually satisfying author. I warn all readers, and especially fans of Koontz' early and mid career output, avoid this stinker at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst.","review":"I can't believe how many 5-star reviews this one got. These people must not read much. I've read many of his books. This one was very bad. The worst part about it was the inane, inappropriate banter between the characters. They would be in these life-threatening, suspenseful situations and all of the sudden make an extremely lame joke and then fall into a cutesy back-and-forth. Imagine if you were reading The Shining and the mother and son are running away from the axe-wielding father, and the mother turns to the son and says, \\"Either Daddy wants to kill us or he really needs some help chopping firewood.\\" I'm not exaggerating. It was literally this bad. It's because of this that you not only don't care for the characters, they often annoy you.And the \\"5 terrible days\\", weren't all that terrible. And the twist and the end was so far-fetched and loaded, your eyes will practically roll out of your head.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying Too Hard","review":"I love Dean Koontz, but feel like he needed to fulfill a contract with a publisher so churned this one out from leftover Odd parts. The plot is so promising, but the leading character is too flippant about the circumstances he finds himself in. I don't care how much a family loves to laugh, if you're being forced to aid and abet a homicidal killer you wouldn't be able to make wisecracks, and think about how much you want to marry some stranger you just met. I feel as though he wanted to create a lead character similar to Odd Thomas, but where Odd has compassion and thoughtfulness behind his character, this one is just plain shallow. This is typical of Dean Koontz in my opinion - he'll write some awesome thrillers interspersed with drivel. Take my advice and skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps You Guessing","review":"I have always been a fan of Dean Koontz. His books amaze, scare me and make me cry. This book really grabbed me and would not let me go. You will not be sorry for reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't slog through it","review":"I have to admit I only got about 1/3 of the way through the audio recording before I gave up. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the book better (although I'm not positive about that), but I thought the voice actor doing the reading was horribly miscast (he sounded like he was the grandfather of the main character, not the main character). The pacing was slow, the plot was utterly predictable (at least as far as I read), and the self-indulgent forced \\"humor\\" of the main character really grated on my nerves and made me wish he really would get shot by the clown and get it over with. This is the first Koontz book I've read - I might give him one more shot, but that'll be it if I don't like the next one either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dean Koontz book I've read in years!!!!","review":"I stopped reading Dean Koontz for a long period of time as his more recent books didn't seem to have the intensity nor the plot interest of his earlier works, such as Lightning or Watchers. (I've been reading him for a long time; I bought both those books in their original hardbacks when they were released.) But a friend recommended this book to me, and I'm glad I took her up on it -- it's a wonderful read! Even more so in that it's outside of what I think of as his usual genre - it's a story of a family, albeit with a slight supernatural twist to the plot. However, it's a far cry from how he \\"made his bones\\" in the book biz, which, to me, is horror.I highly recommend this book to anyone both for its mesmerizing plot and his wonderful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Koontz Books","review":"This is one of my favorite Dean Koontz books! I own it i hardcover, and read it at least once a year. Sometimes I find that when life isn't going as well as I'd like, I can read this book and it perks me right up. The undercurrent of hope and happiness in this story really lift my spirits. Yes, there are the usual Koontz twists, and an evil villian that is likable and pitiable, but still a villian. But under it all, Koontz brings you through this story and leaves you feeling better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Send in the clowns and bakers","review":"Only Koontz could make a funny-scary-spiritual book out of clowns and bakers (oh yeah, also snake charmers and storm chasers).I must admit as I started this book I wondered if Mr. Koontz had lost it. I thought \\"if he were not famous, he would never get this thing published\\". Then I realized the narrative was being told by a clumsy guy with no real skill at anything but baking (and being), and as I began to understand his personality, it began to make sense and to become more of a work of art.Another very enjoyable book, with a lot of sudden twists, by still one of my favorite writers. Thanks again for another good read (may there \\"always be cake\\") Mr. Koontz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and Fun","review":"When I first began reading this book I figured it would be one of Mr. Koontz's latest strange, overly-descriptive novels that would be forgotten soon after I turned the last page. However, the more pages turned the more *enchanted* I became. There were several interesting plot twists that never became too convoluted and all in all it was a terrific read. I've read all of Mr. Koontz's books and he has evolved into a cheerful suspense novelist, completely different from his earlier works, but instead of being disappointed I find I enjoy his new books in a different way. This book is worth the money and a nice addition for any fan. Good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Expectancy by Dean Koontz","review":"I enjoy the character discriptions, exciting adventure, and helps me to realize that my problems are not so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"80 pgs into it & still not interested :(","review":"I am very easy to please, but I am 80 pages into this and I am still not interested. This is my first Koontz book and it will be my last. My coworker recommended this book to me and let me borrow the book. I am glad I didn't spend a dime on this. I've read books that have got me hooked on the 1st page, but this one is booorriinnggg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz amazes us again","review":"Dean Koontz never ceases to amaze his fans with his wealth of imagination. He can come up with some plots that make you ask, \\"where did he get that idea?\\" This story is no exception.Just before Jimmy Tock is born, his grandfather gives a prediction of 5 terrible events in Jimmy's future. With the foretelling of the last event, he dies. I won't waste your time with teasers, this book doesn't need any. The characters are funny, scary, heartwarming, and frightening. You will laugh, shake your head and at times yell at the characters in the book to not be fooled by what they see in front of them. It is like sitting in a car on the tracks and riding through a fun house. There is enough action, humor, suspense and at times, pure silliness to go around.Will the foretold events come to pass? Will Jimmy and his family survive them? Pick up a copy, crack open the cover and let's find out"},{"rating":"2","title":"life expectancy","review":"This work is everything you have expected from Kuntz. Every twist in Jimmy Tock's life,the joy of the birth of child, the tragedy of death, the love of a parent, a spouse, and finding that your whole life is not what it seemed to be. Iliciting feelings of extreme fear,jubulation, anxiety, love and passion from the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining with strange twists.....","review":"Koontz offers readers a view into the world of the unpredictable. While he starts off with the \\"five bad days\\" that were announced on a relative's death bed, we see how these five bad days progress and become intertwined. While some of it seems surreal, in fact I believe it is supposed to be. It takes a while to let go of that, and appreciate the brilliant humor that he writes in. There is a nook of humor in every sentence. This was a laugh out loud book even when the story was gruesome. While I was glad to see the \\"five horrible days\\" go by, I was sad to have this book end. Many other writers are just boring compared to Koonz."},{"rating":"2","title":"What to expect in LIFE EXPECTANCY...","review":"The first few pages of the book seem more like a fairy-tale than the usual suspense/horror of Koontz's novels. Nonetheless, if you continue to read past these pages, you'll find a book that caters to more emotional moments than previous novels. From that point on, I never thought about putting this book down again....a truly different, but inviting experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few words","review":"I only have a few words to describe what I think of this book. After reading the numerous reviews on this board, I see that everyone else said something I wanted to say. What's left? Well, in Life Expectancy, Koontz has not only created a book worth reading, he has created a wonderful world. As a writer myself, I envy Koontz's gift for characterization. My sense of humor is far different from his, but humor is relative. Koontz has definitely switched up what I call \\"The formula\\" of his many other books. I stopped reading him for awhile because of that fact, but this book has brought me back. I'm now looking forward to cracking the binding of his other, more current works."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"Dean Koontz is never disappointing. This was a page-turner (like most of his books). The story is about a man that knows 5 dates in which his life is going to be at risk. He meets his future wife in one of those dates and begins believing in the predictions his grandfather made a few minutes before he died. The ending is classical Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully funny","review":"I went and read the reviews on this book before I would buy it. I was so disappointed with his other book \\"The taking\\" that I did not want to waste any more money on this author. I decided to buy it and was glad I did. Easy read great entertainment. BEWARE-If you read through the reviews you will know how the first bad day turns out. SHAME ON YOU SPOILERS!!! Just leave a short review on if you liked the book or not. We don't need or WANT a run down of the story. Again SHAME ON YOU SPOILERS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fourth Koontz Novel and a Great One","review":"This is a wildly weird novel that deals with predicting the future, a family of eccentric bakers, and a father & son who happen to be clowns, as well as, maniac killers. This unique novel from Koontz contains twist after twist as the story spirals to a satisfying conclusion. The characters are all quirky, but remain engaging and relatable. Out of the four Dean Koontz novels I would rank them as follows:1. Intensity *****2. Life Expectancy *****3. Lightning *****4. Phantoms ****After reading pretty much everything from Stephen King, I am glad I have finally found a new horror/suspense author with over 40 novels that I have yet to discover. Can't wait to start his new novel, Velocity, which I just bought last week."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and the Koontz continues...","review":"Well I have been a great admirer of Koontzs' books even from the beginning like : \\"The Funhouse\\" where I was scared to go to a circus for quite a while...but it seems as though Koontz focused, yet another, story involving a circus, clowns, trapeze, and so on...so I was expecting to see something different, thinking that the title was a bit misleading....But in the strangeness of it all I found this novel to be quite disturbing given the fact that it involved incest and clowns , which are two subjects that i find revolting.Overall, my opinion is that this is not his best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I have never in my life read a book that tried so hard to be clever....and wasn't. Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I LOVE Dean Koontz but this story is horrible. I usually can not put his books down but this one I was forcing myself to read. I was forcing myself to read it because I spent the money on it, but I gave up. The money is not worth trying to bear through it. Right now I am reading Tick Tock and I can't put it down. If you love his classics then DO NOT READ THIS ONE!!I recommend Watchers, Tick Tock, and Phantoms"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't imagine it being any worse","review":"I started listening to this book on CD (from the library) because I thought the premise sounded great. However, I can't believe Dean Koontz actually wrote this. It's terrible. The quirky humor was only funny for about 2 minutes and then just seemed cliched. I love most Dean Koontz books and I'm listening to Lightning now (even though I read it years ago). But I would never suggest this book to anyone else.

I picked up the 5HP saw with the Router Lift table and am very pleased with it. It won't be long before all of Powermatic will be made in Taiwan, so if you want an American made saw, you better act now. Your next best choice is General (not General International), which is made in Canada.

I had to make modifications to the instructions, use glue when it was supposed to be a \\"Level 1(easy) snap-together model\\", and the reason I gave it one star on durability is because \\"durable\\" does NOT mean that the landing gear keeps on falling off.

Add to that the Belkin lifetime warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ethernet Signal Degradation","review":"I used this surge protector for about 2 weeks before returning it. The 120V power component of the device seemed to work fine, but it would degraded the Ethernet signal significantly. I would see an 80% drop in download throughput along with lost packets, interestingly upload was not affected. I tried multiple cables and multiple speed-tests to confirm it was the protector causing the problem. I tried cleaning the ports with compressed air, but that didn't solve the problem so I returned it to amazon.If it wasn't for the Ethernet problem i would say its a pretty good surge protector, the plug placement is pretty good. The cord management thing is kinda useless and your better off using a velcro/nylon tie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only half functions","review":"From the day I received this product, straight out of the box, only 6 of the outlets worked. So it's basically half paperweight half power strip. Since Belkin requires that you pay to send it back, I've just used it as a 6 outlet power strip ever since. Recently, however, a power outage caused the 'Not Grounded' light to come on and stay on. I'm told I need to return it for a new one. So I'll have to pay the pretty expensive (about half the cost of the strip itself) shipping costs to return it. Isn't is meant to withstand power outages? Isn't that the purpose of the product? Very disappointed, wish I could just return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken from the start","review":"Item shot out as soon as plugged into the wall, and we hadn't even plugged anything into it yet.

No evidence of surge on same circuitat other locations in home. Fortunately, someone was in room and smelled burningcalled me and I pulled plug. Plastic burned and deformed.

It's hard to imagine that a power surge got it since it has been sitting unplugged on a shelf. Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect surge protector for workstation or home theater","review":"I actually bought two of these - one right after the other, once I installed the first one on my home theater and realized just how nice it was. The layout of outlets is very well conceived - I haven't run into an issue yet with fitting in 24 different plugs and devices from Apple products to a bluray player and home theater receiver. I now feel confident that all of my expensive devices are well protected from surges and any other electrical abnormalities. The slim design is just right and would probably work very well if it were mounted directly onto the wall, which it has the option of. The cable management is nothing spectacular, but adequate, and helps enough to make sense of a bunch of chaotic wires right around the unit itself. I highly recommend this surge protector, especially for its twenty-some-odd-dollar pricetag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"Had half a dozen power surges here in LA due to the winds the last couple of nights and nothing blew up, so I would say this puppy works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but picture 4 shows coax protection","review":"I have no problem with this product.

I HIGHLY recommend for a computer, even if you don't have a lot of things to plug in. You never know what you'll need to put there (like the lamp and shredder in my case..I had no where else to plug it into in that area)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surge zapper","review":"This was just perfect for all the the electronics that I need to use.

(1) It was really low profile and (2) Belkin arranged the plugs to allow you to use both normal power cables and transformers into it very neatly. (3) Long cord for the protector itself. When I got it, I was very happy with it and haven't had any issues with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"I have had a long streak of bad luck with Belkin surge protectors.

Once I plugged it in, I luckily avoided an electric shock. Power went out. Management tried also, same results. Need to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The phone jacks on mine do not work at all. The phone cables worked just fine on my previous surge protector(which didn't have sufficient capacity hence my purchase of the Belkin). Even if the jacks did work, there is no room to plug in a two way splitter to support both the fax and phone that I need for my home office - you'd need to use yet another phone cable and a three way connector. This is very poor design. Further, the unit makes a slight buzzing noise when turned on. I won't be buying this brand again and will likely replace this unit before long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Works great. Even has a cable clip to keep the wires neat at the end of it. Outlets slide open and close also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I need it to do.","review":"I wanted a good surge protector for my office. The cord is plenty long and it protects power, coax and ethernet. My only complaint is that in my application, I am hanging it horizontally and the mounting holes are designed to mount it vertically. Not really that big of a deal because I just used four strips of heavy duty velcro to mount it. Don't over-think this one; it does what it's supposed to do and is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need an outlet strip that let me use more of the outlets","review":"This outlet strip does let me use more of the outlets than most others that I've tried but still manufacturers need to recognize that there are a lot of devices that use wall warts and their outlet strips need to be designed to allow more that 2 or 3 to be used. This one does better with 4 but still you can lose up to 2 outlets for \\"normal\\" wall warts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much perfect","review":"This is the best surge protector I have used. The outlets are spread apart so if you have large plugs its very convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive guaranteed protection","review":"At the price I paid I could not be happier.

Belkin is a good brand, You must have every single connection to your equip protected and this does that for you. This unit is rated at protection up to approx 4000 joules! Thats a way bigger surge it can stand then every other surge protector Ive looked at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Surge Protector that fits ALL my needs","review":"This surge protector is perfect for me. The 10ft Cord allows flexibility with the placement. The layout of the outlets are nice, because there are separate outlets for the larger plugs and a strip of outlets for standard plugs. The 12 total outlets allows me to have extra outlets available for future plugs. That way I don't have to switch everything out and run extra extensions if and when I add electronic devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy and get what you expect","review":"Simple power strip and surge protector, not complicated to set-up - get what you expected from the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Seems to work pretty well. The outer outlets are spaced enough apart so that I can plug in any of the wider plugs without covering other outlets. The bracket at the end is nice for organizing the mess of cables. I haven't had any problems but the real test would be when I have some kind of surge and I'm not about to test that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought 2 of these surge protectors to help clean up the mess behind my entertainment center.

I ordered this one thinking it would be able to provide protection for my new TV with its standard-size 8P8C ethernet jacks, but this unit only has connections for the smaller, telephone-jack size 6P6C type connections, which almost nobody uses for networking...so don't expect it to fit your standard ethernet cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works As It Should","review":"Not much to say about this other than it it works as it is supposed to and serves it's purpose.

Of course the return policy per Amazon is only 1 month so too bad for me.

It made things a lot easier to fit and the price wasn't bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Surge Protector","review":"When my new HDTV arrived, I realized I had forgotten to order a new surge protector. So I ran to Best Buy and purchased a crappy, overpriced Monster \\"home theatre\\" surge protector. After paying almost $40 for the stupid thing, I got home only to find that not only could I not fit all of my plugs into the narrow row of outlets, but the surge capacity was much too low for my beloved new big screen. I immediately went to Amazon.com and purchased this Belkin, like I should have done from the beginning. And it's perfect: wide-spaced outlets for wider plugs means you can use *ALL* 12 outlets (even with big, fat A/C adapters plugged in!); a 10' cord so you can run it to where you need it; low-profile, right angle plug means it will fit behind furniture easily, and plenty of joules to feel safe with. It's perfect! I returned the Monster, saved $15, and got a much superior product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right Belkin 12-Outlet","review":"This is a great surge protector for the home.

This surge protector even has holes in the back in case you want to mount it on the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"A little while back I got a 6-outlet surge protector with a 20-foot chord for twenty-five.With this, I get a shorter chord, but with double the outlets, at a lower price.That is a good trade-off for me.It freed up so much space for me, and eliminated the necessity for a second surge protector.1 negative is the quality is not very good - the plastic feels a bit cheap.1 big positive is there is a lot of space in between each outer outlet, so I can fit all types of plugs in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Engineered for wall mount","review":"The wall mount keyholes are too small to accept screws large and strong enough to secure the plug-laden unit to plaster or drywall. The keyholes are arranged so that the labeling on the product is upside down when the unit is mounted vertically even if the tiny screws can get purchase. ... So the thing ends up in a tangle of wires on the floor. If you can toss the mess under the tv console or behind it, perhaps this could work. But if you're looking for a clean solution, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Purchase","review":"I purchased three of these surge protectors in order to update the old fashioned ones I have.

I do not need a power surge just to prove that this thing is working. I bought it because of the widely spaced sockets. I have a number of adapters that are so big that they can't fit into most multi-plugs in the market due to their sockets being so closely located to each other. This is just perfect.

The real drawback is that the plug end does not swivel like some of the other Belkin plugs.

I'd be fine with that if this was caused by a surge, but merely toggling on/off should not blow the unit, so that's an instant one-star. If you regularly need to use the power switch, stay away from this model.It lasted a few months, Belkin's website doesn't even recognize this model as existing and their RMA processes is convoluted.

Hence it is only a six outlet unit, not 12. Had Belkin maake it just a bit wider, it would have accommodated six \\"Wall Warts\\" in adddition to six standard power cords.

Overall I'm very happy with the way these surge protectors look, though I wish that they would include RJ-45 ports on similar models.

You would have to be pretty dumb to not know how to use this. I do like the way the B.S.P. is designed. The strip in the middle for common plugs and the strips on the outside for your bigger \\"brick\\" like plugs. The \\"cord wrangler\\" as I call it is very handy too. It keeps all of your power cords going in one direction. My only problem with this is (and this would be my problem, not the B.S.P.'s problem) I can't keep my 11 month old son from unplugging it from the wall. Does anyone know if Amazon sells a bag of switches?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for Productivity and Performance, Required for the 7-Hour School Week","review":"A surge protector will protect your precious computer, as well as help you save electricity by easily turning all electronics off with one touch. I love the Belkin 12-Outlet due to its design that allows you to put large adaptors on the sides. This allows you to get the most out of every outlet.Other single file outlets don't have space for the large adapters that will end up taking 2-3 precious spaces.I have 2 outlets that I use. One for all the electronics I use often (computer, lights, etc.), and one for electronics I charge once a while (cell phone, camera, etc.). This way, it is easy to turn each outlet on and off to save more electricity when the equipments aren't being used."},{"rating":"1","title":"My computer got fried during Hurricane Sandy","review":"I had all of my files on this computer....felt safe with this product....after Hurricane Sandy, the computer, mother board and power supply was fried and was plugged into this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Pros: 12 outlets, laid out in a clever pattern that lets you plug in small wall warts as well as power cords.Cons: Doesn't actually work.I got 4 of these because they have ethernet surge protection, and after a bunch of hardware got fried via ethernet lines during a lightning strike, I decided to spend the money.Well, one of them passes an ethernet signal intermittently, causing connections to drop randomly. Two of the others don't actually pass an ethernet signal at all. Run a direct line between my D-link switch and my eee box, and all is well. Take the same line into the Belkin's ethernet port and run another line between the Belkin and the eee box; no signal. And this is only a 10' run; it's not a struggle for anyone's ethernet hardware. I can only guess it's misdesigned or miswired, and leaks too much current to ground. Given the power available on an ethernet line, that would be a substantial leak.If they got the ethernet wrong, who knows if they got the rest right?Back they go."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't even give this a one star!","review":"I bought this after reading the reviews and the looking at the warranty. Well sure enough we got a power surge during Hurricane Irene. Guess what??? Yes the power supply blew on my computer. After a series of phone calls it was determined that since the computer was 3 years old I would get bubkis for the replacement of it AND I had to mail it back to them for them to LOOK at it. Basically it is just a scam and a way to sell more by making the warranty look like the end all. So for the new computer I bought a warrenty through Square Trade. obviously I haven't had to use it but after a introduction phone call from them along with reading all the reviews here, on the BBB website and on you tube the money spent on that 125 for a 3 year spill, drop and damage warranty) promises to be better than this product.

Looks are OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belkin outlet","review":"This is a lot safer than the swarm of cords I used to have behind the couch and chairs. It is a good combination, having both the oversize plugs for transformers and the normal sized plugs on one strip allows you to get rid of flimsy extension cords and eye sores. The fact that it also has the right angle plug is also helpful, as it guides the cord to run closer to the wall and more out of the way. Generally, it works as it should, and I have no real criticisms and the price is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"surge protectoor","review":"Works as described except line protector doesn't work with DSL to the modem.

Unfortunately, when I connect my Ethernet cables through this surge protector, the signal is attenuated so badly that up to 70% of packets are dropped. I've tried it with multiple different routers, switches and pieces of computer equipment with more or less the same results. Maybe I got a bad manufacturing batch, but if you are looking to use the Ethernet protection I'd advise getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"Very bad quality. Protected light went off after plugging it in for 15 seconds. Liked it because it was pretty inexpensive and have enough outlets for all my stuff. Stuff still works when plugged in, but without the protected light, it is not serving its purpose as a surge protector. Belkin charges you for shipping it to them which makes no sense since this only cost 19 bucks and shipping this thing costs almost half of what u paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: Only one phone line is protected","review":"The RJ11 telephone line protection jacks on this surge protector only have the inner TWO of four connections (line 1 - Red/Green) IF you have two lines in your home requiring all FOUR connections in the RJ11 jack, this unit will NOT work for you . ONLY line one is designed into this surge protector's telephone jacks. Line 2 (the outer two connections in an RJ11 (Black/Yellow in telephone lingo) are not included in the Belkin jacks. They only designed this for a home with one telephone line. If you have two telephone lines and two line phones(Home and Home office for example) you cannot protect line two with this unit. Beware, looks like Belkin was being cheap and only designed with one line instead of two in the RJ11 jacks. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard Surge Protector","review":"It is very streamlined and slim, which I like. The plug is slim also but slants to the right when plugged in.

I have several plugs with built in transformers that are bulky at the plug side and the 8 side strip outlets are perfect for them. Nice wide design accomodates them all and the cord manager on the end keeps them nice and tidy. I never used the coax protection before but it seems to work just fine. I guess I'll find out in the next storm, or maybe I won't, which is the whole point I suppose. Anyway, I can't say enough for Belkin products. I usually choose Belkin over others when I have a choice. The reason? I have never had a Belkin product fail on me. Enough said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Own 3 of them now","review":"With any product the overall long term success is in the details. This features 12 plugs, with 6 sideways and nicely spaced for those power adapters we love/hate. The outlets themselves have slide locks when not in use. The unit's power plug is flat & angled, two subtle but quite nice features for 2 of our 3 uses. The unit it a bit big, this is not a power strip for sure, but the footprint has not been an issue. It does not have that \\"plasticky\\" break-in-your-hand feel due to the overall heft. For the price there is nothing else I can find that touches what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this","review":"I bought this for my home office electronics and it works great on this purpose.

It has a $300,000.00 device coverage, for damage to your equipment if surge protector fails. I bought this because of the Cat5, Cat6 network protection \\"Very Important\\" option, all others with it were much more $$. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the back of the protector, the slots for mounting are backwards, and protector would be upside down from what is pictured, had to mount it sideways instead.

Even a 1 year warranty could prove to be superior to a \\"lifetime\\" warranty if you happen to buy the product after it has been on the market for a few years and Belkin decides to make a nominal change and discontinue the old model number.

The product looked like it was shoved into this torn box and the cord was not even tied or fastened to keep it together. When I took out the device it has scratches all over it. These scratches were by the plugs. Looks like someone used this and returned it. I thoroughly tested this device to ensure it works and it does.

It has two slotted holes in the back - 5 inches apart - that are used to mount it.

That means that my air conditioner's plug doesn't block half the others. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, I can't say anything about the effectiveness of the surge protection, having never experienced a power surge with it yet.

They are obviously in a difficult situation where one warranty claim on a $10 product could wipe out the profit on 10K units. BUT, that's what they are advertising. My opinion is that it's purely a gimmick. If you have a repair technician saying that your product has power surge damage but they can't detect a failure in their product, you get nothing. Seems like a little bit of a conflict of interest.Anyway, these products are good extension cords. Don't count on them working as surge protectors or on Belkin to honor their warranty.

After a ton of back-and-forth and jumping through hoops, they have said they will pay us $135. The computer was only 2 years old and cost $1000. The replacement computer cost $1000, and our alternative was to repair the old one for just under $900. This offer from Belkin is laughable. It cost $180 just to have the hard drive salvaged and to get the repair estimate done (which Belkin insisted on in order to file the claim).

Many of the action sequences are pieced together so poorly that almost no action ensues, or you end up laughing at the amateur quality.

You'll notice throughout how careful they are with their gear and uniforms as hardly a speck of dirt or fake blood stain them. Even CGI special effects dare not damage the vintage military vehicles. The script is a run of the mill yarn using second rate actors and an element of romance is thrown in. I only could imagine the fun all the reenactors on both sides could have had, getting to strut their stuff. We have seemed to regress with the camera work. Just check out Spielberg's \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" made in 1998 and you'll see what I mean. The Normandy invasion is way too big for a low budget production.

This whole movie was taped over a year over at different reenactments. I know reenactors have to pay a lot for different events and gear but anyone could do a better job at making this movie better. The camera shots where either too far or close ups making it hard to know what is going on around the actors. Do not watch this movie is you enjoy history movies.

I have the Printmaster Gold on my desktop, but needed something for my laptop and lost the installation disk. I decided to upgrade to a newer version and picked the Printmaster 16 platinum.

I loved my Printmaster Gold program, but this new version is that much better. My friends love the items I've been able to make and have begged me to make things for them as well. I've also been able to create advertising pages for a local printer and email the files over to go straight to print and the books have come out awesome.

However, I really didn't know what to expect since there are also two other instructors on this DVD, Jessica Smith and Michael Carson. Surprisingly, all three instructors provide excellent workouts, about 20 minutes in length, with a count-down clock to let you know how much time has elapsed, and thus, how much time is left (a great motivator!). There are also 5 bonus workouts at 2 minutes each, for a total of 10 additional minutes. I generally prefer to do at least two workouts and then add the bonus workouts, but you can do one, two, or three of the workouts on any given day and then either add or don't add the bonus workouts. All the workouts are fun and do-able, and you can see results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica Smith is great!","review":"I am happy with these workouts. With the ten minute solution workouts you are able to create a custom workout and this disc doesn't offer that option. That means I have to select each workout from the menu manually; this is a little annoying but not a deal-breaker. For people who only workout for 20 minutes, this disc is perfect. If you workout longer it is a little more difficult because the workouts alternate between weights and cardio. For me, just playing them in order doesn't work so it's a little bit of effort to switch the workouts but it's not too bad. The trainers are great and the workouts are really good.Also, the value is good because it includes three 20 minute workouts plus five bonus two minute workouts. I'm glad I bought this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for the money!","review":"This tape is much better than I expected for the low price. The workouts are challenging, enjoyable, easy to follow and are easy to fit in time lengths. I like all of the instructors, and the short bonus workouts are wonderful!

The bottom compartment is a little hard to get access to if you have a center console. While it is super functional and he loves it, I was a little disappointed in the quality for the price. It is a solid piece of molded plastic. The plastic insert for hanging files is somewhat flimsy. The non skid rubber mat on the writing surface was coming up when I got it, but I just glued it back down. I would expect to pay more like $50-60 for something of this quality.

Once again the developer claims to be working to address these issues - yet we see no patches to address them.The final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is short, expect only 3 hours to finish the main quest on normal, then you have to repeat the SAME GAME 2 more times to unlock all difficulty levels.What a stinker of a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be great but it is not","review":"I absolutley adore the Diablo series.

That's what I get from Ms Mathews. But, sadly there is no concrete words to hang onto that would change any message that a minister would prepare that wasn't mindful of the Holy Spirit. Each chapter sets out to be first critical about any woman that accepts what she refers to as society's perspective of women. (She , herself, makes the name calling of such women who \\"accept\\" the downward look of this as \\"stupid\\". For a Christian book , that is not called for.) And, it's not a healthy perspective. She gives no research on any of her opinions. That is the major weakness Ms Mathews makes throughout the book. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preaching to women doesn't seem much different to preaching to people","review":"I aim to read at least one book on preaching every year, and two things in particular stand out in this one. In the first place, Mathews raises three questions that every preacher should ask: What does the text mean? Is it true? So what? In other words, preaching involves explaining, proving and applying. Secondly, Mathews has some helpful things to say about eschewing power. That is something I really need to remind myself of as a minister. Yet neither of these things have much to do with preaching to women in particular. I finished this book wondering how preaching to women is different to preaching to men. Indeed, the great need in the church today is not that preachers learn how to preach to women, but that they learn how to preach full stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hustle","review":"Too bad the story had to be made.

It would stop for several seconds with the wipers up on the windshield when in low or delay modes (in delay mode the wipers are supposed to go to the \\"low wipe\\" position when they are paused.) The motor is supposed to reverse 1/2 turn when the wipers are turned off to activate the park cam but they only reversed 1/4 turn so the wipers would never park unless pushed down by hand.

Unfortunately Lynn Abbey wrote it so that this information was given to us very slowly, and without much else in between.

The parts are mixed and matched, and, at one point a character being dead was all that told me WHEN what was happening occurred, it is a pain to tell where you are in the story.If you want to do the pomo ideal and chop your story into pieces, fine. However, tell us which goes where sometime before we get halfway through the chapter. Otherwise, it makes me want to hurl the book across the room.

In lieu of learning more about him directly, we are trapsed through very muddled and superfluous descriptions of Phyrexian life and a woman/newt named Xanchta (sp?). This woman attmepts to find a surrogate look alike Mishra to rattle Urza back in to the realm of sanity. The plot alone is ridiculous, and the writing matches suit.

Plus the dvd ain't all that either but, I ain't hating they just trying to make some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it...","review":"I bought this album when it first came out. I really enjoyed the hidden bonus track (after Jhene's song), though I wish they had made it a separate track. However, I was disappointed that they put a song from the first album on this CD (Why I Love You). Then, I was more disappointed that in this sales driven world they re-released the album with additional tracks. The song Girlfriend (which they've released as a single) isn't on this album. Then they wonder why people download from the web without purchasing their CD. It's tricks like that, which seem so popular lately (J. Lo did it with I'm Real and LL Cool J did it with All I Have), that make people not buy CD's and just burn them. Overall, however the album was good...I just suggest you pick up the one with all the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore Album More Mature Than First","review":"I maybe a B2K supporter, but let me tell you something, even if you have never heard or like B2K, COP THIS ALBUM. They sound way more mature than the first album 'B2K'. With crush grooving songs such as 'Bump Dat', 'Bump, Bump, Bump', 'Girlfriend-Remix', and 'I Beat U To It'. They're more mature side on love with 'One Kiss', 'What a Girl Wants', 'Everything(that is my favorite song), 'The Other Guy'. Plus it has a debut of Lil Fizz's cousin Jhene with the song 'Dog' right after that song Omarion has a solo. So if you wanna listen to some great music, this is the album, don't look at it as being a teen idol boy band album look at it as a maturity in the making. Bump This!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rellsbabi4lif","review":"i luv this cd. i think its probally their best one yet. in this lbum you gt to hear their more mature side, and my babi (j-boog) sings on my favrite song. \\"Everything\\" is the best track, i think, because they harmoniz really well. i think that if u like r&b then you will luv this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"b2k the hottest","review":"I think this album Pandemonium is really good.

They don't have nothing to offer. NOTHING!! The music on here sounds like typical and tired R&B garabage. The song \\"Bump Bump Bump\\" is the worst song on radio today. The song \\"Tease\\" is lame and \\"Back It Up\\" is regular junk. If you want REAL music from a boy band, then check out Jackson 5 and/or early New Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...","review":"I gave this album 4 stars because I did like the songs in there, but that doesn't mean I don't have a few things to comment on. I did love the songs, but I'm not way into these guys because they are totally conceited and that's such a huge turn-off. I also hated the lyrics to the songs. My favorite song in the album was \\"Everything\\" because it actually sounded like something we all can relate to. How many of us can relate to songs about huge rocks and Hummers? Plus, they continually say \\"We're focused man!\\" throughout the album. I think I got it the first time they said it. All in all, I did like the album although I hated a few things. Buy this album if you're only into the music and not the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is what it's come down to.

Have people actually forgotten what a real love song sounds like? My suggestion to you is this: Download Led Zeppelin's classic \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". It's not really a love song, but it is a beautiful song that you can easily slow dance to. Go ahead, enjoy all 8:01 of it. Then listen to something off of this dumb disc. Starting to get it? Good.

My favorites were: Bump,Bump,Bump, Sleepin, Everything, Tease, The Other Guy, and What U Get. I like this cd as much as the last one. The ballads stick out over the party songs. I don't know why \\"Why I Love You\\" was put on there though. They also included Lil Fizz's cousin Jhene's song Dog. It's cute; I can stand it. Seems like they stuck with the same formula on this album, which is alright with me cuz like you've heard \\"If it ain't broke don't fix it\\" and B2K is just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I suppose you could do worse...","review":"If I could give this CD a 0, I would. It's almost a shame there isn't a 0 stars option. Call me a \\"player hater\\" if you want, but this isn't just some of the worst music i've ever heard it's the most obnoxious. This band is obviously out there for the money and just like your MTV told you to you go out and buy it. It's sickening, this really is an easily impressionable generation. Go listen to some music with substance you morons. I swear you trendy bastards are so much in love with these untalented generic boy bands you don't realize how bad the music really is. And I take that back my original statement, you really can't do worse than this cd; this IS as bad as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really no need for a re-release","review":"B2K re-released Pandemonium in a special edition about three months after the oringal verisonw as released. Pandemonium Special Edition was included with a crappt bonus DVD a few new tracks. Two of the tracks written by R.Kelly are the strongest on the album which are Girlfriend & What A Girl Wants. While both these tracks are cool there really was no need for a re-lease hence my low rating. Another compliant on the CD is Why I Love You is repeated from B2K's debut release once again,"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mature Side Of Them","review":"This is a very sexy and mature side of B2K and I love it. The songs on here are touching to the ladies and men could relate to it. One of my favourite songs has got to be \\"Why I Love You\\" because the melody is great, the vocals and production are hot and the lyrics are beautiful. Sometimes, you just need to get away from all those horrible sounding music of rock, country and some rap, and listen to some true, introspective and authentic R&B, like this CD. If you are into Usher, Pretty Ricky, Mario and B5, then this is the CD for you. I just hope they reunite in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION","review":"I got this album about 2 years ago,and thought that i owed you loyal viewers a personal review. The first album was definetly better. Creatively I think they were in a better place. The standout songs are \\"Bump, Bump, Bump\\" \\"One Kiss\\" \\"Everything\\" \\"Tease\\".

It does what it promised. My only concern is that the glass mug is ultra-thin. The packaging mentioned nothing about its quality or tempered strength and it came with no instruction manual etc so I am treating it with kid gloves. If it is great glass, they say nothing. The infuser seems to be light-weight stainless steel and could be used with other mugs. I thought about returning it, but Adagio will only allow credit, not a cash return. Good so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass too thin","review":"I loved this mug, but it broke when gently knocked over on a masonite table the first time I used it. So sad. I do love the infuser though and I use it for other mugs. I like that the holes are small enough that I don't end up with a cloud of tiny tea particles at the bottom of my cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass is too thin","review":"I'll start off by saying that Adagio teas are truly fantastic. But I didn't enjoy this mug. I have a tea kettle in one room and my office desk is in another room, so I carry my teacup from room to room with boiling hot water in it several times a day. This teacup is so thin that the heat is immediately transferred to the handle, and it's far too hot to hold the non-handle part of the mug either. I dropped the lid once and it shattered into tiny pieces. So it doesn't meet my needs - I'll stick with ceramic mugs.However, the infuser itself is fantastic. It's exactly what I need. The holes are small enough that even dust tea doesn't go through. I use it in another mug and it works perfectly. The stainless steel doesn't hold or transmit flavors, so I'm able to use it for white, green, oolong, and black."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality..enough said","review":"Just like the other reviewer said I was surprised by how thin the glass was too. Even though it is thin the cup and the lid feel very strong. The infuser is what impressed me the most by it's excellent quality. I will note that when I bought this Mug & Infuser I was under the impression I could add the water to the mug, microwave the water, then with the tea leaves in the infuser i'd just put it in and let it steep and remove... Nope, the design is meant to have water heated to the right temperature from an outside source (I find heating up water in a measuring cup the quickest in the microwave) and pour it into the infuser and let it steep then remove the infuser and enjoy. Not a big deal, just had different impressions as I never used an infuser before. In the end I really like quality of the product and the fact that I can enjoy loose leave tea now conveniently! I also recommend trying Adagio teas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still kicking after 4 years of use","review":"I never thought I'd rave about a glass mug + infuser, but I *love* this thing. I am an embarrassingly prodigious tea drinker (I've consumed 20 lbs of tea in the last few years, eek), and I only use this cup. It is very thin glass, but I am not terribly delicate, and it's survived approximately 5,000+ uses. Good lord, is that right?The steel infuser makes a perfect cup of tea, and the size of the cup is just the right size to keep it hot while drinking it. (Any bigger and you'd have to drink pretty fast to not have a cold slurp at the bottom.)I'm going to knock on a bunch of wood now that I've bragged about how long this thing has lasted.UPDATE: Four months later, I finally killed my coveted mug, but it took a good 5-foot drop onto a hard floor to break it. I immediately ordered another (minus infuser)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass way too thin","review":"I have mixed feelings about this mug. First of all, the glass that the cup and lid are made out of is way too thin. It feels flimsy, heat transfers through the cup immediately and cools the drink too quickly and makes the mug difficult to hold, and I'm always worried that I'm going to drop it or the mug is going to shatter from either me dropping it or through rapid temperature changes. On the other hand, the infuser that comes with the cup is fantastic. It fits into many of my other mugs so I can use it with whichever mug I have handy. It is very large so the tea has room to expand while it is brewing. The mesh is thin so I don't end up with many little particles floating around on the bottom of my drink. Finally it is easy to clean and reuse.Overall, I would never suggest the mug, but I would suggest the infuser to anyone who drinks tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"I didn't care for this because of the strainer.

It also has a little background for each reading so you can make sense of what they are really trying to say. It does not have the songs.The church rotates the mass every year, so there are four sections to the book.

We are new converts to Catholicism, and we felt a little lost during the liturgy. This is the superior of the two missals. The vinyl binding is flexible and durable. The book is well organized and easy to use, with a minimum of page-turning necessary. At the back there is a useful section on prayer which is a nice bonus.However, some of the commentaries on the Scripture readings are pretty liberal in their interpretation. Fortunately, these comments are easy to ignore (which is what I do most of the time). The typeface is easy to read, but the overall design and layout of the book is somewhat old-fashioned. The full color picture inserts look like prints of Rennaissance paintings, which is OK if you like that sort of thing. I would prefer a more up-to-date design.However, the Missal does its job well, and should last the reader a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunday Missal","review":"This is elegant and a pleasure to use.

I enjoyed the way in which the author wove contemporary sources and Paiute folklore into her story. It's not an especially sophisticated book (for good or for ill) but it is not without complexity. Nineteenth century U.S. cultural and political constraints are clearly illustrated, along with Sarah's personal life and the tribulations facing the Paiutes & other Native Americans of that era.

Since it was out of warranty (it had been in the guest room closet where they advertise it's so handy to have one), Aerobed did nothing to help. We just wanted advice from them on how to fix it, but they were unresponsive. So as it turned out it would have been cheaper in the long run to put the guests in a nearby hotel. If the Aerobed you buy is fine, then you'll like it, but if there's a problem, don't look to Aerobed customer service to give you much help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Leaks","review":"I bought two Aerobed mattresses. One of them developed a slow leak within a few weeks. No big deal at first. I just had to fill it with air periodically. However, it eventually it started to leak more air to where it became unusable. I could never find the leak. The second one developed a leak about 3 months after its purchase. I found the first leak and patched it. However, it developed another leak about 2 weeks after that. I could not find that leak. The mattresses do not pump up as fast as advertised when a leak exists.The air pump attached to the mattress is a bother. It scrapes the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"I bought one for Xmas since I had a guest staying over. Within 4 days the bad sprang a leak and was renderd utterly useless.

This is such a classic piece of Irish-ness! The storyline is fanciful (unless YOU regularly have Hollywood crews arrive in your little town) but the underlying truths are not. When we saw this play performed in London, two actors played all the parts, which just added to the poignancy and hilarity. Drunks, dreamers and the depressed are all part of the Irish national psyche, and \\"Stones\\" hits on all these.

So I scanned parent safety websites, green toy blogs and COULD FIND NO ENDORSEMENT of Bruder either. Hmmmm. There was also no testing available of Bruder toys to show content.

The front side mirrors are black plastic only-no silver paint or metal. The cab does open to reveal the engine; however, the engine is completely black plastic with very little model detail & no painted parts. Also, the engine is not removable for play or examination.This truck seems more like a plastic model than a toy for a child.

If you are a diabetic, read it to ground yourself and share experiences with someone who has been there and back.

And then commit yourself to supporting diabetes cure research."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last - the truth about life with diabetes!","review":"I consider myself privileged to have been allowed to read this extraordinary book while still in galley form. Deb Butterfield has written an achingly candid account of her personal journey with diabetes. She begins with her diagnosis at age 10 and ends with her pancreas transplant some 15 years later; covering all the physical and emotional trauma wrecked by diabetes in between. Unfortunately, the toll diabetes took on her life is all too common. She puts to rest, once and for all, the myth that diabetes is a chronic disease which can be managed if one is simply diligent enough. After reading Ms.Butterfield's book, it becomes crystal clear that diabetes is still a fatal disease which can only be managed by curing it. The book ends on a joyous note with the knowledge that alternatives to continuing with diabetes already exist and that the cure will come sooner rather than later"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know anyone understood","review":"Deb was looking back at me from my mirror!

Garmin also updates the software which you can download from their website which fix minor issues. You must buy the serial cable to do this. The unit is also waterproof, not just \\"water resistant\\". Battery life is about 15 hrs using the gps and radio at the same time. You can turn off the gps or radio if you want to use only one.

Obviously, the maker of this video has done something very right. Horatio's voice is very annoying, but that is just from the adult's point of view, my daughter loves him. She roars out loud at him (he doesn't do that, she just knows he is a Lion), and waves hi, screams when the other kids come onto the screen, dances when the kids dance, and now she blows kisses (she learned that from the video, we didn't do that with her before).

This latter consideration is extremely helpful when we leave the domain of canned examples and venture forth into the real world.I suspect that when a team of authors assembles a text, as in this case, we get the benefit of vertical expertise but miss out on the encapsulated/synthesized wisdom that a single author conveys as he/she walks us through a detailed technology tool.After 7 chapters in this text I switched to Microsoft Press': \\"SQL Server 2005 Integration Services, Step by Step\\" - for which I have written a more favorable Amazon review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommanded","review":"This book is hard to read.

A background in DTS will not necessarily prepare you for SSIS.Watching the videos on the LearnIntegrationServices,com web site FIRST is definitely the way to go. The major negative that I have thus far is that it is somewhat difficult to follow when trying to complete the example packages. More step1, step2, etc. would have been helpful.

Yes I know it was my fault for not doing the research, but as she is an automatic buy I just went for it. I do not like early American Colonial reads so this was my first issue. And basically her writing has improved so much over the years, it just came off a little light for me. I have learned and I wrote this for everyone who is impulsive and so quick to purchase without doing your homework!As I was reading the new books for the fall I see that MS Kleypas has another NEW (old) book coming in October.... now I feel a bit of resentment in the fact that they are calling these new releases. I am new to the genre and know now to be very careful when making purchases. Its so disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like her other books","review":"I read the whole book through, barely. I kept hoping for it to pick up but it didn't. I could find no room in my heart for Lucy or how Heath could either. The book also dragged a lot. I literally rushed through the book. I won't hold this against Mrs. Kleypas since 90% of her books are great reads. Hopefully the next installment won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was tricked!","review":"I was so excited as I waited for the release of a new Lisa Kleypas book. Now I know it was simply a re-release. The book was disappointing to say the least. There was no action and no real conflict. We simply followed the H/H through their marriage. The heroine was spoiled, annoying, and immature. We rarely got to see what was going on in the hero's head, so I never knew what drove him; why he did the things he did. Neither the heroine nor the reader knew much about his past and what we did learn we got through snooping through his things and from secondary characters. I agree with other reviewers that all the historical facts bogged the story down and mostly just skipped over those parts. If you dont need action, adventure, mystery, or plot twists in your story then this is the book for you. I, on the other hand, found this book fairly boring. It only got 2 stars because I like Kleypas' more recent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Just to be clear on one thing: he did not rape her. I read the scene carefully, trying to decipher how they both were feeling emotionally and physically, and it was consensual. And I'm usually VERY sensitive to scenes with forced stuff like that.I WANTED badly to like this book. Lucy was the most immature heroine I've ever read. Heath was a freakin saint. He put up with so much of her crap, and didn't deserve her one bit. This book was not worth finishing.I love Lisa Kleypas, but every author has a bad egg that doesn't work, and it's usually one of the earlier ones because they're still kind of getting the hang of it. This is said book. Lucy never grows up or starts to think about other people other than herself, and I don't blame Heath for acting the way he did ever, although I wish I knew why he was so \\"in love\\" with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Lisa's normal standard","review":"I usually enjoy Lisa Kleypas' books very much but I've been reading this one is spurts and just can't get it done.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read by Lisa Kleypas","review":"I usually love Lisa Kleypas' regency romances. I borrowed this book from a friend thinking it was also a Regency romance. It was actually set in America during the Civil War, which was different for Kleypas but well done.

It probably works fine on its own, if you don't know how great the author is now. I can't tell you how many times I've reread the Wallflowers and Hathaways series and there are plenty of her standalones that are amazing too. This story lacks the emotional connection we've come to expect from Kleypas and there's too much filler that doesn't do anything to progress the characters or story. Here and there you can see glimmers of the writer Kleypas becomes but I'm not sure it's in her best interest to re-release books that are so inferior to her current offerings. Again, in the scope of romance novels, it's good (not great). But for a Kleypas romance, it's sub-par. Better to re-read Where Dream Begin again."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful book from a great author","review":"I love Lisa Kleypas' books, and was very excited to see a new one out, ended up totally disappointed.

While attempting to use them in practice, everyone's unit was always off due to this problem, so I will be returning mine in the hope that they will fix this problem in future units. The problem is that the batteries are on squishy springs, unlike the Motorola Talkabout's taut ones; and the circuit lacks a capacitor or other means of storing milliseconds worth of power. They will probably fix it, so not the date of this review: 12/3/02.Also, I assumed that the units would provide automatic position updates to others in a group, but discovered that it only transmits one's location if one presses TALK.

I have had it attached to my camel pack while mountain biking and hiking. It has been through several crashes on the bike with me. While Geocaching, I dropped it into a stream. I snatched it back up, and found it to be operating perfectly. I have had this on the outside of my pack during light to heavy rain, with no problems. I can do many trips on a set of batteries. I use it often when 4X4'ing with my Jeep. I'll preset coordinates for intersections or points of interest, and it keeps me right on. When Geocaching, it has always led me within a few feet of cache.My only \\"gripe\\" would be that there is no connection for an external antenna. My screen has a \\"dark\\" patch on it...kind of like when you press on an LCD screen. It does not interfer with the view on the screen though."},{"rating":"1","title":"rino is junk","review":"im very disappointed in my rino 120.its plagued without problems.the microphone is not sensitive enough no matter how loud you talk into mic people can not here you on other 2 way radios.the input jack for headset is faulty you have to wiggle headphone plug around to get headphones and mic to work.basemap that is included with rino is vagued so plan on spending at least another [money]100 for mapsource cd.rino uses a click and stick button to switch modes and change setting the botton is small and difficult to use.lcd screen is so small you need a pair of binoculars to read it.i contacted garmin and they said tey were aware of the problems and were working on solutions.they would contact me when they come up with something.that was a month ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKED PERFECT!","review":"I got this for my husband to take hunting, it worked great!

I can tell you that the radio feature of it does not seem to work as well as a regular FRS radio. I was in a situation where I was standing right next to someone with a regular radio and they were picking people up that I could not hear. My communication abilities were not as good as the rest of our group. They were trying to talk to me several times and I never heard them. I am not sure if this radio just doesn't have the transmit strength of a regular FRS radio. I am also not sure if it possibly has a higher squelch threshold which would cause it to not hear as well as other radios.Overall it is not a bad product. I will be interested to see version 2 of it. It think they will fix some of the minor issues that it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device!","review":"I purchased two Rino 120's through Amazon. I am very happy with them.I tested the radios in thick woods with gradual sloping hills. I was able to get about one-half mile clear communications between the two radios. The peer to peer position reporting feature worked perfectly, as well as the GPS features.The advertised \\"up to 5 mile range\\" etc. you see on radios like these only happens under perfect conditions which nobody is likely to ever encounter. Knowing this, I wasn't disappointed. The half mile range will do fine for my use.I was a bit disappointed with the lack of detail in the Topo map software, but it is still servicable.All in all, a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Rino 120","review":"I purchased my fist Rino 120 a little less than a month ago.

Produced by Tony Visconti & Godley & Creme who would not much later employ the same production values with New Romantics such as Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran, Ultravox and make it work, V Deep is one of those albums that has grown better with age. As a departure for The Rats I thought and still do that this album has stood the test of time in similar ways The Stranglers La Folie and Billy Idols Whiplash Smile branched them out and beyond the flag of convenience of the UK New Wave / Punk thing. For some it worked, Idol, The Police, Depeche Mode ( listen to the Vince Clarke inspired \\" Talking in Code \\" ) for mostly the others it did not. This is a good collection and The Bitter End, Little Death, Charmed Lives are truly the last good songs Gob penned before he embarked on annoying the hell out of the rest of us but mostly himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Rats album by a landslide","review":"I can not recommend this CD in any way, shape, or form.

I would rather use a professional program then use something that looks like it came off a video game and sounds like one.

Piano, cello, and programming round out the performing instruments.Sound quality is very good.

It's when you render the project that the software lets you down. Videostudio will create artifacts and noise. For example, it has a slick pan and zoom feature for slides, but it cannot handle the simple task of re-sizing your megapixel still photos to fit in video formats. The results? dancing pixels, shimmering and blurry pictures. If you go to the Ulead forums, they recommend that you resize your pictures closer to video format. Besides the absurdity of resizing hundreds of pictures to suit one poorly executed piece of software, what is the point of having the pan and zoom feature one wonders?Avoid this program, it is as poorly written as Pinnacle Software's Studio dud.

The dark and quite humorous dialogue between characters (especially Pris' character) coupled with the wisdom of the Lincoln and intensity of Stanton make for an interesting read. Some might complain that the story doesn't go anywhere, but I would argue that it's not that different from the tradition of putting ordinary characters in insane, yet objectively amusing situations. The interactions, the dialogue, the whole setup, is strangely hilairious and dark but done in a fresh style that doesn't render it the least bit recycled. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dick fan's choice","review":"I have recently read some fifteen books from Dick's lesser known production. In general, they are not as good as the best known books (like Ubik, Valis, Man in the high castle).

Unfortunately, all that is abruptly dropped, and the last 1/3 of the book is devoted to treatment of the protagonist's mental illness.Only for die-hard Dick fans, and then if only on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Two intertwined plots, the development of the simulacra and Rosen's growing obsession with Pris - and he simply abandoned the interesting one. Even with the first-person perspective, he never managed to bring Louis and his feelings for Pris to life.

This book has plot elements, but it's really not well put together or entertaining. The main characters aren't very interesting, and the love & rejection the protagonist gets from Pris is so strange, it's almost like Dick is forcing something that had happened to him into the story. Really, would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dick at his worst","review":"We Can Build You is one of PKD's weakest books. It starts in a quite interesting way, but ultimately leads nowhere.

She even talks to the phone (a little freaky right..)I guess my point is, that this toy is very addictive. It's great for parents that need something to occupy their toddlers, but not for mature twelve-year-olds.Sorry Rebecca!Love,Kaci Hawkins"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute Kitchen!","review":"My 1 and 3 year old received this as a gift from Grandma and Grandpa and both love it. It is the perfect size for my 1 year old. My 3 year old tends to play on her knees, but doesn't mind at all. Set-up is great! Take it out of the box and that's it...it is ready to go. You can put batteries in the phone if you want, but I opted to let them use their imagination...One complaint was that toys r us did not actually carry it in the store (pick up would have been a nice option as the shipping was $40). Great storage space in the fridge and definitely fits in small spaces and easy to clean. Overall, great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen, buy elsewhere","review":"I bought this kitchen when my daughter was 16-months-old.

I recommend it for the history of emotional theory. It's a reference, not a \\"quick read.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Touchably lovely","review":"My son enjoyed this book a whole lot until he dropped it into the fountain and it got warped. Even slightly disfigured, he still comes back to touch the puppies' noses and ears. It kept him occupied for quite a while when he first got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for dog-loving kids","review":"I got this book as a hand-me-down from a friend, whose 4-year-old and 2-year-old boys had failed to destroy it. That alone says a lot about the durability of this book, and its tactile pieces. My son, who is 16 months, loves this book. He likes to touch all the different tactile pieces: the furry puppy chest (my son's favorite), the silky dog ears, the fuzzy slipper, the rubber ball (my least favorite), and the leathery puppy noses (my favorite). The pictures are adorable. There aren't many words per page, so the book might lose its appeal for older, more experienced readers. But it's great for younger kids (under 4)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn!","review":"I had such high hopes for this movie resulting from the many excellent reviews and many festival entries. I REALLY tried to like it, BUT it seemed to me that the two main characters had no chemistry at all and most of the time they were intermittently infuriating and obnoxious. As someone mentioned in another review they circled one another in a dance with one chair left and neither of them wanting to take the first move. Production values were excellent. I feel both the lead characters were woefully miscast in what could have been a rather sweet AND realistic story of self discovery and romance. By the way, if anyone knows of a town this tolerant, please send me a travel guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet for me","review":"The first half of this film was engaging - good cinematography, great scenery and some promising characters confronting real issues. Then it went a little weird - not weird interesting & challenging but weird saccharine & implausible. This film is obviously a hit with some, but is far too sweet for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I'm glad to see that so many seem to have enjoyed the film, but it honestly left me confused and wondering what I had missed. The plot really didn't make sense. Big Eden left me with a feeling similar to when to friends try to tell you about something they both know, but leave out all the important details you need to hear to 'get it'. The main character is rude to his friends, his family, and everyone who approaches him from the very first scene and you end up not caring for him as a viewer. The city he finds himself in is bent on playing matchmaker and keeping him there, but it all seems very unrealistic and your mind fights against it the whole time. The ending is predictable and takes forever to play out. All in all, the only thing I really liked about it was that it was gay-themed. If this had been a straight flick I don't think I would have even finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sold","review":"I take back my reservations about Big Eden after watching extras on DVD. At its heart, the director says, the movie tells us that take away hate and bigotry and life is still difficult.Henry Hill is a successful but unhappy NYC artist who returns to his Montana home after his grandfather has a stroke. While coming to terms with a high school friend, Dean, who he's secretly loved for 18 years, he finds a surprising new love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Hearted Big Eden","review":"This is the little film that could. This was such a sweet and touching movie. I smiled all night after watching it. It's a glimpse of life as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't Love Grand","review":"Big Eden is a sweet,humorous, down-to-earth story about following your heart wherever it may lead you. When Henry Hartt returns home to care for his elderly grandfather, he rediscovers a life vastly different from the one he left behind in New York City. During the course of his visit, Henry inability to let go of his past prevents him from experiencing the joy that right under his nose. This movie demystifies the dymanics of a gay relationship, and allows the viewer to see that meaningful love is universal and possible regardless of one's orientation. For those people who thought only heterosexuals are capable of this kind of emotion, surprise! If you have ever been a victim of homphobia or know someone who has, I'm sure you'll agree that the world would be a better place if it were more like Eden, Montana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Sweet Home","review":"If only home were like this, no one would ever leave. This is a beautifully shot film with lots of warm likeable yet quirky characters very similar to Cicely, Alaska from the TV series Northern Exposure. Some people don't like this film because all of the characters are so supportive of the lead character who happens to be gay. However, people need to understand that this is a story about how life should be. Isn't that why we watch movies? To dream about a better world. In my opinion, this is a wonderful, feel-good film. The scenery is spectacular, and the acting is top notch. It makes you laugh and then makes you cry. What more can you ask of a film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is truly one of the best gay films I have ever experienced. If only such a place existed like Big Eden. We all can only hope. This is the one movie that I never get tired of watching and can find new meaning to it everytime I watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming and alive.","review":"I've watched this movie 3 times with friends and each time we have all come away with a feeling of warmth. Though many will agree it is not true-to-life for those of us who have experienced daily non-acceptance, it gives us a feeling of hope. I find that it comes the closest to expessing the way gay men feel and interact of any movie I've seen so far; others may disagree. However,everyone that I know who has seen Big Eden agrees that there is definitely something there that touches the heart. A close friend, who had just broken up and was not able to talk about it, poured out his emotions after watching the movie and was much better for it. In my opinion this is definitely worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! No matter your orientation, you should see this film!","review":"I watched this film at my University this week and was so touched by it I cried, several times and laughed my head off too. I am straight, and often am disappointed in the way the LGBT community is portrayed on television and in movies. This movie really puts it in more perspective though. In Big Eden the characters are REAL. No matter your orientation you can relate to the problems and dilemas faced in this film. The supporting characters are hilarious in their attempts to help out and whether this kind of attitude will be found in small towns in the near future or not, it was awesome to see the film placed in such a setting. Please see this movie. It was touching and funny and I think you can't help but enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative !","review":"I've seen many gay themed movies over the years and this is, without doubt, the best one I have seen to date. It doesn't involve the typical stereotypes of gay men, no campy queens or drama starlets. It deals with real human emotions on a deeper level than any other movie. This world we live in does not have to be all about horror and violence. Gay peple do not have to be the subject of ridicule and stereotypes meant only to please and humor the ignorant. Hats off to the writer, director and the actors for this superlative movie. I am so impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Superb with Tears and JOY!","review":"I have watched this movie now, I say not enough. It's not just a gay movie although it does have a gay romance that is not shown, but grows with such a spirit of true love that it will shake the hearts of many.

I loved it! If you need a life affirming movie as a gay man, or anyone, this is it! I'm here to buy the DVD Edition with all the extras because I can't wait to show it to my boyfriend, and watch it again myself! I think I will watch this movie over and over again because of the good feelings about life that I have now after watching it. It actually makes you want to be a better person in your own community!

I didn't know it was categorized as a \\"gay movie,\\" and I don't care. This is a very well written, directed, performed, photographed, and edited piece of film. The fact that Henry being gay is as naturally beautiful as the lakes and mountains portrayed in the movie. Aren't we all looking for a place like this? I'm not gay, but I'm a guy in 40s. The life is wanting to be simpler, and this movie is a nice reminder to go beyond what we are caught up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to survive coming out and accepting love","review":"I bought this movie in 2002 when I was in the process of coming out to friends, family and co-workers. I was over 35, a \\"late bloomer.\\" This movie spoke to me in many ways. It was how the world could and should be. How a community can love, accept, and take care of one another as human beings sharing a common space. There was a scene between the lead character and his grandfather that touched my heart and my soul. I had to pause the movie as it had moved me to tears. I wept for the acknowledgment of how I had felt about myself, how I had assumed others would feel after I came out, and for facing the pain and the misguided shame that I was shaking off. This movie would do wonders for anyone who loathes gays, and that includes self-hating gays. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy Land !!","review":"There is absolutely no way that this depiction of the gay scene in Montana is somehow linked to reality. If you can overcome this huge obstacle you might enjoy this movie. Then again, you have the other unrealistic scenario where 2 men (one of them divorced and gorgeous) are trying to win the affection of an annoying, ugly Arye Gross (name suits him). Never would happen! The scenery shown in Montana is stunning, and the portrayals of his grandfather and close friend (woman teacher) are sweet but cannot save this far fetched drama. This movie had potential but a different cast and a dash of reality were needed to give this one a chance. Rent this one at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment","review":"I bought this movie based on the reviews here. What a disappointment. I thought I was watching a different movie than the one reviewed here. The premise of the movie was encouraging, but the execution and the acting was just not believable. In fact at times it was laughable (unintentionally). The lead was not believable - I couldn't get past the premise that he was being persued by TWO men, not just because he wasn't traditionally 'cute', but there was NOTHING in his personality that made him attractive or appealing. In fact, he seemed to be uncomfortable being gay. Another problem I had was that the movie was filled with all these 'wacky' but lovable and understanding characters who became annoying (to me) since they were a bit too cutesy. This movie tries to be a 'feel good' movie, but I couldn't get past the bad acting and unbelievable characters. The movie's soundtrack was the best thing (older Country)."},{"rating":"1","title":"description misleading","review":"description failed to state category of movie. description failed to state category of movie. description failed to state category of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun Overall","review":"Not every movie is for everyone. I understand some of the criticism of this movie, but its faults are minor and its understated points ring true for me.The story is interesting, has some twists and turns which I didn't expect, the characters are wonderfully expressed and realized, the tension is real, and there are no happily-ever- afters guaranteed at the end. Just like life.The characters are fun to watch and the scenery is unbelievable. Everyone seems to have enjoyed making this movie, and put their best into the project. It has made for a little gem that will seem familiar (if a little exaggerated) to anyone from a small town. Sure, it's a little idyllic, but it's a fictional movie, after all.Not every point or issue is as fully-verbalized as some would like, but not everything has to be thoroughly verbalized to be understood. And some of the points and issues are left to the viewer to interpret. It's not a bad thing.Wonderful entertainment. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great film.","review":"Arye Gross really shines in this heart warming film.

I'm very happy that films like this one can be made but they just haven't gotten it right yet.I expected MUCH more from this movie after reading the synopsis on it's official website. It dragged in more than a few places (the opening scene, Henry and Grandpa on the porch, Pike preparing countless meals) and left me dry in the end. The Henry/Pike thing didn't work for me at all. It felt very forced.I found myself feeling VERY sorry for Dean in the end. He was never quite honest with himself and ended up settling for something he didn't really want.Overall this film didn't end up being the idealistic fairy tale that it professes to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuinely sweet love story.","review":"I'm a married straight woman who generally avoids romance/love stories (not much for schmultz). But I just love this film. It sort of reminds me of a gay \\"Northern Exposure\\". But I'd hate to define it as a \\"gay movie\\". Quite simply, it's a charming little romance about unrequited love. And the main characters \\"just happen to be gay\\". Eric Schweig was wonderful as Pike, the achingly in love but painfully shy general store owner. Lots of good performances by some really wonderful character actors. If you're in the mood for a romantic film that's a little different, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I have seen many gay films and grown tired of seeing the same old themes hashed out (nasty queens, AIDS, self hatred), so I was excited to hear that Big Eden is something different. True it is a sweet fable about unrequited love and the importance of family. And as a fable, I can go along with its unrealistic tone. However, the two lead characters have almost zero chemistry going on. I think the director was so involved in making an \\"endearing\\" \\"sweet\\" story that he forgot to provide any good reason that these two men would ever be compatible or fall in love with each other..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little gem of a film","review":"This film is a classical boy returns to home town, hooks up with a local girl and, after overcoming obstacles, they go off in to the sunset together. Except in this case it's two guys. Interestingly and refreshingly, the fact that the main protagonists are gay is barely an issue in the story.The acting is top notch all around and the scenery of Montana is spectacular. I was delighted to watch a movie that is about unconditional love and acceptance. This film's gentle humor and unabashed romanticism was a delight to behold.My wife and I were also very moved by the story. She had herself a good cry and even I had a lump in my throat. I doubt that there any place in the real world that is filled with so many loving and supportive people, but I found Big Eden to be a much appreciated break from the sadness of current events."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After all those fine words and grand reviews it was a big disappointment to watch this movie.The story about the New York artist going back to his home town to discover himself is a classic. That's okay as long it is told with conviction, but this one is not. Why the hero is so uptight about being gay is a total mystery, because he is surrounded by a bunch of good willing and good acting oldtimers including his granddad, who whishes the best for his and his gay life.In spite of some well known actors in the line up, the acting is poor and especially the leading part is awful. And on top of everything he is an uncharming little gnome, and it is very unlikely that he'll have two admirers."},{"rating":"1","title":"<yawn>","review":"Thomas Bezucha's vision of a gay Eden is one where most everyone is straight, but uber-tolerant of the few fags among them. This alone is enought to turn me off. This is not my idea of a gay Eden.The lead character has spent 20 years pining away for his high school best friend. He comes back to his rustic Montana hometown when his grandfather goes ill. We are led to believe this is like entering Shangri-La, but to me it was like the 4th level of hell. All the local straights appear to be able to figure out who the queers are and they engage in all manner of stupid matchmaking activities. All the gay people, however, are tightly closeted from both the straight world as well as each other.Seems to me that the director/author of this flick is a self-hating gay man. No self-respecting gay man could have conceived of a world so loathsome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap is King","review":"I purchased this video on sale from Wolf, expecting something great.

It never ended.I had just viewed \\"The Car Man\\" before viewing this dud. In only one hour and twenty seven minutes, without saying a word, Matthew Bourne conveyed more then this movie could ever say in telling a story.The director or the writer evisioned an America that they would like to see, and indeed should be, but is not, and I wonder if it will ever be.I removed it from the VCR and put it right were it belonged, in the trash. After all, why keep something I will never view again.All I can say, if you have to see this video, rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Movie is not very professional.

The storyline and acting seem so effortless that the legendary fourth-wall literally does seem to disappear and the viewer feels \\"present\\" to the drama as it unfolds.As I said, the writing and the acting are superb. What a remarkable ensemble the supporting-cast turns out to be! The directing is as well. Every now and then the movie over-reaches itself and loses something by trying to do or say too much, but those few moments don't dampen this otherwise wonderful film.Definitely a place I want to visit again and again. If only such a place truly existed, where friends could express their emotions and feelings fully and be accepted, and where shame is not taught to children, and where everyone helps everyone else to come to their \\"good place.\\" Their own Big Eden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightened up!","review":"Cute! My partner and I really enjoyed the cornball happenings in this movie. We where both smiling at the end and commented it was nice to see an old fashioned, sugar coated gay love story. Life is \\"real life\\" enough. This break from reality was refreshing and feel good. I like a good drag queen character as much as the next guy but it was nice to watch a movie that was not your sterotypical gay character set.

However, I must acknowledge the struggle that many gay people I know have undergone, and in doing so I find the townfolks' attitudes in this movie a little too unbelievable.

They stuck to the bottom of the pan and were not cooked evenly, even on medium heat with the use of cooking oil. Then I had to soak it for a while to even get it kinda clean. I decided to try using a nonstick cooking spray the second time for a grilled cheese sandwich and the sandwich still stuck to the pan and cooked unevenly on medium/low heat.

Visually, it shows that one reason why Bartoli consistently dazzles is that she collaborates with other top-notch artists. This recital is so attractive in no small part thanks to Olivier Simonnet's direction, which is excellent in all arias but one. The camera angles, the lighting, the details, the editing--all show a nuanced understanding of the music and the whole Baroque aesthetic. They create an atmosphere of exuberant vitality and the most exquisite melancholy. It is the latter in particular that Bartoli conveys devastatingly well--I wish they had included more of the silky, haunting arias of sadness. Yes, Bartoli shines in the bravura parts, but it is in spinning those fragile notes of abject longing in which she is peerless. For the splendour and the intimacy of the Baroque, this is a performance to treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacrificium, the music of a goddess.","review":"What else can I say?

Songs like Analysis Paralysis and Dancing Dogs have great lyrics with a fine melody, while the awesome Token Pledge is still a highlight of their live show (Tiles was on tour in 2000 with Spock's Beard and Dream Theater). Yes, the tired comparisons to Rush are bound to come to your mind after listening to this, but hey, isn't all great guitar-based prog metal eventually compared to Rush? Chris Herin and company would be proud! Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and cool moves","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect. We're having a 50's sock hop and needed some help with the dance moves. My girls (7 and 9) love this DVD and my husband and I can even tolerate it. Great music, fun dance moves. The two instructors go over it many times so anyone can learn them, with a little practice. The acting is bad, but the dancing is cool. Short, only 3 songs, but you'll learn them well and can apply the cool moves to any 50's or 60's songs. After watching the DVD twice, the girls have picked up most of the moves and are cutting up the dance floor. We're enjoying it and would recommend it for kids.

The author's style is rambling and cryptic. It is often hard to understand his point. He delivers endless analysis of other author's works, but completely fails to either describe his subject matter well, or to teach a new author how to learn voice and style techniqiues. He may be a good teacher in the classroom, but he certainly does not know how to write a book that can teach.

I have been looking for this version for quite some time and have been unable to find it. I only gave it 4 stars though because the only way it could be perfect, is to completely copy from the book.

Its four hours long which is great. There is plenty of time to develop the story and put in lots of details (the book is LONG). I do think Timothy Dalton is too handsome for the role, but hey why not its more enjoyable to look at him. He is not as gruff as some previous actors have portrayed Mr. Rochester. I loved the scene in the study where she has told him she is going to leave him. He cries and tells her his heart is broken, its very touching. In other adaptations Mr. Rochester just yells all the time. Zeleah Clarke was a very gentle and melancholy Jane (although I think too plump for a schoolgirl from Lowood). But she was great.

Secondly, every scene with Timothy Dalton is straight out of 1980's soap opera. It was all I could do to not laugh out loud.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone; it was so disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zelah , No Jane Eyre","review":"I've watched this adaptation many times, and am always moved by Timothy Daltons performance. Zelah Clarkes interpretation of this character is VERY ANEMIC. Very poorly cast.

I've never read the original, but I think Timothy Dalton is the most feeling, engagingly human of all the Rochesters I've seen, while Zelah Clark is simply matchless as Jane.

The acting was very poor and unconvincing. I was shocked and so disappointed with actor, Timothy Dalton. His acting was the worst of all. The Physical appearance of this Jane Eyre was very unappealing and unconvincing as well. I found myself getting upset at this rendition of Charlotte Bronte's novel as it rearranged some scenes. I thought this was a movie, but it was a series of episodes, which made watching it disturbing with all the stop and go of introduction and credits!! What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I finally gave up on this. Timothy Dalton did a good job but he's far too handsome for the role of Edward. Jane was a total diappointment. Jane is 18 years old, very tiny, thin and modest, Clarke looked almost matronly. The costumes were so far off from what the book described as her dress. She wasn't submissive but then she wasn't a smart ass either like she plays in this movie.I didn't see any \\"chemistry\\" between Dalton and Clarke. Clarke's performance seemed like she was reading cue cards rather than acting.The book is wonderful but this movie is lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average adaptation","review":"I've watched this version a few times and tried to like it but unfortunately I can't. Some of the scenes are quite disapponting, there is so much to work with in this novel but they just don't capture anything. The 2 main actors Tim and Zelah don't in any way suit the roles they are playing, so immediately I can't warm to it. Tim acts well but isn't Rochester and Zelah is just well, strange! Even Pilot the dog seems disastrously miscast! If you want to see a true, classic adaptation of a fine novel with outstanding acting, then go no further than the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, simply outstanding in every way. I think the fact that it has been released after 30 years due to popular demand says it all! It's a complete joy to watch and proves that you don't have to cast a young, tall dark and handsome actor as Rochester to ensure that you produce a fine adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"STIFF","review":"Oh my gosh!

No other film based on Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre even comes close to it. The actors / actresses are brilliant and the scenery imaginable when reading the text.

It's almost as good as Gone with the Wind. I rented this movie and watched it. I was not prepared for this-. The scenery looked so fake, the actors were terrible, they looked like they didn't know what they were doing, and it looked like it was recorded from someones shoulder at some times. The one star is for the fact that at least the movie tried to follow the book, I'll give them that because I despise movies that are titled after books and end up being totally different (e.g. 3rd Anne of Green Gables movie.)Excuse me, I might have been running away with my imagination while I was reading Jane Eyre because the movie so rudely brought me back to the bare facts of the book. (I am so sorry, but Timothy Dalton looks most unbecoming, even if he's supposed to, I always fancied the \\"ugly\\" men as handsome- forgive my ignorance.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely you jest. What a bomb!","review":"Someone should inform the casting department at the BBC that a forty-year woman with bad teeth and wide hips does not look nineteen just because she's short. She resembles instead a forty-year old, wide hipped dwarf. This overlong adaptation of Jane Eyre is absolutely risible, and I challenge anyone to hum a single line of the elevator music. Look, folks, people back then had little do but read books they could barely lift; it was either that or play dominoes or charades, but that does not mean a modern adaptation should last as long as it takes actually to read the book. This turgid production is two hours too long and stupifyingly dull to boot, suggesting that the director was either paid by the hour or had to fill up two nights of programming. Stick with the elegant version starring Charlotte Gansbourg, an actress with immense sex appeal and backed up by a terrific musical score."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Near-Perfect Adaptation!","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of my favorite novels - and of all the movie adaptations of this darkly beautiful masterpiece, this still remains the favorite of my heart.This is one of those beautifully-acted, exquisitely-staged BBC productions that one just cannot get enough of! True that Timothy Dalton's Mr. Rochester is a bit too handsome, but he captures entirely the romance of this mysterious and fascinating personage. Zelah Clarke is a simply wonderful Jane. And the settings in this movie are dark and lovely - just as I had pictured in my mind while reading the book.For those of you who love well-made adaptations of literary classics - this is one movie that it would be very much a shame to miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Bronte's novel alive on screen as it should be.","review":"This amazing rendition follows the book perfectly. The characters are so well developed and enchanting that even Charlotte Bronte would be mesmerized! Every minute of the film is engrossing and well worth the time to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follows the book very well","review":"I gave this a 4 star rating only because it does a great job depicting the character from the novel very well. Jane and Mr Rochester moral characters are evident. The movie quality is lacking. There is a new version out that I really enjoyed as well but they left out Jane's God fearing moral standard the drove her life. I wish I could combine the 2 movies to make a perfect match. If you love the book then you will enjoy the movie just don't expect it to be high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this up and get the latest adaptation","review":"I bought the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Jane Eyre, but it doesn't ship until later in the month. I decided to puchase the 1983 adaptation in the meantime to get my Jane Eyre fix. However, I was very disappointed in the settings and the portrayal of Jane. I thought there was no chemistry between Ms. Clarke and Timothy Dalton, and at times it was almost painful to watch the two of them together in certain scenes. I did like Timothy Dalton as Rochester, but he definitely needed another Jane to play against his Rochester."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timothy Dalton was great, but...","review":"Great acting by Timothy Dalton, but he's too gorgeous for Mr. Rochester. I can't believe no other women wanted him except for his money. I thought Mr. Rochester and Jane in this version are mismatched. This Jane just looked like a self-righteous older woman with weak voice...not likable at all. She often looked annoyed or irritated, instead of having inner strength. I couldn't see how Mr. Rochester can be attracted to her. After reading the book, I felt like I couldn't have enough of Jane and Mr. Rochester, but this adaptation gave me some bad after taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far, far inferior to the 1973 version","review":"I'm sorry but I can't understand how Tim Dalton can match the Rochester described in Charlotte Bronte's novel. He is described as the exact opposite of young and handsome. Tim does a lot of staring and theatrical acting in the part of Rochester and that's about it. Zelah Clark just doesn't capture the fire and character of Jane in the novel and where is the chemistry? She also looks far too old for the part. The 1973 adaptation is outstanding, every scene is wonderful and Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack ARE Rochester and Jane. Having seen the 1973 version nothing else compares favourably and this 1983 version is completely dull, certainly doesn't capture the essence of the novel. I wouldn't recommend it but if you haven't seen any other version then this is probably just ok. Not a classic by any means! A plodding romance it is but Jane Eyre it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane is a dud in this movie","review":"Perhaps Mr.Rochester is not as handsome as Timothy Dalton, but at least he shows some passion. Zelah Clark as Jane is a bore. There is no basis for Mr.Rochester being drawn to her. I had to laugh when he called her passionate. She pretty much had one expression throughout. Save your $ and get the movie with William Hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"This production has expired","review":"I was disappointed in this production of Jane Eyre. I purchased it to compare with the newer version and I found that came up short. The lighting and production values were distracting, and the actors had little chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very engaging","review":"Having read Jane Eyre in school years ago, I remembered liking the story and being touched by it, however I couldn't remember why. At the beginning of this movie, I almost groaned with how the cinematography seemed class \\"B\\", but that was soon swept aside by the truly excellent portrayals of the characters by the actors and actresses. This was a moving and passionately done, believable rendition of a classic. Now I remember why I liked the book so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it!!","review":"This is the one and only version that is anything clos to the book! I loved it! Timothy Dalton was Rochester. The emotions, the almost bi-polar moments were perfect for Mr. Rochester. Granted, he was a little too pretty but his acting made up for it. The emotion he used before Jane left was great! he went from panic to sadness to anger. It was perfect! This is without a doubt, the best Jane Eyre video and I have seen all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"My favorite Classic of all time Poorly portrayed","review":"I was so disappointed in the television series of Jane Eyre. Timothy Dalton is known as a great actor, but you would not be able to discern that from watching this. Jane Eyre is a book that I have read, reread, and read some more. The actors cast in this series were not the actors for the job. They turned one of the biggest romances of all time into something that I am not sure I recognized as Jane Eyre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as reading the book","review":"This version, and the more recent A&E version, are the two best adaptations I have seen of my favorite novel. While Dalton did a wonderful job, he IS too handsome to play Mr. Rochester. When Jane says she does not think him handsome, you simply don't believe her!The production values are not as good as the acting; the music is cheesy and the costume designer has for some reason seen fit to make all the women wear dresses that give them the illusion of enormous hips. However, you soon forget that as you get swept up in the story. I agree with JulepPark's review- the drawing room scene is heart-wrenching.There is one thing I didn't like, though- it ends too fast! It seems to stop in the middle of a scene, then go to the epilogue. But that is easily forgiven for the sake of the rest of it. This is worth every penny of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Every actor in this superb cast is part of something very special. Ms. Clarke and Mr. Dalton are first among equals, and their scenes together are wonderful. Ms. Clarke is a lovely, modest, and principled Jane Eyre, with a core of steel. Mr. Dalton was born to play Edward Fairfax Rochester. His voice is a gorgeous instrument, beautifully handled. It's a delight to watch favorite scenes dramatized so well. The salary dispute is more exhilarating than a fencing match, and the renunciation scene is powerful. All praise to director Julian Amyes and dramatist Alexander Baron for honoring Miss Bront's novel with this fine production."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A LOVE STORY!","review":"I fell in love with Jane Eyre's character, her good Christian morals would not allow her to marry Mr. Rochester who was still secretly married to an insane woman, nonetheless, Jane knew it was not right and stuck by refusing him. But at the end she could not deny that her heart belonged to Mr. Rochester. She finally goes to him finding him free but sad condition. Awesome ending you must see the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton. Best Version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faultless","review":"This version of \\"Jane Eyre\\", is the best. I have seen them all and did appreciate many of them.In this version, the passion is palpable. When Jane left Rochester, and he begged her not to go, the despair jumps off the screen.The chemistry that can be sensed between Zelzah Clarke and Timothy Dalton is rarely seen.Get the DVD, invest the time, it really does fly by, and you will fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I have ever seen","review":"Great adaptation all around! There is not one actor miscast, not one word superflous or missing. Zealah Clarke is gentle, kind, modest but strong and independent Jane Eyre, and Timothy Dalton is dark, melancholic, but kind and passionate Rochester. I adored Mr. Brockelhurst--great performance, Mrs. Fairfax--perfect portrayal. All of the cast had the grasp of the manners, language of that time. Beatiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Shortened Version of Mini-Series","review":"The original UK release of this mini-series consisted of 11 30-minute episodes (330 minutes of footage) while the running time of this video is only 239 minutes. As you see the startling 1.5 hours of film were cut! Since I had a chance to see both versions I can assure you that the cuts subtract from your enjoyment of the series. And it's a shame as this is clearly the definite adoption of the Bronte's celebrated novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done!","review":"This is my favorite make of my favorite book, Jane Eyre. This movie was really very well done. Definitely a good watch, and definitely the best make of the book I've seen so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video release makes great injustice to the marvellous series","review":"I've seen a lot of people noticed that film is too long and certain characters are underdeveloped. I was even more disappointed than most of you with this video release since I saw \\"Jane Eyre\\" the way it supposed to be seen as TV series.Because you don't watch everything at once but over 1 week adaptation you don't feel that adaptation is long. The editors of this release left out huge chunks of original footage throughout the movie, especially Jane's childhood and Lockwood scenes and later at St.John's. That's why you don't see much of Jane's relationship with Helen and found that actress young Jane is somewhat lackluster though actually she was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a bit long....","review":"I know that is exactly what some of the earlier reviewers particularly liked about this Timothy Dalton/Sian Pattenden version but I felt like there were just too many words at times in this adaptation of Jane Eyre. (I even fell asleep at one point.) Even though I am certain that it is more true to the book than the Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens adaptation, I personally preferred the Toby Stephens one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presenting...The very watchable Timothy Dalton!","review":"I have seen several versions of Jane Eyre and this is the best one (IMO) because of Timothy Dalton. His portrayal of Mr. Rochester was intense and strong. Passionate one minute and cool and distant the next. Open, deceiving, manipulative, tragic, defiant and yes, sexy. I loved him. Zelah Clarke, on the other hand, was the worse Jane Eyre. Sorry, her performance didn't move me at all. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite literary characters but I found Ms. Clarke's interpretation to be wooden at times and had too modern a feel to it. Her 'pregnant pauses' go on for years, with a blank stare to boot. I felt no deep passion, no fire beneath the ice. If I didn't know better (which I don't) I would say perhaps the editing was at fault somehow...but probably not. It's just her method of acting. I know many will disagree but, oh well. It's still worth a buy, if for nothing else than to watch Timothy Dalton's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Rochester buckles my swash","review":"There are a zillion versions of Jane Eyre and they all fall short when compared to this one. Timothy Dalton is a swash buckling Mr. Rochester. Tall, dark and brooding. Zelah Clarke is a petite, perfect foil. I never try of this one. It's as timeless as the romance itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Country/AltCountry Gem","review":"I think Amazon had originally called this CD Song of the Divided High. I don't see that anywhere on my CD. Instead, I suggested this just be a self-titled album.This is very great country music, and some of the songs even have a cool western swing to them. Earl Butter's voice is just a straightforward country warbler, nothing special, nothing outstanding, in fact, it's almost unique in how plain it is. A southern accent without too much twangy inflection, which is the annoying thing about most modern day mainstream country. It's honest and pure.I'm rediscovering this CD, but I must say that \\"Coffee and Beer\\" is one of my favorite songs on this CD. A great tune about the road and drinking coffee and beer. Again, honest and pure.Recommended for those of you who just can't get enough \\"good\\" country music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful book","review":"This book is worthless; I finished reading the first chapter, and I cannot bear to go further. It's that bad.I am an attorney, and much of what the author writes is simply wrong. There are countless times when the author misapplies the law, and his description of our legal system is unrecognisable. The author apparently thinks that basing his argument almost entirely on fictional novels and movies is a good idea. His other main source seems to be himself, but the legal system that he describes has nothing to do with the one I know. Judging by the introduction, the author's career involves civil law and writing novels, which might explain why he fumbles so badly when discussing criminal law and morality.Don't waste your time with this book. There is nothing of value within its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plural of anecdote is not data","review":"There is not much more to say than what is said by the other 1 and 2 star reviewers. The book is filled with the way Rosenbaum wishes the world could be, but is completely divorced from how the world actually is. There is no support for his arguments outside of fictional creations and conclusions drawn from anecodotal stories. Nor does he even try to explain how the world he imagines might come into being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every lawyer should read it","review":"I agree with the NY Times reviewer - all law students should be required to read this book, but would add that all practicing lawyers should read it too.

It was more of a kid's video than a serious way to learn disco dances. It was extremely disappointing, with lots of kids doing the dancing, and when the instructors show the dance moves, there are many times when you can't see their feet as they do the steps.

We got some for our son when he was first starting to use crayons. We had some of the \\"chunky/chubby\\" ones for at home, although if he was really coloring up a storm, he could still snap them from the pressure of coloring. So these twist-up ones were a great solution for the diaper bag. Anywhere we went, he could color and his crayons wouldn't break because of the plastic casing. They are hexagonal shape, so they won't roll off the table as easily as regular crayons. And when he wore down a color, he would hand it to us and we would twist it up a little more for him. As he got older, he could twist them up himself (we had to teach him to only twist out a little at a time!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martha's Vineyard Plan Book","review":"I purchased this item expecting to see architectual details for some of the fine Victorian houses in Martha's Vineyard.Instead, I was very disappointed to find out that it's an architectural firm's catalog listing plans to order."},{"rating":"1","title":"rib tickling","review":"Rib Tickling and Stomach Turning.

I wanted something somewhat decorative since I didn't want or need a light kit. The fan is so quiet and it is well made. I paid for a handyman to install it and it took him just under an hour. He said installation wasn't any more difficult than any other fan with the exception of how the main part of the fan attaches when you do the initial wiring. It's more of an awkward moment then a deterrant to the installation. Other fan brands attach in a more convenient way. I ordered the fan from Amazon because of the price which was $74 less than the local stores. I'm thinking of buying a second fan to replace another old fan in my living room. My only disappointment is that the fan is not made in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter Savoy 52-Inch Five-Blade Ceiling Fan","review":"This came to us quickly, product was perfect for our lower ceilings (8ft) so still had headroom.

Nearly all of the episodes deal with one or another phobia (Lofty's fear of heights and general tentativeness, Muck's fear of the dark...and mice...and sounds at night). Both characters are shown whining on and on and on about their fears. It's truly annoying. Shows that deal with phobias can potentially help a toddler get over those fears, but this video simply reinforces them without showing characters that have overcome their fears. Each new episode starts with the same rediculous amount of fear and trepidation. Can we fix it? \\"Uh, I think so....\\"Other features I dislike are scenes of Spud the scarecrow taunting Lofty about his fears, and Bob exhibiting poor judgement about safety.My husband and I think Lofty should be fired.

However, my taste has branched out of late. And it led me to take a look at Miami Guns, which ran across via the wired. Nevertheless, this anime is beyond brilliant. It takes cultural perspectives from Japan, to America and blends them into a matrix of pure laughter and gut busting gags. Making fun of Die-Hard, to Wrestling. This anime by far, has class, intelligence (stupidity) and just flat out fun. This is a series any anime fan should own.

So, I think my expectations were a little too high for this book. It's tiny, barely more than a pamphlet. It's poorly-organized, interview-style format was cumbersome to me. I wanted information like she had presented on greens in the dvd, instead it was this airy-fairy tale of the Boutenkos adventures with little in the way of solid info., you can sink your teeth into. A lot of people have been inspired to make positive changes in their lives after reading this book though, so don't go by me. Read it yourself.

Less acceptable, to my point of view, is the utter failure to correct mistakes that occurred in the previous edition. Number 17 on page 124, for example, is unsolvable as written and the answer is incorrectly reasoned. I e-mailed them about this last year and they agreed that it was unsolveable as written and assured me it would be corrected in the second edition. Well it isn't! Number 12 on page 491 remains uncorrected (in addition to the answer they note, it could also have length of 85 and width of 1). Several other typos HAVE been corrected, for which I am grateful, but one would expect much greater editing accuracy in this edition, given the complete overlap with the first edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably easy compared to the real test. . .","review":"I am the director of a tutoring program in Boston.

While the \\"correct\\" answer is \\"more richer\\", the verb \\"is\\" in the end doesn't agree with the \\"had\\" earlier in the sentence.

Although, sometimes I do have to tell him we have to wait for Dad to come home with certain things around the house. Point is, this video (along with \\"Dig, Lift, Haul! & Bob Saves the Day) uses language appropriately and clearly, shows positive interaction between people, and the machine characters are pretty cute. However, we could lose a bit of the one that says, \\"Uh, I think so\\". I like that my 3 1/2 yr. old son is learning what different tools are used for, too.

He always disliked the small grips on that weapon, so I purchased these for him.Installation takes about 2 minutes, you remove the original grips, then included is a peice of metal that attaches to two pegs on the bottom of the frame. This peg creates about an extra 3/4\\" extra gripping on the handle. You then carefully slide the grip over the frame/handle, and fasten the flathead screw that is included on the bottom of the grip.The grip has a recess where the hammer would otherwise hit the grips, at first I thought it was ugly, but I realise now it's purpose is to create enough clearance for the hammer.It does make the weapon look sloppy now, but function is primary over cosmetics.This grip is unfortunentally made in MEXICO."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Hogue Monogrip ...","review":"is fantastic!Completely changed the feel of my S&W; 442.

Maybe all revolver grips are that way. I don't know. Why take it off, you ask? Because the gun loses conceal-ability with the new Hogue grip on it. Also, you limit the number of places you can carry your gun at with the bigger grip. So, in conclusion, awesome grip for the range, not so awesome installation."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Hogue item I have been dissatisfied with.","review":"While I am generally very pleased with hogue products, this one simply falls short of the high standard I usually hold hogue to.I love the overmold design, and is sported on my 870 and one of the 10/22s.However, the grip it to large, and makes a very concealable firearm...BIG! I may as well carry a 4\\" GP100 if I keep the hogue grips on. They are of high quality, but in my opinion really kill the purpose of a J frame.I wanted more traction, a slightly larger grip, and the ability to get my hand higher, up to the bore axis.The grip is too large, and I can't get my hand up high enough.Oh well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, at best.","review":"I had high hopes for this book, having just moved to Oregon from Colorado.

Much to my disappoinment, there is much more information on survival skills in the Oregon woods, availalable big game animals (types, species, etc), Oregon weather and stories from local hunters. No information on wildlife areas, BLM lands...nothing !! Also, the apparent lack of maps in this book is really, really disappointing. The book actually seems more like it was written for elemetary school children who know nothing of hunting than for serious hunters who want to know where to go inb Oregon.

Then I took galvanized steel deck nails and nailed it on. To be removed someone would have to get through 4\\" of brick. The decking nails anchored it into the brick.

Nice idea, poor function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful but limited","review":"I bought this product to hang by the door way entrance in my garage. I figured as soon as my wife or I park our cars, we put our car keys in here and know where they will be at all times. The problem is the device is really only meant for KEYS. Not your alarm remote or any other things hanging off of your key chain. Depending on what you have on your key chains, the space allotted is really limited. I filed my set of keys to one of our vehicles to make it work (guy thing, was determined to prove that it was a good buy). So, although great concept, I wish it had just a little bit more space to fit the entire key chain................."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lock","review":"This lock does exactly what we needed it to do.

When the keys moved, it wouldnt lock. I almost gave up but was determined to make it work. The description claimed that it could fit up to 5 keys. I find that very unbelievable. I also tried putting my lock box key in there (from the bank, the flattest key there is) & couldn't manage to fit that in along with the car key. The product is rediculous and I plan to return it or just never take my keys out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"used item","review":"the mechandise i recieved was used. i payed for a new item. not good business at all. that is why i gave this item one star. hard for me to return it because i have family coming and i dont have time to wait for another."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"The dials are rough to turn, don't seat accurately or solidly and on the very first attempt to set the combination and reopen, the box would not open.I unfortunately bought two of them after seeing so many good reviews ... which makes me think those reviews are staged.

After a three weeks, one of them jammed and would not open even when the combo was entered correctly. I used a crowbar to remove it easily from the wall. I then set it on its side and hit it just once with a sledgehammer. The door broke off instantly. The lever was now free and moved easily when the correct code was entered. If all you need a cheap key storage box that gives the illusion of security (enough to deter honest, curious people), this is a great bargain. If you need protection from people with crowbars and sledgehammers, don't purchase this product. Also, if you don't have your own crowbar and sledgehammer to break into this if it sticks, don't purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits the need perfectly","review":"What good is security when just hiding a key on a shelf or under a rug. It's obvious that a key is in here, but by the time a thief ripped this off the wall and smashed it to get the key out, they might as well just break through the door to gain entry.

Leaving a key hidden outside was just not something I felt comfortable with. It is reasonably priced. It was easy to install and is sturdy. It is easy to set your own combination. The directions provided are clear and simple to follow. The one feature that I do not like is the combination needs to be scrambled upon locking it after use, unlike other locks that need to be set to zero in order for the locking mechanism to engage.

Seems like it would be hard for someone to break into it. I do agree with some other reviews that it would be nice if there was a little hook or something in there for the keys to hang on.

But overall I'm very satisfied and would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST PECULIAR - does not open in freezing temperatures","review":"This is most peculiar, and perhapse only related to the specific unit I have, but when the box is cold, below freezing, it cannot be opened. I verified this by putting the box in my freezer and indeed, could not open it until it warmed up. When it was cold, the lever that unlatches the door would not move despite having the correct combination. As it warmed up, one could hear a click and then the lever would work. I came to this because once I had to sit outside freezing my tush, waiting for my wife, because the darn box would not budge. A few days later the weather was warm, the box opened, and my wife began to look at me funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I bought a couple of these for my rental properties and have only used one. It is at my own house. It is well worth the price to know that I will not get locked out of my house again. Also, if I unexpectedly need to let someone in my house, I can give them the combination and then reset the lock afterwards so they cannot get in later. I chose this model, which is screwed in with the screws only accessible when it is unlocked, because I though it would be less tempting to steal than the one that loops over the door lock. This model can go anywhere and be less noticeable. Also, I did not want anyone breaking the handle off of the door to get to the lockbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed, easy to smash or crack According to YouTube","review":"Bought because it was recommended as a tough safe.

One attack was a hammer attack and the castings that affix the rear plate bolts sheared in a few hits.

The storylines of Season 4 are great, but it's Tiffany that makes me not like Season 4. The packaging is great. At Wal-Mart they started selling 2 Seasons of some shows for $20. I bought Seasons 1 and 2 in one package and Seasons 3 and 4 in one package.

In my opinion the show doesn't flow as smoothly as it did with Kate. Cheryl Ladd's character seems to almost be reading her lines, they are spoken short, quick and staccato-like. Shelley Hack's character seems hesitant all the time, hesitant to speak, hesitant in what she says and in how she says it. Jaclyn's Smith's character is the only one that seems to flow, but it's awkward for her to flow when the other 2 are going off in their own direction. So I think the acting is a bit stiff, but it's still a fun show to watch and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The story lines aren't as strong as seasons 1-3. Shelley Hack's acting isn't so great, but I don't think that's why the ratings were low. It's mainly the writing. There were too many Kris Munroe episodes giving Shelley Hack and Jaclyn Smith mere \\"supporting roles\\" to Cheryl Ladd. If they had balanced it out and given all of the angels starring story lines the season would have been more interesting. Plus, people wanted a chance to see the new angel Tiffany shine, which we didn't get to see. And Jaclyn Smith's role was greatly reduced after Kate Jackson left which is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!!! Finally!!!","review":"We have literally been waiting years for this release. Please everybody, buy a copy of this, so Sony will release Season Five. I have only seen a few episodes with Shelly Hack, and I will say that she is my least favorite angel. That being said, I am pre-ordering a copy of this ASAP in hopes that Sony will see that it is in demand, and will release season five. I absolutely love Tanya Roberts in season five, so I will be eagerly await the release of season five. I was hoping four and five would come out together since it took so long. Sony, please do not make us fans wait another three years!!! Thanks for this release though!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad it's out","review":"I enjoy the 4th season of Charlies Angels. Adding Tiffany as an angel wasn't a bad choice, but a week one. She wasn't as strong as the other two. But yet, she added her own character into the show.My favorites of hers was when she went back to her alma mater and helped find the missing girls. Another one where she helped her friend whose husband was trying to kill her and especially where she and Kris learned to drive the big rigs. The other one was where there was someone after the Angels and Toni's boys had to help them out. That would have been a great spin off into a new show.Adding it to your collection would not be a bad thing, especially for those shows that I've listed above. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection...","review":"...but where o' where is season 5? I want to complete my set.

If the comedy was there, it was so subtle that I, and many others, missed it.In \\"Lost in Translation,\\" Bill Murray proved that he's still got it at this point in his career. \\"Life Aquatic\\" was a definite squandering of his considerable skills and a waste of everyone's time in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Bill Murry doing to his career???","review":"What has Bill Murry become???

Still, The Life Aquatic remains not so much a movie, but a series of bad sketches and cheap repetitive camera tricks, lined up consecutively on a DVD. Wes Anderson should have focused less on the film's hipster soundtrack and more on making the characters have at least a slight semblance to real people. Come on, you know your film is in trouble when a scene is so boring, you have to stick animals doing stupid things in the background to distract the audience from the pointless dialogue.

The real story is being told in much finer detail via innumerable one second shots. It is here where the characters' personalities are crafted into sharp focus. The broader jokes such as stealing the use of his rival's facilities, then robbing the equipment as he leaves are almost vulgar in comparison to Anderson's defter touches. But it all works to make a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exremely underrated","review":"This film is extremely underrated. As Rushmore and The Royal Tennebaums it's about fathers or paternal figures coming to terms with their resentful sons, but this one, even more than Rushmore, it's about trying to mantain your spirit as you grow old. The best scene: when Murray finds the jaguar shark and says \\"... I wonder if he remembers me\\", and everyone caresses him. The Sigur Ros song is a great touch.You know what: we will remember you Zissou, you're that great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taken with a grain of salt","review":"First off, you cannot take this movie seriously. It is what it is. This should be evident in the opening sequence of the movie when you watch a movie made by Steve Zissou with \\"real\\" fish that are flagrantly fake. In the movieverse they are real, but in reality they're just goofy. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Dark humor with deadpan jokes. If you get it, you really get it. This movie comes across as funny due to the fact that the characters take, with seriousness, all the stupidity going on around them. I don't want to paint this movie as just a screwball comedy, because it does have a plot, a point, and a message as well...but it's definitely worth watching. The DVD extras are also good and definitely do what a DVD should do, which is add content to the original movie that makes shelling out the cash worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"I know this movie doesn't appeal to everyone, but it's a damned good movie. Is it quirky? Oh, yeah - definitely. Quirky films can be tough. Usually they're either brilliant or so far out there that they're unwatchable.This one is brilliant and definitely worth watching.It's got a great script and a great cast. Bill Murray is perfect in the title role. I can't think of any other actor who would have been better in the part. Also especially good is Willem Dafoe. He's got a small part but he practically steals every scene he's in.This movie is definitely worth watching. Actually, I think it should be watched more than once. It's one of those movies that gets better each time you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou","review":"My favorite of Wes Anderson's movies.

Didn't really enjoy Rushmore or The Royal Tennenbaums. So I think it's a testament to the quality of this film that I really, really liked it. Anderson is getting more confident and creative, and I feel like his sense of humor (always dark and ironic) fits perfectly with Bill Murray's delivery.A very fun, silly movie.

At times you'll wonder how much of what drug would have to be consumed over what amount of time in order to get this screenplay as a result.Yet it's one of the most memorable films of the last few years.Bill Murray is hilarious as a poor man's Cousteau who seeks to destroy the sharks that ate his friend and colleague. Not only is the plot original, so is the dialogue. The humor is hidden at times but obvious if you follow the line of thought. Many of the jokes won't make a lick of sense to those who list \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" among their all-time favorites. The rest of the cast, including Owen Wilson, does a great job carrying the movie as well.If you like intelligently written humor, go rent a copy and enjoy it.

If you have absolutely nothing else you would rather be doing then watch it, but don't expect much in return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Only the most ardent Wes Anderson fan could sit through this film. It is an abomination. While at times cute and funny, it proves that Anderson is a sadist. He develops not one character toward a meaningful realization. Even the title character is something slightly more than a caricature.I loved Anderson for Rushmore. The Royal Tennenbaums was a pleasant diversion with a wonderful performance from Gene Hackman. In the space of four films, however, he has already begun to immitate himself and the immitation doesn't measure up to his obvious hero Hal Ashby.I'm an optimist. I think maybe the loss of Owen Wilson as a writing partner and the poor choice of Noah Baumbach as a replacement was perhaps the culprit in this failed effort. Hopefully he will learn from his mistakes by his next film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"There must have been many times during the filming of this movie when the director said to some cast member: \\"Go out there and say something...anything, just so it is not amusing and you utter it with a total lack of expression.

I happen to think this is Wes Anderson's best, most fully realized work. It's also one of the hardest films to try and explain to someone who hasn't seen it.

The variety of characters adds to the enjoyment and the visual tapestry is always interesting. And, of course, Bill Murray delivers an outstanding performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wes Anderson's worst","review":"I thought Bottle Rocket was very original and loved Rushmore and Royal Tennenbaums. Thus, I was eager to see Life Aquatic. Unfortunately, I found the movie to be utterly unenjoyable. Bill Murray is out of his element. The dialogue is silly, but rarely funny.

It's absent in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky is no substitute for funny","review":"I usually love Wes Anderson movies. This was disappointing. It was quirky for the sake of quirkiness.

I can see how some people gave it 1 star, I think it is a love it or hate it type movie. The soundtrack is also superb and matches the feel of the move perfectly -- ort of a modern 80's digital/indie mix.

It was recorded in a restaurant where Wes Anderson and his collaborator met to write the screenplay. There is all sorts of background noise from plates and forks clanging to people placing orders. I found this incredibly distracting. Also, they tended to talk about their relationship as collaborators instead of discussing what was happening on the screen. I really like this movie and saw it twice in the theaters but the commentary was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Great cast, great locations, visually appealing...

The product is described as a 2 disk, special edition but one disk. Also the title on the disk in inexplicably written in Japanese; yet, the menu and audio options are in English. Needless to say that description is as misleading as a wonderbra.

It just didn't hold my interest. Maybe the movie is brilliant because I sat through the whole thing waiting for the acting, or maybe the directing, or maybe the editing to begin. I'm not mad about being sucked in like that. There were some interesting parts . . . why else would I give it one star?I like David Bowie music and enjoyed the French acoustic versions of his songs sprinkled throughout the film, but the rest? It's too bad, because this is really a talented group . . . just a bit off for my taste on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I just rented this and wow, I want those two hours of my life back.

Believe me, saying that is as much of a surprise to me as anyone. I'm a longtime Bill Murray fan and really looked forward to finally viewing this movie. Not only do I generally love his films, but I also like Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson, so I thought this one was a sure thing. Boy was I wrong.To be blunt and to the point; the film is not funny, the dialogue is uninspiring, the actors don't illicit any emotional attachment to their character and the plot wears thin long before this 118 minute albatross finally comes in for a landing.My recommendation, pass on this one and go to the beach instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm not a big Bill Murray fan i have to admit but i am a Kate Blanchett fan so i rented this.There were a few funny moments of Calypso parody but overall i was pretty bored by the end.I usually enjoy low key comedy but this was just bad.Guess it's one pof those 'love it or hate it 'type of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Best To Put It?","review":"It could be said of this film that, under the guise of loosely connected, funny vignettes, it shines the klieg light of absurdity on supposedly - but not actually - serious matters; that it crafts a sardonic microcosm of life's misadventures, sometimes as a dryly humorous rhapsody, sometimes as light-hearted elegy; that it tries nothing more ambitious than to entertain with a string of offbeat, funny, but teleologically connected jokes that playfully pokes fun at itself and its audience.Or, it could be said that it is a really tedious piece of aspiring pomo bilge whose producers wasted a fine cast, to say nothing of having fleeced ten bucks from movie-goers nationwide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch This If You Have Trouble Sleeping!","review":"I like to think I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to movies. I love Bill Murray movies, getting hooked on his comedy stylings from Caddyshack, Meatballs, Stripes, and Scrooged.But this movie, which got a lot of acclaim started out with a lot of promise (the dolphin scene made me cry I laughed so hard). But from there it was a free-fall downhill and I found myself wishing for the ending to come along.Other reviewers found the claymation styling retro, and maybe I missed the point there, but I found the plot to be non-existent, and the actors seemed to be lost trying to figure out where their characters were supposed to be or do.Rent this movie, you'll thank me for saving you the money of a purchase.

This is usually just an act of defiance. Plus it draws attention to me at the yacht club gatherings. Yes, I am one of those people, the people you all hate.

We have broken pieces of plastic from each of the holders Seasons 1-4 because they are not made very well and hold the discs in strange ways. We were being as gentle as possible with them, especially after the first couple of breakages. It's just nearly next to impossible to get the discs out without breaking the holders.

Bought season's of 24 for 15 dollar's a piece at T*A*R*G*E*T which is more recent and more popular . What gives with the price of this show . Let's get to a fair price of 20 to 25 dollar's and will buy every season . The china bootleg's are tempting with fair prices for what you get but will wait for the US version to drop to fair prices .

I eventually had to just buy another copy of the series from amazon. Because the other company was overseas, I lost all the money I gave them. In hope to help YOU prevent making the same mistakes (or at least identifying the mistake if you've already made it), I put together this 5-min video to show you all the difference between the real DVD set (from Paramount) and the bootleg/fake ones that some Chinese people made to look as similar as possible.

The opening bulerias sets the tone for the entire program and both singers are in great form and are propelled by Paco's driving rhythmic playing.

I felt it.","review":"The Wisdom of Shepherds is something of a fairy for intelligent children of ALL ages-- It's for the old, but the young can read it too since the author was careful to avoid offensive language.It is a wisdom story, and as such it excels in imparting many important truths that are vital to a happy existence. I personally felt like I grew for having read it.The story is about an old man who spends every winter camping in a crumbling cottage. He is a shepherd. His life really isn't so bad, but it could be a lot better. One year he returns and finds two strangers in his cottage-- a destitute young woman and her poor child. He can't make them leave, but he doesn't know them, and he can't stay.A lot of wisdom is requires to resolve the situation. It is not a typical story in any sense-- the story line is utterly unique. Romance abounds, but not between the main characters. Good humor (really lol stuff) is found everywhere. There's also a tremendous amount of suspense and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wisdom of Shepherds!","review":"The Wisdom of Shepherds is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I think I ran across it here in the reviews and bought it on a whim. Good story, very readable. It has a strong plot, and I always enjoy that. It makes some great points about life as well. I found the characters to be irresistably likable. The story is very simple and good natured and anyone of any age can enjoy it. I guess it's sort of a fable. Anyway, I truly liked it, and I highly recommend The Wisdom of Shepherds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept Me Awake","review":"The plot in The Wisdom of Shepherds is so strong that I stayed awake until the wee hours reading it.

However, the bulk of of Akira's films are here and at the time writing this, many of the early ones are now available to dvd.

Are you smoking monometh??","review":"So, I've been meaning to read The Hero With A Thousand Faces for a long time, but only recently got around to it. Campbell's writing is pretty dry, and I'll admit that it was a bit of a struggle for me to read. At one point I lost my copy (under a pile of laundry), and thought I'd never finish it. Once I found it though, I kept pushing, and finally got through it. Just so you don't waste your time reading it *spoiler alert*: it's not actually about it a shapeshifter. It's just some dumb book. One star."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the stuff a thesis is made of.","review":"Wow. Campbell easily shows his points and has no toruble convincing you. Campbell focuses his ideas on religion and mythology, but you can easily see them applied elsewhere. I had read a paper on how Campbell's monomyth applies to Neo in The Matrix and the story is fairly well-known on how Campbell praised George Lucas's use of the hero's journey in Star Wars. This is a must read for an fan of the epic, and most literature majors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Involving.","review":"I picked up this book due to a recommendation from a video game story panel about character development. I am only about a quarter into the book and I'm soaking in so much. This is heavy material and I am enjoying taking my time to understand what Campbell has to say about character development through out time. I good study read for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Hypothesis, No Facts","review":"The good news is that Campbell asserts an interesting and provocative hypothesis: all hero myths have a common storyline. The bad news is that from the examples given in this book we'll have to take his word for it. While entertaining, the myths he uses as examples simply do not prove his point. Written in the middle of the 20th century, The Hero with a Thousand Faces uses Freudian and Jungian psychoanalysis to further his interpretation - something that today would inspire a few chuckles. Most readers encounter Campbell in college and believe it's a \\"profound\\" experience. It may be, and Campbell might be right, but only English and film school majors looking for plot lines and Psychology majors still needing a shot of Freud and Jung will be convinced by the evidence as presented in this book. I finished the book astonished that it had received the praise it has. The idea of the archetype is brilliant, the supporting evidence lacks rigor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hero with a Thousand Faces","review":"The book arrived on time. It was, as advertised, in \\"very good\\" condition. It did have a few (very few) yellow highlighted sections which were not indicated in the description, but, as I will be the professor using the book, this is not a major issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all been done before, or, life's rich pageant","review":"Campbell takes us through the tragedies, comedies, adventures and redemption that form a common thread through human stories. The archetypes have universal patterns to their struggles, and I began to see a reflection of the paths of Odysseus or Buddha or Jesus in my own life.Every life is a hero's journey, or can be if we choose to see it that way.However, while Campbell is obviously deep and brilliant, he can also be a bit wordy and dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opener","review":"Joseph Campbell has obviously done a lot of research on the topic of Mythology and its relationship to religion and society. I bought this book as a birthday gift for my brother and I'm going to order a copy for myself. He has a way of explaining the subject in such a way that you cannot help but find yourself turning page after page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I reading the same book as everyone else?","review":"After hearing about how so many writers were influenced by this work, I figured I'd take a look. And I just...don't get it. This thing is pretentious and bloated; it's full of metaphysics and discredited Freudian and Jungian psychology. It makes no attempt to connect with the reader; it just rambles on and reprints obscure myths and legends that have no real bearing on the subject of the book. I don't understand how anyone could find this book influential, or even coherent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, rather boring book.","review":"When I picked this book up, I realized that it wasn't a beach book, and this was not leisure reading. Unfortunately, I don't have time for non-leisure reading. The stuff I read in this book is fascinating, and a must have for any writer of epic/sci-fi/fantasy fiction, but I took it out of the library, and just didn't have time for it. Also, it probably would take many readings to retain all the knowledge in this book. A good one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Religion and Mythology students","review":"Every religion student should take the time to read this book. I loved it, I can't praise it enough. The linear form of the writing and the method Campbell uses of illistrating his theory through the use of myths from cultures all over the world make it an exceptionally easy to read piece of knowledge and wisdom.If you want to understand what star wars was all about and who Luke really was, read this book.If you simply want to expand your knowledge or want a non-fiction book to challenge your thinking, read this book.The concepts are easily understood, and the book is a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrambled Eggs","review":"This book seems it has plenty of good information in it. It just is NOT assembled in a form that is even remotely engaging. The storytelling is choppy and is hard to follow. I read the whole book (because I don't like to put one down once I've started) and suffered through the whole thing. Big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could only take reading a few pages of this book.","review":"Wow, this guy is way out there he is brilliant, but what is a pain is that he doen't follow any one story through when he is discribing it. He trows in so many different sotries, parables, ect. and jumps around I had a very difficult time following what he was saysing. The Keys section of his book is worth the price of the book, it is about 4 pages long. And really good, I wish he could write the way he did in that section in the whole book, but unfortunately he did not. You have to be way way way into mythology to be able to make sense out of this book. Good Luck! I agree with the fisrt revewier, rent the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Reading","review":"This should be the most interesting book ever written - after all, it purports to summarize myths across cultures with a mononmyth theory as the unifying force. The problem is in the execution, and probably the underlying theory, which is certainly out-dated. Campbell writes poorly. He is hard NOT to put down. And so, alas, as with earlier editions, I could not even plod through this tome. It is useless to my understanding of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perennial classic but outmoded","review":"This is a perennial classic and as such will continue to sell, but its contents have been repudiated time and again by Campbell's fellow academics. It is good to see that the Introduction to the 2004 Commemorative Edition has been eliminated; it was totally unnecessary and almost constituted a book in itself by the sycophantic Dr. Estes. Campbell's obsession with seeing the entire world and all of life through Freudian psychobabble is a discredited approach to mythology that insults most of the civilizations and religions he attacks or tries to undermine. Mythology does not occupy the modern mind or any facet of sociology today except in the ravings of lunatics and prison inmates, for most of whom a sense of identity has been severed from the rest of the human race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero Of A Thousand Feces","review":"This is a good general introduction to the barest basics of mythography, recommended for jr. highschool students or adults wanting to get their feet wet before diving into actual texts and theory.However, this book is no more than a New-Age philosophy manual - far closer to Deepak Chopra than the works of say, Roger Loomis.This is best for Star Wars-headed armchair 'mythologists' i.e. hobbyists with no true inkling of what the research of cultural evolution is all about. If you're looking for a quick fix to your 'deeper' questions about Star Trek and Hobbits, or a framework for your million-dollar Hollywood script project, this is for you!If you are serious about mythograhy, however, you'd better get a serious grip on linguistics and begin tackling the extant texts in their original languages. Any other approach is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written","review":"This book isn't very good-the author is very naive and needs to take notes from C.S. Lewis-a fellow whom shared the same degree and taught the same classes. Joseph Campbell is no good... read C.S. Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mea culpa","review":"This is one of these books that I would love to pretend to have read and enjoyed. Alas, pretending is not my forte. I would read this book only if I were forced to. Try the Christopher Vogler version instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed the way I view the World","review":"Ok, this is the big one! Joseph Campbell's \\"The Hero With A Thousand Faces\\" is a revolution in the field of Anthropology of Religion. His lucid study of Mythology has literally changed the way the world views ITSELF. Ok I'm sorry I don't want to overstate things, but I don't think I am. If you read this book and actually understand what he is saying you wont be the same.Campbell has found the creative archtypes found throughout history in the mythologies of all cultures. There is an excellent blend of classical psychology as well as Occidental and Oriental Mythology references.If you have never read Joseph Campbell and you love Mythology BUY THIS BOOK! Buy the POWER OF MYTH and watch the video with Bill Moyers.Joseph Campbell is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"See Things Differently","review":"All of life is a journey and we our the hero, so learn to see how you are creating the metaphors around you and how to interpret them through the concepts and work of Joseph Campbell. Joseph Campbell understood group consciousness before it became a religion - I appreciate his facts and knowledge behind his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure with a Thousand Cheers!","review":"For those who enjoy shadowing the hero's walk through mythology across time and space, then this call to adventure wiil not disappoint. Campbell discussed hero mythologies in a multicultural context highlighting the symbols and meaning shared by diverse peoples. He storytells and explains. Campbell does explore concepts and beliefs in-depth; therefore, you may want to digest certain sections before reading further. The hero's venture and passage is one we have all taken; Campbell reminds us how awesome the journey is. This is a \\"keeper\\" for a home library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read In Understanding Existence","review":"This book is nothing short of brilliant. One of my favorite reads of all-time. This book is deep, long and sometimes complicated. Campbell displays his pure genius with his wealth of knowledge of all the known myths and legends of the world and how these stories play into the fabric of human existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"It changes lives","review":"Consider for a minute, every movie that has ever touched your heart, every story that still moves you, or every hero/heroine that has inspired you. Every bit of magic in the world of story telling that you could not define or articulate. This is the logic behind it. And the logic in itself, is magical.This book makes every goosebump make sense. It will make you smile in recognition or gasp at the recall, and all in all, you see how the hero's journey is not just applicable to a Harry Potter or Luke Skywalker, but to your own life . This is not for people who are looking to be spoonfed, or who like their knowledge with a big dose of fun and excitement. Yes, it is pedantic, and it is long winded, but if you are patient, and do not require special effects to understand transformation of the spirit, this book will find a permanent place in your book shelf and you will feel rejuvenated everytime you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Campbell","review":"The book is good and full of examples of heros with a thousand faces. He gives in my opinion too many examples that the heros are almost always the same and they follow a pattern. The book was so informative that now when I read a book or see a movie, I notice they are following the same patterns that Mr. Campbell explains. I believe it was just a too many examples but it provides a great deal of information. This book gives information in not only Greek, but Asian cultures as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A twentieth-century hero","review":"This isn't a review as such; there are many comprehensive reviews of this book. What I would like to reiterate is that The Hero with a Thousand Faces is a seminal book of the twentieth century. As a writer of religious fiction, the works of Joseph Cambell have been indispensable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freud & Jung applied to mythology?","review":"The table of contents is the best part of the book. It outlines the stages a hero goes through on the path to enlightment, and agrees with our intuitions of how a hero develops.The main problem is that Campbell uses Freud and Jung to justify his theory of the hero. These theories are outdated and make it very difficult for anyone trained in psychology to take seriously. Moreover, the writing style is boring and the long examples combined with Freudian analyses belabor points and make the book drag on longer than it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"The modern day \\"Golden Bough\\"","review":"This book reminds me of Frazer's \\"Golden Bough\\" or Graves' \\"The White Goddess\\". Both of those books (and Campbell's) have in common that they have a grand unified theory of mythology and marshall lots of examples to support them. They also have in common that they are so interesting that it would be cool if they were true! Another thing they seem to have in common is that they distort the original myths to fit their theory and thus aren't accepted by experts in the field. The world of myth isn't really much simpler that the real world, so no simple theory will ever be able to account for anything but a small fraction of it.These books are useful if you want to tell a story according to their formulas, but don't mistake them for good scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Example of Joseph Campbell's Poor Scholarship","review":"There is a major problem with Joseph Campbell's works regarding mythology: his claim that there is an overarching mytheme that transcends cultures is demonstrably false. Joseph Campbell is very good at EDITING myths (for example Sir Gawain and the Green Knight) to make it fit HIS mystical beliefs. One would be better served by ordering tapes on mythology supplied by the Teaching Company.There is a good reason why Sarah Lawrence College refused to accept Joseph Campbell's papers for archival purpuses (and at varience with its policies): his work is regardaded as New Age garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Remarkable content.

He spends chapters on concepts that could have been said in one or two sentences.Based strongly on the outdated material from Sigmund Freud, this book uses a lot of his concepts and theories that have been completely discredited.

How sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book on yoga","review":"I have never found a better book on yoga anywhere. This book is written by a great teacher who came from India. It has a comprehensive set of yoga postures, breathing excercises and meditation. The only flaw in the book is that one should study under a teacher. For those who cannot find a teacher or would rather work alone, I strongly suggest working with inner guides. A good book on this is The Inner Guide Meditation, or a similar book. A teacher is necessary, because contrary to what others may say, yoga and other spiritual excercises do work. They work for anyone who has the time and patience to do the excercises even for a short time. Results may take years to come, but they do come. But given a teacher to see the results through which can be frightening at times, this is an excellent book and I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly thorough..maybe not so good for newbies","review":"It took me pretty long to get through this book because the material is so dense.

To see Vishnu's hands and feet uncoordinatedly splayed in all directions is simultaneously comical and sad. Like many people from India, he is very supple. Unfortunately, he also seems to have very little awareness inside his body. And body positions without mental involvement are the antithesis of yoga. Besides Iyengar's, check out Vanda Scaravelli's book. She once said to me, \\"Yoga is the religion of the spine.\\" Vishnu's spine is supple; but again, without awareness. When I used to teach yoga, I would bring this book to class as an example of how NOT to do the asanas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very old yoga","review":"This book in my opinion is great. It's not as illustrated as i had hoped (it's in b+w). But it has pictures for everything it talks about and so that's good.

When I finally received the book in the mail I did have a pretty good time reading the first part of the first story. It was very original and the world building was better than I'd seen in years. But. It kind of got stuck right there. The second half of the story was a let down and the other stories in this collection didn't grab me at all.

A little too creepy. I mean a witch finding her way in the dark with a wand lit by human skulls, etc. Teenagers and kids a little older it is fine. But recommendations for kids 4-6 years old?

How hard is it to translate correctly the story that already written?

The book was very good- delivered on its promise to teach Java Beans. I have the following observations:1) Never came out and said exactly what a Java Bean is- a component that can be manipulated in a visual builder. The Beans spec addresses the mechanism by which a Bean exposes its features to the Builder. The book covers additional material, which *should* be covered, but never makes clear what makes a Bean a Bean.2) Stuffed (padded?) with examples.3) Section on Introspection was not as clear as it could have been. I downloaded the Beans spec from the Sun site, and that helped fill in the gaps.Overall, I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This is a very good book well worth the money.

If you just want to know the ins-and-outs of building a bean, testing the bean, creating a JAR file, and loading and calling the JAR file in an application, this book is shockingly lacking in that most vital of information needed by a beginner JavaBean writer. Worse yet, the book is hopelessly out of date. The Bean Development Kit it uses for testing beans is no longer supported by Sun Microsystems.

The book builds you up for that but only leaves you with one short chapter on the topic near the end.

In my opinion the authors exhibit a personal vindictiveness against \\"white Americans\\".My understanding has always been that the West was hard won. \\"White Americans\\" ventured west searching for a chance to a better life just like any people do today.The authors ramble on with out any footnotes to historical documents to support their claims.

While America's history includes actions that would draw criticism if weighed against current values, I don't think it is appropriate to apply modern values when judging leaders of our past in a textbook.

The story of a whiny housewife who gets fired up over mediocre things her 'oh so evil' mother in law does to drive her crazy. There was not one incident in the story that was dramatic enough to be the least bit entertaining, or humorous at that. I hate to put it this way, but before you commit to reading this book you may want to open it up to the back sleeve and look at the picture of the FABULOUS author Jane Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Lose-Lose","review":"This book spoke to me because I have been in a sort of standoff with my son's girlfriend for a few years now when I consider myself to be a most tolerant and accepting person! She's not his wife (yet) but still this book, with its descriptions of very raw exchanges between the mother-in-law and her son's wife, was valuable. It caused me to evaluate my own situation in a new way (though no solution suddenly came to me) and reflect on myself and my own words and actions in a very awkward and wrenching situation. A standoff with any family member is always a lose-lose and the most valuable thing that's lost is time spent together. The two women at war in this book are depicted in very realistic language and I found myself cheering both of them on to a resolution which comes about in a most surprising way for them. This book is a testament to both human flaws and human triumph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately held my attention","review":"This was a great read! The story was a unique look at a common issue. What I really found interesting was looking at the evolution of the relationship between daughter and mother-in-law and the admission of the main character that she may not have always been right in her reasons for not liking Mrs. Cooper. What I found a bit patronizing was that whenever Ellie would regress to a little girl when she really needed to stand up to her mil, was that the early death of Ellie's mother was always dredged up as the reason why she \\"inacted\\" in those situations. That became hard to believe of a single, successful, woman about town who would somehow regress into duh-ville over her mil.All in all, having had a mother in law or two in my life, I could identify with if not the specific instances, the sentiments and the pressure it can put on a marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"the other woman","review":"This is a book about the dynamics of relationships between family members and close friends. The central character is a female named Ellie who is looking for the love of family and friends. Something she has never had either of in her life. There is a lot of bellyaching and moaning about how demanding her mother-in-law is. How bad her life has always been. The love hate relationship she has with her BFFs. I found myself wanting to tell her to shut up and get on with it, that what she is experiencing is what you call \\"life\\". Yeah and in the end they all come together and are one happy family.

She finds the man of her dreams, gets married and then realizes she is also married to the other woman- her mother-in-law. I won't say this book is unpredictable but it will have you reading well into the night to finish it. The characters in the Other Woman are almost three dimensional and you will root for Ellie as she tries to sort out married life, in-laws, babies, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Jane, what's happened?","review":"I figured The Other Woman had to be better than To Have and To Hold - but I was wrong! Talk about boring... let's see, would you want to read about 1. a woman who admits she has no friends outside of work colleagues, 2. a doormat of a main character who can't get up the nerve to keep her annoying mother-in-law at bay, 3. a husband who is so weak he can't tell his mother to mind her own business, 4. a storyline so bland, so downright boring that all any chapter contains is the wishy washy thoughts about Linda, a mother who needs to be put in her place? And it's not just the topic, the writing is also devoid of interest. Please, Jane, skip the married stories and return to where you came from - your singleton tales were so much more enjoyable and witty. At this point your books are like your character's relationships - stale, staid and not the least bit enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not-so-plain Jane","review":"Love that Jane Green.

Ellie could not have been more annoying, she really was a spoiled,miserable brat who seemed to whine through the whole book, she didn't like anything, what a bore she was!!!When I read the cover I thought it would be fun to read about the trangressions of the mother-in -law,but there really weren't any, she never really caused any grief ,she liked Ellie right away ,she just wasn't an unlikable person.This book was boring & silly, no real drama, no real laughs, I think if I read another Jane Green book it will be from the library!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't strand the main character!","review":"I love reading Brit lit, and in particular, Chick Brit Lit, but over the course of this book, I grew to hate the main character Ellie.

It got to the point where I started sympathizing with the antagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is Jane Green's worse. There is nothing going on and I could care less about any of the characters. The book, I guess, is about Ellie not liking her \\"controling\\" mother-in-law. Well, I see nothing wrong with the mother-in-law. What grandmother does not want to see and hold their grandchild? Ellie gets way to emotional about the stupidest things. This character really gets on my nerves. I am stuggling to finish it but I hope the ending is her husband dumps her and she is all alone wishing she had the \\"controling\\" mother-in-law back.

I have read her other novels, some good mixed in with average, and this is the worst. She redeemed herself with Jemima J which is why I decided to read her latest. What a waste of time. I finished it because I hate not finishing books but it was a trial. Ugh. Also, I would hate to see any of her readers take any parenting advice from the main character in her book!

For a better author, try Marian Keyes!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read but pretty unfunny","review":"I really liked \\"Jemima J\\" and since the reviews said this book was so funny, I ran out and bought it since I had a horrific experience with an old boyfriend's mother. However, this woman seemed mild to me compared to many mother-in-laws out there, and the whole marriage dissolving in the book was very unfunny to me. In fact, the entire book wasn't funny at all, although I'd say it was an easy read. The main character struck me as an overreacting whiner! Also, the book just kind of depressed me and made me glad I choose not to have kids. I don't recommend the book if you're looking for a fun and light read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop preaching....","review":"I really wanted to like this bookI have always been a fan of Jane Green, but there is something sanctimonious about her voice in this book that is a complete turnoff. First, the mother-in-law is a pain, but stop whining about it already. The main character is also very preachy to me about her parenting skills. Lastly, I did not like the \\"thank god i am not single\\" theme that played throughout the book. Where is the author that reveled in being single? Both choices in life should be praised, whether you are married or single.I was not impressed. The last two Jane Green books have left much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again.","review":"This book left a sour taste in my mouth.

I would not recommend this book to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible book with annoying characters","review":"I generally like Jane Green, but this was probably the worst book I ever read. I only finished it because I kept thinking it would get better, or there would be an awesome turn at the end. There wasn't. It was impossible to feel any empathy or even like for the main character because she was so passive and wishy washy. Ick. And her love-story with her husband was pathetic. You were supposed to feel like they were in love, but there was just nothing there. All of the characters lacked depth.Overall, the book just made me feel tense. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many times did you roll your eyes during this book?","review":"I have read several of Jane Green's books, and although some of them have unrealistic parts in them, they are usually at least enjoyable. This book was horrible to read. The \\"evil\\" mother-in-law was nowhere close to how she was described on the back of the book. This is what is written:\\"Ellie's problems have just began. When she discovers she is pregnant, she realizes that Linda has only been rehearsing for the real takeover\\".What takeover? All Linda did was buy the baby a bunch of toys and clothes, show up at the hospital when her FIRST GRANDCHILD was about to be born, offer to babysit and give them a free vacation to the south of France. She may have dropped the baby, which was totally unrealistic, but it was an ACCIDENT.I could go on and on, but I will just say that I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I am a huge Jane Green fan, and just finished this book, The Other Woman. It is interesting to see a pattern develop in Green's plots, cheating husbands and possible cheating husbands, divorce and possible divorce, the other man, and with all the foreshadowing you can see each plot twist coming from a mile away. This book also moves at a really fast pace, but not necessarily in a good way. You turn the page and the next thing you know, months have gone by, and the narrorator is bringing us up to speed on what happened during that time span. I don't mean to sound so critical, I just would have liked to see something new in terms of a plot, and at a slower pace.The climax of the book is good, and once I got there, I literally could not put the book down until I finished it. I just would have liked the book more if it wasn't so predictable. But overall, it was a fun, very light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story","review":"This was not the absolute best Jane Green book, but it was pretty relatable. Everyone has people that come into their life that comes on a little too strong or has problems with an in-law, this book is just an extreme example of that. The whole story is a bit far fetched in many ways, but it's entertaining and a fun book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Other Woman\\" and thought it was a good book. It held my interest and I liked the way the book ended by taking care of all the loose ends. I think Jane Green is a very enjoyable author and will continue to read all of her books.But, I did wish the book was more up beat and light like Mr Maybe and Jemima J. I found this book insightful and made you think about family relationships, but it lacked the escapism and fun of her other books. I felt like she sat down to write this when she was really angry at her husband and/or mother-in-law. I hope her next book is more like Mr Maybe and more lighthearted. This was a serious and mature Jane Green."},{"rating":"1","title":"The main character was whiney and annoying","review":"The mother in law was overbearing, no doubt about that. However, I rarely found myself empathizing with Ellie at all. She overreacted to everything her mother did.

He pushed it around for a while and then went on to other things, but usually came back to the truck for further pushing around!

This not just about a young kid dealing with sexuality. I believe the book is more about Robin coming to terms with his life, sexuality being only a small portion of what he learns.

It seems pieced up, haphazardly and you can't really get over with the main character... or any character for that matter. The idea was good but it was so poorly constructed that I ended up crying for the trees butchered to make the paper for the book, and every single penny I wasted on this.

The story is so honest and real, that it moved me much much more than many recent gay novels. The story is multi-faceted and highly emotional, but it never puts you off.

Now that he is bigger we just switched the seats around and he can sit up and seems to still enjoy it alot, and since my daughter is getting close to 3 years old soon we will just go back to using it as a single jog-type stroller.This accessory was a life saver!

The initial set-up was quick and I was quite happy with the firmness and the fact that it was the size/height of a normal bed. After a few hours the bed had noticeably deflated, not all the way, but enough that it was unusable. I checked for holes but couldn't find any. I inflated it fully, and a few hours later encountered the same problem. I contacted Aero and the person I spoke to suggested either of the 2 valves could be the cause, and that it wouldn't necessarily be obvious. The bed is also fairly heavy when deflated and as such wouldn't be as easily portable as I had imagined if traveling.

I was very embarrassed to say the least and felt terrible that their overnight stay at my house wasn't a restful one.

I have no issue with religion, but I seriously question George W. Bush's legitimacy as a leader let alone a spiritual one. This book is not about spirit, but about religion and only one side of religion. The author tries to paint a picture of a just and moral character in the context of near Christian fundamentalism.I have no problem with that, except the assertion that it is the way and not a way amoung other ways. It is hard for me to vision George W. Bush, as much more than someone born with an enormous silver spoon with someone always available to show him the way. If you are skeptic of fundamentalism and its message, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush as a spiritual person?","review":"The title itself is unintentionally funny.

It fails to mention how he believes in capital punishment and is actually in the Guinness Book of World Records for putting to death more inmates (152) than any other governor in US history. Where did this author get some of this stuff? Bush has used religion to propel him into power. He is not a Christian because he is not in any way Christ-like. He hijacked our Lord and Savior. He is an occupier of innocent countries, a killer of innocent people, and he will, in the end, destroy the reputation of Christianity as a whole. How much did Bush pay this author for this book?

Where's the witch hunt now?How can anyone call this man spiritual when all he does is destroy the freedom and spirit this country was founded on?

When you hear it, you have to keep in context the time it was made, 1984.George Orwells Future Shock had come to be. \\"Blinded Me with Science\\" was a hit record, you get the picture. Stanley was echoing the time period and with fantastic results.

We meet Inspector C.D Sloan of the Calleshire CID, as he tries to solve a baffling murder of a nun at a convent. Soon, he discovers that someone was doing some cross-dressing, and that a group of boys had help in stealing a habit for a bonfire to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day. It isn't really bad, but the dialogue has an empty feel, and it seems like Aird is still finding her voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing but not Monotonous","review":"Robin Bailey is laconic. I generally prefer quicker--or perhaps I should say, lighter--readers (Ian Carmichael, Rosemary Leach) but there is something hypnotically pleasant about listening to Robin Bailey's deep voice. You can picture him raising his eyebrows over some of Sloan's dialog.In typical Aird fashion, the dialog is often quite cryptic and the mystery is somewhat thin. If you like mysteries for the clues, the red herrings, the complex puzzle building, Aird is not for you. If, however, you enjoy irony and the fine sketches of various personalities (in the context, of course, of a murder), Aird is a good choice.Recommendation: I'm a firm believer that readers make all the difference in the enjoyment of an audiotape. If you've never heard Robin Bailey before, check one of his audios out of the library first."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"If you like strong and cheeky heroines, FATAL ERROR is for you.

In every one of them she builts the characters and the plot nicely and makes for a very convincing stoy. The romance falls in line with the plot so is very believable, and there is as much romance as suspense. No steaming erotic sex scenes, not that they are missed.

It appears to be tied up with VS team system, so if you are a home or small business who is unfamiliar with tem system then you may have problems.I contacted Wiley Customer Support, but they just told me the code works and provided nothing helpful.I will not be buying any more Wrox / Wiley books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough, non-stop, monotonous instruction!","review":"The instructor does explain everything VERY thoroughly, in extremely slow and excruciating detail; in fact, she never stops talking. At all. I like exercise videos and would like to try Pilates but the non-stop monotone drone of the instructor is really irritating. Each exercise is done very slowly while she explains what to do and anything and everything anyone could possibly do wrong. I made it through about 20 minutes of the video before giving in and tossing it out. Not for those with limited patience or looking for a workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Any College Basketball Fan","review":"Joan Mullen's book is an eye-opening experience for the typical college basketball fan. She looks past all of the hype surrounding one of the game's greatest coaches and gets down to his true passion: The success and development of the young men trusted to his care. This is great book and illustrates the many facets of Coach Knight. I highly recommend it, especially for those of you who have already read Feinstein's book, A Season on the Brink. This book offers a more objective approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just does not work","review":"Painting in the tub should be easy enough, right? But this toy simply does not work.

A complete waste of time and money. Plus the foundation of this pseudo-doctor's feeding regime is the Pottinger Cat Study. This is an antequated study from the 1930's that had no controls. Reading it, any nutritionist worth their salt would know the diet Pottenger fed lacked taurine which caused his problems. Why doesn't Dr. Yarnall? Now, we have that and much more in today's food. How else can generations of cats reproducing year after year and living long heathly lives on commercial diets.

It's a great sleep aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"First of all avoid what WAS their website","review":"You can't do any real setting unless you visit their website, via the gamepad.

Not very easy to program the buttons if you want to switch them... you will have to do it threw your games keyboard layout to switch them... so that kinda sucked. Also my b (back up key) dose not work at all...has to be a defective keyboard button but the rest work.

Oh and fyi the instructions are so vague, goodluck understanding em. I think my 6 yr old niece could have done a better job writing the instructions. Do yourself a favor and avoid this piece of junk at all costs. Buy a nostramos n52 pad not as many buttons, but much much better over all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too large and space wasted below movement keys","review":"I tried out the Fang with Call of Duty 4 and returned it after a long weekend. My main complaint is that there are no buttons directly below the movement pad. These keys are easily accessible on a standard keyboard, but the area is wasted space here. In addition, the movement keys are oversized so you really have to reach for other buttons, especially the numbered buttons which feel a bit separated from the movement keys. The 3 keys on either side below the movement keys are nicely sized, but are too close to the palm to be easily reached with the thumb and too far down to reach with a finger. I'm a lefty, so another annoyance was that the two left side buttons are both mapped to the \\"n\\" key, essentially making one useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gaming accessory","review":"In my opinion, the Fang definitely does not fall into the \\"must have\\" category of PC accessories... but it sure is nice to have one! The keys are soft and comfortable and the response time is good. It doesn't have that clicky feedback you get from your keyboard but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The button placement is great and the ZEngine software is very nice (if a little prone to startup crashes). The Fang could theoritically be a great accessory for gamers on the go because it is far superior to any integrated laptop keyboard. However, in practice, it is a little too big to qualify as a portable accessory. Then again, if you are already lugging around a 15-20lbs gaming laptop then I don't see why you'd have problems adding this one to your backpack (or trailer). All in all, I am very happy with the Fang."},{"rating":"2","title":"great even for laptops","review":"I use this with my laptop with the geforce 7800, I was tired of my hands getting so warm on the keyboard and this was the perfect answer, playing HL-ep 1 was such a better experience with the fang:)its a solid peripheral for any gamer looking for an alternative to standard W,A,S,D keyboard configurations. The variety of buttons allow players to get much more done without taking a hand away from the movement keys, and a smart arrangement of convex and concave surfaces prevent fingers from getting lost while reaching for a specific key."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game pad.","review":"The Fang Gamepad was great. It is very hard to get use to like all game pads. The only problem I had was that if you are pressing forward and left strafe key at the same time and attempt to press the 2 key, it does not work. Other than that, the arrow keys are a little too large for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes gaming easier and much more fun","review":"This Gamepad is very easy to format for your favorite games. It's handy and much easier to use than a keyboard. The price is very reasonable as well. Once you install it (simply insert cable into a USB port), you will be up and running in minutes. You will never want to go back to a keyboard after trying this. Your scores and your gaming enjoyment will both increase with this gamepad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fang Gamepad by Ideazon","review":"I bought this as a gift and it seems to have many functions at a fantastic price-especially through Amazon!

The author tries to suggest that Native Americans were just as \\"human\\" or destructive of the land as western people. Um....has he seen the land lately, it's a little changed since the English first arrived. It's mostly gone, covered with asphalt, and the animals? They are gone too. Of course they used the land they we human beings but to suggest that they were of the same mind as those that followed is a reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING BOOK","review":"If American Indians were so morally righteous and deeply in tune with nature, then why do the ideologues that espouse this fiction demonize tobacco? Didn't Europeans learn the ways of tobacco-smoking from the purest race on earth? Here's what's going on. Said ideologues hate white people even though they themselves may be white. Anything non-white is pure and holy. Anything European or Christian is evil. Hence, we have a body of myths about Indians promulgated in the name of truth. This book shatters them with the tomahawk of historical fact. Read about the American Indians' penchant for destroying vast tracts of land by setting forest fires. Did you know they hunted buffalo by driving entire herds of the beasts off cliffs? This book will set you free from PC lies. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad History","review":"I notice that the earlier review of 'learned' E. N. Anderson is very careful in maintaining a politeness to 'learned' Dr. Krech. Both men, however, seem to be victims of their education. The book is indeed biased. It will be welcomed by all those who wish to corroborate their mindset belief that the Native Americans were an inferior race who needed to be pushed aside by the superiority of Western culture. For the reader who sincerely seeks out truth, I would suggest these books: Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond; A Peoples History of the United States by Howard Zinn; Lies My Teacher Told Me by James W. Loewen; and The Only World We've Got by Paul Shepard."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your time","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is written with a prominent agenda - debunking the myth of an ecologically friendly, noble native. Unfortunately, the author uses white stereotypes to make his case rather than presenting firm evidence to support his claims. There can be little doubt that native peoples had an effect on their environment. However, to suggest as the author does, that it was on a scale equal to that of euro settlers is just plain stupidity. Native peoples didn't practice ecological principles, they were too busy trying to survive off the land that gave them everything. Because of that, they were truly connected to the land; something no non-native can possibly claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Myth, not a lot of history","review":"Not much to say about this type of thing without becoming overly political.

I own a jukebox and have about 1,000 45's and didn't particularly like it. If our hero had been my age (60), liked all 50's music, then I might have identified with him and his story. Instead he was a 30's something with a yuppy mentality searching for a holy grail that doesn't exist except in his own mind. I empathized with his sadness about the loss of a bygone era, but that was about it. He threw in a part about searching for the real Elvis and here is where I thought he really missed his mark. It would be like me writing about Rudolph Valentino with no first hand knowledge of the man. Nothing was learned here. I also got tired of his political commentary along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't teach myself to sing","review":"I didn't know at the time, but I thought I could actually teach myself to sing so I bought this book. Maybe if you play the piano or you are very talented, that is possible, but nothing beats taking lessons. In stuff such as acting, dancing, or singing, it is very difficult to learn by reading. These things are usually learn by doing since they all involve movement of some sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the trouble","review":"This was bought for my 12 year-old son for Christmas.

Then he tried his brother's amp and it worked in that one if it was plugged in just so. After a few months use and it completely does not work. NEVER will I buy another instrument off the internet! I have to see it and try it out. It is worth the extra money to buy a good one with a name you can trust. All my son got for Christmas is an amp and a guitar that I couldn't even sell for parts. Keep in mind too the return policy on this puppy is thirty days and if it poops out after that too bad. Oh wait, they'll email you ways you could trouble shoot to fix it. DON'T BUY THIS.

I was introduced to the wonderful world of Eric Whitacre during a relaxation session in concert choir. I'm hooked.The harmonies are incredible! Everything is incredible beyond that of any word of my vocabulary could describe. The chords are so unusual and are seldom heard even in the choral environment. And although the chords may seem to clash at first, they are so phenomenally well written into the songs, making them true works of art.What I admire the most about this album is that the lyrics are text-based, often from poetry.

I heard a sampling of Eric Whitacre's Cloudburst on NPR while driving home during the fall.

Admittedly, it had been a long day, the commute wasn't that great, and I had been going through some personally stressful ordeals, but Eric's music was totally captivating and uplifting in a way I have rarely experienced. I just got the CD yesterday and spent the morning listening to it. I'm not particular overwhelmed with a couple of the arrangements including the change in the title track Cloudburst, but overall, the CD has fulfilled my expectations as a moving and beautifully performed artwork.

The weight of the tool is too light for smooth planing, any experienced woodworker knows that a heavier plane tends to control chattering resulting in smoother cuts. If you try to flatten the sole the pot metals quickly clogs the stone or sandpaper. After awhile even when the sole has been flatten, it starts to bow back.

It features a classic Steel Cage encounter between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Mr. McMahon, which features many cool surprises and twists. Also, A Last Man Standing Match between Mankind and The Rock. This is also a great match, with both guys taking some sick looking bumps. Also included is an Intercontinental Title Match between Ken Shamrock and Val Venis, a semi mixed tag team match with X-Pac and HHH taking on Kane and Chyna. The Tag Team titles were on the line as Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett defended against Mark Henry and D-LO Brown.

Match 5:Val Venis vs. Shamrock an ok match nothing special. Match 6:HHH and X-Pac vs. Kane and Chyna a awsome tag team match with a good ending. Match 7:The Rock vs. Mankind last man standing for the WWF Title by far best match of the night. Match 8: Stone Cold vs. Vince McMahon a good match but not the best cage match i've ever seen.

I could have gone to a bar on the right night and seen better action.

Bought this new one and absolutely hated it. The old one had a lever to choose intensity of water flow -- new one doesn't have that. The old one was pretty straight so when in the holder the water would spray diagonally; new one is curved so when in the holder the water sprays straight down and you have to be standing directly under the shower head.

All I have to say is that I stayed up and watched the whole thing. It wasn't until I heard Pedro Eustache playing one of Yanni's compositions 'Enchantment' that I became a hardcore Yanni fan. Gave me goosebumps. Amazing. Then I went out and bought all of Yanni's albums. Can't get enough. If you are or not a fan of Yanni GET THIS ONE. You will NOT be disappointed. But watch out.

There are tons of special affects and the music is faster paced but I found the power of the orchestra lacking. There is no substitute for sheer numbers of instruments. Its a video that is worth watching especially on Blu-Ray. You can tell that the whole performance is not shown and there must be some parts that were cut.

Alas, the man decided instead to release \\"The Concert Event\\" on blu-ray. And this one is just as good as the other, although the format here is some departure from \\"Acropolis\\".In Acropolis Yanni plays with the backing of a large Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra in a show tailored to the taste of Greek aristocrats (and their counter parts else where)- the ghost of Plato was milling in the crowd. This concert, which follows years later, incorporates a number of exotic musical instruments and musicians selected to give it an international flair. The tempo is often upbeat. All of which may be a good thing. After all there is no point buying two concerts that are nearly identical in all aspects.The DVD version of this concert is very good in both video and audio quality but playing the blu-ray on HDTV is visually more pleasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but","review":"Good but, I wish the Acropolis was in Blue Ray at a similar price.

As a fan of sci-fi and shows like Lost, I thought this will do in between seasons of Lost. However, the writing on this show basically sucks. I can't count how many times I rolled my eyes during the pilot episode alone. The story is contrived, predictable, and just plain stupid. The characters lack common sense and it's like they throw in every cliche out there. Seriously, what sane person will issue a restraining order on his missing wife, mother of his child, who's returned after 11 years??? Watching this was like watching an episode of Jerry Springer, where you just want to shake the people because they are so dumb. I couldn't even bring myself to watch the second disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich premise, poorly executed","review":"I've only seen the pilot and the second episode, but so far I'm not as impressed as I had hoped. Though the idea is loaded with possibilities, the execution is poor, from clunky dialog that lurches from the absurd to the trite (what little girl would say, when referring to the rain, \\"It's only a light shower\\"?)o poor acting and X-Files-like stories. There's an interesting and recent French movie called \\"They Came Back.\\" You might call it an anti-zombie film about what would happen if the dead rose up from their graves and returned to their towns. They haven't decomposed or anything like that; they're as they were just before they died. How would society reintegrate them?The 4400 pointlessly complicates the interesting questions posed by the premise, by giving the returnees special powers that, naturally, work against them.

Big mistake.I must admit though that I watched the first 4 episodes and with so much to do and better shows to watch, I never cared to watch the last 2, so maybe the final 2 episodes gave viewers some answers as to what exactly was happening with The 4400 and the ones from that group that you actually get to know.But they dragged it so much that by the third episode, you just want to know and are no longer interested in the stories of these freaks.Also, the main characters who were working to find out what the hell was going on were not very interesting.I'd recommend these 5 shows over The 4400 any day:24, Nip/Tuck, Lost, Alias, and The O.C. (which is great if you like young hotties).24 is so much more intriguing. Nip/Tuck is so much more fun. Lost has great characters and Alias is just really cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scifi series; DVD version reasonably priced","review":"I didn't manage to catch the start of The 4400 when it appeared on USA.

I've heard it likened to the X Files, but there really is no comparison: The X Files story structure ended up depending on Scully being a total moron (given all the evidence of this, that, or the other thrown at her every week, only an idiot wouldn't believe...) There's none of this silliness in The 4400; the characters react sensibly to the reality they face."},{"rating":"1","title":"More unhealthy Cult Entertainment....","review":"I am tierd of all these second generation X-Files/Men in Black turn them into stupid television programs. The concept is stupid, the acting is very very second rate, the production values are even below Roger Corman's film efforts, and what passes for the story is lots of cheap melo-drama, which is all Cable Television offers....Cheap Melo-drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"I love the show and all the characters and actors. It has the right amount of scifi to wow you, and the right amount of drama to keep you watching!! Jacqueline McKenzie is a wonderful actress in this. She hides her aussie accent very well. Joel Gretsch and the other actors are also really good in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The 4400","review":"I love \\"The 4400\\" but a few extras would have been nice. Still, I am glad that they put these out with such speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Never Watched Before ...","review":"This may be one of the best television series ever produced. Entertaining, shocking, yet written with human warmth and morals. For those who have seen it, it is something to go back and watch again ... and again. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this series!","review":"I caught this mini-series on USA during a marathon leading up to the season finale. It was fantastic to be able to watch the series from start to finish all in one sitting (although six hours of TV watching on one Sunday definitely qualifies me as a couch potato -- at least that day!)I fell in love with this series and can't wait to buy or rent it to watch it again! The USA message boards on this show were going like crazy after the season finale. It was originally only supposed to be a miniseries, but it got such a huge response from the public that they are producing a second season -- which I can't wait for. I hear it's supposed to air in March 2005 (?).I highly recommend The 4400 first season to anyone who enjoyed X-Files or Taken. They're not all exactly in the same vein, but enjoyable on the same level nonetheless, particularly if you enjoy sci-fi/aliens/UFOs genre-type stuff.I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 4400 is NICE!","review":"The first season of the 4400 is only 5 episodes. It gives you real insight into the 4400 as well as the hardships that they have to face. You see the struggle of a family to put itself back together again. It also gives you insight into human nature when we are faced with something that we don't understand. I give it 4 stars defiantly on my recommended buy list."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting, exciting and captivating show","review":"I watched this show because my dad thought it would be interwsting.

This is such an exciting show worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"The songs on this EP are excellent. The vocals are very strong, the lyrics memorable and pointed, and the instrument work is also very good. Michelle Nolan is great here. Her voice on I Don't want this anymore has a Julee Cruise sound. John Nolan is remarkable. His voice on Later That Year has a resigned sad quality that makes it one of the best songs. The repition of \\"We Did The Math, It wasn't worth it after all\\" makes the song very powerful. A Slow Descent is also a strong song. It makes you think of the breakup of TBS and how it freed this great talent to go on his own. The cover of With God Our Side is also worth hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"last time i checked.........","review":"there was freedom of speech!!!! let the bands speak! everybody else gets to do it!... comedians,actors,sports figures,and so on.... pls people let the bands speak through the music, don't sit there and try to take away their voice. remember at the end of the day it is their opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"prepare to be let down","review":"i love straylight run. their first cd, amazing. so when i saw this new ep in best buy, i immplusively bought it. turns out, major let down. 1. there's no depth to these songs. it's just a few lines repeated over and over. 2. vocally it lacks, he never goes high. it's almost like talking over overly-produced electronic music. 3. this ep has a strong political agenda (anti-war), and that's pretty much all it has to offer. the only decent songs on here are 4, which is off their old cd (better on the old cd as well) and 6, which features the best written lyrics. unfortunately bob dylan wrote it. so spend your 10 bucks a better way; eat three meals at mcdonalds"},{"rating":"1","title":"can buy better and cheaper parts at home depo","review":"I did not know how to do a drip system for my trees and shrubs. This product included a \\"how to\\" booklet, so I purchased it. The instructions were fine and I discovered that this was a very easy and simple project. This raindrop kit did not have enough hoses and other parts so went to both Home Depo and Lowes. Both had tons of parts for a drip system but adding them to the raindrop stuff was extremely difficult as the hose diameters did not match. I discovered that I should have just gone straight to Home Depo (or Lowes) instead because everyone can buy better and cheaper parts there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply-made.","review":"I bought one of these kits just to get my system started and then added a bunch more to it. I would NOT recommend this product. I had numerous pieces break apart hile I was putting it together. Even the pressure regulator, which seems like a thick sturdy piece broke apart right in my hand when I tried to tighten the connection (it was leaking)! It's garbage. Also, just FYI, the Raindrip 3/4 inch pipe is slightly smaller than other brands (or vice versa). In any case, you'd think 3/4 inch piping would be standard (hence the size spec), but it's not. Be forewarned- if you mix Rainbird stuff with 3/4 inch drip stuff from another store and/or brand, it might not fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repairing Furniture","review":"I really like the easy to follow text.

I had the same experience with the hitch ball mount in same order. Classic bait and switch. Very unfortunate for a company as reputable as Amazon to deal like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Voice","review":"Mindy does a really great job singing on this album - she has a beautiful, expressive voice and a real talent for thoughtful lyrics. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the production on many of the songs is pretty bad - there's an inappropriate jarring strum going on in Raggedy Ann, and a couple of others have tinkly piano and violins in the background - like elevator music - which definitely do not suit Mindy's voice. All that said, I can't wait for her next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindy The Maverick.","review":"Mindy Smith is one hell of a lady.She does not compromise but her attention to detail is obvious from the first bars of the first song to the final note.Mindy deserves to be so successful.Whether that is by the effect of her music or the dollars made is debatable but I know what I should like to see.Dozens more discs to showcase her wonderful voice.What a talent - others have written similar reviews but I believe that Mindy touches everyone in a slightly different way.She taps into the inner soul.I rate this disc in my Top Ten of all time.Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Moment More","review":"I bought this album for the song title, \\"Come to Jesus\\" which is a great song.

Her cover of \\"Jolene\\" is more than competant, it borders on stunning as does \\"Come to Jesus\\" but the rest is pure crap. It was a pleasant suprise to here Dolly P. backing her up here on \\"Jolene\\", they harmomize wonderfully together. Angelic! But save yourself the trauma and money and buy something else unless you think those two songs are worth the asking price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing..","review":"I first heard Mindy Smith on CMT singing Jolene in the music video. I loved her voice and wanted to find out more..so I listened to the three other songs that are on her website and loved them. I finally got this CD for my birthday and absolutely love it. If you are Christian this is a wonderful CD to have, if you aren't..this is a wonderful CD to have. There are 3 great Christian songs on there \\"Come to Jesus\\",\\"Hard to know\\" and \\"Angel Doves\\" all of which are some of my favorites. I also love \\"It's amazing\\",\\"Falling\\",\\"Hurricane\\",\\"Raggedy Ann\\",and \\"Down in Flames\\".

Ironically a particular television station has been using many new artists in their shows, as background music, and Mindy Smith is one of those fresh new sounds. I first heard One Moment More on an episode of Smallville, and since purchasing the album, have enjoyed it with each repeated playing. The only track that I don't care for as much is \\"Train Song\\"... the inclusion of \\"Jolene\\", Smith's cover of the well-known Dolly Parton song is good. It has a folky bluesy sound to it, and there's a nice touch of having Dolly duet with her towards the end.Overall a good effort from a fresh new face in music. I look forward to hearing more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart!!!","review":"I first heard about this CD in a review on NPR. The snippets they played interested me enough to seek out an purchase it.While I like her messages, and her style, I found this CD VERY difficult to listen to! I was in the throes of trying to end a most tumultous relationship, and EVERY SINGLE SONG (except \\"Jolene\\") had me bawling my eyes out!!! It's been almost two years, and I STILL can't listen to 'One Moment More' and have dry eyes by the end!! Maybe that speaks more to me and my fragility, but no other music has quite that effect on me.I LOVED the duet with Dolly, though! That's the best song on the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Voice","review":"This is the most moving CD I've heard in 10 years. Like many people I heard Mindy's interview with Bob Edwards on Morning Edition and was struck by her open, honest interview. I found myself crying in the car when they played the title track and I still cry every time I hear it- for all of us who've lost a parent, this song hits home. The rest of the CD is just as lovely- showing the highs and lows of this amazing artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Beautiful Voice, Lovely LYRICS","review":"Wow, I love this CD.. and ALL the songs...I first heard the music on Tv.. one of my twin boys Stopped his jumping in his jumperoo bouncy thing.. and Did not move an inch, and litterally drooling and Cooing to her song \\"Come to Jesus\\".its beautiful, Good Job Mindy!Deffinatly worth Buying !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and very well done.","review":"I don't buy many CD's but I heard a few songs from this album on Pandora and really liked them. Anyone who likes Patty Griffin will love Mindy Smith. The song writing is exceptional and every song is good. Not just a few standouts on this one. My kids love this CD too and we all have different favorites. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates great song writing and well produced collections of singer/songwriter material. I do some song writing and playing myself and this CD is inspiring - though at the same time a bit depressing - cause I'm never going to be able to write and execute like Mindy Smith. I haven't been this excited about an album since 1000 Kisses (Patty Griffin).

She wrote all of her own lyrics and damn, that gal can sing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not my usual cup of tea, but wow","review":"Let me start by saying my usual listening habits involve bands like Devin Townsend, Opeth, Type O Negative, Soilwork, etc. So, for me to like something in the country/folk genre is quite a stretch. Well, Mindy has provided a way for that stretch. I first saw her on Conan O'Brien and was instantly impressed with her voice. So many vocalists try to spice up their style with pointless techniques like vibrato or falsetto, etc. Mindy's voice is so pure and refined that it just glides into your ear and permeates your head. I've been waiting a long time to hear a female vocalist with such a pure voice. Songs liks Come to Jesus and Fighting For It All display a very strong talent for good songwriting. I love this CD and hope other metalheads can branch out and discover this diamond in the rough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have read about 20 Ellora's Cave books. They are usually passionate, highly sexy stories that have a way of keeping you awake all night, and not in a bad way. This book, however, should be read if you ever have trouble falling asleep and want to get to sleep fast. The sex scenes in this story are very non descriptive of what the woman is feeling, so that you can feel none of her passion or excitement. I assume she was excited as she had 2 amazing guys wanting to bed her, but it never comes across in the book.

First, it is sleek, stylish, and a good size for a toaster oven (it can hold a whole frozen pizza woo!). Second, it was easy to set up and the instruction manual was very well written. I was able to use the bake, warm, and toast functions without much problem. The crumb tray is also large and removes easily. With that said, I cannot vouch for other's reviews about it almost causing fires.

Some of his gossipy details have been supported by the stars themselves or by people close to them, but far too many are just rank speculation he presents as fact.

It is made from concentric rings, which unfortunately, are not glued or even stapled together. The result is that when you throw a knife into it, then try to pull the knife from the board, the ring comes with the knife.

Initialy I was skeptical because the first few minutes of warmup is very boring, but she soon moves on to more challenging exercises, especially a lot of variations of V-sits. Also, initially I was reluctant about the length of the video (~50 minutes), but since she moves from one move to the next, the time passed quickly and she doesn't waste time sitting around.Stott is very clear about cueing the moves, including when to inhale/exhale. She demonstrates very good form, with good lines/angles, always in control of the moves, and fluid motions (i.e. no jerking or flinging).I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a challenging Pilates routine (or non-pilates people who want to cross train)."},{"rating":"2","title":"adv pilates","review":"Wow, what a workout.

Even though you know what happens in the end, in Episod 1, these books make you feel like you're not sure if that is what really will happen.

A teeny-weeny gripe though: In all the other Episode 1 info, Obi-Wan is Qui-Gon's third apprentice, yet in this one, he's only his second.

It was worth it at that price for the convenience of having it on the Kindle. With the recent price increase of 50% to $14.99 per month, or $180 per year, it really is not worth it. I also can't imagine what their justification is for charging a 75% premium for the Kindle version. Finally, it seems rather predatory of them to initially price it at $9.99 and then increase it to $14.99 after getting a bunch of people to spend the money for the device...we are now a captive audience and it seems they are going to extract whatever they can from us.

Has anyone at either Amazon or the publisher taken the time to sample how clunky the user-interface is? It does not read at all like the print edition, and should be divided up according to the print edition's individual sections, not by its own subject areas, of which there are far too many. The pricing is especially egregious considering how quickly price increases for this product have come. It was not long ago that it was only 14.99/month for this product. The price then increased to 18.29, and now to over $21/month. Not to mention the WSJ/Nook Edition remains at $18.29.

I've been an avid print reader for several years, and liked having it delivered electronically early every morning and not having used papers stack up. It was portable and easy to read. However finding articles was clumsy and I found myself falling out of the habit of reading it. I also found a large number of sections and articles relating to the Greater New York area. Since I live on the West Coast, and rarely travel to NY, those articles are of little interest. My print edition used to have sections unique to the SF Bay area.

Now the price increase takes all the goodness out of getting this subscription, and part of the reason why I bought the Kindle DX in the first place.

Look at the low ratings remember folks a good product will have an normal rating to just to balance off the bad ratings.

Who do they think the market is for the kindle version? Some hot shot Wall Street dude....Oh wait they are all out of work. Anyway, in a work setting you want the print edition. That way you can share it with others in the office. Cant do that with a Kindle. Can't share a thing. But you can drop the paper version in someone's lap and say \\"Your turn\\".So at the price of $180 per year, I will renew my print subscription to the Wall Street Journal for another year (six months at a time for around $40-$50). More paper to put out.

But I'm not sure that I'll keep it at this price. Also, initially, I thought that there was a significant problem with how articles are browsed. My impression was that, in order to browse article, you needed to page through them in stepwise fashion (within each section), i.e. that there was no menu of articles. I missed the fact that you may access a menu of article by clicking on the numbers that appear to the right of each section title. This is a usability problem.

Unfortunately the Kindle version is based on the New York edition. So out of the 100 or so articles in the Kindle edition, at least 30 are New York local articles. At that ratio, it's really hard to justify the cost. All of the local west coast articles are missing. It's a bummer, since I like the paper and I like reading it on the Kindle. I'll either go back to either print or online at this point, or just skip it all together until WSJ can put out a decent localized version for the Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"WSJ - Too Bad","review":"WSJ missed the mark with this subscription price or perhaps it is Amazon's that has made it difficult for us owners of the Kindle product.

Moreover, I now see some of the editorial bias of their opinion pages slipping into their news coverage. Yet, given that it remained the preeminent business paper in the US, I still subscribed. A 50% price increase, however, has pushed me over the edge.

WSJ, offer this at a more reasonable price and I may reconsider subscribing to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great format; can't justify the price","review":"I decided to do the free trial because I was getting tired of the stack of paper building up from the print edition, and I didn't necessarily want to try to read the online version on my laptop or phone. It's so nice to just be able to switch on my Kindle, download the paper, and read over breakfast, and the Kindle edition is really nice. Ideally, though, I'd like to be able to finish reading articles later online, perhaps at work over lunch, so it strikes me as strange that the online version isn't included.

They need to work with content providers to ensure content is delivered in full and print edition bundles (i.e. web subscriptions to content) is the same for Kindle subscriptions.

I travel too much to take the WSJ in paper form, so this was perfect - until they raised the price. The price was already too high at $9.99/mth, since that's the same price I can get it in paper form. I mean, they should pass on some of their cost savings to the subscriber, or at least offer a package Kindle/Internet subscription price break. So, at $9.99 they were already skimming us, but I bought it anyway. At this new price, I feel like they're bending me over a barrel.

First of all, as many have pointed out, the $99/yr subscription applies only to first-time subscribers. Thereafter, the subscription goes up to $250/yr. Needless to say, the Kindle subscription is LESS THAN 50% of the regular price. But really, the most important part of this discussion hinges on the following:The revenue for the Kindle suscription is ENTIRELY suscriber based. There are no ads; there is no ad revenue; the newstand PRICE IS NOT AD SUBSIDIZED.In someways this is an unprecedented moment for journalism, not because of wireless delivery, but because an important hindrance to transparency is removed. The conflict of interests between the newspaper and its revenue dollars dissipates instantly.

My complaints are twofold. (1) The Kindle WSJ doesn't bring with it acceess to a WSJ online account. I could tolerate the monthly Kindle subscription fee if I could also access the WSJ online. But no! Seems to me that Jeff Bezos/Rupert Murdoch may be getting a little too greedy. But at the heart of it, that's a business decision, and I can subscribe or not in whatever form I choose. (2) The quality of the Kindle-delivered WSJ is very poor. Typos abound. Stories are replete with errant punctuation marks that detract from the readability of the copy and are not found in other electronic versions. Sloppy work, and not what you would expect from a national newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the subscription price","review":"Most of the negative reviews of the WSJ Kindle edition concern the $14.99 per month price.

The programers are having some real difficulties with the format. Why else would a company charge twice what every other newspaper charges and then offer no discounts when the paper version on a six month subscription is half the cost.

What pissed me off and led to eventual cancellation of my subscription was the bad quality of the kindle fire app. First, it took forever to download the newspaper. Second, performance was really lacking. the app kept crashing, transition was sluggish and many times the app simply reloaded itself when I was in the middle of reading.

At $15/mo..... not so much. I'll still take advantage of the 14-day trial but it went from a sure sale to, now, probably not.

My wife loved the fact that we did not have print versions of the WSJ all over the house originally when I received the digital version. I enjoyed the fact the kids did not toss or lose them also. However with that being said why should I be paying more than the print+online edition of the WSJ? I shouldn't and that is a clear fact. It amazes me that a business focused paper can be so wrong on a business model. I understand Murdoch has declared war on Amazon and the Kindle, I however decide to not be a casualty in this.

Many reviewers on here were saying that the paper is great but that the $9.99 Kindle price was nonsensical as most regular readers pay about $99/year. So Amazon responded... by raising the price to $14.99. Seriously? It's really infuriating that Amazon is price gorging us here.

At $9.99 it seemed to be a better deal... While the articles are the same, there is something to be said for reading newspapers in paper form. I LOVE the Kindle 2 for book... however, for WSJ and newspapers in general, it is just simply not that desirable. While we may complain about the advertisements in WSJ, I actually miss those as well as most other graphics that are omitted from the Kindle edition. I also think the increase in price make this completely out of the question given the other problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle subscription is way more expensive than a print subscription!","review":"I just realized a couple of days ago that the Kindle subscription is much higher than the print subscription. This really made it feel as if the paper is trying to balance its declining subscriber base on my back. If you add to that the slightly irksome right-wing editorials, my switch to the FT Kindle edition was a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will make you smarter. . .","review":"The Wall Street Journal is journalism at its finest. The articles are very well written and researched. I subscribed to FT just to try it out for a week, and what I noticed was the articles in the FT were ones I had read in the WSJ the day before. No, they weren't exactly the same articles. But the point is, why go elsewhere, when all you get is a rehash of day old WSJ articles?The one thing I don't like is that if I am a print subscriber, I get access to the online site. If I pay MORE for the Kindle subscription, I don't get that. Reading the Kindle edition almost makes me want to cancel and subscribe to the print edition. But then again, I can't listen to the print edition in my car on the way to work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixing Apples and Zucchini?","review":"Folks, this is portable, convenient electronic reading...you cannot expect the same experience of physical or online newspapers. I read the WSJ every day...it's a commuter's dream. I don't need the pictures and certainly don't' expect the same layout. The Kindle makes navigating the sections, articles, opinions, LTE, etc. easy. What more do you want? And the price? Consider that the WSJ provides a version readable on ereaders...do you think that's no cost for them to do this? At $15 per month it's a bargain. I now read all journals, magazines, books on my Kindle. It's easy, convenient and sure maybe not as pretty, but if that esthetic is what I'm after, I'll go old school and pick up a paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not updated during the day","review":"Buyer beware: This is literally the print edition for the day and never updates throughout the day..

And such a common sense approach (for digital content) doesn't even appear to be on their mind.When I called WSJ to ask, the only thing customer service insisted on doing is to direct me to Amazon, while my question is most definitely for the content provider.Guess that's why they were taken over on the cheap by News Corp."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is th worst newspaper!","review":"one day i was reading this newspaper on my kindle, the articles just cut off.this is morelike the worst street journal.I would rather sit in a trash can than read this!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality of journalism","review":"A long time ago, the WSJ was a great paper. But since News Corp. took it over, it has become just another tabloid. It is basically a cross between the NY Post and FOX Business news, and its editorials are extremely right-wing. I cancelled my WSJ subscription and now read the New York Times and Financial Times - US Edition. The NYT has great domestic coverage, while the Financial Times is more international. I only have time to read 2 papers a day at most, so these newspapers are far better written and have more insightful articles than the WSJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not get the real thing its cheaper and complete","review":"The title says it all.

Amazon's Kindle is a Swindle because of its DRM. Products like these intentionally use DRM to dumb users down and restrict fair use rights. Therefore they are defective by design. I understand the convenience of using e-books and having an e-book reader if your traveling you don't have to carry 10 or more heavy paperback or hardcover books but at least with printed books you own a copy of the book not a license to access which can be revoked as Amazon has already done by remotely deleting George Orwell's 1984 from Kindles.

Goodbye WSJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price too high for a mediocre product","review":"Getting the WSJ in near real-time was a big plus, especially since we follow NY by 5-6 hours. I subscribed for the convenience even though the cost was higher than an online edition. Funny thing I noticed is that you can access most/all of the WSJ content online simply by doing a search of titles in google. Not sure if this is intentional or a loophole by WSJ.The recent raise in price to $14.99 is just too much for the value return.I was willing to pay $9.99, but canceled today because of the price increase. Lots of other content to choose, so don't have to look far."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WSJ Has Gone to Pot!","review":"The WSJ for Kindle is overpriced, and the customer service has gone completely haywire since the newspaper was bought out. I have read and subscribed by Kindle, print edition, and iPhone app (WSJ Mobile). Unfortunately, they are all horrible in contebt delivery--even though the writing is still superb--and try calling them. 10 minute waits to speak to someone in a different country who will put you on hold, and then when you try to cancel, it is abysmal.

I can buy the paper for $120/yr or I can buy the online version for $100/yr and sync it to the Kindle for free.

Having the WSJ accessible on my Kindle is great - so why the low rating? The WSJ app is a space hog. The WSJ app stores a weeks worth of material on the device. There is over 650 MB of content stored on the drive. On the limited 8 GB of memory for the Kindle Fire this is way too much.Once I read an addition I'm done with it and don't wish to have it stored. There is no way to delete the version once you are done reading it. I use my Kindle Fire mostly for multimedia content so this memory hog limits my content. As much as I like being able to read the WSJ on my Kindle Fire I'm going to cancel my subscription because it's a memory hog.This app would be a 5 star if there was some way to control the storage to the current version then discard it when done reading - just like a normal paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"priced way too high","review":"I tried it at 14.99 for a couple months, but could not keep going when the print edition was being offered for $1 a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why change the table of contents?","review":"I bit the bullet over the high price, but this latest change to the table of contents, with no warning, is the final straw.

Originally I thought that it would be great to \\"go green\\" and eliminate a ton of paper each year. On the Kindle the WSJ at best is only slightly less readable than paper but if they offered it at a discound to paper it would be worth considering.

The price increase is ridiculous since you are limited to reading it on the Kindle only and have no online access.

Furthermore, the Money and Investing section of the daily/weekly chart of the indices is not provided; therefore, you must read the article to find out how the overall market performed. Lastly, the $5 increase that happened a day ago increases my cost by $60 on an annual basis. Like others have noted, this does not make sense when there are deals to get the print and online version for $99. Instead, I'm paying $180 ($15 * 12 months), even though I'm helping the environment by not having someone drive it to me.I also forgot to mention that the iPhone can get articles for FREE.

You get whatever you want as long it is the NYC addition and the graphics are not nearly what they are in the on-line addition. Then there is the price. It was high at $9.99. But $14.99 ? I don't think so. Maybe WSJ and Amazon will figure this out and offer some variety at a reasonable price. Until then...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Amazon?","review":"Sorry Amazon, this was definitely the wrong move. This is almost a 75% premium to the buy the Kindle edition of the WSJ.

It costs $5 more a month than the online version of the paper, and is missing market tables and other items (which could be important to students who are required to subscribe to the paper). It is very difficult to look through the paper for articles that may be on a specific page (or to query by article title). There are numerous typos and formatting issues. All in all, it's not worth it. I wanted to like this because I love WSJ and I love the Kindle, but there's a lot of work that needs to be done before this is a good option for the WSJ reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is OK, online great, iPhone app is sadly lacking...","review":"This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered. There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web. The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome. Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format. It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access. WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible. Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete, you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.

That's absurd. If you want to read the Journal online, then subscribe to it online: the cost is about the same. Or you can buy the paper edition, which costs quite a bit more, but then you get to pass it around the office or family.What the critics overlook is that the Journal is the best and most thoughtful newspaper in the U.S. I am not a huge fan of its continuing makeover--it looks more and more like every other paper in the world, a sort of upscale USA Today. But still there is no other source nearly as good. It covers all national and international news, and in compact fashion. Its editorial page is conservative, but you don't have to read it if the politics offend you; the news pages are center-liberal like those of the Washington Post.

The best thing is when I wake up in the morning at 6am, the new issue is already on the Kindle! It is a tad expensive, but it's cheaper than buying it in the newsstand every day.

It's a solid rock song, trendy yet it's the kind of song that can get any band some attention.However, I wonder about the talents of this group when I listen to the rest of the CD - made me seriously doubt their song writing abilities - the rest of the CD sound like a bunch of below-standard B-sides thrown together just to make up a whole CD. The rest of the songs from 2 through 8 sound so much alike that I can't really distinguish one from the other, they're all monotoned and boring songs that have none of the rock feel of the first.I was seriously disappointed.

Somerset Maugham's novel \\"Theatre\\", BEING JULIA features the luminous Annette Bening in the title role with a fine support cast. The story concerns the reigning actress of the British stage, Julia Lambert, who enjoys a very modern relationship with her husband/director/manager Michael Gosselyn (Jeremy Irons). When her personal life hits a stalemate, she enjoys a fling with a young American fan, Tom (Shaun Evans), though when she discovers he's also seeing a featherbrained young actress called Avice Crichton (Lucy Punch) with designs on stealing her limelight, Julia concocts her delicious revenge.BEING JULIA is deftly-directed by Istvan Szabo, and also features Miriam Margolyes, Juliet Stevenson, Rosemary Harris, Rita Tushingham, Michael Gambon and Leigh Lawson. A supremely-entertaining gem. The DVD also features audio commentary with Szabo, Bening and Irons; deleted scenes; behind-the-scenes footage and a \`Making Of' featurette."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not sure of this one yet??","review":"I am not certain whether Iike it or not??Difficult movie..funny at times, boring at times.

Yes, it seems he probably was, but tried to avoid Oscar Wilde's fate by being more discreet. Do I get some kind of prize?Now for the good news. If you take it as farce it is okay. It is well shot and costumed. The English son of the aging actress has a great part and did a good job with it. Actors were generally fine, although just like Moulin Rouge, this is one part that Madonna could actually handle because she wouldn't have to act.I gave it one star for the theme and what it presented as worthy of celebration-- even if it was half-farcical."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CATASTROPHE...","review":"Who is Jeff Shannon, anyway - and who gave him his questionable credentials?This film is a sorrowful disaster.

Annette Bening is excellent, totally in command of this extremely complicated character. The final \\"stage scene\\" is a display of breathless insanity.

It's hard to describe to cleverness without giving away essential plot points, but I enjoyed it very much, and am still in awe of Ms. Bening's achievement.She keeps losing Oscars to Hilary Swank, but given more great roles like this one, she's bound to win someday...Fine DVD extras, though few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Believe Everything You Read -- and do meet Julia!","review":"If I'd only based my decision on the handful of so-so \\"professional\\" reviews I'd seen on Being Julia, I probably would have missed this little gem of a film. Forget the fact that Annette Bening will likely be nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe, this film is a delightful character study of a British stage actress and those who inhabit her world. Besides Ms. Bening, the movie features a top-notch cast including Jeremy Irons in the role of Julia's producer-husband.

But why we should care about this foolish, vain, self-centered, adulteress drama queen is beyond me. Particularly at the end, which the filmmakers plainly see as Julia's personal triumph over her adversaries. But what adversaries? No-one's to blame for the pickle she finds herself in more than herself. So how is publicly humiliating an innocent -- albeit annoying -- person a triumph? It's petty, cruel, self-serving, unprofessional behavior. And that she should be rewarded for it is completely implausable. I understand that the film is meant to be fluff, but even fluff has to make sense. The marvelous supporting cast, most notably Juliet Stevenson, helped enormously to keep my attentions from completely waning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being Manic","review":"I wasn't to thrilled about this one. Benning's character is so unlikeable and not in a Bette Davis All About Eve kind of way. Although the film does have some of the same diva theatrics.Benning's perfomance is best described as manic (and she does do a good job at it) but again, she really is not a likeable or sympathetic character. The others turn in decent perfomances, particularly Juliet Stevenson, but it still isn't enough to keep this one really entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this toy!","review":"This has Play Doh's Fun Factory beat by a mile!

You can slide them back a bit. At first, I did not like this, but after playing around with it, I decided to push each successively higher tray back as far as it would go. (about 3/4\\" per tier).

Once the crayons are out of their holders they break apart easily.Second, the crayons dissolve quickly. If a crayon is under water there is a plume of colored water surrounding it as it dissolves, proving how quickly these crayons dissolve.Third, the crayons barely write.

I wish we would have done that. My 2 year old daughter broke out terribly within 2 minutes in the tub with these crayons. The allergic reaction resulted in huge red areas on her skin that came in contact with the water. Those red areas had large, swollen, whitish areas in the middle that looked like blisters. We panicked and called the doctor but ultimately they went down after we washed with soap and water (clean water) and gave her children's benedryll.

Well, she was super excited to use her new \\"colors\\" in the bath, and enjoyed them for 2 bath times until the crayons began to fall out of the holders and break. She was left with little nubs to color with. I understand that the manufacturer was trying to create a fun product that was easy to use, but the crayon holders are faulty, and don't do what they are supposed to.

The little ducky sponge helps but in my personal opinion the after clean up effort makes the fun the boys have with these crayons less than desirable.If you are looking for REAL kid fun in the tub I'd go with the Crayola color dots! The can comes with 3 different color pellets. By mixing 2 pellets into the tub water a child can see how 2 colors create a new color. Colors are vibrant and even change bubble bath bubbles to their color. MUCH easier to clean up and just as much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This product has potential if the holder were redesigned. The crayons (amazingly small compared to the holder) fall out of the case all the time. My son tries to color with them, but if he tips the crayon upside down or sideways, out comes the crayon into the water.

It does cover a year's worth of stripping, but it is not enough to engage a reader who is looking for something other than a compilation of facts in chronological order - the story does not develop or evolve, it simply starts and ends. The observations about stripping lurk on the surface of mediocre psycho analyses that don't go deeper than what the eye meets or the ear hears: she sees and hears things and so she types it out on her laptop and sprinkles it with flavorful allegories.It does read fast and keeps you entertained, but don't go looking for insightful or eye opening revelations.

The author of this book tries to make every sentence memorable and a zinger. The effect of this style of writing is like turning up a thrash metal song album to high volume. There are no levels, no quiet spaces, just one long smart-alecky shout. The book is also lacking in insight, either into the author's motives, the dynamics of the strip club, or the girls or patrons involved in it. The one good thing about it is that she does not shy away from describing the fundamental depravity she participated in and yet simultaneously acknowledges that there is some strange degree of glamour in the business.

However, her writing style is overly simplistic, and she relies too much on metaphoric pop-culture references that elude the somewhat older reader (I'm in my mid-thirties). Additionally, her language is exceedingly crude. I do not think I am too much of a prude, but I was offended by her vernacular and embarrassed to read most passages aloud to my husband.

No surprise because this is a German company and I doubt they care about overseas sales. Save your money. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This product requires that you first download a CD onto your comp before the computer even recognizes the MP3 player! I downloaded everything 3 times and my computer would not recognize the MP3 player. I spent hours on it! Also, their costumer service line is in Germany and they have no costumer servies in the US. Therefore, no one can help you. Good luck trying to figure out how to use it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This CD","review":"This is a great concept and timeless recording from one of the greatest country singers of all time. It bridges the gap between traditional and contemporary gospel and will appeal to gospel, country and bluegrass followers. Recorded in the early 80's and just recently released on CD, this recording is as fresh and natural as this morning's dew. Shining bright on this recording are the tight bluegrass harmony vocals which pepper up each tune and the slick guitar work of Ray Flacke. An exceptional effort !"},{"rating":"1","title":"item not received","review":"It has been quite some time since I ordered this item and to this date still have not received it.

I purchased the UA-1X and was very disappointed. I had hoped to use it with my laptop as a line-in. However, I found the unit completely bypassed the Mixer in Windows, so no level adjustments could be made in XP. The unit has a two level input gain switch, but I found with the unit connected to the preamp out on my preamplifier that the high gain setting resulted in excessive clipping, and the low gain setting was too low. Practically useless as an line-in unless you have a separate external gain control to adjusted the level prior to going into the UA-1X. I would not recommend at all as a line-in.

While I love the workout, I was highly disappointed that the tapes malfunctioned after a few months of use. Both the beginner and intermediate tapes I purchased wouldn't play - I had to open the case and manipulate the acetate to get the tapes going again. I thought this was odd since I still have tapes that I bought in the early 90s that work with no problem today. When I emailed the Merrithew Corporation - the Canadian company owned by Stott that makes the tapes - to complain, they promised to send me replacements, but never did.

These three are great. 'We are the radio' pales in comparison (and the new female singer sounds too similar to Grace Slick): repetitive, lacking energy and urgency. Even the one instrumental comes nowhere near the brilliance of 'Heroin and Prozac revisited' off of 'And this is our music'.

The fact that they have NO authorized repair shops around the country, none at all, zero, means that their 'life time warranty' is useless. (They count on this, I'm certain. Much cheaper to do business. Good for stockholders. Bad for consumers.) It is way too much of a burden and expense to box up these large items and send them across country (in my case). It is also a huge time commitment for the bag to be away - numbered in weeks depending on how busy they are.

This backpack did all that and more. It has several big pockets, and as you move toward the front, they get smaller, until you have a tiny one just big enough for my keys and name badge - making things easy to find, instead of rummaging through one huge compartment for a small item.It seems well made, and I've had no issues with it so far, and I wear it every day I work (and I've had it for over a month now).I feel that the nylon will be somewhat water resistant when it starts raining, but it shrugs off the snow easily.Overall, a very nice backpack at a good price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big and Roomy!","review":"I bought this backpack for my HS daughter as our HS doesn't have a schedule that allows students to get from one class, to their locker, and back before the next class begins.

Two years ago I bought him an LL Bean backpack because I thought that LL Bean had a great reputation and everyone commented how great the back pack was. The zipper got stuck and caught onto the fabric within the first 2 months. I mean it really got caught and even my husband couldn't get fix it. He used it for 2 years and then another zipper got caught. At that point I had enough and order this Jansport backpack. He's had it for close to 2 months and I have to say that he hasn't had any problems with it. It's great. Very roomy. Holds his 4 binders with more than enough room to spare. It doesn't look large on the outside but it enormous inside. Its very strong. The shoulder straps are excellent quality.

I've had the backpack for 1 semester of college in which I carried 3 very heavy books among other folders, schools supplies, etc. I was afraid the backpack would tear at the seams under the weight but it didn't! I definitely recommend this backpack. Jansport also has a lifetime warranty that will replace or fix your backpack in case it ever breaks. It is also very comfortable on your shoulders and has plenty of pockets and space for miscellaneous supplies. My only complaint is that the zippers get stuck sometimes which I guess is only expected, but as I stated earlier, if the zippers ever break, Jansport will replace or fix the pack for no charge. Overall great quality and highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Name says it all but straps are very hard and uncomfortable","review":"I was very skeptical about this bag when it arrived. I looked no different than any other bag that I have seen in the stores. I didn't look big enough for my high school students needs. Our schools do not let them have lockers, so they must carry everything with them causing them to need a very large bag. We haven't had much luck in the past finding bags adequate in size, so I thought I would try this. When it arrived, I thought I would be sending it back immediately. I moved all my sons books and supplies over to this bad and he has room to spare. Nothing is smashed. I am very pleased.

Let me tell you, this bag is NO bigger than any other one I have. In fact, I have one from Walmart that is bigger. This was a complete waste of money and is falsely advertised. Also, this bag was my first Jansport bag. I have heard that Jansport is supposed to be a great quality bag, very sturdy. The fabric is very thin, and the shoulder straps are thick and very stiff. I imagine those might break in a little with wear, but overall, the promise of all you can fit into it IS FALSE. Buy this bag if you like the print or relish having a Jansport bag.

The only thing I don't like as well is the buckles on the shoulder straps, they're not as large and may not be as heavy duty, only time will tell.

The big Student Classic Series Backpack has flimsy zippers, zipper pulls, and fabric. The shoulder straps had thin, poorly padded straps.

The color is not horrible, but my 14 year old son is not going to carry around this all year...Or ever.

It looks like a boy's backpack. II would not recommend it at all. The straps are soooooo uncomfortable. The only thing good about this backpack is it holds all 6 of my binders. Thats it.

I learned nothing new about Madonna by watching this DVD. The sound quality was horrible and some of the camera work was disappointing. Of course since it is an unauthorized documentary, there are no Madonna songs being played as background music and certainly no concert footage. I thought there would be more rare photographs of Madonna. I do not recommend this item if you are a die-hard Madonna fan. I was bored the entire time and turned it off after 30 minutes.

It is fresh, fun and full of energy. Ms. Kidjo floats effortlessly over rich rhythms that cross the boundries of Africa and Brazil with a touch of Jazz, Salsa and Funk. This music takes me back to the 70's and a group called Osibisa. They were one of the first pioneers of this cross-cultural sound. I love the vibe that Kidjo creates on \\"Black Ivory Soul.\\" She has a great talent for blending different styles to create textures and melodies that are very distinct and colorful. There isn't a weak cut on this disc. Thanks also for including the english translations of each song. Keep up the good work, Angelique. Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MikeK","review":"This woman should be part of the discography of World Music we hear about and get on digital cable. After I heard a sampler of 3 songs (Refavela, Tumba, and Black Ivory Soul) I bought the CD. She is awesome. The notes the critics give her on this one are on the mark. From the smooth \\"Bahia\\" to what should be a radio airplay gem (\\"Iwoya\\" with Dave Matthews) to the serious jamming \\"Refavela\\" and (my fave) \\"Ominira\\", you will not stop playing this over and over. You must get this CD if you are a fan, and you should get it if you like \\"International Music\\"! If we support her, I would expect her to tour here more often. I saw her 4/2/02 in Philly, and she was AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese versions!","review":"It is probably one of Angelique Kidjo's best albums!!!She didd really good job on her French songs. Two bonus songs, that the album is featured with, are rhythmically really beautiful songs! Ne Cedez Jamais, translated as a \\"Never Give Up\\", and Les Enfants Perdus - \\"Lost Children\\", are worth to buy the whole album, even you've already bought original \\"Black ivory Soul\\"! You won't be upset!In this album Kidjo shows her as usually superb and vocally strong voice!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Magic","review":"This could be Kidjo's best ever, although she's still young, and no doubt, has more tricks up her sleeve, as the more recent, Caribbean-influenced OYAYA! would indicate. This collection of songs is largely inspired by Brazilian music, but as usual, Ms. Kidjo likes to mix things up, so her Aftican rhythms combine with French, South American and other shadings, and most of the melodies here are not only beautiful, but memorable; \\"Iemanja\\" and the kora-backed \\"Okan Bale\\" are particularly lovely. Even the fairly commercial duet with Dave Matthews is fine, and the one track I've heard on the radio, \\"Tumba\\" is joyfully infectious. Angelique Kidjo is an international treasure who has grown as a singer. She has become subtler, while retaining the power and soulfulness that first caught my attention in the early '90's. If you have the opportunity, catch Kidjo live, as she is an energetic, animated stage performer who can move even the most reserved audience to dance in the isles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelique Does It Again!","review":"Each of Angelique's albums has its own personality, and this one is no exception. She has even said that her albums are like children to her. I find this album to be very listener-friendly. I find myself transported to Bahia, though I've never been there. \\"Iemanja\\" makes me think of a moonlit night stroll on the beach. I especially love the ballads, but \\"Tumba,\\" which is \\"dedicated to the public,\\" is sure to get you on your feet. I have seen Angelique live 4 times since 1998 and met her 2 weeks ago. I will say that after hearing the music live, the album has a few weak points, not as pumped up as it is performed live. But I would definitely recommend picking this up for your Kidjo collection. If you have never heard her music, I would also suggest you pick up Keep on Moving as an intro to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious is the word!","review":"Someone donated this to a thrift store, unopened, and I am the lucky girl who found it for only a dollar!

Not very unique or exciting or different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Basic Textbook","review":"This is not a book that you would want to read on a family vacation. It is a small textbook on DOE and a pretty good one at that. Before studying this text, I had a fairly good grasp of what disigned experiments are and had even used some DOE software. What I didn't know was what was going on behind the scenes in the software and how to choose the correct designs to accomplish my goals. This book filled in many of these basics for me.DOE certainly is NOT an easy subject. This book is a great addition to the library of anyone wishing to really understand DOEs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts slow and then goes too fast","review":"The book starts out with nice explanations about averages, standard deviation, normal distribution, standard error, etc., that are very easy to follow and are a good set up for the basics of DOE. But then it just jumps right into full factoral designs, fractional designs, saturated designs, etc. without laying any good ground work to understand what the author is talking about; it basically goes from 0-60mph in ten pages. Plus the examples are not presented well and are confusing. I am a novice at DOE and would not recommend this book as a starting place; perhaps better for someone who already has some knowledge of DOE and wants to build further off a base."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast track DOE (Design of Experiments) course:","review":"If the Experiment you are dealing with requires a statistical design and you're a novice to DOE, this would be an ideal book. The book explains the basic concepts of statistics with easily comprehendible examples. The chapters on factorial design are well organized and explained with hypothetical data. After reading this book you'll have a better understanding of factorial design jargons: confounding, interaction, linearity, factors, levels etc...

I went bowhunting with them for the first time and on the second day dust got in the twist up area of the eyecups just from setting them on my dusty pack a few times without the cover on and the next time I went to pull them up they were bound up from the dust. I tried twisting it up but the rubber covering on the eyecup slipped off and broke the plastic inside it. Now it comes off with the cover everytime I take it off. Another problem with them is I went to look at an elk the day before and had to pull the cover off twist up the awkward eyecups and pull the caps off the objective lens. The whole process took about 15 seconds and the elk caught me fiddling around with the binos. Not very easily used while in the moment. I am sending them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Music Chronicle","review":"Marty Stuart is country music's renaissance man. What a truly rare combination of talents: great voice, great picker, great songwriter, great photographer, and is keenly aware of the fact that he's had the good fortune of having stood among American icons.The photos in this book are excellent by any standards. I was expecting the photography to be so-so...generally when a talented person tries to branch out, it doen't translate to their new endeavor...but I have to say he's got an excellent eye. Not only that, but he can spin a yarn like a true poet, and that is what makes this such an all-around joy to both read and look at.Something to look for in this book: the story of going to see Connie Smith in concert as a boy and telling his mother \\"I'm going to marry her one day\\"....and 27 years later, he did just that. Wait until you see the picture he took.This book captures an important piece of American history and does it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I'm beyond disappointed. I would give zero stars if I had the option. I vomited in this bag and it was only about 1/3 cup. After only a few seconds of holding the bag, the entire bottom opened up and the vomit ended up all over my lap and on my seat in the car. Unbelievable! What an embarassment! I had to take my pants off in the car and had to cancel my dinner plans because I didn't have a change of clothes. The \\"one-way valve\\" is total joke. The bag is not opaque as in the picture. It is completely transparent. This is advertised for vomit and urine. Imagine if someone were to use it for urine. They would have it all over them as well. The seller didn't pack a receipt in my order and there is no way I can return the rest of the bags I purchased. Amazon was only the middle man for this purchase. Don't trust BP Medical. They have my money and I have a totally worthless product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"Bought these and there is no inner- valve to prevent leaks. I've not had to use it, so don't know how sturdy it will be. You would have to throw it away immediately after using it or hold it upright in your lap, because it will definitely leak! It is also clear rather than opaque and there was no packing slip, either. I'm a little scared to try this product after reading the other review. Giving it two stars, because I haven't had to actually use it, yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story line","review":"While some reviewers may think this story line is unbelieveable, in reality it bears some truth. The music is excellent. The acting is not the best and neither is the transition from scene to scene. However, I stayed glued and never had a clue to how the story line would go until way further in the movie. Maybe I am biased since it was filmed in Atlanta GA and I am a Georgian. I would recommend this movie as it kept me guessing and intrigued"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not big budget but worth the watch","review":"The Books of JohnThis movie was not a big budget movie and the story line was different from any I have seen before but I liked it very much.

Some bits and pieces of this movie made me wonder what the actors could have achieved with better direction and a better script, but far too often their emotions changed so dramatically and unrealistically within a scene that is was imposible to take them seriously. The music was sappy and distracting, playing so heavily over some scenes as to make the dialogue difficult to understand. It was refreshing to see \\"real\\" looking actors but what they were given to say was many times laugh-out-loud silly and trite. Not the worst movie I've seen, but one easily skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Snoozer...","review":"I would never have watched this movie but I'm related to one of the main actors so it was for support. First of all, the movie was so poorly shot that I couldn't understand half of what was being said. The story was completely predictable & the acting was HORRIBLE! If you want a sweet story to watch, purchase Brokeback Mountain.

The sudden death of a man, who started a runaway shelter in the South, begins a quest by his lover to discover more about his companion's past. This obviously true story, filled with the kind of synchronicity only the Spirit could orchestrate, takes us to consider grief, loss, HIV, letting go, love of life, renewal, and passion, which comes unexpectedly. This is a great story. The acting is amateur, the editing poor. Seen as a home movie with real people being themselves, it becomes a quest for love and realization of who our real family is."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This cd was amazing!

A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like I had missed all the rehersals","review":"This video contained dance steps that were combined into very long multi-part patterns that are hard to learn. It feels like you are always several steps behind. New steps and patterns are added every few minutes, so you never get to repeat one action long enough to learn it. Several times I've thought that it would just be a lot easier to go outside and jog for a while in order to burn fat. So that's what I've started doing. I don't use this video any more.

I never get tired of doing this workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad for a Quick 30 Minutes of Cardio","review":"This video doesn't deserve the negative reviews posted here. It's led by Michelle Dozois who, in my experience, likes to throw in fast changing and complex foot work and doesn't have the best cueing. (I'm not a fan of Michelle). However, the music and the challenge of learning the steps motivate me enough to have fun with it. There is a point, about 2/3 through where it can get a bit frustrating, but overall, it's really not that hard to follow. I also add wrist-weights and high impact moves to make it more intense. Not that bad for a short cardio workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"anderson sanctuary choir","review":"Got this one for one of the tracks from radio. Could never get the artist, so I called them.

Another more subtle form of fusion is when it happens within the artists psyche as a result of his or training, which is more than one style of music, and in Mishra's case obviously Western and Indian, and to the end that it is internal and flows from within it is more natural in a sense.

SPOILER--But the author couldn't resist talking about Whilden's actions as heroic and how the day was won for the Confederacy as if it were a truly noble outcome. Now look at it another way: if Whildon were shot down and the Rebels didn't have a rallying point to successfully rienforce the earthworks, then Grant would've plowed through, cutting Lee's army in half and most likely defeat them. With this outcome, you would not have had the endless series of massacres throughout central Virginia, no siege of Petersburg, no Cold Harbor.

The sleeves are long, but not too long (and are easily pushed back due to the elastic feature).

Of course, someone would have to get through 2 security doors to even get to my door, so I don't have any fear of someone taking off with it to pry open and get in my apartment.

The black switch on the left would go down when I had the code in (wouldn't for different combinations) but the door wouldn't open to release the key! I called MasterLock and they said if I could get the lock off the door and mail it to them and they decided it was malfunctioning, they would return my money. I was like WHAAA? I had my landlord saw it open with a steel cutter to get my key out-- I don't have time to wait around for my only key!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this lock box","review":"I was one of the unfortunate ones who had the box lock up on me. I set the combination and tried it several times. I then gave a demo to my wife and babysitter, so I verified the combination at least 5 times. I locked the box near our back door. The next day I tried to open it and it failed to open. There was no opening it. Fifteen minutes with a hacksaw and then a few squeezes from a big vice and I had my $30 Medeco key back. That created a whole other security concern for me. A 14 volt battery powered sawzall would go through this in 10 seconds. With a big hammer, or a moderately sized vice, a thief could have your key in a minute or less with this or any other lock box. I know real estate offices need these things but if you're just a home owner hoping to avoid locking yourself out, I'd consider putting a key in a zip lock bag and burying it somewhere in your garden. It's cheaper, and probably safer too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"We use these on rental properties so that others can access the property without us being there. The combination is easy to reset, holds up to weather and won't scratch or mark up the door or door knob. They're not break proof though. Recently I had a house that was broken into and the thieves used the key in the lockbox to do it. What they did is break off the knob and apparently break open the box to gain access to the property. Subsequently copper pipes were cut and other minor things were damaged. It's not really Master Lock's fault but I wish they were a little more durable. Overall though it's a great product and I will buy more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Open Item","review":"At first I thought I had lost my mind, or that perhaps someone punked me and changed the combination, because the thing will not open to the combination i set.

We had it on a commercial box truck to lock down the cargo door and hold the ignition key. One early morning at 5:00 AM and my driver could not open the lock. I googled for a solution and found these reviews on amazon. Turns out a few people were able to beat it open with a hammer or a rock.So I passed that along to my driver who then took his tire iron and was able to pry the shackle off in about 3 minutes and then hit it while it laid on the ground and broke it open in a few more minutes of beating. Piece of junk lock and bad ass driver.Would not recommend this lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Secure...it doesn't open","review":"We hired a caregiver for my dad and didn't want to just give them a key. Bought this because of the high amount of positive ratings. The storage box is VERY durable and strong. It was easy to set the combination. I tried it several times, it worked great. Then we put the key in,closed the door and tried the combination, but the box wouldn't open. We removed the key chain from the key, thinking maybe it was taking up room (it wasn't a big chain) and just put the key in. It wouldn't open. This was a normal sized house door key, not some jumbo key and there was only one (the description says it will hold 5 keys). The lever to open the door would move, indicating that the right combination was used, but the door wouldn't open. Can't take a chance of having the caregiver standing outside the locked door trying to get in...this is being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didnt work.","review":"A lock really only needs to do 2 things, lock, and unlock, mine would unlock ok but would not lock until i hit it against something, which is not easy to do hanging off a door.

I have had four of them quit working and have not been able to open them. The first one actually wouldn't open until about the 5th or 6th try and suddenly it worked. The second one I have we were never able to open and we had to remove the door knob to get the lock off the home. This makes us look pretty bad in front of our clients when we can't get into a home. It is not a wrong combination problem as the first lock opened after I spun the numbers back and forth and tried it 5-6 times.

I was tempted to cut it off as we didnot know the combination. One day I decided to see if I could get it off in a nondestructive manor. My first attempt was by disassembling the door knob. This only got it off the door. I fiddled with it for about an hour until I couldn't believe my eyes! It opened! Using nothing but simple everyday household items, I was able to discover the combination. After doing it a few times, I could do it in less than two minutes.If I can do it, I'm fairly certain anybody could do it. Beware that these things are not very secure.

The worst thing is it turned out they all came from his own imagination!It's worth watching once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the same","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Stephen King owning just about every book and movie ever made. I must say after reading the book and then seeing the movie come out I was mystified of how different the movie was from the book and how horrible the acting was. David Arquette was horrible and so was the crappy back story of Johnathon Jackson's character. Once they started on that my attention for this movie tanked. I really wish Hollywood would realize that the reason some movies fail when based on books is because they lose something when you change or leave out too much of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"Let me start off by saying that I love Stephen King, he's given me hours of entertainment and for that I am grateful. I am also a big fan of the lead in this movie Jonathan Jackson. Together I was expecting a can't miss movie, but it didn't quite work out that way. Riding The Bullet is just all around dull. The story was weak to begin with, the flashbacks were dull, the characters have 0 personality, and it just wasn't creepy in the slightest! If Disney made horror movies, they would be similar to this. I probably rated it higher than I should have because of my fondness for King and Jackson, but really this movie was a bore, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong poduct Description","review":"The description did not match the product it was not an LCD screen, it was like a media conector for multiple audio and video options.Even the seller offer a reinburse i have alredy send it as a gift to another location so it was impssible for me to return it.Not to mention that the kid who receive it was extremely desapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"My grandmother collects roosters, so I thought these would be a perfect addition to her collection. They're adorable and look really nicely crafted with the paint job. They came super speedy to my house and arrived in brand new condition! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for pets!","review":"After much research we purchased this insect repellent to keep the mosquitos off our precious kitty who was being bitten in the face. She hates it because it is so pungent, but just a little dab on her forehead seems to keep the mosquitos from biting her. I would purchase this product again. But a little goes a long way so I don't think I'm going to need more anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"book by John Creasey","review":"As always it is very well written and manages to keep you interested and wanting to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Sadly, I ordered this product before Major Schiller's informative review. As a matter of personal policy, I never \\"register\\" inexpensive software due to the spam and email/ID theft risks. Be warned that the sticker saying you have to register before the product is unlocked is INSIDE the CD case. There is no warning on the outside. This may affect returns, but is probably defensible. Sure, I'm willing to run their little maze - if they are willing to pay my hourly consultant's fees. As far as I'm concerned, I paid my money and I deserve a working product RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even run the software","review":"I purchased this software over a month ago. As others have described, there is a multi-step process to unlock the software in order to use it.So far, I haven't gotten it unlocked. I have gone to their website to authorize the software as per the instructions. Whenever I click on the 'authorize' button, I get a cryptic message \\"scgiwrap: Caller must be the nobody user\\".I have emailed their customer support and sales email addresses, and have never gotten a response.So, to put it bluntly, this software is completely unusable to me, and the company that produced it has been unresponsive to my requests for help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality!","review":"Bit doesn't hold well. The design and the construction of the chuck doesnt work. Probably why these are selling cheaper than their weight in scrap metal. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Neck Bit Brace = Chinese Jink","review":"This bit brace was total junk. The ratchet worked poorly when I got it. When I put a 5/8\\" auger bit in it, the entire chuck blew up within 5 minutes (6\\" deep into the pole I was drilling). 2 of the 4 jaw teeth came out, and the square bore at the base that the auger drill bit fits into to transfer torque was completely ruined and rounded out. Ended up finishing the job with a pair of solid Craftsman Vice Grips. This is cheap Chinese junk - I think the red handles are a sign of the maker. I would rate it ZERO stars, but you must have at least one. Don't bu y this - you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't expect too much","review":"Not a horrendous tool but doesn't have the feel of a tool you can trust. I would spend the extra 5 to 10 bucks and go with the fuller brand bit and brace they have for sale here.It has not failed yet but I really don't trust it or feel I can rely on it.Wish I had spent the extra money for the fuller model.I wish there was a way to know where something was made before purchase.Also, my fault, I should have realized a cheaper price means a cheaper tool. I rarely use this so I did not want to spend too much but there is a cut off price below which you won't get a quality item. I should have realized that anything below 20 dollars for this tool would be an either an amazing bargin or more likely an inferior tool. Do yourself a favor spend a few more dollars and get a tool that you will enjoy using instead of a tool you'll avoid using."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - do not buy","review":"Waste of money, did not work and basically just fell apart. Didn't get a single use out of it. Look for a used older one somewhere else, you'll at least get a functioning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Crap!","review":"Don't throw away your money! This product is cheaply made and will fall apart quickly. the chuck won't grab your auger bits. the chuck teeth are made out of some cheap steel/tin composite are prone to bending and breaking. All of the hardware that holds this thing together is very very cheap and it will break! Don't think your getting a deal buying this product, you will regret it. the ratcheting gears are made of a soft metal and will strip quickly. For the love of god don't throw away hard earned cash, whoever marketed this as a quality product good enough for actual use, is a shister! don't be fool by these crooks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality Tool","review":"It may be that the price reflects the quality in this particular situation. The brace I recevied was poorly made and not lined up between the top handle and the jaws so that turning the handle caused a wobbly action that made using the tool very difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor adaptation","review":"This film is an adaptation of the first book in the new Frankenstein series by Dean Koontz. I am not really a Dean Koontz fan and have only read a few of his books, but the first 2 in this series were excellent. (I eagerly await the 3rd, which is past due to come out.) This movie was a very boring, poor adaptation in my opinion. Why Dean has such bad luck with movies based on his books I cannot understand. Every movie version of his books has been really bad, this one is no exception. It is dull, which is hard to understand because the book is anything but dull. It is no wonder that Dean took his name off this project. That should have been sufficient warning to me. If I could get my money back, I would. Save yours, or better yet, buy the Frankenstein books to enjoy the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No","review":"Save your money, read the book. The movie tried to follow the book but it was so disjointed it made no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn on a light already!","review":"About 15 minutes into the movie, I wanted to shout at the filmmakers \\"turn on a light already!\\". It is dark. Even when it's light (outside daylight street) it's dark, like it was underexposed two stops. My wife and I were trying to place the lead actor, and I recognized his voice, as I could not see his face.In one early scene, people were talking in a courthouse. The background was lit, but the people were not, giving them a backlit effect. The needed key lights or reflectors were simply not present. Yet it looked like a professionally shot movie, not just some guy holding a camera. So it was an intentional effect, even to the point of distraction.The characters were often in silhouette, with parts of a face occasionally visible. But this effect was carried through to every scene, which debases the effect when they are indeed in a creepy place. And when it looks like a normal shot except for a missing light on the subject, it just looks wrong and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G!!!!!!","review":"I didn't know that this was a Koontz-based scrapped pilot until I read the last review - which makes it even more disappointing. If this movie doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will. This has all the \\"drama\\" angles of Buffy the Vampire Slayer with hardly any action and then as the movie builds to it's peak THE CREDITS ROLL!!!! STAY AWAY, folks. I am a Dean Koontz fan and I'm thinking he had very little to do with this. Parker Posey was the only enjoyable thing about the movie, but people looking at \\"the monster\\" and talking about him being in a freak show when he just had a little scar on his face - come on, I've seen worse at the swimming pool. This is an hour and a half of your life you will never get back. Frankenstein Unbound was a B movie, but was much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"total tv-movie b.s.","review":"I caught this when it was first aired like a year ago on tv and I thought it was pretty lame. \\"Frankenstein\\" is nto really a good title, as this thing has little to do with any of the actual literature or previous films it shares a name with.Vincent Perez, who played the Crow in the god-awful \\"Crow: City Of Angels\\" stars as a Frankenstein monster, kind of, who also doubles as a mysterious informant for a tough/but/pretty cop (Parker Posey) whos investigating some weird events involving a genetic scientist guy. There's no real ending, since this was intended to be a series perhaps, and the whole thing is just bland and pointless. Could have been a cool idea, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I was kind of upset that Dean Koontz's name did not appear anywhere on this film. The book was one of the better ones I have read and for the film makers to basically quote word for word from the book without even a mention to Koontz is ridiculous. They also took out what I thought was one of the best story lines with the other serial killer Roy. I thought that added a good little side story. Also, Victor Helios and his creatures were not really explained all that much in the movie. Randall Six did not appear, and the scenes with Erica weren't that clear. I don't know, I hope there won't be another movie to tarnish this series of great novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Poorly done.This first book by Dean Koontz was awesome!The movie, not so much.In the book Deucalion is a very large very scary and grotesque man with a very derformed face.In the movie he is a good looking man with a scar on his face. ??REALLY??Just crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must in your CD collection","review":"The title to this album describes the music perfectly - it is indeed played with passion, grace and fire; sensitivity and ferocity. Usually, I maintain that musicians who play with speed are just displaying technical skill but this album has parts which are so fast its almost unbelievable and yet it portrays such colour and emotion. 'David', for example, is a wonderful piece combining delicate nuances with ferocious flamenco."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY LORD...THIS ISN'T HUMAN!!!","review":"Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, and Paco De Lucia produce some of the finest acoustic guitar work ever recorded. Everything about this album is perfect. They play Flamenco the way it's meant to be played. If you're looking for something that obliterates the likes of Ottmar Liebert, \\"Passion, Fire, and Grace\\" is it. Don't take my word for it; listen for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly impressive","review":"I have recently read this book, and I have to say that I'm less than impressed with it. When I started it, I was pleased and relieved that it was so easy to read and entertaining, but after a couple of chapters of Eagleton's witticisms and biting humor, I found myself waiting for the \\"theory\\" to kick in...and it took him until the last three chapters. The book seems to be primarily a rant directed against capitalism (i.e.-the United States, though he does make a tiny disclaimer about this in the postscript), and while it's not surprising coming from an alleged Marxist, it does eventually begin to wear on the reader--at least on this reader. He has good points, but After Theory really feels more like a soapbox for a fist-shaking rant than a discussion of the decades that have comes after literary theory's \\"golden age\\" of 1965-1980. I was really hoping for more out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dour Marxist Anti-American Screed","review":"Terry Eagleton is clearly bitter. Bitter about the status of America in the global community, bitter that his beloved Marxist dogma has been relegated to the rubbish bin of history. He does, however, have some perceptive things to say about the legacy of critical theory. What will replace theory as the new academic fad when theory finally vanishes from the intellectual horizon of the college English department? What will we read when Foucault, Derrida, Barthes and Althusser have been thoroughly debunked? Could it be...the source texts themselves?! Isn't that revolutionary?!! Someone might actually read...a novel! Or a poem! Oh, be still my beating heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Commisar's disenchantment with theory:","review":"After Theory by Terry Eagleton is a the typical product of a man who has set himself up a commissar of culture.Eagelton doesn't so much argue his points as pontificate.
