I forced myself to finish that chapter only to be even more pissed off when Mary went on to sleep with him in anger (how dumb).

And why do the brothers talk like they do? It is just wrong - written wrong. This book is flawed. The idea behind the series has potential but it just has to be better plotted than this.

Pleeease, the whole vampire thing is more believable than Ugly Betty getting Brad Pitt, and at least Betty is funny, but Mary...she's just B O R I N G! I still can't believe he falls for her.

She feels that sometimes something else is looking out through his eyes.Rhage knows he needs to claim Mary for his own. His beast also recognises Mary as it's mate, and she is the only one that can soothe Rhage after a transformation.The ending is perfect, a real tear jerker. My heart really broke for Rhage.

I suspect that when I finish Lover Awakened, I will change my mind again and want Zhadist although he is the \\"ugliest and meanest\\" of the warriors.What the heck, I will take them all. Read this series and see for yourself what an exciting adventure it is getting to know the warriors and their history. I'm off to read book 4 which focuses on Butch, the cop.

I held out for 1 day. I finished the book this morning in one sitting. I am soo hooked!If you thought that Dark Lover was good. Lover Eternal only gets better!I loved how JR Ward brings a funky, hard core and hip edge to these characters. And what's even better is how she fleshes out the \\"supporting cast\\" (Tohr, Zsadist, V, Butch, etc.) She manages to make everyone 3-dimensional, without sacrificing or rushing the storyline.

Human. terminally ill, Mary meets Rhage through a meeting as set up by her neighbour Bella(vampire) with the brothers at their compound on a matter regarding a mutual friend.Their path to finding love, mutual acceptance and devotion is just as gut wrenchingly beautiful as Dark Lover.

Whenever I flip the page and the attention turns to the \\"lessers\\" I become so disinterested.

If you've only seen her as an actress (and she's a fine one, too!), do yourselves a favor and buy this cd. You'll enjoy it like you've never imagined. This is a fantastic album, and she is a *fantastic* lady: talented, supremely intelligent, witty, passionate and personally one of the kindest human beings I have ever known.

Briefly put, Venus Diamond is on a case again, although she gets into it indirectly. The Greedy are seeking to profit from the Protectors of near-extinct wildlife. The Moralists and the Environmentalists are in there, too.There were too many plot elements to keep track of; too many subplots that do little to advance the major thread; too many \\"just-in-time-and-place\\" resolutions of sticky issues.Of course, everything gets more-or-less resolved by the last page, but one can hope that Venus' next outing will be more grounded and less contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Venus on Vacation","review":"In the previous Venus Diamond novels we have seen her as a get-tough, get-it-done Fish and Wildlife Agent. Since her marriage to Richard, Venus appears to have lost her way. She is depressed, goal-less, and unable to carry out her investigation of murder and theft in her usual no nonsense, efficient style. She is unable to dodge the bad guys, getting hit over the head more than once. Unfortunately, little sense is knocked into her. Venus needs to get her life back and with the Zen help of Dr. Wong might do so if she can muster up the motivation. Venus does get to realize one of her dreams, that of becoming an astronaut, but this part of the plot is decidedly far fetched.As an avid reader of mysteries, and as a great lover of the out-of-doors, I would like to see Venus return to her roots and her kicking ways. This is not the Venus I have come to know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"Butter dishes are difficult to find in the stores.

It's full of little gems like: \\"This [equation] can be used to parametrically adjust the nonparametric estimate of probability plot shown in...\\". You get equation after equation with no explicit way to get from the abstract math to the plots and conclusions you really need.Not for anyone who needs a quick, practical guide to reliability analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful in practice","review":"The purpose of this book was supposed to serve very broad groups of people: students, statisticians and engineers. Unfortunately, I found this book not quite suitable in engineering practice.From practical point of view, when dealing with reliability estimations, one has to connect mathematical theory with real-life data. It appears that to accomplish this task it is necessary to understand some basic statistical ideas, plus specifics of the subject under consideration. Sometimes common sense knowledge can come in handy. Strangely enough but many fundamental principles are in fact surprisingly simple, elegant and thus beautiful. What is missing in the book is the lack of clear explanations of fundamental statistical concepts that certainly can be presented in a complicated form but in reality they are not. On the other side, the book could serve as a solid textbook to students, statisticians and mathematicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not MY Cup Of Tea","review":"This may be a good novel of the thriller genre; I never finished it. Why? Because of the author's cold calculation that his opening of the book - consisting of a masturbatory scene - would intrigue and tittilate the reader.

I used this productinside an Armour that has doors you can close on the front of it and I'm a bit nervousthat the doors will be closed with the light still on given the amount of heat it gives off.Another problem with this light and the reason I gave it 4 stars is that I don't recall it sayingthat I needed to go to the store and purchase wire and a plug so that I could completely disassemblethe fixture and wire it up a cord myself, which I had to do.

This study of \\"the magic bean\\" is one I'll keep. . .I consider it to be the definitive work, and it has a permanent place on (where else?) my coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unexciting Potporri on Origins and Uses of Coffee","review":"After reading books on this subject by Thorn and Kummer it was a real disappointment to me to find that this so-called \\"ultimate guide\\" fell far short. If your interest lies more in the way coffee is served and consumed here and in other countries this may hold your interest. (The author's dissertation on U.S.practices manages somehow, even there, to omit any references to the influence of the key people at Peets, Starbucks, and Allegro, for example.) It is far too shallow for my taste in the areas of coffee selection by type and location (pros and cons) and blending techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"The poor quality of the film transfers were rather distracting. It made it look like the briteness setting on my TV was too high. Also, 3 out of 4 of these movies are edited versions. Home in Oklahoma was the only movie to be full length. Carson City Kid looks to be missing about 4 minutes. Yellow Rose of Texas has 13 minutes missing, The Cowboy and the Seniorita is missing 23 minutes. Most of what was edited were songs. Unfortunately, no run time information was available on Amazon. The price was pretty good for 4 movies, and if you've never seen Roy in action, it's a cheap way to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"great taste and texture","review":"This is the first almond butter I've tried, and it's really good. It has a great texture - which is mostly grainy rather than crunchy (don't expect it to be like a supermarket peanut butter). I love it on a cracker. The taste is a bit milder than peanut butter, but much richer. When I first opened the jar, I had to put some serious elbow grease into getting the oil and the butter stirred together properly, but I stored it in the fridge (per label instructions) and I had no problems with it separating over the next two weeks as I gradually emptied the jar. Word of caution: this butter has tiny dark fragments in it, I think from the papery almond skins. They can stick all over your teeth and look rather embarrassing! So just do a quick smile check in the mirror when you're done eating it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting almond butter","review":"Due to food allergies I've switched away from peanut butter to cashew and almond butters. This Kettle brand is a winner, I've been fond of it for some time. You can't go wrong with it in the crunchy brand. Try it on Milton crackers....yum.............trust me on this. I'm a nut butter expert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now how can I review this","review":"There's just so much good stuff on this record that it cannot be believed. This is the most cohesive record Wire made and possibly the most challenging. The songs are too good to be true but very dark taking on tales of schizophrenia, break-up in relationships and something about reading the \\" Nouvelle Observateure \\"This album may take a while to get used to but if and when it does.....the highlights are endlessPS Doesn't Once Is Enough sound like a prototype of The Cure's Lovecats? Or are my ears deceiving me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"154 number 1","review":"The vinyl 4 Men With Beards version of this album is superb. The sound is better than the original Harvest/EMI release while the mastering is faithful to the original version. The record itself is very clean sounding with no pops and almost silent between songs (the Beards are good at this). The artwork is beautifully recreated and even improved on in the case of the label. The other two 4 Men With Beards re-releases of the Wire albums Chairs Missing, and Pink Flag are just as good in their magnificent sound and high quaility artwork. Bravo Beards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable but slightly flawed album","review":"The BAD: Overall I prefer _Chairs Missing_, which I think mixes the band's art and pop/rock sides more successfully. A few of the problems: \\"The Other Window\\" is rather self-indulgent (although it has grown on me), \\"A Touching Display\\" goes on for about two minutes too long, \\"Once is Enough\\" seems intentionally annoying. The GOOD: \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" mixes a gothic sensibility with an almost _Pink Flag_ style minimalism. \\"Two People in A Room\\" is a great punk song at heart. Musically, \\"The 15th\\" reminds me of \\"Reuters\\" and \\"I Am The Fly\\" on earlier albums. \\"Map Ref...\\" is one of the band's best songs and is almost worth the price of the album alone. \\"40 versions\\" is a good, menacing track with well-written lyrics. Several other songs are pretty good too, which makes this an essential, if imperfect purchase, if you have any interest in Wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A POST-PUNK CLASSIC","review":"A CLIFFORD HODGE REVIEWThis is one of the overlooked classics of the post-punk era, and probably belongs on the top 20 list with NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS, the first CLASH album, PIL's SECOND EDITION, etc., yet it even gets underrated by WIRE fans. This has a dark, bass sound, associated with groups like JOY DIVISION, but with a more ominous-sounding vocal style. Probably darker than JOY DIVISION, SISTERS OF MERCY, THE CURE, etc., it may have been considered just too gloomy, although it is not so much depressing as it is oppressive, hammering at you more like a series of short Jonathan Kane compositions, but less repetitious, and with deep vocals invoking strange dream-like images. This should be the album for which WIRE is remembered 80 years from now. The LP on original release in 1979, contained a bonus 7-inch, but the CD has 4 extra tracks not on the LP. This is a must-have for fans of progressive punk/new wave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Point of collapse","review":"This strangely titled album is named after the number of concerts Wire had played up to the time they started recording this piece of avantgarde wave rock. \\"154\\" is widely regarded as a classic by Wire, but even after several listenings I just don't know why. As the reviewer below said, I also think it's too arty and out-of-focus. The songs are too sketchy, inconsistent, and chaotically arranged. The melodies are often weak and somehow not fully developed. The only song that leaves a lasting impression is \\"The 15th\\", the rest is hardly memorable and not enjoyable. I think \\"Pink Flag\\", \\"Chairs missing\\", and the subsequent 1986 album \\"The ideal copy\\" are much more rewarding and palatable. Not every snip of music needs to be released, even if it was done by a band called Wire. My advice: Check out the Wire tribute album \\"Whore\\", featuring great cover versions from bands like Godflesh, Laika, Main, and Bark Psychosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Post-Punk Lowpoint","review":"I found this album to be both pretentious and boring. Nearly every song begins very slowly and never really gains momentum. Anybody who has made a few dozen mixtapes knows it's a bad idea to have song after song of slow-burners, and this album lacks anything exciting. The songs themselves are not very interesting or catchy and I found the monotone vocals to be annoying and too artsy for a pop groups own good.Track 3 was okay, an obvious single. The album as a whole is a waste of your money and time. Unless you're a real chin stroker, but personally I'd rather listen to Gang of Four."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Simply the best recording in 1981 of its genre, which it nearly redefines in one fell swoop. Completely unlike Pink Flag in its sonic sophistication, with lyrics as artful as any, anywhere. It is unfair to compare this recording with any other; it is that original and transcendant. Still fresh and deep after nearly 20 years, this is not pop music but rather true Art. Not very accessible, not for everyone; if this recording resonates with you, you will love it, if not, you will find it at the least educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING ALBUM","review":"In my research of Arty Post-Punk(including early industrial and experimental, often the more commercial pop New Wave is mainly referred to as Post-Punk).......I found Wire's 154. One of the interesting things about good Post-Punk is that the bands for the most part do not sound alike. This album is no exception, and in my first listen I did not know what to make of it. But, often that is a good thing because it is an indication that something different is going on(there is no real formula). This music goes in many directions, so you need to have an open ear. It is more cutting edge than popular music of it's time and although it definitely has a definite 80's feel, there are no radio friendly tunes. It was released in 1979, so I suppose it was right on the turning point, and as I researched I found that there is a lot of interesting music to be found from that time. This is a good one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close.. but no Maclaine","review":"I love the movie, I love the score, so why can't they release the CD of the movie? The songs from this show are classics - Big Spender, If They Could See Me Now. AND, in the movie, SAMMY DAVIS JR sings Rhythm of Life. The cast on this album are talented and peppy, and there's a few songs you don't get in the film. Which is all very nice.

You get exactly what is promised in the Editorial Reviews-Description section.

I recommend this tape for judoka of all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Core Throwing Techniques","review":"This is by far the best video I have seen. The quality and content is great. I am currently a Judo instructor at a major University and have been doing Judo for over 20 years.

If you can only buy on tape to help you with your Judo, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Documentary...missing bands gives it 4 stars","review":"Lots of good reviews here... I don't have a lot to add but to reinforce that overall, a comprehensive look (as much as can be squeezed into 2 hours) at Metal by a guy who lives it and has the ability to put a solid 'educational' piece together. My issue is that not only was there precious few mentions of the greatest metal bands such as Led Zep, Judas Priest and even Aerosmith...but NO mention of one of the 'original' Industrial Metal Bands - Sevendust, even in the awesome historical chart ?Along with many other reviewers... we can only hope for a sequel... and again, an excellent DVD Package."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great documentary about metal music and its subcultures","review":"I hit my teenage years in the early 1980s and was introduced to early metal bands and the metal scene by my friend's older brother (a girl growing up in a rural town filled mostly with churches and hair salons). I was immediately hooked and I'm still hooked to this day with no regrets and filled with amazing memories and experiences. This documentary is a must see for any and all metal fans, regardless of age, gender, etc. It brought back great memories of times passed and reminds me why I love this music so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal","review":"This documentary is very well done and the special features on it make the experience even better by looking at the response from viewers.

Kudos to Sam Dunn for finally hitting the nail on the head; while he's been a headbanger since his youth, he didn't make this film so slanted toward metal that it's uninteresting, but at the same time he didn't fall into the usual stereotype traps that make metalheads grit their teeth in most \\"documentaries.\\" If you love metal, see this movie, and if you don't love metal, as Dunn said at the end of the film, \\" . . . we're doing fine without you.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Death metal mom","review":"WOW.

It's impossible to listen to this music and be a cynic. The first track draws you in, and never loosens its grip. Lift to Experience is the greatest band to come from TEXAS in a very long time. They are not country, neither should they be compared to anyone. The guitar is EQ'd perfectly. The bass lines hover in a trance just underneath the wall of guitar perfection. Their Drummer Andy Young should be compared to likes of Keith Moon or John Bonham. The energy of the TEXAS JERUSALEM CROSSROADS flows with passion and realism.

But this thing was a disaster! Predictable. Too much cutesy dialog. And what's with Susan and her Harvard Ph.D.? So what? Give it a rest! Characters one dimensional and shallow. Seems Mr. Parker was wanting badly to wrap this turkey up but just couldn't find a way to do it. So he plods along with a plot that was clear after the first 25 pages (or sooner). Yeah, yeah he's made $$$s writing for years and has been a top crime writer for years. Taking nothing away, but maybe it's time to do something else.

I did not really like the book in it entirety - story was stupid. Spenser in this book - is just not a rational detective - take on a case and would not drop it even with no client at the middle to the end of the story. Did not get any financial rewards out of it but alot of expenses and heartache to boot. Stupid detective in my opinion; not a business man at all! Kind of a fool in a lot of respects!

I thought this book was tired. Does he really need the money to churn out less than stellar Spenser novels?The plot was not terribly interesting and the repartee was just flat. I also have felt that Spenser's so-called observations about feminist/feminism are the couch potato sort and I'd expect more from someone who usually writes better. Admittedly, the last several RBP books have made some misguided statements about feminists/feminism that read like he has merely gleaned through a newspaper and done no research.I don't know if I'll read the next Spenser novel at this rate.

There are events in the early part of the book that are actually fully contradicted by later events (follow the trail of Tony Marcus's early visit to Spenser).There are numerous logic and plot mistakes.

This is her second comedy special for HBO done in 2009 and she comments on Barack Obama's presidency, her new life in a interracial lesbian marriage, Bikini waxing and being a performer on a all gay cruise ship with 3,200 couples. She is amazingly funny, honest and provocatively rough around the edges. Her ability to entertain is enormous and she is a strong and fearless woman. Wanda has much strength to admire, sharp wit to enjoy and it all comes out in fearless comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG....non stop funny!!!","review":"This is one of the funniest stand up acts I have ever seen.

If you can find them, Conair now (finally!) offers a replacement foil & cutter kit at half the price of new unit.

Stick with the studio recordings!","review":"This cd is interesting only as a novelty recording. I love The Monkees, but this live show just isn't very good. The sound is bad and unfortunately the boys just can't reproduce the songs on stage (they didn't really play on most of them originally, and they don't have the right equipment set up to do a decent job anyway). It's sort of embarrassing: Mike's eternal chord strumming (no leads or riffs...just chords); Mickey's limited drumming (drumming that he never actually did on most of the studio versions of the songs they cover).

Most of the time they tried mixing it down right to a reel to reel, which meant you took what you got and couldn't go back to fix it later.The only thing I could really complain about is the mix. Sometimes you can't hear dolenz's voice, sometimes the person singing background is louder than the lead, sometimes a guitar overpowers the rest.But the performance is great!

It comes with 2 rails but with my MP15, the gas tube runs along the top of the barrel so you can not mount the rail to the top of the carbine hand guard. The bolts are too long and will not allow you to bolt onto the top of the hand guard with a \\"non piston\\" version. Still a great price for only using one of the rails.Installation was a breeze. Pull off plastic carbine hand guard, pry off heat shield, line up rail, bolt on with supplied allen wrench, re-install heat shield, replace hand guard, and you're set.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing value","review":"You honestly cannot beat these rails for the price.

Overall, the performances, color, sound, and filming is done quite well. The film is shot better than \\"Rock Show\\" but \\"Paul Is Live In The New World\\" is slighly better.

The sound on DVD is very good and I believe it worth any cent you spend to buy it. I've got mine here in Brazil a few weeks ago and i am still watching on the screen to remind that day. I think the only think they missed it was the lack of the documentary about the tour which was released after the VHS was done and so this is why I gave four stars to this title.

The 89/90 tour was fantastic, but this film captures none of the magic, and actually makes the tour look bad.

The only downside was that it sweats a lot and doesn't fit in my car's cup holder. I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rapid Ice Coolers","review":"Very disappointed. The discription says it is a two pack, but there is only one cooler in the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Works if you have COLD soda and it's frozen. After 2 cans it's done. Yes you get two of the sleeves, but I'm not pleased. Better luck with a 99 cent foam coozie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't freeze completely","review":"I wanted a product that would keep my drink cold at work. I work in an office so this shouldn't be a difficult task. These can chillers keep my drink cold for about an hour, maybe. I think they would work great if they froze solid (as they claim) or if they were insulated. I was very disappointed in this product and will continue to search for a drink chiller that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless","review":"These are absolutely worthless. Not only do they not KEEP cans cold, they actually suck the coldness out of them. Mine went into the trash fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"All six of my guests we're EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!","review":"I purchased two sets of the can/bottle holders for an outdoor pool party. Sure they looked sleek & assumed they would do a great job (especially being frozen & all of drinks we're well chilled.) After we all had used them, we all agreed...a big waste of money. They do not freeze solid, do not keep drinks cold longer than ~20 minutes-if fact we all agreed that my old foam drink kozies that I purchased for 99 did a better job. We we're even sitting at our shaded patio table with an overhead fan blowing on us. A real waste of money! I read & trusted all those positive reviews. I want to know what they were using? Maybe they were using them in the dead of winter in Alaska. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"efficient product","review":"Received the Vacu-Vin chillers as a gift to give to my mother. They spend a lot of time by their pool in the heat of the south and needed some extra chillers for canned beverages.

Maintain the cold temps of soda or beer cans for long periolds of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Vacu Vin Can Coolers","review":"I have used these before and they really work great. They take up very little space and definately live up to thier billing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and perfect for wine and champagne.","review":"We keep these in the freezer ready for when we are going to serve wine. It brings a bottle of red down to the proper temp pretty quickly and will keep your whites where they need to be for about an hour.We also throw these in our picknick basket when we want to keep something cool or for tailgateing and need to keep the wine cool. These have proved durable so far as they have not ripped or cracked which is a problem for items that are frequently frozen, thawed and frozen over and over. They still remain very flexible.Simple and effective, what more could you ask for.They have an attractive silver/chrome outer covering or you can get on with a french resturant scene. We got both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes solid?? What??","review":"These drink coolers do keep your drink cold for a little while. On the other hand, they absolutely do NOT freeze solid. They are thawed completely in about two hours. When I put a cold refrigerated beverage(carbonated) in the drink cooler it makes the drink slush instantly and foam out the top forcing me to pour half of it out. all in all, disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars, but only because of omissions.","review":"If you must only have a snapshot of this incredible band, then a \\"best of\\" will do. Criminally, most of their crucial songs didn't even make the cut. Tragically under-represented is the MIND-BLOWING \\"Over the Edge\\" album, as well as the \\"Youth of America\\" EP. That's not to mention that \\"Is This Real\\" ain't even included (rights weren't held by Restless). All bitching aside, this is a taste of one of THE BEST bands of the late 70's and 80's (yah, yah, I know Sage is still around). FIND AND BUY ALL REISSUES. THEY ARE NOW AVAILABLE ON \\"GIFT OF LIFE\\" RECORDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"India did it again!","review":"I am so thrilled that India Arie's second album is just as amazing as her first. She is an incredible woman, and inspires with me with her voice and guitar grooves on \\"God is Real\\" and \\"Little Things\\". A softer sounding album, you can tell she has given a lot of thought to her music and truly has a passion for it. That's what I respect most about her. You can really see it in Voyage to India, with her song about loss and death \\"Good Man\\". One of the best songs on the cd has got to be \\"Slow Down\\". It's one of those (like most of her songs) that you can really sing along to and understand what she's tryin' to say. I highly recommend getting this album. India Arie will definitely be around for a long time, and she's proving it with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voyage to India","review":"Disappointing. The songs are undistinguishable. They run into one long momotone music of the same rhytm and not much variety. I heard one song in the art galery and was atracted to it not knowing that one song is over and over through out the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is like therapy!","review":"After listening to Acoustic Soul too many times to count, I really thought India would be out of good material. This album proves that mentality way wrong. Voyage to India truly is a start-to-finish CD; beautiful from beginning to end. India truly has a musical genius within her; I can't wait to see what she's going to pull off next! I honestly would have paid twice what this CD is worth; I've probably listened to it more times than any other album I own. The lyrics will give you goosebumps and truly make you grateful for everything you have. Now that's what I call beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful and beautiful","review":"Whenever i listen to this album i feel like i'm travelling... i feel like im somewhere abroad and somewhere tropical and hot... her voice, acoustic and whole vibe she sends just sends me such a nice feeling!my favourite track on this album would have to be \\"good man\\"..and also \\"complicated melody\\".all the rest i love and think are fantastic but these ones stand out to me for some reason..! good man almost made me cry when i heard this... its so emotional and sad and hope it aint true! complicated melody is pretty and tune flows very well!love it, love her, love her name! well done india xxx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rushed Voyage to India","review":"This cd is good, but I think Acoustic Soul is much better. The reason I feel this cd was rushed is because there are some really good songs, and then some really mediocre songs. If India would have spent more time on this album I think it could have been much better. One thing I admire about India is her lyrics are always self motivating and from the heart. I don't think that India is preaching, but sharing things with her listeners that motivates her life. My favorite song on this album is \\"Get it Together\\". I heard this song while watching \\"Brown Sugar\\"-the movie. This is the song that made me buy the cd. Other strong songs are \\"Good Man\\", \\"Slow Down\\", and her interludes are always so healing. Songs like \\"Beautiful Surprise\\" and the wacky \\"Complicated Melody\\" get skipped when listening to this cd. I am not as impressed as I was with Acoustic Soul, especially since I didn't catch on until a year later. All in all this is a good cd to the add to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Voyage","review":"I really enjoyed Acoustic Soul so when I found out about this new release, I was excited to give it a try. After borrowing a friend's CD, I really felt drawn to it. Though some of the thoughtful insight of Acoustic Soul may be missing in lieu of her ode to the current love of her life, I found quite of few gems in this piece. I especially like \\"Get It Together,\\" \\"It's the Little Things\\" and \\"The One.\\" Unlike some of the reviewers, I didn't find anything \\"preachy\\" at all...perhaps it may have hit a little too close to home for some? I love artists like India, Erykah Badu and Jill Scott who write for those who are in touch with their vulnerability. I am a \\"hometown\\" fan of Ms. India and feel that her music will always be for the \\"long-haul\\"You go girl!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Rounded CD.","review":"This was a pretty good cd, though I found that most of the songs seemed sound alike. No track seemed that much different than the track before it. Arie's voice seems almost monotone on some tracks. The strengths of this cd overall out weigh the weaknesses though I wouldn't say that this was her best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Beautiful Surprise\\" and that's \\"The Truth\\"","review":"Yo Go India! I love practically every single song on this CD. Your sophomore effort actually surpasses Acoustic Soul in my opinion and that CD was awesome.I can only imagine what you are going to do on your third album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inlove w/this cd","review":"It's all about where you are at in life, I'm w/Ms. India.Arie on this one. There is not a song on this cd that me, my sisters, my brother-inlaw, nieces and nephews (ages 3-15) didn't like. This cd is evidence of life's lessons learned and applied. She is such a positive and inspiring person. When asked by others how is it all I can say is \\"pure\\". I am a gospel music listener but I would take this cd, so far, over many gospel cd's I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love her!!","review":"I love her new CD. Ms Arie rises to the top again. She is everything!! Her introspection on this CD radiates through her music. Excellent purchase....you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this woman","review":"It was not as good as her first; yet, I will buy anything buy and/or represented by this talented queen. Her music is good for the soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Missing Something","review":"I bought this, thinking that it would be better than her first album, which I didn't like. I have to say, after multiple listens, the songs don't really stick. The production is somewhat better than her debut album, but again the album is lacking a vibe. The lyrics sometimes delve too simplistically; her voice is decent. At first review, I thought this might be a pretty good album. But after more and more listens, I'm finding that this album lacks a certain amount of emotional depth. So I guess if you liked her first album, then you'll like this album I guess. But if you didn't like her first album, then you won't be too impressed with this album either, as I apparently have come to realize. We'll have to see what comes next I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"India has topped her original CD","review":"India has done it once again. She continues to take her music to new heights, pouring out love and soul. The first time I listened to this CD, I laughed and cried (which was a first for me). Her music is very real, and it's obvious that she really puts her soul into her music. I was even surprised at the emotions her CD evoked.This CD is up there with some of my best gospel CDs in terms of inspiration. Each time I listen to this CD, it moves me in a totally different way. The love songs on this CD are not just your usual love songs, they are much deeper than that. They will definitely make you reflect on your relationships and how important they are to you. I love this new CD. Keep up the good work India!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT SHE COULD POSSIBLY DO NEXT!!!","review":"I have been impatiently awaiting for this album:)...People say that they played a few of her songs on the radio so much that they didn't care to purchase the CD. Well... that is there lost because if you don't listen to the CD you are truly missing out:(Anyway - Back to the Voyage:) I could not imagine how India could possibly top the previous album. She did \\"NOT\\" fail me:) To be honest, when I listened to Acoustic Soul... I loved \\"EVERY TRACK\\". Now, with the Voyage... I love it... but I can't say better than the first. I am not disappointed at the least bit and I love 8 out of 10 songs:)That song \\"truth\\" is hot!!!! She has quite a bit of songs that are nice. She must be in love or something because she is showing how much she appreciates her \\"King\\":) I love her for that:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've bought in a few years","review":"I love this cd. I don't take it as being too preachy as some of the other reviewers... I take it as being inspirational and from the heart .

I would recommend this to anyone that wants to hear some fresh and spirit warming r & b ."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've been let down","review":"I have a copy of India's Acoustic Soul CD and it is wonderful. That entire CD is good, which is why I found this album so disappointing. It just doesn't seem to pop like the first. It's just a bunch of muttering/moaning that doesn't grap the listener's attention. It doesn't say 'Hey, listen to what I have to say'. The best song I found was the bonus track 'Interested'. Now that song grabs me ... the rest is just back noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WONDERFUL","review":"I love this CD. You can listen to it anytime, while doing anything. I can't choose a favorite song, I love them all. Great follow up album, I never doubted her ability. I can't wait for album #3."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened???","review":"This album is not even close to Acoustic Soul. It had a few decent moments scattered throughout which earns it 2 Stars but you can tell she rushed this one for the Grammy Deadline, it sounds half-assed.\\"Acoustic Soul\\" was one of the best albums of 2001. I personally think \\"Voyage to India\\" is a waste of money. Hey, everyone has their own opinion. I just hope she takes her time on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED!","review":"I respect and applaud her lyrics and style but please come clean, she can't sing! Everyone rips Ashanti for her vocals but because India has braids and does the earthy thing with limited vocal range we claim she raised the bar?! Don't buy the hype, look to Jill Scott and Heather Headley!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of this album","review":"India.arie is one of the most talented singers/songwriters I know at this moment.She is so pure and it shows through her songs and her lyrics. This album has helped me through many of my bad times. \\"Voyage to India\\" is a wonderfull album and I would recommend this album to anyone. Her first album \\"Acoustic Soul\\" still sticks with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Nice Surprise! A Must Have!","review":"When I saw India Arie in concert this summer, I thought for sure I would NEVER buy her CDs! After hearing a couple of tracks on the radio which I really like I decided to give her a try. I must say Voyage to India is the Bomb! I love her messages, the arrangement, music, and everything! I'm definitely feeling her on all tracks! She speaks the truth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like a sinner","review":"A friend of mine has been trying to get me to review CDs for a while and I've resisted, but I couldn't resist any longer with this release. I really liked \\"Acoustic Soul.\\" It wasn't my favorite of all time, but it was good. With \\"Voyage\\" I just feel like a dirty sinner. Well, maybe that's too extreme. Just as another reviewer said, I feel the CD is too preachy. It just feels like Dr. Phil, Iyanla and Anthony Robbins rolled into one with musical accompaniment. I enjoy Jill, Erykah and Tracy more because they add a vurnerable, weak side to their music that I feel is lacking here. I like artists who convey a message that they are human beings that falter at times. I just don't feel that genuinely coming across in this release. Not even with the inclusion of the song \\"Slow Down.\\" As another reviewer said, I like the music, but I just can't get past the lyrics. They were meant to uplift, but just manage to bash the listener over the head with faux positivity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for the SOUL","review":"I bought this c.d.just for the song \\"Get it Together\\" love the song really touches me inside!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"soothing","review":"I luv this cd. It is sooo relaxing. It was in perfect condition. I would order from this seller again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, well a return to Soul!","review":"This record is without a doubt one of the better soul records of the 2000's. I was afraid i was going to have to keep buying older CDs to get quality, but India proved me wrong. I love most tracks here, skip the stupid interludes and you'll be ok. Enjoy the talent and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of her most important songs...","review":"...are exactly the ones excerpted on this page! India's sound is unique and she hasn't changed it, except you really hear her as a bandleader on this album.But the tunes you can sample above are absolute home runs for her. Everyone says how uplifting she is, but how ROMANTIC the best parts of this album are is the big SURPRISE in \\"Voyage to India.\\"Man, I have never come across a writer who speaks of love this way....and the one ballad that really speaks to the families of Sept. 11 is here, \\"Good Man,\\" which she performed movingly at \\"Concert for America.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Voyage","review":"I encourage everyone to purchase this release. There is no comparison to \\"Acoustic Soul\\", so it's best to eliminate any preconceived notions before hand. This may prove difficult for some, who have grown to familiarize themselves with Acoustic's flow. It's evident that India has grown musically and as an individual. Regardless of weither or not the new material takes some getting used to, \\"Voyage To India\\" is a STUNNING work of art, and should be acknowledged as such. Definate standouts include: \\"Little Things\\", \\"Talk To Her\\", \\"The Truth\\", \\"Beautiful Surprise\\" \\"Get It Together\\", \\"Headed In The Right Direction\\", \\"The One\\", \\"Complicated Melody\\", \\"Good Man\\" and \\"God Is Real\\". However, like most albums it has it's displaced moments. Ultimately, the undeniable truth is that India remains a vessel of innovation and sheer, unadulterated resilience. She is one of few diamonds in the ruff, and this project proves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twice is very nice","review":"This CD is proof in the pudding that India is not just some fly by night artist. This amazingly beautiful sistah has MIGHTY skills; skills that are as long as the nubian locs she adorns. Funky beats, serious lyrics . . . and it just gets better. Don't walk, run to your nearest record store, or, if you prefer, keystroke as fast as your fingers can and get this work or art. You won't be disappointed.You may want to pick up two; one for the house and one for the car; this baby will get some serious rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album, strong vocals, great material","review":"A very surprising sophomore release from India.Arie. Surprising as it is better than her debut album. The material is much stronger, lyrics much better and vocals about the same. I'd really like to see her do some full-vocal songs. She has the talent to do it. The album is drenched in jazzy, soulful overtones. A pleasure to the ears.This album has great replayability, especially in room full of burning candles...you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Sound","review":"I don't usually listen to pop or R&B, but India Arie has a sound that goes well beyond that description. I love the acoustic guitar used throughout her songs, and her laidback storytelling style. It has a relaxing, feel good sound, that I know I'll enjoy for a long time. Big Thumbs Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"First, and I have to say this, India.Arie was robbed at the Grammys! Having said that, Voyage to India is powerful, musically and lyrically. She has again opened up the heart, mind and spirit of this listener and lover of her MUSIC. All you have to do is listen, I mean truly listen with your heart, and you will know that this \\"Minister of Music\\" is a God send.She has brought back to us music with a real meaning. Something that has been missing since the 60's & 70's a time when there was a message in the music, you know, Stevie, the Commodores, Earth Wind & Fire, Marvin, and the list goes on and on.India.Arie, thank you, and please don't ever change your focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A JAPANESE ATOMIC BOMB PROGRAM? GREAT READ!","review":"I'd never heard of a Japanese atomic bomb program during World War II until I read this book.

READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live Album","review":"I am listening to the album as I type! Song playing? Folding Money. I am more of a new Radney Foster fan. I wasn't old enough to enjoy Foster and Lloyd. I do enjoy their recordings now! This album is the best live recording I've heard, simply because the emphasis is on the music. Not the crowd. You can sing along with it. Besides that, the songs are great! I just wish he would have did a live recording of \\"Texas in 1880.\\" That is my favorite song of his. While the new version is great, although I like the old Foster and Lloyd version better. Any true country fan should buy this album. Foster is surely better than some of country's bigger starts, such as, Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, etc. I am kind of glad he has not reached that level of success, because I think that kind of success would hurt his music, at least for what I like. Anyway drop whatever you are doing and get this album at your local grocery! You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Series 6 of West Wing","review":"We've become \\"wingnuts\\" and have really enjoyed this sixth series, even though there are character changes happening. Wouldn't it be great if the real Whitehouse was as caring and thinking as these programs portray?"},{"rating":"2","title":"format swap?","review":"I haven't investigated but I suspect that West Wing makers have been seduced by the dubious advantages of HD. Compared to earlier seasons the lighting seems by turns either harsh with massivley blown highlights or mushy and soft. I am a DoP and I have heard rumours that the West Wing sets and lighting rig were retained without being adjusted for the inferior output of HD compared to that of Super35mm. It's a shame if it has gone down this route as one of the great positives for TV is the high quality offered by US mutliseasonal dramas like; Carnivale, 24, Wired etc if this quality is to be dumped for a bean-counting production excersise then we are all the poorer.On a purely non technical level WW6 won't disappoint it retains all the pulling power & punch of previous seasons and is emminently watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb television","review":"You could write a review for any season of this show and it would basically repeat the same thing - this show was amazing. Some of the finest Tv ever aired. The writing was never watered down for the masses. I respected the pacing of this show. You absolutely had to pay attention to every second. This way, you became a part of the saga, not simply a viewer. The addition of Jimmy Smits and Alan Alda to the cast added yet more firepower to an already explosive cast. Quite possibly the best portrayal of a President by Martin Sheen - at least, the kind of President we all want."},{"rating":"1","title":"West Wing; Sixth season","review":"The sixth season of West Wing is well produced. But there are changes to the characters, which makes it unlike previous seasons. C.J. becomes Chief of Staff, the President developes M.S., Donna leaves her support position to Josh and Josh leaves to campaign for someone, Charlie is no longer assistant to the President and of course Sam left in an earlier season. It is not the same program in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The West Wing - The Complete Sixth Season","review":"wonderful. No other drama like it.

The first four were jems and possibly the most intelligent show on television. The sixth season was a marvelous side of the West Wing that had not been fully explored yet: a true campaign. We learn to love Alda and respect Jimmy Smitts more and more as each episode progresses. This season was what saved the show from a embarrassing cancellation, which came only a year later.

Thankfully, that is what I did before considering buying The West Wing season 6 . To find that English subtitles are not included is just plain wrong. Evidently people with handicaps such as hard of hearing are of no concern to the corporate decision makers at Warner Brothers. Shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In this season CJ is promoted to Chief of Staff. It is obvious that her unrealistic promotion (in contrast to her character from season 1) was meant to infuse new energy into the show. Every other scene is about contrasting her womanhood with being Chief of Staff. She seemed authentic in her previous role while she comes off as angry and whiny much of the time in her new one. Her character as a whole thus ceases to be appealing and convincing. The rapid dialog comes off as stale and empty. I also felt that Josh (who still wears a back-pack over his shoulder) is a role model for the show's college-aged viewers and is not exactly role model material (he is completely obsessed with politics and neglects other aspects of life). While it's an overall disappointment, Martin Sheen is AMAZING (as he always is)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more English subtitles","review":"Suddenly dropping the English subtitles after the 5th season is a terrible thing to do to viewers who depended on them. The rapidfire dialogue with no subtitles makes the 6th season almost unwatchable by viewers who can't hear well. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Downhill Fast","review":"I own and loved West Wing until... Season 6 and 7 was no longer witty, intelligent, funny etc. I was surprised that Season 6 was not canceled half the way through.

This is most unfortunate in that some of the dialog is nearly impossible to follow 100% without sub titles. In an informal viewing, not one person was able to catch all of the dialog. One of the actors was even affectionately nick named \\"Mumble Blond\\" after viewing this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"The English subtitles are gone starting with this season.","review":"I love the West Wing, but I guess the makers of this DVD boxed set didn't think that deaf people would want to watch past season 5.

What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"why are there no english subtitles?","review":"I have watched seasons 1 through 5 as I walk on my treadmill. The briskness of the language in this series demands use of the subtitle feature, especially over the noise of the treadmill.

Wasted my time and delayed my project"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst plugs ever","review":"Having a separate piece that you have to individually thread the wires through is the worst thing to ever happen to an RJ45 plug. I used to be able to arrange the wires in my fingers, slip them into the plug and crimp - 15 seconds max. With these plugs it takes forever to thread the wires through the near invisible holes in the loading carriage. I will never buy these again.By the way - I tried to rate this item with 0 stars, but Amazon would not let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtually fool proof","review":"I have been looking for the RJ45 plugs that allow you to push the wires through the nose to be trimmed off after you crimp. That allows you to confirm each wire is in the proper slot and none are doubled up or held back by the slot dividers. This style is different... it offers a little insert that you slide on the wires before inserting in the plug and crimping..... a very slick feature that speeds assembly and avoids getting two wires in one slot or having a divider push one wire back. Not quite what I was looking for but better than the standard plug end."},{"rating":"1","title":"rj45 connectors from hell","review":"These are by far the worst rj45 plugs ever. For years, I used to crimp cables with relative ease, and usually get them to work on the first crimp. I must have used about 20 plugs on just two new cat 6 wires, and I still couldn't get them to work. Each time I tested with my cable tester, I get faults on different wires. Upon closely examining the rj45 plug head after crimping, I notice that the metal teeth connectors are either slanted, or completely miss the wires. Save your money, and buy better rj45 plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat6 Micro RJ45 Plugs/Modular","review":"Product came as advertised in a neat small package. Cost of shipping too high. RJ45 plugs/modulars with loadbars fit CAT6 solid cable. However, crimping did not result in a good connection. Tried numerous times but each time the Trendnet cable tester would indicate a faulty pin. It was always at a different cable pin. Finally used ten year old RJ45 plugs/modulars without inserting the loadbar and every patch cable made work perfectly. I wanted to return the RJ45 plugs/modulars but why add the cost of shipping the plugs back. A lesson learned, read the reviews of others, and learn from their mistakes. I don't blame the company but the CAT6 plugs/modulars are not reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor CAT6 ends","review":"The ends that I ordered were for CAT6 cabling. I needed these to complete a project in my home. The first one I tried did not work becuase the small plastic pice that keeps the pairs separated did not work as it should. I replaced the small piece and I was able to get it to work, but when the pairs were placed in the end pice and crimped, the brass pins that are supposed to penetrate the wire kept missing the wire. Good price, but poor product. I had to go elsewhere to replace the order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this Book!!","review":"If I did not already know that George's life was actually this dramatic and exciting, I would surely not beleive it was possible.

Besides a very sterile type studio recording, what's up with that guitar tone!!? Anyone who's been playing as long as he has should know how to get a decent guitar tone and even if he's getting older and losing his hearing, why didn't the producer say something?

I won't lie, the information needed for the test was covered, along with every other bit of information in the fields of biology and chemistry. I could have (and did) get more out of outline general chem and bio books. The practice questions are much more difficult than the standard PCAT questions.

I found the book extremely helpful and I scored quite high on the exam. The outlines of what to study were great. It pointed me in the right direction for my studying, especially since I had been out of school for a couple of years. It also has a full length practice exam with answers.

The questions are harder than the actual questions that are asked on the PCAT but it allows you to go over the subject so you understand it. I think it was most helpful with all the tips like what to do the week before the test, answers that can easily be excluded etc. I'm very happy that I got the book because it made me feel very prepared even though the questions were difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preparation for PCAT","review":"I had difficulties reading it; too much information I did not need on the actual PCAT exam..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","review":"THIS BOOK WAS NOT EVEN DESIGNED FOR THE PCAT.

WHAT ARE THE VETS? I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO STUDY FOR THE PCAT. THE OUTLINES ARE WAY TOO IN DEPTH.

Do not buy this book -- it will not help you! The outline goes way too in depth. For example, it suggests that you learn the names & structures of all 20 amino acids--you don't need to know stuff like that. It goes into a lot of organic chemistry you don't need. You don't need to know the taxonomy it insists you do. Peterson's and Barron's are much more representative of the type of information on the test.This book is a big waste of money. Get the other 2 & work some problems from a general chem text book. Take an anatomy course before the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Preparation","review":"Overall, this book is a poor representation of the PCAT. The verbal, biology, and chemistry sections are much more in-depth than the actual PCAT. However, the math and reading comprehension section were useful.

It's full of skateboarding (I give Bam his props here), pranks, and skits most of which are very humorous but to be honest some can be boring or too stupid. All 4 DVDs are good to watch with a group of friends for some insane laughs or just for the shock value of some of the content.

Yeah Steve-O and Johnny have their moments, but Bam, Raab, Dunn, Bran, are the true geniuses behind Jackass, Knoxville simply throws his name around, but these guys are the real talent. The best skits on Jackass were taped years ago while making the cKy videos.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Holiday CD Or MP 3","review":"This is one of the best Christmas CD's period! I can't go without it over the holidays. You won't regret buying this as an MP 3 or CD. I have turned so many friends on to this holiday music, and it is now a staple with all our holidays. The Wilson sisters voices are so special.

I badly smashed my finger, it immediately started swelling, bruising, hurting, etc. I used ice a couple of times and the ointment a couple of times and by morning 95% of the bruising was gone and it was just a little stiff.Also, if you have, for example, a sore back, do as it says. Three times, at least, a day and what a relief. Last, but not least, it doesn't have any odor like ben gay etc.."},{"rating":"2","title":"18th century ladies","review":"This is an excellent book.

But I was very impressed with the music. I then tracked down the soundtrack for the motion picture. Misha Segal did a very good job for creating the score. Harriet Schock does well on the vocals for \\"Don Juan Triumphant\\" and the soundtrack was more malevolent and holds up very well on CD. Though I was disaponited that it didn't have the score for one scene in the film where the opera critic is killed. That is one of my favorite music scenes in the film and was hoping it would be on the soundtrack, but it wasn't, oh well, I enjoyed it anyway and Misha Segal is one of my favorite film composers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, good condition on delivery.","review":"I decided to get the music CD along with the movie. Eventually, the CD arrived in its usual, expected good condition.Because that the CD is a movie soundtrack, to play each particular track on the CD is to hear again the atmosphere of a given scene -- and this movie soundtrack really fits the movie like a glove. Some of the tracks are tender, others are scary or even violent-sounding -- and each track fits both the story in general and its given scene in particular.Whatever you might think of the movie (and I prefer Arthur Kopit's \\"Erik Carriere\\" over Robert Englund's \\"Erik Destler\\"), the music on this CD is great music, a lovely addition to anybody's music collection, something that you can almost imagine Leroux's Erik actually writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber","review":"He is great, he is terrific and i love especially The Fantom of The Oper"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misled by the image!","review":"I was extremely disappointed when I received the Modern Losing Trick Count and it was a flipper that had only highlights from the book version.

It's an odd old schnitzel: the screwy tempi, the Teutonic cast of the orchestra, the somewhat movie soundtrack result are the only things that make half-sense of the Humperdinck as a coupling.For that's all we get: a Hummel-gothic children's story that makes for thigh-slapping hoak. Outside the German repertoire, Klemperer would make real sense in Slavic music, modern and contermporary music, but French music left him pretty much defenseless and we wonder if there is any rationale for perpetuating something like this.For the Fantastique: your best bets are Paray (extraoridinary), Munch, Argenta, Markevitch, Martinon. For the Humperdinck, keep it at a filler level and take your pick or chances, whichever."},{"rating":"1","title":"NBA Live jumped the shark a long time ago.","review":"NBA Live doesn't even try to be a simulation any more!

I have been a fan of NBA Live before it was even called NBA Live(NBA Showdown 94 for those who are down with it). Oh, you can't even forget Bulls vs. Blazers & the rest of them. NBA Live 2003 is nothing but sweet. The best part is how you can change the teams jerseys & let them wear the retro jerseys, but the flaw with that is that they only offer either the home or away retro jersey & they even have the alternate jerseys for teams that have them. A great game that you will never stop playing as long as you don't have Dance Dance Revolution(check out my review on it) or the new DDRMax, which I have yet to play.

However, serious gamers should avoid this game like the plague. The serious negatives include:1.There is no way to play D. Occasionaly you can take a charge, but blocking a drive to the hoop is way too hard, stopping a drive is near impossible.2. Fast Breaks are available on every play. Again this is totally unrealistic3. Your players never get tired. No need to sub.4. In Franchise mode, even if you win, your players always want out. I've played multiple sims with a variety of teams and keeping your stars (or attracting new ones) is very difficult.Overall, this game is so unrealistic I'd avoid even renting the thing. If you want just a fast-break, coast to coast, arcade game though, you'll be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Props","review":"This game is off the HOOK!!! i love it. i did not buy it last year i was really feeling the nba 2k2 but the one they did this year was horrible i mean horrible i had it for 2 days and returned it to get this. i love this years nba live. you guys and girls really went all out i am very pleased. please don't mess up next years like sega messed up this years nba 2k3. it was a very bad game, but nba live redeemed itself from last year 100%. very awesome game. the music is bangin too. i love everything about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WILL SOMEBODDY PLEASE PLAY SOME DEFENSE.......","review":"2 Words.....DEFENSE PLEASE. Man I thought I liked this game when I first started to play it, but once I got the hang of it, then it sucked. They don't play any type of defense, whether your playing the computer or a human opponent. 3 pointers are too easy to make, it's just run and gun all game long and to me that is not Basketball.

In all the Lives they have made over the years no matter the system, old or new, they have used the same engine for all the Live titles. This takes away from what the Live series could be. NBA2K2 and hopefully 2K3 will continue to bring realistic gameplay along with graphics and controls. I urged anyone reading this to play Sega Sports NBA2k from any year 1,2 or the original, and then play NBA Live2003 or 2002 and I will guarantee that you will disown Live and fall in love with any of the NBA2k's.

Then, i got bored with it. I realized the game needed improving. If an all star with good shooting skills is wide open and he shoots, he will miss. But, a poor shooter goes for the three with 2 or 3 men in his face, he makes it. Strange. what also needs improving is the less fouls. Really, i run up a guy, and he doesn't lay finger on the ball handler, but commits a foul. I don't get that, and it's really annoying. Clearly this game needs work.

For those of us in our 50s and 60s, there's more ahead than retirement and taking care of aging parents, aging men, and growing grandchildren. Levine gives us stories of regular women who have tackled brand new careers, learned skills they always wanted to learn but never had time for, renegotiated their marriages and renewed their love-lives. And she also gives us scientific research that shows women's brains have a growth spurt in the 50s that renews our strength and our intellectual curiosity.

Some of the stories shared are very inspiring. Much of this book has sparked deep thought.My one complaint is that I see myself as a vibrant and sensual person. Age doesn't diminish those aspects. In fact, age seems (to me) to enhance and and change them in ways that aren't at all bad.

Much of the tempi are simply way too fast for any of Rachmaninoff's articulate and detail-oriented composing to be appreciated. Argerich's level of intensity is great and the high speed can be exciting, but from someone who generally performs things too fast, myself, this is too fast. Kissin's, on the other hand, isn't too slow--there are many passages that I could only dream of being able to perform as fast as him. His tempi are slow enough so that the listener can take in all of the nuances, colors, rhythms, and anything else that might be overlooked with the faster Argerich tempo. If you appreciate controlled performing (without sacrificing excitement), Argerich simply doesn't match up to Kissin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kitchen Wonder","review":"I am very pleased with this grater.

However I noticed that if I played it too loud it almost shorted out and the sound would go away until I lowered it a bit. I don't know if I blew the speakers or not but it would definitely have that scratchy sound like a bad speaker. I primarily used it in the shower and although it's supposedly water resistant apparently it couldn't stand up to my showering because it eventually lost all sound quality. It's now very very scratchy sounding and it completely shorts out if the sound is too loud or too much bass is present, it goes to complete static. I'm not sure if it got too much water exposure, was defective, or if I just broke it but bottom line I'm getting a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor engineering","review":"I received this as a gift to replace my Ego speaker case that fell once too often and broke its latch. The engineering of this product is poor. First of all the speakers are stacked vertically. Unless you are lying on your side that effectively turns the stereo sound into mono. It cannot stand properly on its side because of the latches. Also sideways my full sized iPod works its way out of the connector. This product looks like and weighs a brick. The control wheel is really buttons arranged in a circle and are missing functions such as the scroll feature. Unlike the Ego this case is not water proof but only water resistant. The sound clarity is noticeably better than the Ego because of the more conventional speakers however it is not as good as most desk speakers.

Both as physical object, a retrospective (of sorts) and a collection, it is a significant book. Joyce Carol Oates' self-selected tales run the gamut from haunting tales of revenge to close studies of family and relationships. The volume includes 13 new stories plus a sampling of Oates' work extending back to the '60s.The book itself is a beautiful specimen. Bibliophiles owe it to themselves to give the book a look just for its high production value.All that said, one begins to tire of Oates' oft-seen subjects (sisters, mothers/daughters) in familiar milieu (upstate New York). This is not a fault of the individual stories themselves, but rather having them all bunched together in one spot.But Oates has an impressive range of voice and style, including the two new stories \\"The Fish Factory\\" and the eponymous \\"High Lonesome,\\" both exquisite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic Stories","review":"I could get less than half way through the book.

I planned to return the item, but when I found out that I would not only be charged for shipping and handling of the return (which I expected), but that I would also have to pay for delivery of the item to me because I had used Amazon's SuperSaver option, I opted to donate the item to the thrift store at which I volunteer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice item, especially for the price.","review":"I'd definitely recommend this item. It's not 100% like being in a jacuzzi, but you're not paying $2000 - $5000 either. I also keep the machine outside the bathroom if it's quiet in the house. If it's noisy, the machine is just enough to drown out the stuff I don't want to hear.

Just brings back memories of being young and skating with my friends and stuff. I remember playing, \\"Mother's Day\\" for my mom on Mother's Day. She passed away a year ago and this song has more meaning to me than ever. I've been in this nostalgia period in my life and I had to get this for my collection.

George Szell and the Concertgebouw Orchestra give two captivating performances of Sibelius' and Beethoven's most popular symphonies. Szell's powerful, riveting account of Sibelius' 2nd Symphony will not replace those of Ashkenazy and Davis as first choice, yet his interpretation remains compelling. Equally mesmerizing is his regal account of Beethoven's 5th symphony. Needless to say, the Concertgebouw Orchestra performs with ample warmth and brilliance under the baton of Maestro Szell. The Concertgebouw Orchestra plays with the same technical precision shown by the Cleveland Orchestra during Szell's tenure as Cleveland's music director. Anyone interested in hearing one of the great 20th Century conductors leading one of Europe's finest orchestras should buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay ... I found a new author!

It's his only album with Fear. Derf Scratch is missed but hey, you get Flea. John Belushi was right - Fear was one of the greatest bands out of L.A., This album is no \\"Record\\" but it's great if you love Fear.

Like all the Pimsleur abridged sets, this course is tantalizingly brief -- it leaves you wanting more. Nonetheless, what these courses do, they do well, and that is to inspire your confidence to open your mouth and speak the language. I was comfortable exchanging polite pleasantries in Dutch and ordering meals and drinks in restaurants -- no mean feat where people are only too happy to speak to you in English!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Basis in Dutch","review":"I recently moved to Belgium for my wife and I used this course to get me familiar with the basics of the Dutch language and it does an excellent job of that. It won't by any means make you fleunt, but it covers enough \\"survival\\" Dutch to get you by. I do wish they had had a comprehensive 3-level course, but I was very happy with what I learned and the ease of doing so. I would recommend going through this course before continuing with the more expensive Rosetta Stone.(Since I've moved to Belgium, I've taken 6 months of classes 5 days a week for 3 hours a day and though my Dutch has vastly improved, I'm still nowhere near fluency yet.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Program!","review":"Pimsleur Dutch is exactly the program I wanted, and it has turned out to be more than I expected. It is extremely easy to use, and I was surprised at my own facility with the language from the first lesson. Grammar is not taught separately, but the sequence allows you to deduce it easily. The words and conversations give a great deal that any traveller would need for comfort when visitng the Netherlands. As Pimsleur suggests, it's easier - at least for me - to learn by ear, and Dutch on the printed page is too intimidating for me to want to take on just for pleasure. Because I had the time, I listened to each lesson several times and heard my own pronunciation and use of phrases improve daily. Really it's all the say that I found it enjoyable, easy to do daily since it only took 30 minutes, and delightfully productive/successful. My only complaint is that there is no Dutch II and Dutch III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was great, and want MORE","review":"I did a study semester in The Hague, but honestly didn't learn much dutch there, as it is so easy to speak English to get around. But, it's just been a fun hobby now for me to learn. And I bought Pimsleur and did the 30 courses, however that's as far as it goes. I know Dutch is an unpopular language, but would be nice to have more, because it IS so easy to just pop it in your car's stereo and absorb it!

The authors thoughts are random and dispersed. The book is not organized as a troubleshooting guide. It does not provide symptoms and flowcharts for determining the cause.

And we are still using and using and using it! Just finished making a Coffee Brulet Granita that was fantastic.

The noise is not that bad and since it makes the ice cream (or whatever!) so fast, the noise doesn't bother us at all.

Yes it makes noise, but it is tolerable and not as loud as a Blender. It is a motor.. they all make noise! The ice cream and sherbert come out soft but one placed in an closed tub for about 2-3 hours it is wonderful! I will not purchase ice cream from a retailer again. So far after a month I have made, French Vanilla, Maple Walnut, Coffee and Strawberry Banana Sherbert directly from B&J's book and all have been a delight to eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble in paradise","review":"I originally wrote a very positive review about this ice cream machine.Unfortunately, on my third use, the machine broke.

The \\"ice cream\\" was no colder than when I put it in the machine.

I'm not intimately familiar with Agent Orange, but this is anything but \\"Real Live Sound\\". From the faked roadie intro to the added screaming to the studio recorded between song banter, this is a prime example of how major record labels manipulate perfectly good bands. Given that is was recorded in 1991, during the heyday of the cocaine and glam fueled pop metal era (in L.A., no less) it's a wonder that it isn't worse.

As others have said what comes on the 12 cds is almost impossible to navigate and there is no reference provided with the software thus, the 'Easy to Find, Easy to Use' on the box is a complete nonsense.

It introduces one of her main characters, Amber Oakley, in wonderful detail, but without taking a third of the book to do so. Amber is blond, beautiful, intelligent and strong-willed. Early on, she discovers her lesbianism, but soon after, also discovers her attraction to both pony-carting and submissive behaviour. Her nemesis, Morris Rathwell, is also introduced in this book in one of Penny's classic scenes. Amber is one of Penny's most appealing heroines, I feel, and this book is one of her best. There's lots of pony-carting, lesbian domination, humiliations, rude and nasty males, and a wonderful finale, so no matter your taste, it will probably be addressed in this book. If you have never tried a Penny Birch book, this is a wonderful one to start with. You'll be hooked, believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinated by Fascination Street","review":"Wow, what a story...this is a great read and I found that I couldn't wait to get to the end of the story to see how it all turned out.

In my mind these guys were (and still are) like Exodus, Overkill, Nuclear assault, Vicious rumors, Forbidden, Heathen, Possessed, Dark angel, and Testament in the way that they released album after album of great material without getting the recognition they deserved. And what amazes me is that the band members were still in high school when they released this back in 1987. Now that's impressive! Most high school bands I hear now are clueless dolts who have poor musicianship and little to no artistic vision. This band is exactly the opposite. This is a bonafide gem from the golden age of Thrash metal and I highly recommend it. THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF BAY AREA THRASH PEOPLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not operate quietly","review":"I purchased this dehumidifier because my last one, after 12 years of use, finally bit the dust. I thought that in 12 years there would have been some improvements made in dehumidifiers. This item is advertised as \\"quiet operation\\". I have this dehumidifier plugged into a wall in my family room that is about 30 feet away from where I sit and every time it turns on I cannot hear the television. This thing is loud!

It is very well made and works like a charm. I have severe allergies and do not react at ALL to this or most other Delonghi products. I become symptomatic around cheaper (more toxic, less stable) materials, and Delonghi tends to use higher quality materials (not to mention excellent workmanship which, as a picky consumer, I appreciate very much). In my opinion, this is one of the best products and companies on the market.

However, lately he seems to forget the background he's given some of them. Susan is a good case in point. Many books ago(maybe A Catskill Eagle?) Susan tells Spenser she is the youngest of three. Now, amazingly, she was an only child. Which is it? Seems Parker is not interested enough in this character to be consistent. And enough of her whining already. She has become a stereotype. Hawk/Spenser dialogue is the best part of the novels. Not enough of that here. Still, looking forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"robertb parker review","review":"i thought it was typically well written and funny but still had some serious moments, and it was nice 2 have susan have a bigger role in the book very well done mr.parker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book - but HORRIBLE READING for audio version","review":"While the story was entertaining- the strange intonations of the reader made me stop listening about halfway through - which is pretty bad considering the price of audio books!

Honestly, who cares about Susan Silverman's petty self-centered analyses about her childhood and consequences thereof? At least one half of the book concentrated on this, and the rest consisted of a haphazard crime plot, the substance of which seemed to have been thrown together on a coffee break (decaf, right, Spenser?). To summarize: so far I've read only good or brilliant Spenser novels; this one was the first downright miserable one. You can do better, Mr. Parker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the dialog; the plot is secondary to a Spenser novel!","review":"Parker's witty dialog among Spenser, Hawk, Susan, et al, is why I enjoy the Spenser series so much. If you're looking for tons of action, violence and convoluted story line, look elsewhere. Parker shines in continuing to develop, nurture and mature the characters we've come to love and befriend over the years. Also, anyone who has a dog knows that \\"Pearl\\" really is a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Susan, but . . .","review":"Susan asks Spenser to help out her ex-husband. During this course of this, we learn about her childhood, which she pries out of herself bit by angst-ridden bit. From the way she gets worked up, you would think her early life was like Frank McCourt's, but it wasn't. It was a yawn. The plot? I don't read these novels for the plot. I read them to spend time with three old friends who are way cool, live in the city I know best, say things I wish I'd thought of, get into situations I couldn't handle, drink better booze than I can afford, and wear white hats (as well as other stylish garments)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER WONDERFUL PIECE OF PARKER ESCAPISM","review":"Mr Parker continues to do what he does best, offer a source of \\"male escapism\\". Mr Parker write his novels not for literary brilliance but for pleasuring the male ego. \\"Sudden Mischief\\" continues the well proven theme of a tough but sensitive detective. Mr Parker's scene description ability makes it very easy to place one's self at the scene as though it is a site that is visited on a daily basis. He will never win the Pulitzer for a novel but Roberrt B. Parker's Sudden Mischief continues Spenser's antics, adventures, and escapades while maintaining a strong \\"grin factor\\".

I can't imagine that he would like how he is depicted in it....he hasn't really publicly commented on it, other than to say the author had his full support. I don't know--it just seemed a weird portrait of someone...it seemed over-dramatic and Vanity Fair article-esque. Or like Confessions of a Shopaholic. Ew. I don't know what MNS is really like or if Bamberger interpreted things accurately.

At page 20 I have to put the book down and throw up. This author sucks. One should have to pass a test before they are allowed to publish a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film making is not a sport.","review":"This author should stick to Sports Illustrated or switch to Mad magazine. His style is that of a gossiping school girl. It would have been an interesting project for an author that has studied film or knew what he was writting about. How can someone write on a topic that they do not know? Bamberger, you risked your so called \\"career\\" on a topic that you obviously did not do your homework on. The next time you meet a celebrity at a party they will think twice when asked by you to follow them around for a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"An easy fun read with little substance","review":"I'm a big fan of Bamberger's writing. His prose is still excellent, and if he could have pried his lips off of Shyamalan's backside for a bit, this book could have been very good. Instead it appears as though the author fancied a career as Night's PR director in the near future. A big disappointment. Honestly, the heavy-handed rose-colored portrayals of Night's actions and personality are too much to bear and are as transparent as they are unbelievable. Any facts that contradict or shed a truly critical eye on the director are ignored or clumsily dismissed. Tellingly, Bamberger ends his lovefest before the movie is released...sparing himself the task of justifying what a horrible bomb this \\"masterpiece\\" turned out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"The one star is for the book's oft-mentioned unintentional hilarity, and because I borrowed it-- so, no zero-star indignation at money poorly spent. As a testamonial of filmmaking, it offers few insights, but as a strangely icky love letter to its subject, TMWHV can be truly cringe-a-minute. Could not put it down, until about 50 pages in, then could not pick it up again, because it gets really tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"A $27.50 edition of People Magazine","review":"You can tell that this author had never been on a film set before. He seemed completely starstruck and that may have skewed his reality. I could barely get through the book, it was like reading a tabloid magazine. He exposed Night to great criticism by offering his naive opinions. Mr. Bamberger should stick to a subject that he knows about. He already hurt the reputation of a young female golfer, he should be careful not to attack the integrety of others. If we judged his writing abilities the way he judged filmmaking his career could suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"This book is a pile of Shyamalan. Boring.......this book will not help us in any way! I am upset that I spend the money and spent my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating page-turner","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It is a revealing look both inside the mind of the writer/director whose last four movies have grossed more at the box office (about $2 billion)than any other four original scripts. Having met Shyamalan at a party, Bamberger convinces the secretive Shyamalan to let him follow Shyamalan for a year as Shyamalan writes, sells and then directs the most personal -- and riskiest -- film he has conceived. The book is spellbinding as it reveals the intrique of Disney vs. Warners, the zaniness on the set, and, most interesting, the burdens and conflicts inside the head of one of today's most creative and commercially successful writer/directors. This book is a page-turner, the rare non-fiction work you can read like a novel. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The review that said this book is like an article from People magazine got it all wrong...","review":"To say this is like an extended article from People magazine is to give Bamberger too much credit. It's closer in spirit to \\"In Touch\\" or \\"Us\\" - that's the level of journalistic sophistication Bamberger achieves.Whether or not you like M. Night Shyamalan's movies (I'll confess to being more than a little ambivalent) it's dramatically clear that the author knows little about the technical aspects of film making and the culture of film production in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read For M. Night Fans and Film Buffs","review":"I don't believe there are enough good books out there about directors and how they approach film making. A film buff like me is interested in hearing about the challenges, trials and mishaps in film making, not a glossy promotional hype piece to sell the movie. Whether you appreciate M. Night's films or not, you can't help but at least appreciate his struggles in this book. It has lots of insight into the director as well as just about every actor and stand-in on set to some degree or another. We all know the movie was finished and reached theaters but I still couldn't put it down to find out the details and stories behind what you see on screen. The hollywood talk may bore typcial movie watchers but film buffs will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man Who Heard Razzberries","review":"I agree that Bamberger could be the greatest satirist living, if that was his intention. The endless verbal oral sex the author performs on his subject...The abject awe...It is truly hilarious.It's also true that you'll only enjoy laughing at this road apple of a book IF you didn't pay anything for it, as I didn't.Let us all hope that in the future, M. Night Shamalamadingdong does NOT listen to the same voices that told him to put out \\"Lady in the Water,\\" AND this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad it hurts (in your funny bone)","review":"This book is a delight to read. Rarely does one come across a nonfiction piece that manages to create such a wellspring of hatred, animosity and overwhelming ill-will toward its author and subject as this.The writing is often atrocious, in keeping with the author's journalistic background. But it is the near-constant and over-the-top adulation he evinces toward Shyamalan that keeps us spellbound. Was there any irony in his comments? Was the potential paycheck too alluring to give him any reason to ruffle Shyamalan's feathers?Or, maybe, just maybe, Bamberger is such a genius that by playing dumb, he manages to brilliantly illuminate what a world-class megalomaniac M Night Shyamalan is. Read the book, but don't drop a penny on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Kidding, Right?","review":"The \\"Subject\\" of this book has become, in the last year, a cautionary tale of when ego outdoes the \\"artiste\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, insightful book","review":"Bamberger's extremely compelling look into the life of M. Night and how he risked his career making \\"Lady In The Water\\" is a must read! The book is insightful and regardless what you think of M. Night or \\"Lady,\\" it provides behind the scenes details everyone will be interested to know.

He treads ground already well-beaten by his predecessors Charles Sheeler, Paul Strand, Andre Kertesz, Walker Evans, but without their eye for the arresting perspective or the play of light and form. His compositions are rather flat and banal, more like postcards for the scenes he presents, wrapped in a hazy glow of romanticized nostalgia reminiscent of dorm room Edward Hopper prints.There are a few pictures that rise above the mediocre to reach the level of pretty good, such as his White Castle photo or the nighttime scene of Petit's Mobil Station, but even these seem to rely on a striking, but cheap, play of light illuminating darkness to achieve their effect. Overall, one gets the sense that he's a Thomas Kinkade who wishes he were Charles Sheeler."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to a new series","review":"Alec is quite wonderful; what a dreamboat. Katherine is sometimes annoying, but she's young and badly influenced. She tends to think the worst of Alec and the best of Sydney, who is such a momma's boy. It is also rather hypocritical of her to be concerned about Alec marrying for money when that was her goal, the difference being it was access to her own money. But she had convinced herself that she was in love with her longtime friend, Sydney.Despite Katherine's sometimes annoying and wrong opinions about Alec and her unfathomable wish to marry Sydney, she does finally see the light and all her best characteristics come forth.

This book received a pretty high review, so I thought that I would give it a try. I have to say, however, that I was pretty disappointed with this book. The plot was pretty bland, and I just didn't really care for the characters very much. I felt like there wasnt a great connection with the main characters, and even by the end of the book, I still wasn't convinced that they were in love with eachother!! There were so many opportunities for supporting characters to play a bigger role in the novel, but none of the opportunities were taken by the author. In no way was this a bad book...I just wouldn't say that it deserves the 4 star rating on Amazon. If you are looking for a GREAT historical romance novel, pick up a Julie Garwood novel instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for a first time reader","review":"I had seen this author's name all over the place yet never picked up a book of hers until now. I liked the book quite a bit. I read it in a day and a half and I definitely like the way Sabrina Jeffries writes. Katherine was a little bit uptight but eventually she relaxed. Alec, I totally felt sorry for throughout the book because of his financial situation but I liked him a lot. I would have liked though, to have seen more about Lovelace and his little \\"secret\\". In a way I kind of wish he would have been found out or something because he just irritated me! After reading this one, I WILL pick up more of her books.

Go just a few feet away however and you notice it does not circulate the air well.Furthermore, Delonghi is an Italian company with very poor customer service by American standards. I called them up to ask about my heater and a voice comes on with a foreign accent telling you all operators are busy, call back at another time. This happened all afternoon. Furthermore, their American website is not up, and I do not speak Italian so it was not of much good either.All in all, I would say save some space by getting a Vornado heater which does work well and can circulate air much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stain Solver!","review":"My husband and I recently bought a house with carpet that looked like it had never been cleaned. We didn't have the money to replace the carpet, so we decided to buy a cleaner and do it ourselves. After careful consideration, we decided to purchase this Bissell Proheat. What a fantastic machine.

It's easy to put together and it's easy to use. Since my Hoover had been on the blink for a while my carpets were definitely ready to be cleaned. My carpets look great and not only are they clean and spot free but my carpet looks fluffier. I would recommend this cleaner and am very pleased with the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made and breaks easily","review":"Unfortunately the \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\" product has been in the repair shop twice in 3 years.

The pedal in the back after going down a 4 inch step broke so the handle will not stay up.

Now when I really need it, it will not spray. Pump belt was broken and Bissell wanted 7-10 days and a big \\"shipping\\" fee for a 6-8 inch belt. (we are 200 miles apart) When I told the CSR that I could not wait that long and I was going to have to rent a machine she was very sorry, but offered no other solution. I called the closest authorized repair person (100+ miles away)and they put a pump belt and brush belt in a regular size envelope with 88 cents in stamps and I got it the next day. Now why couldn't Bissell do that?Long story short. Deal with changing the belt and it still won't spray. The belt is moving beautifully.

Why bother with a reconstruction at all? In listening to \\"Turandot\\" (say) I always hit the Stop button when Puccini's music ceases. In the case of \\"Rodrigo,\\" the plot is not so compelling that the public is panting for a complete version. Would it not have been far better simply (or complexly) to record those parts of the score that do not call for flights of imagination and borrowings from the composer's other works? Giving a stage performance is one thing, making a recording another. I am grateful for that part of the work that is Handel's. The trouble is I can never be sure in listening what part that is, except for the instances given in the notes that come with the libretto. Perhaps the producers would consider a single CD without the tiresome recites of just those parts that are undoubtedly authentic.

I also like the tenor solo singing the \\"Er kommt! Er kommt!\\" from Cantata 140. The duets in that same Cantata 140 are delightful! The solid reserve of that bass soloist and sweet vulnerability of the soprano, not shrill or operatic as is so often the case. Fortunately I made a cassette tape of an old scratchy LP.

Crossfire grabbed my attention with the first chapter and kept my attention until the last page. I didn't want to stop reading! I was amazed that there were a few poor reviews of the book. However, after reading the reviews I realized those reviewers are unaware that a character's stance or beliefs are simply that, the development of that character's stance and beliefs. One must look at a book's overall message in order to apply a belief or stance to that of the author. Otherwise, after reading Nicolas' defense of growing cocaine, one could have have said that Ms. Windle supports marketing cocaine!

As others have pointed out, the main character is ridiculously naive and we are forced to endure page after page of her efforts to convince herself of whatever incorrect hypothesis she cooks up next.

Jeannette Windle demonstrates her misunderstanding about Catholic Christians through her characters' misunderstanding and superstitions. She never offers a single Catholic character who tries to live the Catholic faith. The Catholic family lies, steals, bribes, grows and processes cocaine, do not help the poor, eventually resort to murder, and think a cross is a lucky charm. On the other hand, the several non-Catholic Christian characters are all equated with goodness, holiness, and charity. It would have been better if she had just left out any references to the Catholic Church. It wouldn't have hurt the plot at all, and she wouldn't have demonstrated her bias and her lack of knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"This was an amazing book, I could not put it down, the characters were so real and I felt for them.

McDonald plays virtually any instrument and I suspect he pretty much wrote everything on In The Court Of The Crimson King. That said, it seems nobody plays with much conviction on this disc; its a one night stand and that's that. Chester Thompson sounds nothing like Michael Giles and he just plods along like its a day at the office. Hackett is good when he doesn't sing.

And, we've seen a definite improvement in her eyes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I purchased this for my kittens because they started getting red, runny eyes. I put it on their dry food and mixed it in. Yes, they did notice that something was different, and were hesitant at first, but when they got hungry enough they ate it. After about 3 days use, their eyes cleared up and they stopped sneezing as well. It saved us a $60 trip to the vet. Worth a try but takes forever to ship in the mail. I picked 2 day and it came in 5 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"works, but be careful about dosing","review":"Our 4 month old kitten had slightly goopy eyes and regular sneezing, so our vet recommended this product for him, as well as our other cats. We bought some and found he takes it just fine when we sprinkle it on top of his wet food. The adult cats were more finicky about it at first. While I was careful to give the kitten 1/2 scoop at the evening meal, my husband was giving a full scoop in the morning. 3-4 days later, poor kitty had terrible diarrhea, as in all over the house, all over himself. Very unpleasant. We stopped the lysine, and he's doing fine. He's stopped sneezing. If the sneezing returns, we'll give him the lysine again, but being verrry careful about the dosing. I'll be nervous about the diarrhea returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"She likes it!","review":"I purchased this product after reading that it might help cats who have the herpes virus.

And so far her eyes look better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient","review":"I love not having to crush pills anymore, such a time-saver! However, the price is a little steep.

Often a kitty will have a cold or is a little sneezy from being at the shelters before we get to them, and just 1 scoop in canned food at mealtimes usually suffices to dry up whatever virus they have. Also, I have a Persian cat who has herpes of the eye, which gives him the 'goopy-eyed' look so common to cats whose tear ducts are malformed. Using Viralys keeps it in check, so he's much more comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"One of my cats came to me with chronic upper respitory problems. My vet recommended this but in a paste that needs to be shot into the mouth with a syringe, I prefer this in a powder that I can add to can cat food.

It does a really good job at keeping her healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat rescuer","review":"I use this everyday when I feed my small colony of feral cats. I feed five outside cats and sprinkle two scoops into their food every day. One of my guys has a chronic eye problem and this keeps it in check.

It is a must for those feeding feral cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Feline Herpes","review":"I had previously been getting the Viralys gel from our vet. This powder version online was a much better price and less additives (just says Lysine in a flavor base). I've sprinkled it on hard and soft food and my kitties don't even seem to notice (I have 2) and one of them is very particular about his food. It took him awhile to get use to the gel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff, Big Vet visit saver!","review":"My 11 month old kitten Jim has feline herpes, and a few months ago he had two really bad outbreaks a week apart, so I took him to the vet's office(where I work) and the doctor recommended I try the Viralys gel to lessen the severity of his outbreaks and their frequency. Well, it wasn't in my budget after the examination and the eye stain and the antibiotic and I wanted to do my own research first before buying something I'd never heard of. Anyways, I saw the reviews weren't so great on the gel, but they were great on the powder AND it was much cheaper so I gave it a shot. It's now been over three months and he hasn't had an outbreak since, when they used to be every other month at least! I'm really happy with Viralys and if your cat has feline herpes its a big worry, time and money saver! It's also REALLY stinky/fishy smelling and Jim just gobbles it up with a little warm water in his dry food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tracks!","review":"I highly recommend this album by Kenny Rankin.

Setup was quite easy though there were no instrutions in the box. The rack attatched easily enough to the car however, that is where the downside started. The wraps to go around the frame to hold it in place would not stay snapped. I ended up using a couple small bungee cords to strap it down.The next downside was that the buckles did NOT hold the straps taunt. The buckles did not have any teeth to prevent the tension from backing off. With this, I ended up knotting the straps so there was minimal play in them. With that said, I still ended up stopping frequently to tighten the straps.Being the Swhwinn name, I believed I would have a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low price, works only for driving slowly","review":"This rack is a little disappointment for me. It easy to setup but it really designed for toys bikes that has no weight. With adult full size bikes, it has no way to hold when car is driving on regular car speed. First of all, they should have six straps that can hold the rack steady and this rack only has 4. Second, straps are easy to get loose. Third, the brakets that hold the bicycle are no way to tight up. They use 4 plastic botton and 4 holes on the plastic strap to connect in order to hold the bicycles, which is too week and very easy to just open the connection when the car moves fast.To make use of this rack, you have to use some other assistant.

Once the straps are tightened, the tension buckles do not remain so, and over time the straps will come loose from the car if left to their own devices. The straps must have too much play in them for the Florida weather because they don't stay tight on the car. Also not taken into account are the J hooks meant to keep the unit mounted/stabilized to the bottom of the trunk. They are not long enough to grip the trunk itself, instead hooking the plastic panel covering the trunk on my Saturn, warping it when the carrier is tightened. In addition, the straps that wrap around a bike's top tube and affix it to the rack are made of a flimsy plastic which has a tendency to come unsnapped as the bikes sway. This rack was purchased from my local Target store."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS RACK","review":"I purchased this rack to carry two bikes and all it took was one patch of bad road and it bent my trunk so bad that I can't latch my trunk anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time.","review":"I would give this no stars if possible.

It works well on bare floors but not on carpeting. I have two dogs and it doesn't pick up the dog hairs very well. Also, it doesn't transition easily from bare floor to area rugs. You have to pick it up to move it on to the rugs. The cord is way too short. For someone who has large rooms it would be a problem.

Not enough suction to bring the dirt to the canister. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!","review":"If you hate to sweep, get this vacuum for your wood and tile floor. I'm never using my broom again! It picks up all the cat hair, cat litter, sand the kids track in and who knows what else. It is quite an eye opener when you empty out the dirt cup to see what was on the floor. It is light and easy to handle. I would use a bigger vacuum for a large area of carpet, but it works great on throw rugs and entry way mats. Can't recommend it highly enough for kitchen and living room cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Powerful! Lightweight! Bagless vacuum with tools!","review":"This is the only mini-vac I've ever tried... I was amazed at the power it has! It sucked up more dirt and cat fur that I realized were even in the rug. My 3-1/2 year old daughter who is afraid of vacuums even wanted me to let her help use it! I hadn't realized there were vacuums this small that come with attachments! These have a bit less suction power than using it a a regular vacuum, but I guess that's probably normal. Overall, I'd say it's a very good vacuum for those that like bagless vacs. If I hadn't decided I prefer vacuums with bags, I would definitely stick with this one! Being bagless is the only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vac does not suck","review":"Very disappointed in the Bissell 3108 EasyVac Powerbrush. I purchased the product to clean my bare floors which are saltillo tile, ceramic, and brick. It would only pick up the smallest pieces of sand and some of the cat litter. Just did not have enough power to pick up much of anything. Bissell should not call this a POWER brush. It has no suction power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grest Vacumn","review":"So easy to push great suction,easy to clean, filters clean under water, let air dry, will order a new one next month, gave my son the one I had, he did not have one he loves it have to use my other one, gosh it's heavy compare to the easyvac,getting to old to push around the larger vacumns, came in real handy since I have parakettes and a daily mess with them.

I called the entire list to be told time after time...no parts available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Worst vacuum ever! I have to keep a couple of knitting needles handy to get the stuff off the top of the container. Great suction...for about 5 minutes. Pet hair chokes it even faster.

I only have an area rug 6 by 4 feet to vac, which I vac once a week. The five times that I have used it, it has become increasingly more difficult, and has less powered than the previous.

Bravo Bissell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not well designed","review":"The Bissell 3108 EasyVac Powerbrush seemed great on paper-- like a stick vac, but with a removeable handheld unit. I liked that it had a hose and the options for bare floor or carpet. I have mostly bare floors. Unfortunately I didn't realize it had a tiny dust cup which does not clean easily, so every time you need to empty the cup (which is at least every useage, sometimes 2x in one use, and I have a small house!), dust goes everywhere. You also have to clean out the filter with your fingers. Why bother vacuuming if you have to sweep up after yourself?Also, once the filter is at all dirty, the unit doesn't work anymore, you can roll over a crumb 10 times and it won't get sucked up. When you turn the vacuum off, whatever you vacuumed up last gets spit back out.I got so frustrated I went out and bought a SwifferVac and it works twice as well, which is really sad since it cost half as much and runs on batteries.I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a mess","review":"Initially I was pleased with its pickup power (compared to our Shark), but I now view it as a failed $50 experiment. The major drawbacks are:- As soon as the power is off, it drops all particles. If you've just cleaned up kitty litter, you'll find it all in a pile under the vac head on the floor once you turn it off.- It creates a high-pitched whine, which actually caused my wife and I some ear pain.- REALLY awkward to use on furniture...needs a brush attachment.- No HEPA filter (forgot to check for this before buying it).- Cord is just as short as the Shark's.On the upside, it's lightweight.I'll be donating mine to Goodwill, and am about to buy one of the fullsize vacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is a better singer then this","review":"I think American Idol proved how powerful her voice really is, and neither of her prior releases have done her justice.I hope now she makes music that compliments her talent.However, this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average 17-year-old's pop song","review":"I first heard this tune when we played it on my radio station's Sunday New Music Showcase.

All the tracks are non-original versions, either terrible remixes or live versions (of course the record company fails to mention this anywhere on the packaging).

Of course, \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" is the quintessential rockabilly song. Perkins is known as a guitar innovator, but he should be recognized also as a great rockabilly singer with a powerful, resonating voice. He was hip long before Presley and he was a triple threat---composer, musician, singer...Consequently, he was not promoted to the same degree as was Presley...Perkins deserves greater recogntion...Perkins actually knew what key he was playing and singing in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Ashley Judd, just not this movie","review":"I think Ashley Judd is an incredibly talented actress and usually will watch movies just because she is in them.

No inspiration, no thoughtful moments not even a just plan good entertainment. I hate to say it, but skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I recently watched this movie for one reason.. Jeffrey Donovan. I'm a recent fan because of Burn Notice on USA Network. He was very good in this movie, very real and touching. Although Ashly Judd is a beautiful and extremely talented actress, this movie was a complete waste of time. There were many lost opportunities for the story to take a better turn, such as the dog. Why not then, after the dog died, get another dog and show that she has some feelings for something afterall. The end is just horrible and I'm left with... is that all there is? Did she really change? Is she going to go back to her old ways? Will she be able to keep the company afloat? Did she make amends with her father? What about her grandparent?Too may questions left unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one.","review":"I was very disappointed in this film. I thought for sure it would be worth watching if for no other reason than Ashley Judd being in it. I was wrong. It is filled with the F word, and her sleeping around. Random comes to mind. It goes nowhere, and the end really doesn't offer much either. It has a cheap feel even though recognizable names are present. I could go on, but it wouldn't matter. It simply comes across as a waste of time. The language is too filthy to put up with, and Ms. Judd's character is very one dimensional. It might be believable if she were playing a cheap prostitute, but her character is no \\"Pretty Woman\\".

The movie was not cohesive enough to deliver a comprehensible plot. The movie was all over the place; never explaining the relationships between the different characters (which remained vague at best), nor the process of growth for Ashley Judd's character, it was merely implied. The movie does not know where to go. Although Judd's performance was good, the rest of the movie did not provide a vehicle where that performance could shine through. Actually, the movie was so vague about pretty much everything that the viewer could not really and truly understand what is going on between the different characters. The movie is also very sad and depressing. Skip it unless you are an Ashley Judd fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks","review":"I can't understand anyone giving this movie anything but one star. It stinks. It's a tired and overdone plot with a main character who is very hard to care about. I wanted more of the stray dog story. At least that would have given us more to watch. Even Judd's roommate made a more interesting study. The Lucy/Judd character is just plain boring. She drinks. We get it. Coors light. We get it. Please buy it. She poses and plays pool and gets drunk every night. We get it. She drives too fast and she wears the same clothes every day. We get it. She sleeps around with strangers. We get it. She NEVER combs her freakin' hair. We DON'T get it. She is a most unhappy and unlikeable girl. We got it. I won't get the movie, however.

Mitchum is duped into going to a resort in Mexico. Why? So his identity can be stolen and used by Raymond Burr, a gangster, who wants to return to the states but can't because he has been deported. The battle to maintain his ID is great fun to watch. Jane Russell is his love interest and is typical sultry Jane. Vincent Price is great as a Hollywood matinee idol who longs for real action rather than staged swordplay. This movie needs to be released on DVD. It is very hard to find on VHS and shows up occasionally on AMC or TNT. By the way this filmed all on the backlot of the studio but it sure feels like your in Mexico.

While the subject of professional women bodybuilders didn't really interest me, I tried it anyways. Now that Im finished, I noticed it's only somewhat like a Palahniuk book. Arnoldi doesn't write in the same style as Palahniuk, which is what I assumed. The theme is what is most like Palahniuk, but even then, the theme is barely similar to his themes.My major gripe with the book is that the climax of the book is extremely weak. At the end, I was thinking, \\"this is it? this is the end?\\" and was expecting more. At first, I didn't even think there was a real climax.

But it quickly becomes apparent that Arnoldi has only one effective shot in her posing routine. And the ending is so ludicrous that it wipes out any residual good will still remaining.Samuel W.

Writing style is pleasurable, but it's lacking on content. it's as if someone had an inordinate amount of information about female body building and thought \\"gee, i'll write a book using this information...\\" and then did so. the story is bland and predictable, and the ending was adbrupt and not at all cathartic.I often see Chemical Pink associated with Chuck Palahniuk, but i find very little in common in terms of style, content, or presentation. While it is true i didn't hate it, i would hate myself for telling a friend to buy this book. if you see it loafing about in a Dentist's office or the like, give it a go, but i certainly wouldn't go out of my way.A book i would point someone too that enjoy's chuck's writing would be The Contortionist's Handbook: A Novelby Craig Clevenger.

No matter how messy, disgusting, or annoying Ms. Arnoldi gets, you're compelled to keep reading to see if she'll stoop further. She often does. The characters seem like they were from a B-movie, one dimensional, corny dialogue, and unbelievable situations.

We wanted a DVD we could follow in a real time - like a class.The instructions are not very clear. The routine is very SLOW and BORING. The whole hour only one of the partners does the exercises and the other one only supports him/her. That was the most upsetting thing. You need to do the whole routine again and switch then.Maybe it's because this DVD is a basic level, but we definitely won't try if the other levels are better.

When they find themselves in another world after a fistfight in the hall, they need to find a way to become friends. The land of Gwyliath is a mixture of familiar mythology landscapes with just a dash of Oz thrown in. There is a very nice sense of surrealism to the characters which keeps it from being a stock exercise.While not as enduring as other YA fantasy books, Hero From Otherwhere has some nice messages and interesting passages. I would still recommend the Lloyd Alexander and Susan Cooper books over this one, but it might be just the ticket for a slightly younger reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids book.","review":"This was the first book I ever read cover to cover.

Anyway, this movie, in the theater had a gimmick to go with since this was about the time that 3-D was enjoying a strange comeback. And this gimmick was to give a scratch and sniff card to go with parts of the movie. You smell what Divine smells! With that in mind, this album very well could be the soundtrack. It could be the next Pink Floyd-Wizard Of Oz connection. I can easily see Divine's slide into alcoholic frenzy and dementia being synced up with \\"Ringo Buys A Rifle\\" \\"Smokin Banana Peels\\" and yes, \\"My Many Smells\\".

If you really want to watch this series you should go with the increadibly expensiveBlood +: Part One with Bonus DiscandBlood +: Part Two, however that (at the time I'm writing this) is extremely expensive, approx $250 for USED and $400 for NEW.So if you don't mind not finishing the story that at episode 20 is still building up, I encourage you to get this, but if you like to see things through to the end (like me) you're better off without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notis is great!

They suggested taking it back to the retailer (Amazon) and getting a whole new unit to avoid paying for return shipping.

It is a somewhat facinating, well written book, don't get me wrong, but the story was depressing and the plot was pointless! Nobody learned anything. I got to read of the slaughter of fox after fox after fox, all for some man's twisted sense of revenge that makes no logical sense at all. I can't figure what message we are supposed to take from this story. I guess there's an anti-human thing going, the idea that animals just do what they do, it's the humans that mess everything up.I think other books spread that message more effectively. This was just agony to read. I kept waiting for a glimmer of hope and none was forthcoming. Despite some claims, this is not a children's book. It is nothing like the Disney movie, and if they can slog through the sometimes heavy language, they will find no happy ending or singing owls here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate Card","review":"I would not recommend this card for use as your primary TV and/or even for recording video.

The vocals are basically done in three different forms: low-pitch scream, dark melodic singing, and occasionally a high-pitch scream as heard on one of the album's better tracks \\"Lost\\", which goes from dark and brooding to hateful and grinding in seconds. There is alot of samples and sound effects added to the heaviness of the music and results of this mixture are very interesting. The band uses a drum machine, but they definitely make the most out of it, as the drums fit the music nicely.

About the only time I use a tie is if I'm taking the bread somewhere or giving it to someone. They are cheaper than zip top/lock bags and easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the shipping is.....","review":"Like the others said, this is really poor service when there are no tie's included with the bags.

The main character is shallow...so shallow, in fact (SPOILER ALERT*******) that other characters must purchase a pair of expensive designer shoes to convince her to fight the main big bad guy...sigh. No amount of suffering and pain of others would get her to fight this guy, but you put designer shoes on the table, and whoooo booooy, get out of her way...There is no explainable reason for her friends to stick by her, nor is there any explicable reason for the main dude to LOVE her (somehow, they skipped any form of attraction or dating, and he is in LOVE) she is rude, selfish and (as previously mentioned) shallow. I wouldn't hang out with someone who had, truely, no redeeming qualities, so why would I want to read about one?I will admit that I did read about five books into the series, to give it a fair shot, but things never really got any better. The heroine never grows as a person. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I've read and enjoyed many books in this genre, but Betsy is the worst kind of heroine. She's shallow, stupid, and hard to take. She loves shoes and has little respect for anything. Hardly anyone I want to read about and I wish I had my money back. If you haven't read the Sookie Stackhouse books, then read those instead. If you're a shallow shoe lover that thinks it's funny to insult other women because they need pedicures and if you want to cheer a heroine who cares so little for other's things that she throws a friend's classical CDs out of the window of the friend's car then... good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it","review":"I loved the IDEA of this series. It had such potential. I kept reading, thinking it was going to get better, but it didn't. About half way through I had to throw in the towel which is remarkable for me - I don't remember when I last couldn't finish a book. It wasn't even very funny. It needs to come with a \\"rated R\\" warning for crude language and graphic sex. Maybe it's intended for young teens to get hold of and feel naughty? That's about the maturity level it seemed to be aiming at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better.","review":"I read this book as a way to soothe my longing for a new Sookie Stackhouse novel. Oddly, I was a little put off by how derivative it was of a Sookie novel. Honestly, the main love interest is named Eric...strange. But generally I thought it was a way to meld vampire fiction with Gone With the Wind, which the author obviously likes since she references it in her book. The heroine is a 21st century Scarlett O'Hara and the Eric Sinclaire character is her Rhett Butler. Some of the jokes were a little lame and at the level of a middle schooler. There were times when I wished a character would stake her protagonist with the heel of one of her beloved Manolos. Also, as an African American her treatment of the two black characters was very bad. It's like she learned about black people by watching 70s sitcoms and blaxploitation films. Still, I applaud her for having black characters at all. Overall it's an okay book, but nothing I would regret not reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Fluff","review":"I'll admit I expected not to like this book. I don't like flighty shallow heroines, and I'm very picky when it comes to comedy in books. I'm sorry to say this book didn't really prove me wrong.It's the first person account of Betsy becoming a vampire. Betsy seems dimwitted and self absorbed, but to give her credit she does have a good sense of humor. At first it was mildly amusing to read about her \\"death\\", and subsequent inability to truly die. That lasted about 50 pages. Then the evil stepmother showed up, having stolen Betsy's shoes after she \\"died\\" and I lost interest. Aside from the fact that the constant naming of brands (she goes on and on about the shoes!) was driving me crazy, I just couldn't deal with the simplistic characterization and melodrama.My impression of this book was that it's a lot like a soap opera, but with a vampire as our person of interest. To some this may be appealing, and if your looking for a mindless laugh I'd say go for it. Not for me, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Had High Hopes...........","review":"but finished the book very disappointed. The concept is great, the story wasn't that bad, the writing was very juvenile and at times just wore me down. I would have loved this book when I was 14 or 15.I took the advice of another reviewer and bought Charlaine Harris book. Much better choice for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Normally I don't care for books written in the first person, but this one was great. Funny & fast paced. I finished it in one day. Can't wait for the next one. This was one that I didn't want to end and definately a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had it's moments","review":"This was an okay read. I was wanting to get into a series, but this just didn't hit the spot. I found Liz annoying and her voice beyond annoying. I liked some of the story line, but not enough for me to move on to the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, light-hearted novel","review":"This was my first book by Mary Janice Davidson and I was very impressed. This book was defintely one of those books you laughed out loud to. It isnt a serious vampire book, which you can tell by the cover, but the plotline is completely unique and easy to get into. I recommend this for anyone looking for a good laugh. But be warned, it is a chick book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"This is not your typical brooding vampire book. Ok Sinclair may be a little dark and broody but the vampire queen most definitely is not. This book was alot of fun to read. I honestly love the direction Davidson went with this story. A vampire queen who loves to shop and is obsessed with shoes and other pretty things. Not to mention that the whole undead thing just seems to be a minor inconvenience for her. Normally not my style but I couldn't resist trying it and I'm honestly glad I did. As soon as I finished it I went right out and bought the next installment...Undead and Unemployed. Note: There are 4 stars instead of 5 because use of phrases beginning with stupid this or stupid that became ever so slightly annoying. Still worth taking the time to read if you're looking for a vampire novel on the lighter side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book- Whiny Heroine","review":"I read a review of this book and picked it up from the library. Much to my delight, it was funnier and more witty that the review suggested. Betsy, the Vampire Queen is truly a gal for the new millenium, but I did get tired of her whining and being pissed for the entire second half of the book. Get over it Betsy. That said, this was a truly enjoyable escapist reading adventure and I would recommend it to any fan of vampire novels/romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, funny book","review":"This book is nonstop quirky, sarcastic humor. The main character is likeable and funny. It took me a couple of chapters to get used to the writing style because it's basically one punch-line after another, but once I got into it, I loved it.There's a lot of adventure and intrigue, and the plot is fast-paced. All of the characters are interesting and beleivable. I plan on buying the sequel to this novel which comes out in August 2004 - \\"Undead and Unemployed.\\" I highly recommend this book.If you like vampire novels with a female main character, also check out the \\"Dead Until Dark\\" series by Charlaine Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the buzz","review":"The book is an absolute bore to read. It is not exciting, adventurous nor funny, in spite of its title that implies comedy and entertainment. To finish one page of this book is an achivement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and Unwed","review":"I gave it a one star only because zero stars are not an option. I've read Harlequin romances with more plot and better characters. I just can't believe I made the mistake of buying the next book prior to reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE TRASH","review":"If you enjoy vulgarity ad nauseam and no really redeemable characters, this is the book for you. I did like the mom. Betsy and Jessica are good friends but use such bad language when talking with one another it makes one wonder. Betsy literally takes out her bitter disappointment with her cowardly father and horrible stepmother on the whole world. Truth be told, she probably does not like herself. If you never read this book you won't miss a thing. If you really like vampire books, read Maggie Shayne or Christine Feehan."},{"rating":"2","title":"More laughs than bites","review":"If you are a fan of dark and intense vampire fiction like Anne Rice, this book is not for you. But if you are interested in a hilarious look at how a woman who doesn't want to be a vampire copes with all the changes you'll laugh aloud with \\"Undead and Unwed\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly awful...","review":"Could be a good teenage girl book if it wasn't for the two or three graphic sexual encounters.OK, she's invincible and she knows it - where do you go from there?Don't waste your time on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as other reviewers have stated","review":"After reading the reviews of \\"Undead and Unwed\\", I expected the book to be a funny mix of chick-lit and fantasy. While the book can accurately be called chick-supernatural, it failed in the humor department. Davidson, the author, tried too hard to be witty. The first three chapters have more exclamation points \\"!\\" than I have ever seen before in my life. (really!!)The main character, Betsy, was unlikable. It's like Davidson took Carrie from Sex in the City, dumbed her down and took away everything that makes her interesting--then made her a vampire called \\"Betsy\\".This book isn't worth the time or effort. Read Kelley Armstrong or Tanya Huff instead of this series. Save yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed at best","review":"I love paranormal romances, as long as they are written well. If the novel has a good storyline, realistic characters, and problems that I can (at some level) commiserate about, then I am all there. I read Undead and Unwed and could not get into it. The pace of the book and the dialogue left a lot to be desired and I forced myself to finish the book. If you are looking for some great books... try the anita blake series (for werewolves, vampires, etc), the meredith gentry series (for fairies and all things fey), or J.D Robb's Eve Dallas series (a great mystery/cop thriller series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and uncool","review":"The idea of this book was \\"cute\\", i.e., take a self-centered, vapid, vain chiclet and make her a vampire. No wait, make her an important vampire and juxtapose the two. I know, she'll be so vain she'll hate men but love expensive shoes! She'll even be a Republican! The cuteness just doesn't end. Neither does the annoyance, unfortunately.I applaud the attempt to create an original vampire character, making an ordinary, vain, imperfect human an immortal. When Davidson gets into action there is some spark and suspense. And there is also some humor when Betsy tries to continue to fit into her former life. But when a character is so stupidly self-centered and immature all in the name of \\"cuteness\\" -- and when there is not even a tiny acknowledgement that life might be a little different now -- then reading becomes an exercise in torture, and a minor diversion, like a toothache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took Me By Surprise","review":"I hadn't expected this book to be any good. I thought it was brainless fluff and picked it up because I was desperate for something to read.I was surprised.It's not the greatest book I've ever read and it doesn't require a lot of brain power but....you do end up liking the main character. She is flakey and the whole idea of her being Queen of the Vampires is laughable but the characters in the book thought it was funny too. So, it's a kind of tongue-in-cheek humour. The characters are likeable, the plot is decent, and it doesn't try to be too serious (which it isn't).If you're looking for something light and fluffy and mildly entertaining, give this book a shot. You might be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and entertaining","review":"A vampire story with a comical twist! Plus the requisite smidgen of romance... The main character's take on becoming a creature of the night was lighthearted, funny, and unique. The characters were completely unbelievable, but in a fun way, and the storyline kept me reading. There are portions that are a little raunchy, so parental guidance is suggested. I would say that if you're looking for a fun, fluffy tale to read, this is a good book to choose. However, if you're very into 'real' vampire lore, I'd stay away from this book. It doesn't have the hard, gritty feel of your typical horror-genre vampire story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire romantica for the fashion/shoe conscience","review":"Laughed hard & loud. Headache funnyI giggle just think about it.Truly something new and fresh.I CAN NOT WAIT FOR MORE LIKE THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book with more to come","review":"I just adored this book. This book is for anyone who loves shopping for shoes and vampires. According to Davidson's website there are more books to be published in this series starting with Undead and Unemployed. Can't wait"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doth thith go with my thoes?","review":"Thanks to a great friend, I have dithcovered the ultimate opposite of what mosth folkes think a vampire thude be. Betsy is a whacky, smart, thoe loving vamp who's mouth gets away with her. Then, enter Sinclair. The king who needths a queen. Jutht read the book. You'll laugh, giggle and guffaw the whole way through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad sitcom...","review":"I liked the premise and there were some moments of amusement in this book. But overall it was just tedious and juvenile. I understand that it's supposed to be a parody of sorts, but so much of the dialog felt like a very bad sitcom to me... wooden and repetitive lines spouted by two-dimensional characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Choos? Prada? Gucci? Vampire Queen","review":"Undead and UnWedMary Janice DavidsonRating 4/5Betsy Taylor *don't call her Elizabeth* was attacked by 4 fiends 2 months ago, and she was laid off from her secretarial job, only to go home and be run over by a car and tossed into a tree to die. 3 days later she awakens in the funeral parlor un-aware that she has awoken as a vampire.She tries to die again in many different ways, but nothing works. A minister tells her she's a vampire and all hell breaks loose. Is she the prophesied Queen of the Undead? All the vamps seem to think so. Will she be able to save the day in her Manolo Blahniks?

Finding out that your evil stepmonster had buried you in polyester and cheap shoes and has taken all your expensive shoes, of course.That really gives you the gist of this laugh-out-loud book. I read much of this book while commuting, and got a lot of stares.Minor complaints could be an ending that seems overly sexually explicit, given the rest of the book, and a confrontation with the baddie that seems poorly explained and flimsy. But its not a big deal. This book is strictly for fun, and in that regard, it delivers bigtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical - if you like Evanovich, this series is for you!","review":"Irreverent and hysterically funny, if you've read the Janet Evanovich books and enjoyed them then you'll love this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Wonder","review":"Wow!

My only regret was that the sexual tension that was built lead nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good, if it weren't for the heroine...","review":"I read this book based on an amazon recommendation - apparently since I read the Southern Vampire mysteries this book should be right up my alley. While the general idea and plot of the book could be good, I just couldn't get past how annoying the main character (Betsy) is. It was a quick read, thankfully, and I spent it alternately enjoying the book and cringing anytime Betsy had dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and boring","review":"Is the author of this book 12 years old or what? I, as a reader, am not. Having read about half of this book I am starting to want to through it out the window. Why am I wasting my time? The main character keeps talking in circles and most of the time she will begin on one subject and go into about a hundred different subjects to make her point and then I am so confused that I have to reread her main subject to get the actual point she is trying to make. Kind of like talking to my teenage neices! There are parts that are funny but I actually want to strangle the main character because she is such an airhead. If you really want this book you need to ask yourself why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I ask you ladies, is not the whole romance book supposed to be about a man and woman who spend time with each other, and, oh I don't know fall in love? And at the end of the book wind up with each other or at the very least tell each other that they love the other?Now maybe I missed something (I did skip a few twenty pages or so of idotic drivel) but non of these things happened. They had sex yes, it was great. Yes, but no one was together and no one said they loved each other.That however was not the worst part. It was the idotic heroin (and I use that word lightly. Feather light.) Could anyone be nore vapid, self-centered and dare I say just plane stupid? I don't know maybe that was the whole point. All I know is that I'm never going to read another book by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeugh!","review":"I love vampire novels. I'm a fan of Yarbro, Rice, Hamilton, and a host of others. And I actually kind of liked this one up until the sex scene between Betsy and what's his face. I found the sex scene to be completely unexpected and totally useless to the plot of the book that I never got past it. I have no desire whatsoever to read another book in the series. Now I have nothing against sex. I completely love both of Hamilton's series: Anita Blake and Merry Gentry, so sex, even graphic sex, does not turn me either. I think the author spent so much time telling me how much Betsy hated him that I hated him too, and that her having sex with him just completely turned me off of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"It was a snarky, sarcastically, fun read. I am hooked and ready for volume two. I cab not wait to see what new scrapes Eric and Betsy get into!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Vampire Romp","review":"I really enjoyed this as the first one I'd tried of Mary Janice Davidson. The mix of chick-lit with rising from the dead was fun reading. Betsy's obsession with shoes and her unwillingness to follow the protocol for vampires gives it an offbeat feel. I'll be looking for more by Davidson to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and underwhelming","review":"I was just looking for something light and entertaining to read. The story isn't bad but the writing is painful. The heroine is supposed to be twenty something but she talks and acts like she's thirteen. It was so painful I had to force myself to finish it. It was like Twilight all over. If you like Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey then you might like like the writing in this book. I feel dumber having read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YMMV","review":"I am a big fan of both irreverent vampire stories (like Buffy) and chick lit. This seemed like a nice mixture, but it was a struggle for me to finish it. I found the heroine so grating, the dialogue so ridiculous, and the humor so unfunny it was painful. Jokes like calling Sinclair \\"Sink Lair\\" were not funny to me the first time, and by the tenth, well, I was nigh homicidal. I see the intent, but for me it fell alarmingly flat.That said, there are so many positive reviews that obviously I am in the minority. My suggestion would be that you check out a few pages of it before you buy. If you find her sense of humor entertaining, then you'll enjoy the book. If not, well, put it back down, as I wish I had. Your mileage may vary, as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such potential...","review":"I loved the idea of these books. It sounded new and fresh and I was excited enough about reading them that I purchased the first two books in the series. What a disappointment.The ideas are all there and they ARE good ideas, but these are dreadfully, terribly written, and even the greatest ideas are executed so badly that getting through this book was no easy task (and it's a tiny little book too)! I understand why there are so many good reviews of these books - they have a funny theme. If you can get past the writing, and I really don't think I'm a literature snob - I might be wrong, but I really don't think I am - and the, for lack of a better term, \\"falseness\\" of the characters, you will enjoy the books. They are exactly what they pretend to be.Happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written.","review":"I tried, I really tried to enjoy this book. As someone mentioned before, I was trying to fill the void left by Charlaine Harris, but this just made me feel worse. I just couldn't get into the way the book was written. It was corny, the author tried to hardto make EVERYTHING funny. It really wasn't necessary to spell out so much of the dialogue. Who needs to read out the sound of the cat meowing? reeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooowwww??????? It was just overdone for my taste, hard to find romance in so much corny dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope it Gets Better","review":"After reading glowing reviews of this book, I was surprised to find it poorly written, with an unsympathetic character as our 'heroine'. The author, Davidson, isn't particularly good at developing different characters--Betsy doesn't have a strong 'voice' and some political commentary (from Betsy) seem both irrelevant and inappropriate to the story. While it does have 2 or 3 very funny moments it's not enough to carry the rest of the book. She has the potential to be a good writer but need a really tough editor. If you want well written, but light reading, look to Kim Harrison, Charlaine Harris or Tanya Huff. If you're just looking for fluff, this book will suit you fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure phun","review":"A great fun read. Delightful characters.

The authore has great \\"voice\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word...FANTASTIC!!!!!","review":"First off I really think that this is more of a mainstream paranormal novel (do those exist before now??) and less of a romance. I also am very careful about which vampire books I read. Some just don't do it for me. Ms. Davidson has been added to my \\"safe list\\". Actually she tops it now!Without going into the whole story lets just suffice it to say that the character's in this book are great, Ms. Davidson's sense of humor and wit is great, and she has managed to mix both of these concepts into a fast paced read that will literally having you laughing out loud and more then once. Yes, she even manages to mix in a little sensuality with your vampire's as well as adding her own spin on the whole vampire myth/legend. Trust me you have not read a vampire book like this one. EVER!!! I truly look forward to the next in this series. Ms. Davidson can't write fast enough for me...So hurry Ms. Davidson, Hurry!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHECK OUT Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse Series for the real deal","review":"Anyone who found the Queen Betsy books disappointing should check out Charlaine Harris' excellent Southern Vampire series starring Sookie Stackhouse.

Book # one is Dead Until Dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"very sassy read","review":"I enjoyed this book, this kooky premise. It provided laughs and fun, though toward the end did seems to run out of steam. I am not a big fan of heavy vampire novels, most tend to blur for me.

Sadly, the heroine of this book is just so DUMB that she droze me crazy. She is someone's bad impersonation of a ditz and does not come across as a real character at all, much less likable.

I don't know...I'd pass on this if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written, Cliche Story, Not Really Funny","review":"This book was pretty disappointing. The writing is not very strong, and the book is also poorly edited (there were many repetitions, some grammatical and spelling errors, and it was just generally sloppy). The story was OK, but the main character (Betsy) is very annoying. The language doesn't bother me, but potential readers should be forewarned that this book does contain many swear words. The humor was on about a 12-year-old level: if you think constantly screwing up people's names (like calling Sinclair \\"Sink Lair\\") is funny, this is the book for you.I gave it two stars instead of one because it was marginally entertaining and didn't take long to read, but this is definitely one to pick up at the library instead of spending money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"I bought this book after reading the author's acknowledge page on one of her other books. I had high hopes because I liked her writing style given on that acknowledgment. Imagine my surprise when it took me a good month or so to plod through this book (and I'm a fast reader). I couldn't get into the weak storyline and even weaker plot. The characters were too unbelievable (and I'm a writer) and the author's overuse of the F word left a bad taste in my mouth.

I could not really enjoy this book because I didn't really find the main character (Betsy) to be very interesting. She is flitty and self centered, which is suppose to make the book -oh-so funny- however I just found it rather annoying. Also, there is a lot of pointless sex in this book, that really adds nothing to the plot(although there is not much plot to begin with). This book reads more like a trashy romance novel than a vampire fantasy. I was so dissapointed that I don't intend to continue the series. If you are a fan of Armstrong and Harrison, stern clear of this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Juvenile","review":"Zero depth. I just didn't like the main character. It was like reading about a teenager who was supposed to be in her 30's. I'm in my 30's and don't relate to this character at all. On the upside, it didn't take me very long to read.

And then there's the BIG bonus - Sexy Eric Sinclair (ooh la la). My favorite line from the book came from him during the VERY hot and Steamy swimming pool scene (I thought the pages of my book were going to burst into flames) when she could hear his thoughts and he said \\"Oh Elizabeth, my luminous queen, I would die for you\\".

The plot is thin, the vamp references are uneven and she seems to \\"borrow\\" a lot from other really good authors with her \\"catch phrases\\" (ie, f**k-me pumps, etc.). The whole story feels bumpy, and about a third of the way through I found myself wishing ol' Buffy herself would swoop in and dust the whole lot of them. If you want to read a really funny and well written vampire genre book, try the \\"Dead\\" series by Charlaine Harris or a book called Carpe Demon, by Jule Kenner, about a vampire slayer soccer mom. Now that is a great read that a lot of women will really relate to! Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"The character of Besty is extremly annoying.

The characters weren't very likeable and the writing wasn'tvery polished, I felt like I was reading a high school manuscript.I only read the first book, because I just couldn't bear to read one more word, and honestly it was a struggle to even finish the book.I gave it two stars for the original story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Undead fan!","review":"This is definitely an interesting read.

I was, however, horribly disappointed with this second series. The first series was beautifully cast, the 'chemistry' between the characters a chief concern. Certain characters have been RE-cast in this second series, and none of them are - to my mind - as 'right' as the original cast (furthermore, it was somewhat disconcerting to see the character of 'Mona' wearing the same WIG in each series, but crowning a different FACE!) My real problem with 'More Tales of the City' is its pace; the first series (like the first books) is very fast paced - this series is a real plodder. It's worth renting out of interest, but I wouldn't buy it. (Sorry, Amazon.com!

I was hoping for some better sounding songs. Oh well, I guess this one will have to do until Pokemon 4 comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, there goes another shoddy PKMN album.....","review":"This album contains songs from the Pokemon Johto series, and it's one of the worst groups of Pokemon songs I've heard. The songs, although (sometimes) relevant to the Pokemon series, are written by pop groups favoured by children of about 8-11, and feature little or no actual emotion. The songs (like the bands) all sound the same too, which makes it drag on and on for what seems like eternity. The only redeeming feature of the album is 'Two Perfect Girls', sung by Brock. This song is relatively fun, and has a catchy tune. But that's where the good side ends.For children who really adore Pokemon, it's for you. But it's things like this that can really put you off Pokemon if you're only a half-time fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Good as Hoped","review":"The soundtrack, like the movie, doesn't live up to its excellent predecessors. Like the others, it has an enhanced version of a title song, in this case \\"Pokemon Johto\\". But this CD has needlessly added the normal TV version as well. While \\"To the Unknown\\" by Innosense and \\"All We Wanna Do\\" are good songs, this soundtrack is littered with cheap fill-ins from the show, most of which are already on a different Pokemon CD. \\"Biggest Part of My Life\\" is a decent song. The songs aren't entirely *bad*, per se, it's just that any Pokefan has probably heard most of them before, they are from little-known artists, and they have simple lyrics which get rather dull. Best songs are # 1, 2, 4, 11, and 12. If you want a good Pokemon CD, get the 1st or 2nd.

It's a great soundtrack... if you haven't heard these songs before. They basically took all the songs from the show and threw them in the movie. That's not a bad thing, it's good they got rid of all that pop music. But if I were you, the main reason I'd buy the soundtrack would be because of the 'Pokemon Johto' movie version. The main themes are always the best on the soundtracks and I bought the previous ones just for them. There's no actual popular people on the track but that's probably due to Kid's WB. It's a big improvement over the past two and it's worth the cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but...","review":"The booklet is nice.

But this album is a pop masterpiece that is totally evocative of its era. It only could have been recorded in 1966. It's a wondrous mishmash of musical currents: loungy bossa nova, bright Memphis horns, David Rose-style bump-and-grind, easy listening choruses, catchy bumblegum pop, and bold Vegas showstopping. And it all works! The mostly forgotten Lee Hazlewood, who produced the album, was a genius who had a finely tuned ear for commercial music. He crafted Nancy's wholly fabricated tough-chick image to ride on top of his brilliant arrangements. This is one of the most listenable albums of the '60s.

Go ahead and get this book if you're interested in healing trauma, but don't bother if you want practical information on lucid dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep introduction to other perspectives on healing trauma","review":"Ancient cultures viewed pain and trauma as part of the tapestry of life, the obstacles we must face, and lessons in growth if we choose them to be. In the Western world, despite all the trapping of comfort and wealth, Westerners have the highest rates of clinical depression and mood disorders. Though the statistic is subject to debate, it is a clue that material possessions do not make life any easier when dealing with pain. This book provides a detailed explanation of how this pain can be healed from a different vantage point - that of the indigenous practices of ancient shamans. A way out of pain is not denial but harnessing the energy into something that in the ends, fosters positive growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking for a carpet sweeper to pick up crumbs from messy kids (and adults) after meals.

Not at all useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell Perfect Sweep","review":"I just got the perfect sweep after reading the reviews and here's my opinion on the product. The perfect sweep works great on hardwood floors and tiles, excellent job in picking hair and lint and a not so good job in picking small pieces of paper(you have to run the vacuum over it 3 to 4 times). It does and excellent job in picking lint and hair on carpets too except you really have to push on it to get it rolling on the carpet.Conclusion, Excellent tool to use in between regular vacuuming and a good way to keep the carpet that just vacuum look on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Did I really pay $30 for this? The handle design is awful - it keeps coming apart. When I empty the tray, it is full of dog hair, which means it does pick that up very well.

How frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pick up much","review":"I was wanting one of these sweepers, to use for small messes instead of hauling out the vacuum. But...I'm still hauling out the vacuum as this sweeper just doesn't do the job. I've had this product since December 04 and now it's just taking up space in the corner of a closet. It seems like it should work well...but no matter how many times I sweep over stuff it just doesn't pick much up! It's also very awkward to empty, and the handle keeps coming apart. I can't recommend this item, even though the concept seems great. My grandma had a similar type of sweeper, more basic, and that thing would pick up anything.I was hoping for the same with this, but, no such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea not well made","review":"as mentioned by someone else.the parts ofthe handle keep falling apart.and the cleaning tool keeps falling off.some debris falls through the bottom through cracks.but it still has been a great help in cleaning up from infants after feeding (cherrios, crumbs etc..)I am now looking for a different model by either same or different company, which does not havethese problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've used better but this is good","review":"For the price, this is good for spot cleaning crumbs and small areas.

This is not the sweeper for that. I have a tile floor in the kitchen so it's an uneven surface. This sweeper doesn't pick up anything on that floor. OK, I thought, I'll just use it on my hardwoods. Nope, doesn't pick up anything either. I have to go over and over and over the same piece of dirt to get it to pick up. It doesn't even pick up Cheerios! As a test I put uncooked rice on the floor in a pile. It hardly picked up anything. So, don't waste your money.

Heavy Traffic is the first, and where Heavy Traffic is about the sincere struggle of an artist trying to find his voice among the chaos; Fritz the Cat is about a con-artist trying to satisfy his ever expanding id. Both films are set in New York and explore the urban world, but in very different ways and with very different intentions. Heavy Traffic is the more personal of the two films, exploring issues of family, isolation, love and the hope for redemption. Fritz the Cat is about lust, insincerity and appetites of all kind, including destruction. A wonderful though nihilistic view of the \\"enlightened\\" sixties. Also damn funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN IN CARTOONS","review":"This was my first time seeing this movie. It was really good.

The DVD contains the original 1974 cult classic and the quality is wonderful. The picture and sound magnificent.

I researched this toy and read only positive reviews so I asked the grandparents to get it for my son's 3rd birthday. Within a few weeks, screws began to come loose, tiny wooden \\"plugs\\" covering the screws came unglued, and now almost ALL of the hardware has fallen out (screws, nuts, bolts and washers!!)It was very expensive and now it is so many pieces!!I am going to try to repair it, otherwise it belongs in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing","review":"This is also my first time posting a review on Amazon but I am so disappointed by this toy -- especially given how expensive it is -- that I feel compelled to write. We ordered this toy for my son over a year ago for Christmas and it's been a headache -- the glue used to hold the wooden pieces together has failed and the wooden pegs have fallen out, so my husband has tried to rig it back together with tape, superglue, etc. Unfortunately these fixes don't last long -- and should not be necessary in the first place, since we paid over $70 for the toy, based on some good reviews we read online. We also purchased the bulldozer which has disintegrated even further than the crane.My son was very excited to receive this crane, given his obsession with all things revolving around construction vehicles. It's been very disappointing to watch it fall apart. Guidecraft needs to do some serious quality control on their line of construction vehicle toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Apart!","review":"DO NOT BUY!! I am SO disappointed in this product. Everyone was thrilled at first. My son loved it and we loved it too. I love that it was wood and it looked like it was very sturdy. After a month of play, small wooden pieces that were covering the screws fell off. That was a problem with my teething daughter crawling around, so we pulled the rest off and continued to let my son play. Since then, the rope has unraveled and broken and now the main pieces are detaching from one another after only a few months of use. Terribly disappointed-- this was a very expensive toy and my son is now without a crane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and Sooo Disappointing","review":"I purchase items online regularly and have never written a review before but felt compelled to share our experience with this toy. We purchesed this toy 9 months ago for our son's 3rd birthday. He enjoyed the toy but found it difficult to use. He is generally very good with building sets and fine motor activities but found it difficult to attach the front and back together. The string used to move the crane up and down is awkward and does not move well. WORST of all, after a few months in our home (avg temp and humidity) this toy began to completely fall apart!!!! I have found 15 or more small pieces around the house. Some are small wooden pieces which were glued on to cover screw holes others were metal rods that held the swive l mechanism together. Then the glue holding the crane to the back portion completely gave and the toy was in pieces and unusable. VERY DANGEROUS if you have smaller children in your home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above-average film tie-in that stands on its own","review":"Though De Palma receives top billing, this book was written by the English novelist Campbell Black, adapted for De Palma's film (which is basically a re-telling of 'Psycho' in modern Manhattan, with the sex and violence quotient quadrupled). The novel tells the same story as the film, but differs entirely in style: whereas the film is a very black comedy (as was 'Psycho'), the tone of the novel is rather bleak and morose, more a reflection of Campbell Black's English sensibility than De Palma's playful manipulative (and distinctly American) style. The film is pure visual cinema, while the novel is a more internalized psychological thriller that delves into the neurosis and motivations of each of the characters (including Bobbi - the razor-weilding blonde transvestite whose grisly murder of a sad, adulterous housewife is the centerpiece of the both the film and the book.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best heater we've ever had","review":"My husband bought this heater two years ago and we use it 24/7 during our winter months (okay we live in Austin and thats only 4 months...but still :) I hate turning on central heat, we only use this in my baby's room and little girls rooms. It has a temp thermometer on it and you can set the heater to shut off when it gets to a certain temp...so when their rooms are like 60, i can be assured that i can set it for 68-70 and it will turn off. it is POWERFUL and can heat up a large space amazingly fast, yet has so much control and reliability, it will shut off when it gets to the pre set temp. i LOVE this heater.

I can't recommend this product enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for exactly one year, then died.","review":"This heater worked very well supplementing household heat for a fairly large (12 x 16) and chilly basement room. Then about two days after the warranty expired - the heater expired as well. First it emitted an ugly smell indicating some malfunction. After turning it off for a while it would not come back on. If it cost around $30, I would probably buy another one, but it is not worth $60+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that it or did we get a lemon?!?","review":"We are extremely disappointed with this Delonghi model; the unit hardly gives off any heat even on the highest setting. When I place my hands in front of the heater fan, I can't even feel any heat beyond 2 feet (no kidding - I could feel some air but no warmth). We figured that maybe it takes a while to kick in so we left the heater on full blast for at least 3 hours straight, but even after all that time, we could hardly feel any difference in temperature. Maybe this heater might work if you put it about 1 foot away from you, but other than that, it's pretty useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"Beware - I purchased a new unit and upon the first use I noticed that max heat setting would not work. After approximately 10 seconds of use, the heater stopped and a buzzer went off. After letting the unit cool so that it would start up again, I tried several more times to get the unit to work properly. I began to notice a large internal spark on the internal coils and connectors.I view this as a serious safety hazard and am amazed that this wasn't discovered prior to shipment.

It has run now for over 1 hour, and the room temp is still 63 and I'm going to pack this thing back up and send it back. I really hope this is just a faulty unit, because if this is all it has to offer for heat I don't see how they can justify the price. Also, I tend to unplug devices after use, and with this thing I'd have to go through setting the clock every time I plug it back in. Even if I just set it to \\"00:01\\" to get it to work, that's still a hassle. The clock should be optional, so it only needs to be set for timer use, not as a start-up requirement. To top it off, the dial is completely dark, so I had to fumble around with the light this evening, so I could read it and set the clock. WAY too much trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good for 1 month, then died.","review":"Saw all the good reviews and decided to try one out.

The good part is no doubt, Sandstorm. This song is unlike anything I have heard before. Also, Feel the Beat, and Before the Storm are worth listening to many times over. However, most of the songs sound alike, most noticeably Sandstorm and Feel the Beat. Although the songs are good, you will find yourself thinking more than once that the track is repeating itself. A word of caution. Do NOT bother to listen to any of the songs after Flow. The mixes only take away from the other songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the singles, you'll LOVE this","review":"If you've heard the singles then you know what to expect from Before the Storm. With the exception of Drums from New York all of the tracks follow the same routine with the characteristic slow down mid track and the frenetic finish. Indeed without the addition of Drums from New York the tracks on the album would probably all be too alike although all are as well delivered and as brilliant as any of the three singles. All in all if you like the singles then get this album, if not then this definitely is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good techno cd","review":"This cd has some absolutely great songs on it.

Honestly, its as if the v man has remixed the entire cd after its previous track. The vocals arent great, and the cd is an alltogether sloppy effort, lacking structure. However, there is supposedly a 'hidden track' if you play your tracks in a specific order, but i never got it to work. In sum, your 14.95 would be better spent on a variety of other cd's.

Darude could have done so much better. The only songs that are notable on this album are the overplayed \\"Feel The Beat\\" and \\"Sandstorm.\\" I really don't think that it was necessary to include all those remixes on \\"Before The Storm\\" since those two songs are great as it is. It really devalues this CD and makes you wonder if he has any talent for making catchy trance songs. (I know he does.)Another thing that troubled me about this CD is that most of the songs sound alike. I know tranceheads really enjoy this, but I, for one, can't stand it.

Once you know the algorithm, coding in ANY language you know is easy...I've been programming FORTRAN 90 FEM codes for two years, and I think this book is a must, even as a desktop reference.

There are stimulating interviews with Bowles and his critics and friends, and the differces and contradictions in their views are thoroughly explored. Allen Ginsberg gives a remarkable, lucid explication of Bowles' world-view, and others give honest glimpses into his fascinating life. The filmakers pull off the impossible trick of being severely objective and sympathetic at the same time; their approach is the journalistic equal of Bowles prose style. Includes excerpts from Bowles' lively musical compositions. Bowles was a terrifying, implacable writer but he had something important so say, and fans of \\"The Sheltering Sky\\", \\"A Distant Episode\\" and his other work should not miss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-have\\" for readers, students, and scholars of Paul Bowles' works.","review":"Paul Bowles: The Complete Outsider is a DVD documentary and biography of influential 20th century novelist Paul Bowles, perhaps best known for writing \\"The Sheltering Sky\\". Filmed in Morocco and featuring exclusive interviews with well-known cultural figures Allen Ginsberg and Ned Rorem, Paul Bowles: The Complete Outsider explores Bowles' development as a novelist and composer, his marriage to writer Jane Bowles, and his amorphous sexuality. Bowles himself speaks about his life, writing, music, his use of drugs, and his friends, including W.H. Auden, Tennessee Williams, Aaron Copland, Gertrude Stein, and Ginsberg. Rare archival footage and interviews round out The Complete Outsider as a \\"must-have\\" for readers, students, and scholars of Paul Bowles' works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lifetime","review":"I bought about 10 of these, and they get gradually dimmer until after a year or so they are not useful.

The music is laid back and lazy. And while the band seems to consist of talented musicians, Condus' trumpet isn't anything special. I don't understand why this band has become popular.The band, for whatever reason, plays Balkan music but names themselves after a Middle Eastern city. There sound doesn't really describe, in my opinion, the sound which makes these regions so great.I've even heard this band compared to the Janissary-Turkish sound, but I don't hear that either.I would stay away from this album if your looking for authentic Balkan-gypsy folk music... or anything that sounds like it has spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER-REACHING..NEEDS DISCIPLINE AND A METHOD","review":"In a world of the inevitable forthcoming Brittney Spears cd..this will pass the muster, for most.

Filling up the bucket is a pain, having to use a separate spray bottle because the builtin spraying mechanism cuts out intermittently and it just gets things too wet to be anywhere near effective.

The accessory hose is nice and flexible and it has a few tools that I used to clean the crumbs from my couch crevices.

On the first pass over a recently vacuumed carpet it filled the dirt container with dog hair we couldn't see and didn't know was on the carpet.

And unlike most of the white filters other have, this one is washable (rinse with cold water) and doesn't need to be replaced like the others. I do wash the filter with cold water at the bottom frequently because I have to, but it really holds up and I haven't had to get a new one yet! It has three filters on it, the one on the bottom of the canister -if that stays clean you never have to clean the one on the side. We really have loved having it.

I have a unique situation, as I foster dogs for a rescue organization, so I have a lot of pet hair, dirt, and torn up paper! I thought the Bissell bagless would be a wonder, but it's been very disappointing.

For the first six months it worked great, but after that it was clog after clog after clog. The hose that leads from the cleaning head is continuously stopped up, and I spend more time dismantling it and shoving coat hangers in there than I do vacuuming. I've gutted it more than once in hopes of finding a secret stash of hair that keeps it from sucking. No luck. Instead, the vacuum spits the dirt and hair out the back of the cleaning head at my feet.

I noticed it has gotten louder over the last few months, then the last time I used it, it smelled like it was burning. I assumed it was the belt, but the belt was fine. So, I cleaned all the filters and made sure none of the hoses were clogged. Tried it again and the burning smell returned and it wasn't picking anything up. I'm in a small, two bedroom condo, no pets or kids, this should have lasted longer. I owned a cheap Eureka for about 10 years, I think I'll go back to a more reliable brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Vacuum","review":"I was in desperate need of a new vacuum and after using a bagless vac for a few years, I had to find a suitable replacement. Not only is this vacuum a great value, it's lightweight and it works extremely well. The first time I used it, I had to empty the canister twice. And that was only the main floor of the house. I was impressed at just how quiet it is. Some vacuums you almost need earplugs to use them. With this one, I can still carry on a conversation without having to compete with a loud vacuum. Another great thing with this vaccum was the ease in assembling it. You just need one screwdriver to screw in 6 screws and the rest snaps together. The only downside is that the canister is small and if you have a large house, you may have to take a few trips to the garbage can to empty it. Other than that, I highly recommend this vacuum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"I have had this cleaner for a year and at first it was the best one I ever had but for the last several months I have not been able to keep the hoses from getting clogged.

I bought it as a vacuum which I could carry down the basement stairs, on occasion, as needed. And, it is light weight... But three times the work compared to other vacuums I've owned.

Every conversation is short, simple, and archetypical. If you read SR novels to get a feeling for the SR universe, you will find nothing in THE BURNING TIME you haven't read a hundred times before. Even worse, the text on the back cover lures you into believing that there has finally come an end to Talon and company. Not quite true. Kenson tries to write good SR fiction, but it's not enough.

Its funny to hear a hall of fame rock n roll bands music turned into bluesgrass tunes!And its no imbarrasment, even the AC/DC fans themselves enjoy this music! And Brian Johnson (singer for AC/DC) and Cliff Williams (Bass player for AC/DC) went to see Hayseed Dixie preform and loved it too! And so will you if your familuer with these songs!

I don't get infuriated when someone covers one of my favorite bands, this album just isn't entertaining. The musicianship is adequete, I just don't see much appeal besides pulling it out at a party for a laugh. I can't really think of who the blue grass versions of these songs would appeal to.

The very idea of a bluegrass version of AC/DC songs sounds like a parody. Yet, for some reason, these musicians seem to take themselves pretty seriously. However, AC/DC's already ridiculous lyrics sound even more absurd (if that's possible) sung with a bluegrass backing. Also, the running time is barely 30 minutes (Come to think of it, I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing!). And what audience are they trying to appeal to anyway? It's hard to imagine serious AC/DC fans going for this, & the musicianship isn't so overwhelmingly great that it would appeal to bluegrass fans.

It's too dang bad the members of Hayseed Dixie feel the need to remain anonymous; the musicianship is impeccable, and the fiddle and Dobro solos take your breath away--I'd like to thank these fellows.These songs display the qualities of a great cover--they're different enough to be worth doing, and they do justice to the songs and to the style they're done in.

The book is more a follow-up to the story, rather than a retelling or a sequel, but it does give you the entire story covered in the documentary. Besides providing us with some very interesting insights into the lives of the celebrities in her life, both well-known and obscure, Ms. Cross tells a fascinating story of identity and family relationships, with no easy answers, and I'd call it a very good read.

Not only does the memoir deal with the ugliness of racism but also the pain of growing up with a selfish mother. Her story is told with insight and compassion dispite events that may have made the telling impossible for most. June Cross successfully maintained a relationship with a manipulative, selfish mother without becoming bitter which may have been the key to her own success. I found her ablility to navigate her childhood without coming \\"undone\\" an inspiration. A great book. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a way to understand themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Several things turned me off while I read this book. In the first place, although I can empathise with the pain June felt, I detested the militant turn she took. A careful reading shows many barbs at white people, just for being white. I'm sorry Norma was such a monstrous mother, but that does not make every white person a racist, nor every black heroic. Secondly, the writing itself was pedestrian. Third, it was infuriating to hear Norma's twisted defense of herself....\\"oh what did I do wrong in a previous life, that I was not permitted to raise my children?\\" That is bunk, as she chose to have three illegitimate children and give them ALL away, even the white children, so it wasn't just racism. If she regretted any of this at all, why did she refuse to have anything to do with her son's children...she claims their existence made her feel old. I was angry at June for not respecting Peggy enough...that woman was a true mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what expected","review":"I bought this book because I was interested in the content.

The principal for the heater is to heat the oil inside which in time would provide heat for the affected room. I turned it on high (there are 3 settings) and left it on for 4 - 5 hours. There wasn't any noticeable change in room temp. Thinking the room was simply too large, I moved it to a small bedroom. On high the temp in the room went up marginally. Another thing is this would be very dangerous around children or pets. The unit gets VERY hot to the touch except for the handle in front. It has casters, and it will move quite easily, but when hot you must be very careful.While this unit looks impressive, it's not. You would be better getting a heater like the vornado that generates more heat and moves it around the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"A considered and intelligent piece of writing","review":"This is the third such guide to have been published about Guterson's novel - and easily the best.

I returned the phone because it did not improve my ability to communicate. I replaced it with a basic AT&T; phone that has no special features for the hearing impaired, and found the sound of higher quality than the Ameriphone.I am very generously giving this a two-star rating only because it delivers high volume.

Having been born in the 1960's, I loved being able to visit it as an adult through the pages of this book. T.J. MacGregor did a mesmerizing job of traversing the timeline, and was quite believable in a genre that is difficult to fathom for some.The 4-star rating was given because of two reasons.#1: I didn't feel that there was REALLY a good reason to kidnap Annie and the other previous children and I felt that the author struggled with a cause that didn't quite work. The villian in the book should have had more solid definition and motive.#2: The back story with Sheppard on the present side of time failed to keep my interest. I wanted to go back to Mira and Annie.The characters were wonderfully crafted, and the mix of fictional and historical (think Janis Joplin) individuals were very satisfying to visit with.

When I had to stop reading, the characters and plot continued to work on me. The plot begins with a child abduction, heart-wrenching, but done before . . . and then the characters jump back in time and the plot twists in unknown directions. The characters become more and more real with every page. The setting is beautiful, the plot is riveting and the characters are well-developed. This book will appeal to those who enjoy a good mystery as well as those who enjoy the mind stretch of time travel.A very well-written, enjoyable book. I'll definitely be reading more of T.J.

Time to time there have been BSC books addressing baby sitting charges with autism, dyslexia, so there is a possibility that the girl may have been dealing with depression or anxiety and that could have been addressed in the book, and may have empowered children who read this book and were dealing with their own issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sad","review":"I found this movie to be sad and depressing.

Even though I liked the brothers, I feel that the straight one (can't remember his name) makes too huge of a transition over the course of this film. I suppose it could happen....This film seems to borrow parts from other movies. There is the \\"Memento\\" style beginning and end (which I though was masterfully done), The \\"Rites of Passage\\" brother thing, and a scene or two borrowed from \\"Philadelphia\\".Well acted, technically sound, and entertaining.

(I had to spend some time learning the game as well - in order to help with the more complicated parts.) Our kids seem to enjoy setting up the board, with all its tiles in three dimension, the most.

We bought it in August and it is still in a bag by the door from the game he played a few days ago at a friend's house. The game is addictive - he has got the entire block hooked from a middle school student down to a kindergartener (although it is more of a middle school level). After playing it the others went out and purchased their own playing pieces. It appears to be a fun fantasy game - I haven't played it but I've watched in awe as they have, sometimes all afternoon (instead of video games!). It was a little hard to learn - my husband read all the rules and played it with my son for a week or so, until he understood how to play it. I would highly recommend the game if you have a child who loves Pokemon or that type of TV show - hours of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!

The first Master set, Rise of the Valkyrie, is being replaced by the Marro Master set. The first Master set has a much greater *variety* of figures, allowing players to make a greater variety of armies.

Fortunately I borrowed this book from the library, otherwise I really would be kicking myself for shelling out $ for this useless book. If you want to learn about SAP R/3 system, you probably have better luck in your company's training classes.

Luckily, I still have their self-titled album, which is one of my favorites of all time. It's also a good place to start listening to John and John, surpassed only by Flood, the most friendly of all TMBG efforts. Severe Tire Damage, which is a live-ish showcase of their talents, would also be a good first buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical smorgasbord. . .","review":"They Might be Giants go on a tour of musical genres on their first album, tying things together with their clean harmony and sharp lyrics. There's a country song, a couple of straight-out rockers, some new wave, and some uncharted territory (a sample of Johnny Cash's \\"Daddy Sang Bass\\" turns into a song about a car that's also a boat). Some of it makes sense, a lot of it makes no sense, but there's energy and intelligence to spare.These songs were recorded with just two guys and a drum machine, one of its strengths is that its simplicity is never obvious. John and John know their way around a recording studio, and throw in some curveballs to keep your attention -- including the first phoned-in guitar solo I've heard, and some backward masking that isn't backwards.If you're new to the band, Flood is a better jumping on point because it's not quite as strange. If you're a fan already, you must own this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure heaven.","review":"This album, in my opinion, has to be one of the greatest pieces of music ever recorded.

These 2 guys obviously had a great deal of fun making this album, especially with a tricked out 80's Casio Keyboard (perhaps with the Air Drum Sticks attachment?) Thankfully as we all well know, they went on to record the theme to \\"Malcom In The Middle\\" called \\"You're Not The Boss Of Me\\" (unfortunately not on this album, but it would be out-of-place anyway). Despite my take on this album, it is a very sought after collector's item with prices from $10 to $20 used, and double those new. There are very few copies in circulation with a coninuing demand.It is as amusing as it is underwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blip in the digital download of \\"Everything Right is Wrong Again\\"","review":"I love this album and TMBG - I'd give them 4 stars. The 2 stars is for the Digital MP3 version of this album. On the first song (Everything Right is Wrong Again) at 1:42 in, there is a blip in the song. It's one of my favorite songs on the album and the blip is very distracting. I wish Amazon would get a fixed version of that song for the MP3 version."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully warped!","review":"This was, I think, the first CD I ever owned (it was a birthday gift). I've been a TMBG fan from the time I heard this album on cassette. I think the album is wonderfully warped (as is most of the rest of TMBG's work, what I've heard of it anyway). I like '80s music, or at least some of it, and I actually think the album's drum-machine beats are cool. I like the album's overall \\"simple\\" sound; it proves that music can still be really good without being really complex or \\"high-tech.\\" The album has some delightfully weird lyrics (typical of TMBG), and some strange but cool effects. I don't care that much for some of those really short \\"songs\\" (\\"Toddler Hiway,\\" \\"The Day,\\" \\"Boat Of Car\\"), but I really enjoy the rest of them.

My main beef about this rig is that it is very difficult telling when a fish is on the line. My guess is that the rod is so short and stiff that it does not transmit the movement of the fish on the line very well to the fisherman's hand. eg, I felt a tug on the line and it felt like I was reeling in a dead load of seaweed, no fight at all.

But given its high cost and the lack of hunting and fishing spots in Queens, NY, my parents never sprang for one. Bastards. Anyway, the best thing about being an adult (besides riding in cabs naked) is that you finally get to buy your own toys - and I just got my Pocket Fisherman after all these years. But you know what? I'm still miserable! I'm still short and pale and awkward and fat and my prom date still threw up on me! And there's no Pocket Fisherman that's going to change all that. Ever. It's just PLASTIC! It has no soul. It turns out that it's just a deceptive little mechanism that promised false happiness to me and many others. On balance, I would probably not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item!","review":"Great fishing pole! Easy to store! My son is amazed how compact and handy it is.

Why, you may ask?I'll tell you why. Madacy Records (the label on which this release and all of the other 'Golden Legends' releases appear on) prices their records really cheaply, expecting people like us to get suckered into it and buy them.But I'm smart enough to know not to. The sound quality on this release is terrible! No effort whatsoever to clean up these recordings.Do yourselves a favor and buy 'Greatest Hits' (the RCA release of course) or if you want to dig deeper, buy 'The Best of The Complete RCA Victor Recordings.' The sound quality on both of those are superb.But stay far, far away from this one. There's a reason why this is so cheap.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete tracks","review":"I got this because I'm looking for a specific recording of \\"Happy Go Lucky Local\\".

You're going to learn more anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well organized and well written","review":"First, you don't need your highlighter for this book! At the end of each chapter, the author does it for you. I found this book informative and helpful.My favorite chapter was Chapter 7: Managing the Environment, it gives an overview of how hard and confusing life can be for a child with NLD. Great to read again & again if you find you are losing patience with your NLD child. I also often copy the first 6 pages of this chapter and give it to those that work with my child; in the hopes they will have the necessary empathy in working with my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the older NLD child","review":"I returned the book. It was designed for the child diagnosed at a young age. We were diagnosed at 15. Found other books that were more helpful (also from Amazon) Nonverbal Learning Disabilities by Marieke Molenaar-Klumper, which is more clinical, but a very good book and Helping a Child with Nonverbal Learning Disorder or Aspergers Disorder by Kathryn Stewart, this one less clinical, and more practical. Talk about the similarities and differences between NLD and AD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference!","review":"I wish I had this book when my child was younger.

It's nice to have a book where you don't have to read it cover to cover but rather can turn to a page to answer your current concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I found this book dissappointing. It gives readers misinformation that can make symptoms of NLD worse, not better. For example, the author encourages the readers to allow video/computer play stating it \\"builds eye-hand coordination\\". Not only will this NOT develop eye-hand (that comes from anticipating a three dimensional object coming to you in space and manipulating the hands to accurately receive it\\" but fixation on computers often leads away from motor development and soical interaction. We don't need more misinformatoin about NLD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I found this book very helpful. It helped me understand my child better and gave me ideas I can use at home to make his life less stressful. I also read Nonverbal Learning Disabilities at School.

It is straighforward and unpretentious, and a great source of inspiration. I've read a number of Buddhist texts, and this is the one I keep coming back to. There are 33 chapters, each devoted to a particular ethical issue, such as \\"Overcoming Greed,\\" \\"Not Killing,\\" and \\"How to Manage Wealth.\\" Since the chapters are brief (usually 3-5 pages), I try to re-read one of them every day as part of my practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all true","review":"... Land without Bread--... IS a documentary, albeit a Brechtian one. The film certainly mocks the emerging documentary style, as well as the bourgeois confidence that we can understand things from their surface representation. But it's still a documentary, just as Bunuel's fiction films, which frequently subvert their genres' conventions, are nonetheless fiction.Anyway this is academic. What's important is that Land without Bread does compassionately portray its impoverished subjects (as would Bunuel's later film Los Olvidados), moreso than the Strutherian tears and voice-over we've come to expect in our nonfiction pablum."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Pixie's song Debaser","review":"Ok you should know that it is a real eye and that's why it looks so real! But it's a mule's eye. Made with Salvador Dali this is one cool movie, based on dreams they's had and some misreadings of Freud and I think a few French cinematic puns...it still has the power to shock. Land without Bread....done in the clinical form of some kind of documentary you tour the Hurdas provence of Spain which had only just been opened up to the rest of the world and is so poor that some peoplel have never seen bread.

It would be particularly helpful for those who do not already know the ins and outs of Hermes birkins.The author illustrates the beauty of an authentic birkin in detail. There is also a section on how to safely buy authentic birkins online for those who are impatient enough not to wait for one at the boutique.The author gives a style section that is cute and may appeal to a person with many birkins. That's just a fun section.I only wish there were more photographs in the book.

Now, bottom line is that you cannot guarantee authenticity on anything unless you purchase it at the brand-name store (in this case at a Hermes shop). Inside these pages is more fluff about how to decorate your Birkin (oh please, it's not a Christmas tree!) I found this entire read a complete waste of time and in the end I could not help but think some woman was simply trying to cash in on a current fashion craze. On top of it all the author has a web-site in which she sells these handbags for about $5,000 more than they sell for at a Hermes shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handbook of the Fabulous","review":"Silly book, fluff.

Unfortunately, there are very few tips and very little information that I found useful. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult for the average person to obtain an authentic Birkin -- which is why everyone wants one so badly! The author herself even says that she cannot divulge exactly how she acquires the Birkins that she sells at her store, which is, of course, exactly what her readers want to know!Also, the photos are not particulary helpful.

I've been a TMBG fan from the time I heard this album on cassette. I think the album is wonderfully warped (as is most of the rest of TMBG's work, what I've heard of it anyway). I like '80s music, or at least some of it, and I actually think the album's drum-machine beats are cool. I like the album's overall \\"simple\\" sound; it proves that music can still be really good without being really complex or \\"high-tech.\\" The album has some delightfully weird lyrics (typical of TMBG), and some strange but cool effects. I don't care that much for some of those really short \\"songs\\" (\\"Toddler Hiway,\\" \\"The Day,\\" \\"Boat Of Car\\"), but I really enjoy the rest of them. Like another reviewer, I've noticed that Mr. Flansburgh dominates this album. Don't know why that is, but it's O.K. with me. I still prefer TMBG to a lot of the other artists out there!

It has generic information about writing any resume. And then it has example resumes for various computer careers. Useless. You are far better off to invest some time in searching around for what computer professions are currently lacking people, and to see if there is a possible fit for you.

In these troubled times it is great to just sit back and remeber - Who we are, What we are about, the many that have gone so we may live this kind of life. John Wayne is by no means a singer but more of a narrator stating what most of us feel and ALL of us should feel and remember.

The sentiments are simple, yet honestly spoken and obviously from the heart. The familiar and unique cadence of Wayne's voice is as American as a Frederick Remington painting. I first owned this album on cassette in the early 1980's and to find it finally issued on CD during our hour of crisis has been a god-send. I did not always agree with Wayne politically, but this statement of human values will remain a cherished keepsake."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mitchum - author of \\"America Why I Love Her\\"","review":"John Mitchum was a prolific poet as well as an actor and story teller. From the moment I met him, he seemed to tenaciously cling to his one favorite poem, \\"America, Why I Love Her\\", though he wrote many others as well or better.With his brother, Robert, he once traveled across America as a hobo and got to see America where most Americans have never dreamed of going. It is through this poem that he shares with us his vision of America.What could be better than to have his pictographic and historic words blend with the voice of John Wayne to give America a heritage so rich in culture and diversified in truths.God bless John Wayne for lending his voice and talents to record this wonderful message.

Quite simply, it reveals the Duke to be a sensitive and profound musical interpreter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I pledge allegiance to the Duke","review":"The year was 1973. Patriotism was at an all time low thanks to Vietnam and Watergate. One man decided to do something about it. From out of the west came... an actor. No, not Ronald Reagan! It was John Wayne! Yes, the Duke himself. He recorded a narrative tribute (with orchestra and chorus) to America. Wayne himself did not sing, which may have been for the best.

Listening to this CD will definetly help in keeping those feelings peaked, 'The Duke' has his special way of saying what needs to be said. He gets in to the core of ones being and stirs the emotions.May his legend of Patriotism be displayed in our daily routine by kindness to our fellow man,the continued waving of the Stars and Stripes, and teaching our children and grandchildren what it means to honor the Constitution of the United States of America.

Weeks later and after many calls, I was informed that DeLonghi changed its parts agent, and they could not find the parts! Of course 30 days had past so Amazon would not accept a return. The service agent instructed me to return it to the manufacturer. I did ($84). A month later, no response nor satisfaction from the manufacturer regarding repair, replacement, and no satisfactin from Amazon for refund. Conclusion: stay away from Delonghi products until they have their act together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product flaw","review":"After comparing multiple products from several different sellers, this seemed like the ideal choice. When the item arrived (via UPS), the box was pretty beaten up. When unpacked, it seemed fine and worked on the regular setting. However when I added the gallons of water it requires for high-effificiency cooling, the water leaked all over my floor within a few minutes. After closer examination, I found a cracked part in the base. Amazon promptly sent a replacement (via FedEx). The box was in much better shape this time, but I immediately examined the interior of the unit. Again, the exact same piece of plastic had broken leaving a jagged edge. Apparently, this is a weak spot that snaps somewhere in transit.The saving grace of this transaction was that Amazon responded quickly and efficiently to resolve my problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it advertises","review":"It's quiet, it cools a room very quickly. You do need a lot of room for this unit, approx 30\\" high, 25\\" wide and 15\\" deep. It is heavy and bulky. The wheels help but it would be too hard to move it up any steps. It makes a slight gurgling sound which is not bothersome, almost like a water fountain.You want to make sure blue goes with your decor because there's no hiding this unit.It would be perfect if it was at least one third smaller and came in other colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"I enjoy black movies and street oriented films.

Two brothers and a friend who've grown up together become hired hit man for mobsters. The conscience of one starts playing tricks on him and another one wants out of the game after a particular murder. I guess the producers of this film were trying to put out a psychological thriller but it was psychological flop. One of the actors seemed like he got high right before shooting the scenes, the annoying little sister with no acting skills that I was hope would get killed by one of the brothers, and the second half of the movie with one of the actors playing opposite himself as his conscience, was entirely too much to stand. And what does the title have to do with the movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"As another reviewer stated, this is not a triple pack of 3, it is a single triple pack and is a horrible deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRIPLE pack paper towles","review":"that's way too much for 3 roll's of paper towel's,89.99, put it on my wish list it was 9.99, how could it jump that much?"},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING ADVERTISING - RIPOFF","review":"I also was led to believe by this very misleading advertising that I would receive 9 rolls of paper towels for $9.99, approximately $1 a roll.However, you only get one package containing 3 rolls, not 3 packages containing 3 rolls in each package.Since you only get a total of 3 rolls of paper towels, that makes each roll cost $3.33, which is outrageous.Do not buy these unless you enjoy paying $3.33 for a roll of paper towels."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're making me nuts","review":"We had some of these in the house.

If you look at the data (which I know just isn't as human as feeling something and going with it, which is why people vote for the worst kind of imbecile and will continue to do so) one net effect of paper recycling is that the forests that were used for growing paper no longer become profitable and are sold by the paper companies to real estate developers who then put up lousy \\"developments\\" and \\"McMansions\\" for all the nonplus suburbanites to live in...Bottom line pay attention to the facts and don't buy these paper towels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading name","review":"It says 'triple pack 3 ea' - one would think that you would get 3 packs with each pack having 3 rolls - thats not true - u get only one pack with 3 rolls. typical misleading marketing strategy. amazon - pls take note of this and change the name to 'triple pack' instead of 'triple pack 3 ea'. very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"$3.33 PER ROLL, not per count","review":"Didn't think I needed to read reviews - but I should have.

The best part of reading a book by Farwell is that he doesn't just give you the straight story, he also gives you the background to how it happened, why it happened, and who made it happen. For me the best part of his stories are the historical sketches of the men who fought Queen Victoria's wars of conquest and punishment.Farwell takes time in each pastiche to tell you how the general got to be a general, how he was considered by his collegues and those who fought under him. There a great quotes taken from contemporary memoirs and regimental accounts that have statements like, \\" I wouldn't put him in charge of planning a child's birthday party\\", or \\" the man had commanded a desk for thirty years, and now they want him to command real soldiers, quite the waste of good men\\".It is interesting to follow along and see how so many of these wars was fought for pride or just plain pig-headed orneryness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides a fine background on the modern US-Afghan conflict","review":"Without an understanding of the past (a facet the modern media), no one is able to make a sure and objective examination of current affairs. This fine, little book provides readers with valuable insights into the methods that need to be employed in dealing with Afghani militancy. I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal but not insightful","review":"Farwell's title is somewhat misleading, as \\"Queen Victoria's Little Wars\\" includes substantial sections on the Crimean war, Indian Mutiny & Boer wars: the largest wars of Victoria's reign. Filled with anecdote, the book makes diverting reading, but contains little in the way of analysis and tends to give the impression that British military activities were more independent of the civil power than was the case. The wars in New Zealand which, proportionate to the numbers of combatants the British faced, required more soldiers than any other colonial wars, receive scant attention. Absent entirely is mention of British military activities in Australia, possibly because such activities were more genocidal than honourable in nature. Incursions into Central America are also unexamined. Highly entertaining, the book is ideal as a brief introduction to both well and lesser known aspects of Imperial history."},{"rating":"1","title":"COLD COLD AUTHOR","review":"I will never EVER buy a Lynda La Plante boook again!

Characters are not well fleshed out, this book just wraps up loose ends so that the author can justify the ending. A word to the wise is be happy with COLD BLOOD and COLD SHOULDER. COLD HEART reads like a plot to a tv movie of the week ... one that I would not watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Heart","review":"I basically agree with Terry Mathews and \\"rationalcoach\\". I couldn't believe LaPlante killed off Decker, one of the only decent people in the book, so about two-thirds of the way through with the totally unrealistic second date proposal from Jake and extreme happiness on Lorraine's part, I started to get suspicious and went to the back of the book assuming she was going to kill off Jake. That would have been bad enough. But to kill off Lorraine, unreal! I will never read another LaPlante book and I will make a point of reading available reviews before I buy in the future. I thought Cold Shoulder was great, wasn't crazy about the second one, but to say I was disappointed in Cold Heart is a major understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't compare to La Plante's previous work","review":"This book was a real disappointment because all the real story-telling and scene-building was overtaken by melodramatic descriptions of unbelievable and unappealling characters. I found myself turning page after page, waiting for a real plot to emerge. Some of the most critical sub-plots of the story received almost no attention. In the end, the identity of the villian was of no surprise to anyone who had read the last 100 or 200 pages of the book. What happened to the suspenseful climax? What happened to the twists? What happened to the heated confrontation with the exposed killer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Heart not up to the LaPlante excellence found in series","review":"What a disappointment! Cold Blood and Cold Shoulder were such good reads. Then Cold Heart left me cold. What a stinker. The plot points rely on unbelievable coincidence that only amateur writers use. Not up to the typically high storytelling excellence of other LaPlante novels. It is so different in quality that I wouldn't be surprised to learn some day that LaPlante really didn't write this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't come near this unit.","review":"The unit looks fine, and the gray/wood look blends in well with furniture.After one year of operation, I began noticing the hiss mentioned in other reviews. Whenever the unit is on standby (no music playing), you can clearly hear a radio station playing in the background. It's absolutely torturous. Imagine watching a DVD on a laptop connected to this device. Every time time there is a pause in the action, you hear a faint sound resembling a radio playing in low volume. If you pay attention, you can make out entire songs. If you live in an area with bad reception, you won't hear songs like I do, you'll simply hear hiss.The sound will not go away when you play CDs...you can drown it out by playing music loud enough. Unfortunately, that defeats the purpose of a bookshelf system.I called Sony, and they have no information on this problem. Stay away from this extremely disappointing unit. I purchased it for $200, and it still retails for $150. It sells on Ebay for $55."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product! (background noise/hiss)","review":"I too have had problems with the audible hiss/static/background noise with this stereo. Basically, if you play a CD at a reasonably low volume, you will hear an annoying hiss in the background. This hiss is also audible in the MD (auxiliary) input, which is one feature I tend to use a lot to play MP3s from my computer. It's possible that the hiss is also a problem with the radio tuner as well -- but since my signal reception is so poor, it's hard for me to tell. (Note: other stereos I have purchased have gotten significantly better FM radio reception than this one; however, your mileage may vary.)Aesthetically, the style and user interface are fine, but the poor sound quality alone should be enough to keep you away from this unit. I would have expected more from Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"My husband bought this for me because I had been harping for years about the giant system in our bedroom. This was small but I can't even listen to the radio the reception is so horrible. CD's are fine but the changer is ridiculously loud.

I think one of the maine reasons people have had issues with it is because they don't use caution and handle the unit delicately (there are fragile components due to the CD changing capability that make possible to damage given rough usage.

I needed a small, physically attractive system and this one fitted right in--the wood cabinets on the speakers are genuinely classy and the receiver/player unit is compact and well designed visually.The sound quality is good overall. This is a low powered unit but for it is well suited office or small room use.All components work well. The remote seems a bit small--but I have larger than average hands and they all seem small to me--except those that are too big, of course!The CD changer works smoothly--if a bit noisily.My only complaint is the speaker cables are hard wired in-expansion required wire splicing. Once that was accomplished, however, all was well.This is not a boom-box. This is a unit designed to provide background music.

After reading reviews here I see, in retrospect, that going out and buying something cute and small with out sound advice is Stooopid! This player started malfunctioning 4 months into our relationship together. First, tracks would repeat themselves on the shuffle mode, then whole cds wouldn't play on \\"All cd shuffle\\" mode. This is the second time the tray has refused to open. I'm afraid I didn't notice the hiss because I often sing along, but I'm sure it's there.

There are no fillers here. \\"Ana Ng\\" demands immediate attention - you will remember the first time you heard this song. There are plenty of examples of their patented off-beat humor to choose from.There are also flashes of some of the most innovative composition you will find in the rock medium.

The CD comes in a glossy, bound little book with lots of rarely-seen photos and an interesting narrative of his career. The remastering is far superior to other compilations, and also has the most comprehensive songlist I've seen. Eddie deserves it: while never wildly popular, songs like \\"Summertime Blues\\" and \\"C'mon Everybody\\" stand up to anything Elvis or Chuck Berry ever did (and I love and respect them both). His prototypically tough, rollicking persona can turn on a dime to tenderness, and with his sense of humor on songs like 'Pink Peg Slacks' and 'Cut Across Shorty', he is a complete performer no one should miss.Yes, the music does sound a little dated these days, but this rockabilly cat has the attitude and the songs....no one who purchaeses this package should be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very bad.

There is a great combination of buildups, breakdowns, and neat keyboard-efx. The bass is also ferocious, for those that like to boom.

With so many tests in one edition, there is little information on each test. Also, with only one practice test per subject, after you familiarize yourself with the types of questions you're already out of practice material.

But there were all kinds of things on the SAT-II exams that were NEVER in this book, especially on the Math IC and IIC exams, so maybe they should call it \\"Kind of Real SAT-IIs\\". I think that's because first of all there's only one test per subject (that's too expensive, also) the tests in this book are like 7-10 years old, and had probably been used for many years in a row before they were put in this book, so they're really about 15 years old. Maybe they could put a new one out?

The play centers around its characters hope for a different and more fulfilling life. Driven to hide from society and anathetize their problems with alchohol and pipe dreams, deluding themselves into thinking their lives have a psuedo-promise for a vague future imporvement; the characters converge in Harry Hope's squalid bar in New York City's meat-packing district. There, they live a past-obsessed life based incongrously on a fantasy future. When Hickey, an old friend who comes to the bar on periodic binges, comes and forces the others to confront their pipe dreams, we learn the value of sustaining illusions to those whose lives are so desolate that they have nothing else to live for. The Iceman Cometh is a classic of the American theater and I wholeheartedly reccomend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Play!","review":"I couldn't put this play down when I read it, and then I was so interested in it I watched all four hours of the 1973 film version! It's hard to believe the play takes place so early in the twentieth century when its relevance has not diminished. It is a stunning portrait of addiction and the self-deception that so often accompanies it. It's tragic, but it's also hilarious in many parts. I don't think you will ever forget the characters, they're so colorful and interesting. It's like Long Day's Journey into night, but far more fun. (Ok, that's not saying much, but this IS actually a lot of fun!

If you want some ideas that include beds and borders, paths, boundaries, and water features then this is a nice start.For the more advanced gardener it includes ideas for containers, edible gardening, greenhouses and transforming your lawn.

Then he made a 180 turn, completely changed his appearance and his behavior and voila, he was the toast of the ton. Meanwhile Regina (I really don't like this name) was just not that interesting a character. Her dyslexia overshadowed everything else about her.

However, in overcast or even brightly lit indoor conditions, it just doesn't perform. The poor medium and low lux performance of this camera makes shots under these conditions too dark to be useable, and no amount of digital adjustment will fix them. Because of the need for extremely bright light, its' utility as a web cam is nearly useless.The manufacturer chose to use a manual focusing knob as an alternative to fixed focus, but since you can't see the focused image, it is all too easy to wind up with blurry shots.Battery life is advertised as 10 days.

Only flaw - and a big one in my opinion - is the intro which has been cut from the VHS version. It starts right into the movie, with the panning down into the city, and the only bit of the wonderful intro song is a short verse at the end. Maybe most people won't mind, but having seen the VHS every christmas for several years, it's a shame really. But the entire movie is there unedited.

The magnetic strip itself is excellent, but it's built around a very flimsy plastic framework with plastic ends that mount on the wall.The problem is that the plastic frame very quickly warps with the force required to remove the knives from the strong magnets, creating a rocking motion that helps work the hardware out of the wall.Now I have a couple of big holes in my wall, and I need to replace this product before it falls apart.

Heed my advice and save yourself the time, energy, frustration and repair work that goes along with mounting this POS. The mounting brackets are poorly designed, resulting in a loose fit on the wall. This is not an acceptable result when pulling knives on and off of a strong magnetic strip.

His examples quickly degraded into useless collections of codings - they simply did not work as advertised. Worse than this, when he's trying to make a point, he provides examples that are far too complicated for what he's attempting to illustrate (but remember, they usually don't work anyhow).

The vehicle mode is one of the best I have seen, its not based to much on earth vehicles but takes some cues from the dead Transtech line that was supposed to follow Beast Machines. When you transform him into robot mode, the back part turns into a gun station that sits at just the right height. He is super poseable in robot mode, and when combined with the Gun station, he shifts to his brute mode. Now in this mode he is just imposing, but once some of the other figured from the Ultra is released, you will be able to combine them with others.Cant wait to see what he turns into next."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-A-D - get Scorponok instead","review":"This would have been a nice toy had it been released without the awful battle station/armor/electronic sounds box.

It seems well manufactured, and I can only presume it would be fit for purpose. It is a little fat to carry comfortably in a pocket as on a keychain, but is a very good size to fit in a bag or as an addition to a first aid kit. The print rubbed off the case almost immediately.

If I could give the product 4.5 stars it would be more more appropriate. Others complain about the size but let me say 2 things about that. 1st, how small do you think an effective barrier can get? 2nd, in an emergency, you want it to be able to locate the thing & open it. If it were much smaller, those things would be harder. The real reason to have this is for that potential emergency, which is what brings me back to the half star ding about the paint. I know what this is and many others might too, but for those who don't who might hesitate to give rescue breaths for lack of a barrier, should know that protection is inside this little box. It doesn't need to be instructions. Nobody is reading instructions in an emergency. It should be a concise message like \\"CPR Mask\\" maybe a symbol on the other side of an EMS logo or medical caduceus, maybe 2 faces - one covered w/ the mask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to first aid kit","review":"This is a high quality face shield--the flexible barrier is fairly thick and I am confident nothing will get through it.

The upper clamp that attaches it over the camera lens makes it impossible to open and answer the phone withough dislodging the entire holster. Not a handy feature, to be sure.What's more less than a month after receiving it, the swiveling beltclip on the back of the holster self- distructed while it was clamped to the rim of my purse. The mechanism, made up of some pieces I couldn't even retrieve, was irreperable, so I had to discard it and order another style from another company.Disappointing, and a lesson to be learned. The hard plastic, and much cheaper, models without that upper clamp are a better design. . . and the belt clip on the back must be redesigned to not fall apart within less than a month of very moderate use."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This is a junk product from a junk company.

However, this is not meant as a negative comment but rather a descriptive one, because Immortal Memory is a very beautiful and inspiring album in its own right. I would recommend it especially to those who enjoyed the Gladiator soundtrack; this is her most similar work, although the songs are rather more like \\"Elysium\\" or \\"Sorrow\\" than \\"Now We Are Free.\\" Best songs, in order: Abwoon (Our Father), Elegy, Maranatha (Come Lord), Song of Amergin, Paradise Lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is so plain!","review":"The Immortal Memory album sounds more like a soundtrack than a music album with its fullness and uniqueness. It sounds like a part of something rather than one whole artwork. It could probably be a nice Gladiator-type soundtrack. Lisa repeats herself one more time here without inventing at least something that was not heard yet from her, while even the Whalerider soundtrack does not sound that plain. Buy it so that you would actually know what it is, but I would rather listen to the Mirror Pool or Duality one more time than this new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle, sobering, and deeply thoughtful. . . .","review":"This is the first CD I've gotten of Lisa Gerrard. She is clearly a masterful singer with a beautiful voice. Each and every time she opens her mouth to sing on this CD it is very apparent.I would almost describe this music as being holy: it has that kind of quality. There is an obvious purity, serenity, and beauty about it. But it's also very serious and grave, in a way, and therefore not always easy to listen to; but when you're in the right mood---when you're thoughtful, or serious, or sad perhaps---I imagine this could be the perfect music to hear.All in all, this CD has some very pleasant moments . . . but for me, somehow, somewhere, something is lacking just a little; I don't know what though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I am the hugest Lisa Gerrard/Dead Can Dance fan but this CD is very disappointing. Lisa Gerrard's voice is still as beautiful and haunting as ever. The emotion is still there. However, the lush musical backgrounds that usually accompany that voice are absent. I love meditative music, which is what this is, but halfway through it began to feel monotonous. It's as if they used the same synthesizer tone and an occassional percussion the whole way through. I cannot say that this CD is not good because it's better than 90% of the music out there. However, I hold Lisa Gerrard to a much higher standard and I hate that I have to say this is the first time I have been disappointed in any of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you crave that \\"Lisa Gerrard sound\\", don't buy this.","review":"I was very excited about Lisa's new album, and equally disappointed when I heard it. I've played it many times, under different circumstances, and find it satisfying only for meditating. It is rather monotonous, uninspiring, and like background accompaniment to a long sad movie, almost as though one of the tracks was left off. So, if you crave the sound that only Lisa Gerrard can give, you'll have to wait, because it just isn't here. Still a fan, and still waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understated, but it grows on you","review":"When I first received this CD from Amazon, ripped off the cover, and slapped it on the CD player, my reaction was \\"is that all there is?\\" My initial disappointment was based on the expectation of more dramatic and interesting vocal and instrumental arrangements.

I am getting really tired of pseudoscientific nonsense couched in scientific terms. Plate tectonics is real, radiometric dating does work to provide dates within more and more narrow limits, there are transitional fossils between many groups, especially vertebrate, there are living examples of transitional types (fish that not only walk on land but climb trees!), relationships can be fleshed out using genetics. Characteristics are inherited from ancestors through DNA. Where did the DNA come from to produce our embryonic tails and gill pouches? From ancestors that had the same!!

The first ridiculous assumption one must make when reading this is that there is an intellectual controversy regarding evolution. There are many questions remaining regarding evolution, but the evidence supporting it is overwhelming. I only have a second year University education and can easily recognize the manipulations Milton makes. I will not go into details as they can easily be found by searching Google for reviews from any credible SCIENTIST. To believe Milton you have to believe that the scientific fields of Biology, Physics, Cosmology, and Geology are all way off the mark. This belief would take more than just a little leap of faith. However I am sure anyone who wants to believe Milton has more faith than they know what to do with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Dimple","review":"I started reading this book with an open mind but tossed it aside pretty quickly. In the first dozen pages, Milton shows that he either doesn't understand that mutations are the source of variability and that it is variability that natural selection works on, or he is deliberately trying to mislead his readers.He says on page 10/11 that Neo-Darwinists believe that species evolve into other species \\"not because of the trivial variation that occurs between all individuals but because of chance mutations in their genetic makeup...\\" Surely most people who have an iron in this fire know that it is variation that natural selection works on, and that mutations (according to the theory) provide the variation.

For example, the chapter on radiometric dating harps on the innacuracies of carbon-14 dating (actually around 15%)and trots out an assortment of mistaken K-Ar dates, without acknowledging the millions of dates that DO accord with other evidence. Interestingly his references are nearly all from the 50's and 60's, and he is apparently unaware of dating with mass spec.

There are basic assumptions of Darwinism that he challenges. Who says Darwinism is a perfect theory? Milton provides some relevant questions to the idea that every living species on this planet somehow evolved from the slime. I have real problems with Darwinism. I also have real problems with creationism. This book and others are important in that they challenge assumptions and \\"scientific\\" conclusions that many times don't add up.

Those scientific minds that claim to be free of bias through the the \\"scientific method\\" would serve humanity best if they put the data in this book ( and many many others) to the test. Its clear that the challenges put forth in this book expose the subtle change from Darwin's theory of evolution to the neo-Darwin Ideology. This book as well as history reminds us of how statements from the scientific ideology and not fact fired up the propaganda and rhetoric of 1939 Germany, contributed to European merchantilism and the excuses for persecution of the Indigenous Australian people.

The whole point is that while Hogan is such a legendary figure inspiring tremendous curiosity, information about him has come out in bits and pieces over the years. There were dozens of tidbits in this book that were revelatory to me, and I'm someone who lived in Fort Worth many years while the reclusive Mr. Hogan was still alive. I found this book really good and informative, and full of new material. Based on its oral-history format, and the author's own admission in the introduction, this wasn't supposed to be an earthshaking biography full of dirt. Instead, it offers a lot of nifty snapshots about Hogan from people, a number of whom were his close freinds that, while not celebrities, had insights into Hogan's real life that \\"celebrities\\" who thought they knew him didn't. This book is definitely worth at least one read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting insights!!","review":"It's fascinating to me that a guy as reclusive as Hogan could command so much public adoration and curiosity. This is a book that offers a lot of neat stories about Hogan that I had never read. A bunch of people who knew Hogan, both well-known and not so well known, tell their stories about Hogan in their own words---in oral history form. I've read a couple of other books on the Hawk and those were nice reads in their own way as well. I read the other reviews on this page and don't understand why \\"clucas\\" called this a \\"duck hook.\\" It isn't--it's not John Feinstein-caliber, but it's still worth the price.

The film isn't manipulative or preachy, it just tells a story and tells it well and manages to make you care about every single character, which is quite an accomplishment. This is James Burke's first film, and I hope he makes many more because he is a talent. He has quite a way with actors (he got a great performance out of everyone, even the smallest characters) and a great sense of tone and control. He also was able to balance the humor of the script with the pathos, and never make it feel forced.The performances are subtle yet perfectly spot on, with the standouts being Joshua Jackson and Donald Sutherland. This is a true leading man role for Jackson, and takes him beyond just being \\"Pacey\\" into being a great, adult actor. Donald Sutherland is also a revelation, and their acting chemistry is fantastic.If you like films about real characters and real emotions, you should see this movie -- you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intergenerational film","review":"Good film for younger and older adults.

To get repair service, you have to take it to an authorized repairer--there are only a couple on the East Coast. While there was one within 45 minutes--that amounts to a waster of two hours of travel, including time at the shop. Any way, the repair shop was swamped with repairing the same model.

She does not like the taste, even when mixed with wet food (she leaves it alone). I tried putting some on her paws but once she tasted it, she left it alone.

I honestly do not know for whom this book was written - those who already agreed with Dr. Gordon used it as their soap box. Those who disagreed would not have found a possible bridge with offensive language like 'superiority' and 'so-called caring parents'.

I cannot believe that Motorola would put out SO MANY bad pairs that there would be so many people saying they don't work.

For telephone use, this set is worse than useless. But then again, look at the price - all you are paying for is a cheap set of stereo phones ... and that is all you get!

Unless you enjoy hearing a smarmy narrator try and convince you that Faith is a prerequisite for a successful life (never mind atheists, agnostics, and unbelievers)or a business, depending on your interpretation, then be sure to leave this read on the self-help bookshelf, where it belongs along with other pretentious and painfully shallow and superficial works.

I understand Christmas is a christian celebration and would definately include that in our studies, but there are already many, many books that cover that aspect, like the bible for one. Don't waste your money on this book.Do not buy this book for any other reason other than to see what it's like to be a christian in other countries as viewed through a christian's eyes only.

It entailed an act of Parliament (both houses,) required the expenditure of vast sums of money and could be granted only for certain narrowly defined reasons, usually adultery committed by the wife. It was a measure of true desperation, since it guaranteed social ostracism for all parties. Moreover, a pre-marital contract stipulating a divorce 31 days after the marriage would never be legally valid and might invalidate the marriage as well. While the plot is thoroughly implausible, the love story has a certain sweetness, although it is not as well done as it might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"Written long before the recent memoir craze, this book stands as one of the best of that genre. McCarthy looks back on an almost Dickensian childhood with wit and discernment. Perhaps most striking is the lack of defensiveness; writing of abuse suffered at the hands of a misguided great aunt and her sadistic husband, she traces the way it shaped her character but never uses it as an excuse. Nor is she more sparing of herself than of her relatives: she not only gives us a portrait of a realistically foolish, self-conscious adolescent Mary--recounting the sorts of youthful episodes many of us continue to blush over as we remember them in adulthood--but in notes appended to each chapter she deconstructs her own memories, noting where she has given in to the urge to dramatize or where her recollections conflict with those of others who were present. A wonderfully honest, bracing book, refreshing in its lack of grievance and its unostentatious, unsentimental good humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Conglomeration","review":"This is the type of book that I think of as a conglomeration but not really a book. That is, she had published several magazine articles, then gathered them together and made a book. I find that style difficult to get into. She glossed over too much; so many years were packed into just a couple pages.It irritated me after I kept reading and reading, and she kept criticizing and criticizing the people who raised her after her parents died. I sure didn't blame her for criticizing her father's side of the family. But her criticism didn't end with them. She didn't have many kind words for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOOOOOWWWW","review":"I have used the same dish ware for the last 15 years and haven't really been looking for anything new.

When you have an AC unit in a room, it generates heat -- there's a reason that a window unit hangs *outside* the room. There is heat dissipation along the exhaust hose also, and at the window: if your window has 2 sections, the heat can rise just outside the lower section, and re-enter at the window dividers. At least, understand that a 10000 BTU unit in the room does not equal the same outside the room, because the room is not insulated from the machine. I had this unit in a small bedroom -- maybe it was windy in there, but it really wasn't any cooler. The unit did act as a dehumidifier, and required a fair amount of emptying. Anyways, don't, don't buy this thing -- it does nothing, and it's expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective merchandise","review":"I tried to set up this air conditioner in my home last night. The unit does not have the on/off, temperature or time control buttons in the control panel, so the only way I have to turn the unit on or off is to disconnect it. The alarm light comes on about 10 minutes after the air conditioner starts, the A/C shuts off and the unit becomes a very expensive fan. I have called customer support but have received no response as yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"five summers later no problems","review":"I bought this in 2002 because my landlord doesn't allow window units, due the dripping and ugliness factor of window units. This machine has worked perfectly for five years of extremely hot summer days and nights. I set it on maximum cool and fill it with water twice a day. Spent a lot of money, but well worth it! Yes it is heavy and noisy and after five years it rattles a little. I spilled candle wax down it by accident two years ago but it still keeps working! One thing I have been doing that may be the reason for it's trouble free existence is that I flush it every summer month with descaling fluid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Air Conditioner I have tested","review":"I work at an electronics retail store that sells a lot of air conditioners, so I have had an opportunity to test most of them. Out of all the portable air conditioners on the market I found this to be the most sturdy and able to provide the best amount of cooling for the space it takes up. The best part about this unit is that you do not need to add water to it to get ice cold air. Unlike all other portable air conditioners, you dont needs to add any water to this unit, which is incredible convenient if you live in an apartment like I do. I bought one of these for my apartment and one for my parents last year and the units are working great. The one drawback is that this unit is very heave but the wheels help with that. I guess the weight is a good indicator of how well this unit is made, i expect it to last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and reliable","review":"I had this unit since 2002, and it has survived 2 moves, a lot of wear and tear, dragged up and down stairs, and a broken off plastic switch on the front, and it keeps working. It cools much better when filled with water. It never leaks, not once. I replaced the exhaust hose in 2010, after it broke. The main housing is metal. It sounds like an airconditioner, and has a periodic swishing sound when *not* filled with water.Overall, a very reliable and satisfying appliance. I know this unit is no longer available, but I am adding this review as a comparison for others looking at air conditioners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting adventure, and a great gift!","review":"If there are any men who wouldn't enjoy this superb book, I wouldn't want to know them.

These observations, unfortunately, fail to rise above the everyday, because it's as if anything strange, unusual, vivid or unique has been edited out. She's a careful craftswoman, but the ephianies remain buried in a system of images and symbols that don't tell us anything new.

Not really a murder mystery at all, but about a dysfunctional family (who doesn't have one??) and a man spiraling out of control, blaming it all on his upbringing. I do agree that parents can sometimes inflict horrific pain on children, emotionally and physically. I grew up with an alcoholic father and an angry, out-of-control, physically and emotionally abusive mother, much like the father in this movie. I did not, however, end up a failure in life and blame my parents, or kill them. If I could have given this a negative rating, I would have. I don't understand all the high ratings.

For twenty years they never saw nor heard from him. Now he has cancer and is feeling regrets and wants to see them again.This is the first in a trilogy. You won't be able to stop after the first book. The characters are so well formed you can't help but feel connected to them and want to know what comes next.The oldest was close to his father and is now a successful attorney. The second was close to his mother, who died with breast cancer. This son is now an accomplished artist. The youngest has the fewest memories of either parent and has never succeeded at anything, but refuses to take help from his brothers, even if it means keeping him from committing crimes to have a way to raise his beloved son.I loved this book and give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"All men should read this book for soul searching.","review":"This book is very insightful and should be read by men who have either left their families or are contemplating doing so. This author has done an excellent job identifying what it really means to be a man in a captivating style that both women and men can relate to. In addition, he reveals the emotion and sensitivity that men too often are unable to unleash. Excellent job! I am looking forward to his next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleeper hit","review":"This book is definetly one of the sleeper hits of the year 1999/2000. The book is superbly written with charachters that are believable and so real you can feel their pain throughout the story lines. This story is told from an african american males perspective about what happens when a parent walks away and does not contact his sons for years. Can the fences ever be truly mended and what excuses, reasoning or logic could that parent have to explain to his 3 sons the reasons for losing contact. I highly recommend this book to men and women of all ages, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. This is truly a must read!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the old man die","review":"was the club's first reaction when we read the cover of the book but after reading more we had a different perspective. The women in the book were portrayed positively and the club agreed overall that it was interesting reading (there are 6 of us). We all thought Caleb was very immature and Austin was pompous and arrongant and Marcus was well meaning but controlling. This was a great first effort, we can't wait to read Father Found. This book shows how siblings can go through the same experiences yet turn out differently. We would highly recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Reading","review":"This is another book I found on Amazon.com. I brought this book 2 weeks ago, it took me less then 1 week to read it. The writer was very good. The book kept me interested, I didn't have to struggle to get through it. As a matter of fact I couldn't wait to turn the page to find out what had happened next to the Harris Boys. R.M. Keep up the good work. I also recommended this book to a group of girls in a bookstore trying to find out what to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"I wanted to like this book...I really did. But I'm having the hardest time figuring out how to give a fair review without slamming the whole story. The characters are one-dimensional, almost to a fault. Especially Caleb. He made me want to beat his a&# with his 'the world owes me something cause my father walked out on me, my mother died, and my big brother treats me like crap' attitude. Were the women in the story clones of one another? Did we ever truly understand the dynamics that made Austin walk out on his family other than needing his 'space' or his wife not cooking for him one night? I don't think so. Marcus was just a complete wuss. Everything was so predictable. I can understand the writer wanting to shed some light on the epidemic of fatherless children and the emotional turmoil that it entails but in my opinion he falls way short of that mark. A very disappointing and time-wasting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life","review":"The Harris Men, unfortunately, shares the life and pain of men and women abandoned by fathers. The book hit a responsive chord and concured up incidents from my childhood. Several chapters were so real that they brought tears to my eyes.While not a text book, The Harris Men should be required reading for young men. It provides much insight on manhood, as well as, how and how not to be a father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype!","review":"I read this book as a selection of my Book Club, Mind & Soul Alliance, and I must say that I was not impressed. This book was hyped up to be as some tell all about why men choose to leave home. It did not do that. Some may say that we are expecting to much by asking one book to give us this understanding but that was one of the main reasons I was looking forward to reading it. The only character that I found of interest was Caleb. All the others, well the Father needed more time in the book, the women were too weak and the other brothers were just plain under-developed. I could not feel the compassion for any of these characters he was trying to excavate. Nice promo job E.Lynn. Good luck to you next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACKING MUCH SUBSTANCE","review":"I was very anguish to read The Harris Men from so much of what I heard about it. I opened my mind and delve into one of the worse books I have ever read. The characters are beyond unbelief. None were captivating or really very smart.Someone could have been strong,but they were all really pathetic. Better Luck next time Mr. Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatherless America","review":"R.M. Johnson did a great job delving into the social problem of father abandonment in urban America. He shows the negative, rippling effects that it can have on the family left behind. The book was very realistic as far as the anger felt by Marcus and Caleb, but lacked a sense of realization in depicting the feelings of Austin. The only negative side of the book was allowing the \\"villian\\" absent father manipulate his son into allowing him to reenter his life. This was a quick read and a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up fatherless...","review":"I really enjoyed this realistic story of a family torn apart by the father's absence and the effect it had on the sons and their relationships as grown men. I could definitely see the author in his characters even though I haven't met him.As soon as I finished I was ready for the next book!! -ES"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Men","review":"I loved the Harris Men. They were real with real lives and problems. The writer tells a very compelling story of a family of men, three of which grew up without a father. While there is never a GOOD excuse for leaving you children. The writer tells a story that is all too familiar with men today but he also tries to help the reader understand how it can happen and its effects. I remember reading a review of the book prior to reading it and the reviewed stated that both men and women would learn from it. They do indeed!RM Johnson has done a very good job on his first novel. As an advid reader I can tell you from experience, we'll be hearing a lot about him in the future if he continues producing good reading as he has done with the Harris Men. I'm planning to read Father Found, his second novel. I'll let you know when I'm finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic Drama expressing lives affected by abandonment","review":"The Harris Men the first novel written by R.L Johnson, introduces the life of Julius Harris who rudely abandons his children Austin, Marcus and Caleb at such young ages. Though Julius never gave his children an excuse for his absence, it has affected their choices in life. I really enjoyed this book and recommend that you read it. The extraordinary way R.L. Johnson writes, makes his story come alive in our hearts and reflects on what is going on around us. His characters are so realistic in some way shape or form that they seem like their related to us. Once you indulge in the unique story of Julius Harris you will come to know the sacrifices people make each day just to survive, you won't even believe that you finished this book in such a short amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic Drama that expresses lives affected by abandonment.","review":"The Harris Men a first novel book written by R.L Johnson, introduces the life of Julius Harris who rudely abandons his children Austin, Marcus and Caleb at such young ages.

Although I had mine with me until the day he passed on, I still felt the effects of the Harris brothers and could relate on each level to each one. This book will make the reader take notice about their own life and how you can learn to forgive and move on with your life. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"Not original to the album with this cover. Some of the songs I had never heard before.

More than the top names in the field. These players were in demand all over the world. They were who you went to hear when Noel and Cole weren't in town. These are the great interpreters of the great songs.I'm old, nearly their contemporary, and grew up an hour from NYC, yet never heard of several of these. Goldie Hawkins, for one, possibly the most talented pianist among all this great talent.This is a 1987 release. I discovered it after 25 years.

I rated it 5 stars because it was an easy book to follow and very educational. It help me understand a different point of view of what it would have been like to been there on the day on Peral Harbor. I think this would be a good book for someone to read that has trouble reading or doesn't like it all that much because i have to say i would be one of those people. This book is fast, fun, easy, and wonderful! If you want to find out what it was like from a person your age then this is a great book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT up to Dear America standards . . .","review":"My grandma got me this book as a sort of early Hanukah present, along with another Dear America book. I must say, this book royally stank.The first fault is the print is so big, it's really only about a quarter as long as the other Dear America books. It was too short to be very enjoyable, and it introduces characters, giving very little information about them. As for Amber's brother, Andy . . . I wasn't sure if he was eight or sixteen until near the end of the book. And it was just too obvious the reason that the dance-thing was on December 7. I think BArry Denenberg can do a lot better, e.g., My Face to the Wind, which was one of my favorites.Also, this book is way too sad. If oyu don't like sad endings, DON'T read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the trash bin!","review":"I will not be finishing this book with my child. About half way through the book the author uses the word \\"godd***\\". Not only is this word offensive to me and my beliefs, but it also has absolutely NO place in a child's book... NO place. I sincerely hope the other Dear America books do not contain language such as this, as if they do they will join \\"Early Sunday Morning\\" in the trash bin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Book","review":"I've read many of the Dear America Books. This is the best one I've read. This book is easy to understand and makes sense. The Author done a good job telling how Amber really felt on the day of Pearl Harbor. When I started reading the book I couldn't get my hands of the book it was so good. The best thing is the book is short and is easy to read. This book is the best of Dear America Series. A rate this book A 5 out of 5 stars because it is educational and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is an awesome book. It gives you a great insite on what happened in Pearl Harbor, to kids especially. Early Sunday Morning lets you look through this point in time through a young girls eyes.

Felipe Staiti muestra en este disco que el si esta a la altura de los grandes, las guitarras son sobresalientes, hay muy buenos solos que no caen en el protagonismo, encajan muy bien en el contexto de la cancion.

Gave it to a larger friend.This is the second review I have made. The frist similar one seems to have been deleted.Bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prison of the Bi-guys","review":"First of all, this movie is not scary at all. The characters walk around the prison until they are frozen in place at random and then killed. You do not feel for any of the characters, and you can't even cheer them on since they just get stuck where they are before you even know they are in danger and then it is over for them. This film is a great example of horror writers who have no education on the basic elements of horror.Why should you even check this film out? This film is quite progressive on the issue of sexual minorities. There are three bisexual guys in the film. One who hits on another character, while the other two reflect upon their sexual history with each other. It comes as quite a surprise in this film because it seemed to come out of nowhere. It inadvertently normalizes the experience of sexual minorities and is worth viewing for that reason alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty generic","review":"No surprises. I confess that I do not know this genre very well but it seems pretty generic without much to make it stand out and make up for poor acting and predictable story and script. I did like the setting and the lighting. One reviewer says three guys were bi. Maybe, but maybe they were just \\"modern\\" youth -- and if that was the only unusual element in the film, then more could have been done with it to add a little more drama. So all in all I see this as a generic B college-age-students-and-somewhat-creepy monsters film in a cool setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie is Awesome..................","review":"Disregard all the negative reviews...Get a grip people this is full moon pictures...............I love this movie and highly recommend it....To those who have taste on B Movies this is for you...To those who have whatever taste it is they have go sit in a dark room and be depressed or punch yourself in the face for not having a sense of humor and takes full moon pictures way...............too.......seriously...Otherwise I loved It................Highly Recommend :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen some crappy zombie movies in my day but this one takes the cake.","review":"I have never ordered a zombie movie from Amazon and then felt like I wanted my money back until this one. I am a huge zombie fan of novels and movies and any other medium that the genre is exploited in but I have to say this was the biggest disappointment in a zombie move ever. Those other people who gave this movie a good review must be the friends and family of the director or something, either that or we didn't watch the same movie. I mean is it me or were the only zombies we see in the movie the same clip shown over and over of some cloaked guy \\"rising\\" from the dead? I could go on ranting all day but suffice to say the movie stank and if you are a huge zombie movie fan like me... if you have a brain you will probably hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"escape while you can!","review":"I was going to give this movie a harsh review, then I noticed the single review that already existed for this movie. The person loved it! So I thought that perhaps I had selected the wrong movie. There is no picture for it listed.But just in case there is only ONE Prison Of The Dead let me just say this. No action, no killing, no prisoners! If this is the movie I remember,then the only good part about it was that at the end they interviewed eact actor. It was sooooooo funny, because these actors were taking the interview so seriously, like they were on Johnny Carson's tonight show (the movie seems that old). Anyway, do not waste your time on this one. I'm off to find a good movie to review now."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movies blows!","review":"if you can get this movie for under $3.00 do it, otherwise leave it be. youd be better off to sit in front of your tv with it off for 80-something minutes.not even really a zombie movie. there are i guess what you would call zombies, but they dont eat any one. everyone knows that zombies are hungry for flesh. it looks like the movie was made in about a week on one set. theres a tease of seeing some erotica, but then your let down hard.unless your a stoner and can sit and watch bad movies, just for watching bad movies, steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative infinity stars!!!!","review":"The movie starts when these annoying yuppies go to a prison.

It's a terrific album from a great lady. Some of these songs are new to me eg. the kickoff song 'Merry Christmas'. As is the title tune which is uptempo and a lot of fun. Bette pairs up with Johnny Mathis (the crown prince of Christmas music). The highlight and surprise is 'From A Distance' which has been totally redone with a Christmas flavour (short bites of Christmas music). She is accompanied by a massive big band. To end this set is a tribute to her Hawaiian heritage. The negative? At approximately 35 minutes, it's much too short.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holidays with The Divine One!","review":"Glad to add this to my holiday collection!

This book has politics, action, and a lead character who, although he has doubts and fears, tackles his problems directly and with gusto. Ben Bova seems not to like this book or his first book Star Conquerors (which I have never been able to find, but would love to read.). Sure they are not up to the level of his later books, but then few first or second books are as the author is just learning his craft. But the book is a good read. Holding your interest and making you care for the characters. This book was one of the first I read and was directly responsible for my life-long love of science-fiction.

The author writes with the dramatic eloquence of a seasoned novelist creating a history book that is, of all things, a \\"page turner.\\" It reveals epics, sagas, villans, and both noted and anonymous heroes. It is a shame so many of our educational systems do not teach this history becasue it is the story of millions of Amerians and fully one-third of United States territory. If anyone has ever looked at a map and wondered why so many mountains, cities, villages, rivers, plains, states, and people have Native American or Spanish names, this book will answer those questions and more, it will help them appreciate Mr. Fuentes' insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not match description","review":"The faucet I received had an item number that matched what I ordered.

Oh yeah, and she writes about Barbie dolls too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry?","review":"I could barely get through the book. Duhamel's philosophy seems to be \\"first word, best word.\\" The poems are without rhythm; no attention has been paid to sound.

I took the temps using a Thermapen device, an accurate cooking thermometer. The can WITH the insulator started at 35 degrees and after the 3 hours, gained exactly 20 degrees, while the can WITHOUT the insulator started at 35 degrees and gained 36 degrees. The performance wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, but is still exceptable in keeping it cooler. Definitely better than drinking soda at room temperature.

Just recently rented the DVD and was not too happy with it, even though it does stick pretty closely to the original storyline.As I recall, the main character was more sympathetic and likeable than as played by Shirley MacLaine. The book also did a much better job of explaining how Joel became possessed. But the main problem with this movie is the last third or so. The abuse of the children was stomach-turning and much more extreme and dragged-out than I remembered in the book. I almost felt as if I were watching child pornography. Or perhaps reading about this part did not make as big an impact as seeing it acted out.

The English tips and hints are not clear or specific. Rather, the author makes general comments; too general to be useful in practice. Moreover, there is nothing to do with Economics.

I love Gavin. He's a little bit of everyone and he just seems like he'd be a lot of fun to hang out with, as long as your on his good side. Christabel is great too. She not some 17 year old beauty, but a 30 year old woman. She believes in herself and thinks herself quite worldly because of her life with her father and always in the company of soldiers and her 10 year marriage that was kind of dull. She's not.

The balance between their sexual desire and growing tender feelings of love for each other is well-paced. So often, historical romances create a story in which the hero ends up rescuing the heroine (which is okay, but often requires a weak female for this trope to work). This story actually builds the relationship between the hero and heroine from the start that allows them to team up against the outside threats and defeat them together. As partners, they achieve so much more than they would alone. They really seem to become a genuine couple by the end of the book.

The DVD picture quality is low-medium (okay, but could be substantially better). Taking this DVD, as a whole, into consideration spending any more time than they did in order to achieve a better picture quality would not have been worth it.

I can't compare it to the original as I had someone else change the oil, but the mechanic did say that this is the same brand he uses in his M3.Just in case you're wondering, I have a 2005 BMW Z4 3.0i I6, and this filter fit perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit 1997 BMW Z3 1.9L","review":"I just wanted to let others know that even though the \\"Will it fit\\" form says it will fit this model, it does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Service!

I liked this trilogy while in my early twenties. Over a decade later I go back to find a great concept poorly executed.

This is a great story, that is quite tragic and one of the better Batman stories, I have to say. But i tell you, this Jim Murray guy who did the artwork is amazing. Its funny that people forgot sometimes that comics are 2 components (unlike novels/books). Story AND art. Thats why even though the Sandman stories are pretty cool, just look at the artwork of the guy who did Sandman #1. Maybe one of the worst artists ever? The sandman story...great. The artwork?? Sucks.

This one is very handy for keeping the current work forms, legal pad, or document in view, while storing a considerable amount of paper inside, out of the wind. The one flaw is that the baffle between the paper and pen compartments allows pens, pencils, and smaller objects to move back and forth when the clipboard is jostled, tilted, or dropped.

Closure clip holds the box closed securely, and the papers don't fall out when closed, no matter how much I shake, rattle and roll it.

But, I became deeply disappointed. The book jumps into Eastman and his interest in photography, but a truly good writer would've done a short essay, maybe a chapter, on the history of photography from the very beginning. It could then evolve up to the present moment when Mr. Eastman came along and got his interest. It also spends too much time on details about trivial things: a whole chapter dedicated to the building of his home, while nothing on the development in photography. I finally put the book down and stopped reading it halfway into it. If you want to know about Eastman, the man, it is fairly good; but, if want to know about the history and development of photography with Eastman as the center point, and how and why he changed it- save your money. All I really gathered from it was that he became the \\"Standard Oil\\" of the American photography business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I wax my stomach and my bikini line myself, and the small gigi muslim strips work great for this purpose.

You will never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"closing the distance","review":"Just as she did in her highly acclaimed novel, Staircase of a Thousand Steps, foreign correspondent Masha Hamilton once again closes the distance between us and those we see depicted at the top of the news. In Caddie Blair, Ms. Hamilton has created a character as conflicted as the region she covers, the Middle East...and that's a good thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful kitsch","review":"Hamilton offers only stock characters & stereotypical incidents. This skims the surfaces but gives little sense of lived experience, in spite of the author's background. Though filled with equal measures of sex and violence, the novel simply fails to engage the reader, in spite of the promising early pages.Readers seeking a richly written, thoroughly gripping and truly authentic portrait of the Middle East, should turn to Robert Stone's wonderful novel \\"Damascus Gate\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but boring","review":"I'm using this course for a business class in ecommerce. It was the best book I could find at the time (May 2000). I like the coverage and the approach (not too technical) but, oh my gawd, it doesn't read well. Long convoluted sentences.

On the plus side, if you're an accountant, this is the probably the best ecommerce book around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I wanted to like this book, but couldn't.A word of warning: look out for any book that has a group of 5-star reviews by reviewers that only have the one review.

That's the impression I get from reading the entries where I know what it is, like the past perfect on page 287. Can you imagine any reputable source giving as an example of anything, \\"It had been being compiled by hand\\"? Wow. I also think there is too much copying, which is rampant in the grammar field, and there is certainly 'jamming', as in the example just cited. This is a book you should have on your bookshelf to maybe make people believe you're smarter than you really are. Nah. Why bother? Let it go.Sorry, Oxford. I suppose this is the flip side of playing off your name, which you have done for centuries. Maybe it's time to catch up, which in this case means to start over and try harder to get it right.

I found that Jazz seemed to be a pretty normal person and that Antonia was somewhat abnormal and in greater need of help;I didn't understand that girl. At any rate ... the mention of some of the slang did not make any sense (\\"bode\\"? Who says \\"bode\\"?)and the story played out to be extremely corny. For a good High School book, read Speak by Laura Halse Anderson."},{"rating":"2","title":"are you a \\"psico\\" or a \\" control freek\\" which one is normal?","review":"I would absolutely and one hundred presently recommend this book to anyone. This would be a book to read for anyone because it shows how lucky we are to have parents that love you and want the best for you. I doubt that you do but if you don't then it tells you to tell someone for help. Someone that wants to help let them help you, it will get better. Another good thing about this book is that you can't put it down, as much as you want to you can't and you will try and try and try but you just want to know what happened next. When I was reading to find out what happened next and I would get so into the book that I wont event know what is going on around me, because I love this book so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I enjoyed about Define \\"Normal\\"","review":"I really enjoyed Define \\"Normal\\" because it tells you that not everything is like it seems. Like when you first hear about Antonita you see her as a perfect girl who has everything they way she wants it straight A's, a perfect family but not all of that is true. Then when you meet Jazz you see her as a punk that probably has parents that are alcoholics and drug addicts, but what I liked about this book was that Jazz and Tone's life, they way you would expect it to be is opposite. Tone is the one with the alcoholic mother and no father while Jazz has two parents living in a huge mansion. One main thing i learned from reading this book was that anyone can help anyone, like Jazz was acctaully helping Tone instead of the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read for preteens and informative about foster care, depression","review":"My daughter read this at age 12, so I read it also and discussed it with her.

Being from different lifestyles, they find it hard to get along in this counseling class and hardly ever get any talking done without finding their way into an argument or stumbling upon conversationg that neither of them want to enter. Their lives eventually do force them into a strong friendship, and similarities combined with differences make them, and you, define normal. This story was awesome and heart-warming, showing how friendships can grow and people that you didn't take the time to know can be different from the steryotypes. Internal conflict, or a problem within a character is represented in this story. Antonia, a character in the story thinks that she is normal, and acts normal, while inside she struggles with problems at home. I give this story a five-star rating for its ability to ouch hearts and for its moral. Its a book that everyone should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly, the worst phone EVER made!","review":"I've had this phone for about 8 months now, and what a horrible experience it has been.

I called Motorola and they said it would take 7-14 business days to fix and to make sure I kept track of all my phone numbers because once i got it back it would be completely empty! All the ringers and pics and numbers will be erased! Who can go 2 weeks without a phone... as they will not give you a loaner phone, nor will Sprint. The phone will freeze up at any given moment, the volume button on the side doesnt always work properly.

Mind you that its barely April and the MP3 player doesn't work anymore. It freezes and then just turns off. The picture quality on this phone isnt what I expected it either. Then the texting fuction isnt very user friendly. As I was writing this review I was sending a text and the phone just turned off. Also, the battery life isnt very good either.

In the price breakdowns in the book, huge ticket items are not even counted as costs if someone other than the bride or groom writes the check or does the work.

Those examples were very specific scenarios, and if you weren't one of those similar situations(ie: having a friend or family with a home large enough for your guestlist), there wasn't much value gained from the book.Given the target audience for the book are couples trying to get the most for their dollar, the book itself fails to carry it's own weight.

The sections not only gives honest responses from an informed Christian's point of view, but they bring the reader right into the scene. As a reader, you are there. You sense the drama, the curiosity, and sometimes the pain.I've actually been so inspired by this book that I decided to create something similar on my own personal website to continue this legacy of honest responses to honest questions in Christian life.[...]I may not make as much of an impact as Budziszewski, but I've definitely been motivated to put myself out there so that other people might be blessed by God and His works in people's lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little confused I am as a reader","review":"If one is to avoid dating a woman unless she is potential marriage partner, how does the author explain that in business or school world, a young man has lunch or dinner or study / business group regularly with young women whom he has zero intention to marry? If he replies that the man does those in public areas, what is an office or a library cubicle anything but alone-time with opposite sex? Does he think that the more such time one spends the more likely the man and woman will end up in bed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight forward and Hard hitting","review":"J knocks another home run with this book. We used it in conjunction with How to Stay a Christian in College for a series of lessons with our Campus Ministry. J delivers real answers to provocative questions. Rather than saying because I told you so, he paints vivid pictures of true Christian world views. As the cover states, no topic is taboo. He hits on relationships and sex, faith on campus, war, homosexuality and other pertinent questions. A must have for any college student, or anyone with a relation to students."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a college instructor...","review":"I found this book a tremendous help. In a day when most students of state colleges, or for that matter, the professors, know nothing of the difference between Noah and Moses, this book stands as great read for Christian students. Except for the advice to the student of Professor Pagan (p 124), I found answers I wish I could have offered to my Christian students. If the students of Professor Pagan answer him/her this way, then the student needs to know s/he is likely to get an F. I would certainly not advise doing this during class, and never with an adversarial attitude. It will get you nowhere. I'm going to give a copy of this to my own kids. And you don't need to be going to college to have these questions come up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radical and Much Needed!","review":"I really appreciated this book! The author answers questions he's gotten from actual students, and his answers are short and to the point. His answers can be anywhere from a paragraph to a few pages, but each answer leaves you thinking about the topic in a new way. He addresses guy/girl stuff, faith on campus, and hot topics such as war and homosexuality. This book is real--you can see the pain and the anger in some of his students' questions and the author always answers them in love and in truth, never watering down what needs to be said. This is a great read for middle school age to adults alike.

The holes must not be big enough--or it is the interior design of the salt shaker.I have tried all of the usual tricks--putting a peice of pasta (uncooked) in there to break the salt up--and also putting a saltine cracker in there (hard to do with such a tiny hole in the bottom!) to absorb moisture, but unfortunatly nothing works.They now live in my China hutch for decorative purposes only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheerful Addition to the Table","review":"I added fine sea salt to my shaker and found that the salt sprinkled freely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very usefull","review":"This replaced a stolen tool and turned out to be better than the old one.

I felt sorry for the football player, as they do belong on college campuses, not in the cemetery, but I recognize that many academics think the worst of them, but although I liked the steel-eating squirrels, and the prose style is superb, the football player I liked best of all, and all of my sympathy went with him -- an unintended effect probably, but I just love sports players, and think that eggheads are too mean in defending their turf, a remainder envy from not getting picked in grade school but getting picked on, but still, this didn't ruin the novel for me, it just raised all kinds of ethical-social questions that heightened the experience of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, funny and a bit absurd","review":"The cover looked kinda crazy so I picked it up having no idea what it was.

The Bedlounge seemed like it fit my requirements. My first mistake was to order the optional lumbar pillow. It's an overpriced pillow that is very similar to what you find on an airplane for free. I removed it immediately and never used it again. My next mistake was not to return this product immediately.The Bedlounge does its job for a few months and then the armrests loose their support ability. If you look at the picture, it shows the armrests perpendicular (90 degree angle) to the surface. After only a few months of use, mine are almost flat to the surface -- providing little arm support.There is a warranty that says the it covers the inner support not breaking. I'm fairly sure nothing has broken; rather, is has simply reshaped itself into a useless position.

Well, it flips ok, but doesn't always land on its feet. But with this in mind, it actually makes it exciting to play with small children because you can cheer when the dog does land on it's feet. Additionally, there is a tension spring internally inside the unit that you can manually adjust to try to correct the dog improperly landing on it's feet. I think if people read all the instructions that came with the dog, they would not be complaining as much about the dog not ever landing on it's feet.

So if you want one story with a 1980s touch, this one is for you.It was predictable. You know what is going to happen and when. Very little sexy scenes, and not steamy at all.It was interesting that the hero has his doubts about what to do with his feelings and with her. But I didn't find him very attractive in the end.What I liked most was the heroine, because she has clear ideas and real backbone. She wants a little bit of adventure in her life, knows how to shoot an AK-47 but at the same time she is practical: she does not want just a one-night-stand. So she says clearly 'I have better things to do until you make up your mind, baby'. And one of those things is the laundry. It was funny!

First of all, let me state that she's not country or pop but defies definitons. Some of the best performers can't be classified and she is no exception. That's one of the many things I like about Mindy Smith.I love the songs Out Lout, Tennessee, I'm Not the Only One Asking and Long Island Shores.

Yes, her vocals are comprable to that of Patty Griffin, but Patty Griffin she ain't. None of the songs on this album will be remembered past tomorrow and you can't make mediocre songs amazing just with vocals. There has to be music and lyrics to go along with the vocals to make you feel what the songs are saying. I feel nothing for any of these songs.

No glossy fold-out episode guide or anything else came with this. I don't necessarily expect much, but I do expect _something_. There isn't even a hardcopy list of DVD content with what's on each disc -- and I consider that a mandatory minimum for a purchase like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn Notice","review":"I love Burn Notice it is a great show, you can never go wrong with it! It reminds me a lot of MacGyver but with a modern twist. About a spy (Michael Weston) who got burned and does what he can to find out who burned him. Along the way he does many Good Samaritan tasks and helps people with things they would otherwise not be able to get out of. He often uses his wits to achieve what he wants to get done over blunt force, but there is still plenty of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"First off, I love the series.

Quite simply, they are not HD. The picture's grainy quality is extreme to the point of being distracting. I'm guessing that whoever authored this video master committed some kind of down-conversion fiasco, because the transfer actually looks worse than an SD transfer. If Fox had any pride at all they would do a recall of these disgraceful pieces of junk. If you really want season 2, I would just get the regular DVD set. I haven't reviewed them, but they couldn't possibly look worse than the awful Bluray discs and if it was a clean SD transfer you will probably get a better picture than the \\"HD\\" version. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Blu-Ray Production","review":"Burn Notice is such a wonderful show! Season Two was shot and broadcast in HD and looked awesome on my HDTV when it was aired. So how is it possible that FOX did such an inept job in transferring it to Blu-Ray? The scenes are grainy, sometimes out of focus and I swear I saw artifacts. Hands down, these are the worst Blu-Ray discs I own. My standard discs of Season One look ten times better than Season Two. Don't waste the extra money on Blu-Ray!

The HD version on the USA channel was great. That did not make it to most of the BluRay (curiously, the between-scene landscape shots are in good HD!). You'd think the home video industry is mature enough to prevent this Yugo of a BluRay from being made. What's going to happen because of this fiasco? I (and likely many others) will wait for reviews of upcoming USA series on BluRay before purchase. Maybe someone will notice.I guess it would be nice if there was a \\"THX\\" for BluRay so we could have an independent certification of transfer quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to buy the DVD","review":"The problem with Amazon's \\"Video On Demand\\" system is that the downloads are not portable. First you have to download and install some software (Windows only, I believe) in order to view/download the videos, and then you can only view them on the PC they were downloaded to. With a DVD you could at least watch them in any DVD player and also watch them on your PC if you chose to do that.

It's a show with a solid moral center, without being the slightest bit self-important. In other words, it knows right from wrong, the good guys from the bad guys, but keeps a necessary light touch, just the same. The four primary actors and actresses are excellent, by the way.I strongly recommend the series and Season Two is no exception. It deserves four and a half stars, but since that isn't possible at Amazon, and since I reserve five stars for the best of the best (series such as \\"Boomtown\\" and \\"Firefly\\"), there you have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn notice review","review":"I received this product in a very timely manner.

You will learn a lot about the country of Columbia.Windle shows an ambitious young woman trying to understand why her parents were willing to give up very lucrative careers to love and serve people in remote jungles of Columbia. It seems to her like it was all for nothing. In search of a great story, she becomes involved in a plot which could have huge international effects for America. This book has a conversation where the two main characters have a discussion about why someone would believe in the God of the Bible over any other religion in the world.

His decision to devote his life to this work, to give a good share of his tremendous wealth for this purpose are exemplary, virtuous , noble. He speaks about the role his Foundation plays and its cooperation with governments and industries.I would have thought that given the economic crisis the world is in Charlie Rose would have asked Bill Gates about this.

But the book doesn't end with that one dish: There are many, many good ideas in this book that beg to be tried.The presentation of dishes is done nicely; they're easy to follow and to prepare.

In my opinion, most of the dishes seem like side dishes, and they call for unusual ingredients that I would not consider Greek, like Brussels sprouts, and wild rice.

The Greek foods are heavily influenced by the Turkish cooking in fact it is hard to find dishes that are NOT shared by these 2 countries on either side of the Aegean.

My wife and I wanted to give each other massages, and it works fine for that. The height options are good, and it is pretty stable (we're of the skinny persuasion, however).My big beef, and the reason I'm knocking two stars, is that the head rest majorly sucks. You can only angle it, but you can't raise it up and down. But it holds your head too high, which puts a strain on your neck, and there is no way to lower it. You have to just angle it down as far as you can, but if you angle it too far your chin ends up on the horizontal bar. It's a frustrating affair and makes it hard to get your head at a comfortable angle. Can't believe they overlooked this when they designed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good","review":"The table is what I expected. It's been put to good use so far, durable, easily portable, and has worked real well for client customer and masseuse. The only minor thing I would say that isn't top rating on it is where the arms rests are placed and the hanging arm rest for hands, its not the greatest position, doesn't really stay put, and have to attach and detach (yes, the other parts are like that too but simpler). But, I hardly use it and there isn't a need for it so it's not a big deal. Just figured I mention it if its a necessity for some people. Again, it has worked real well and quite happy with it. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"So I got this table not too long ago and it broke during the second massage I gave on it. The legs are flimsy and wobble quite a bit. The frame is incredibly weak. I suppose it would be a worthwhile investment if you do not intend to use pressure while giving a massage, but other than that it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars or 4?","review":"Let me just say I love everything about this table except the wood that is just under the padding. It makes an awful cracking sound at times. I have yet to see any actual cracks but with the slightest pressure it makes a noise that sounds like sand being squished against something hard. It's really hard to explain but it sounds weak. Then every so often - like when a client is turning over - it makes a terrible crack. Again, no visible cracks but I'm worried one of these days it's going to break.Everything else about it I love though. Excellent padding. Could do without the hanging armrest since it's not really stable. The table seems to be a bit on the heavier side but I was prepared for that. All in all a good table for a student at a decent price. But I assure you I will be looking for a new table once I get my license.

I like the size as it covers a large area at one time verses using a ice bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colpacs leak oozy stuff","review":"I have purchased 3 Colpacs, which I use daily in icing after rehab. All three came apart at the seams only a few weeks after purchase and the gunk inside comes out and gets all over everything. I originally purchased the Colpacs over other ice packs, even though they were more expensive because I thought would be a quality product. And since I use them daily, I needed something that would last. My Colpacs are all now covered with duct tape all around the seams and that stuff still seems to escape. It is smeared all over my pants right now, which is why I decided to post this. I can't believe all the positive reviews for this product. All I can think of is that there has been a fairly recent drop in quality, or the other users are not using these things as often as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leak after 4-6 months","review":"Have finally decided after owning 4 and 3 have gotten leaks, that we need to look at another brand. Really liked the feel but just not durable enough. We don't put stress on them. In the freezer, on the back, then into the freezer. Should last longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cold therapy, could use better construction","review":"I've used these kinds of cold packs for years - ice is the only thing that helps my neck and back pain. These are nice and heavy so they get really cold (this is the same style that physical therapists use/sell). If you are not used to this type of cold you may need a towel or two between you and the pack at first but you will get used to it.My only complaint is that the seams are poorly constructed, and after a while they burst and brown goo oozes out. However, I have found a solution that I used on my most recent purchase, and it's still holding up 1 year later. Before you ever put the pack in the freezer, use electrical tape to reinforce all the seams. This is the only thing that helps! It's too bad that you have to do this, but it really works and it's worth the few minutes that it takes to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seam ripped after 4 months","review":"Initially, I loved this ice pack. It is large enough to ice any area of my body. Shoulder front and back at the same time and lower back and hip. However, today one of the seams just opened up with no stress on it. I have emailed the seller and will update if and when I hear back. Four months use is pretty poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Therapy found","review":"Was glad to see this product available from this distributer.

I was using a small, rigid one that was uncomfortable and not easy to position. This ( standard size) fits my lower back and conforms to make cold therapy very comfortable.

Will be getting another for my son to use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted and leaked within 3 uses","review":"I have tried a lot of ice packs, and they always start leaking at the seams over time. I usually get about 6 months of regular use out of them. Of course, I just toss them in the freezer folded in half, often put weight on them when I ice certain parts of the body, and I tie something across them to hold them in place with some pressure. So, it seems reasonable that they won't last forever, but I doubt anybody else wants to treat their ice pack like fine china. I've tried a few different brands, but went with this one because it had good reviews for holding together. Nope, it was the worst one I've ever tried. It was not able to withstand much at all before it started oozing ALL OVER. At least the others would just ooze a tiny bit and I could throw duct tape over the tiny hole, this one was not repairable. Prior to breaking, it was great! Nice and cold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Mess Ice","review":"This is perfect for rehabiliation. I had knee replacement surgery 8 weeks ago, and these packs are perfect to ice with. You don't have to worry about dripping water from thawed out ice. I just slide mine in an old pillow case.

Main character was brilliant, sweet, and refreshingly independent. The ending didn't make complete sense to me, but it was a novel worth reading overall, and it left me uplifted. I felt like he didn't know how to end the work, so he ended it as he did. (I won't go into the ending to prevent spoiling it for others.)The perk to reading In Beautiful Disguises is you can feel the passion that goes behind each and every character's niche in life. This is rare in books, because usually the individuality of each interaction is sacrificed for the sake of keeping the focus on the main character.Read it...and laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this \\"Portrait\\"","review":"Although the Cambridge singers always perform beautifully, this is not a beautiful album. The selections vary from sacred to secular, from a capella to full orchestral accompaniment--so it's hard to sit and listen to this as a program of music. The sound quality sounds like someone pushed the \\"reverb\\" button on an old electric guitar amplifier. If you're looking for a Cambridge Singers album, I'd start with \\"Hail Gladdening Light\\" ASIN B0000031HJ, and then go on to \\"Faire is the Heaven\\" ASIN B0000031H7 by the same forces.

Bernie's constant risk of being discovered \\"in the act\\" is, of course, a major theme here. That's how he ends up in the closet.The apartment's owner returns unexpectedly and, as you might expect, gets murdered. Bernie, for his part, is locked in the closet he hides in. And the fact that he's locked in there actually helps determine the identity of the murderer.It's a funny, well-writen story, but since it's so early, it even predates Bernie's ownership and operation of Barnegat Books. As such, a key dimension of interest present in later stories is missing here.Good stuff, though, especially the way the plot is woven."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second \\"Burglar\\" whodunnit, as hilarious as the first","review":"Less well known than some of the installments that followed it in the \\"Burglar\\" series, THE BURGLAR IN THE CLOSET is a fabulous play-fair whodunnit, filled with great character bits and at least a dozen scenes that will make you laugh out loud. Bernie is not yet the proprietor of his used bookstore here -- he's a full-time burglar and part-time detective, working desperately to free his dentist from a charge of murder. Block's authoritative asides on the science of burglary are delicious and the climactic unmasking of the killer at the end is entirely satisfying.

But I draw the line at doing all of that work for a wine bottle cozy, lace clothes for freaky looking dolls, or preserve jar covers. It's just too over the top.There are better lace books out there.

I like that it's the right amount of tightness, and I've heard from friends who've been playing much longer that the tension spring (is that what it's called?) in bad capos tends to snap right away or that the tightness wears off after a while. Well, I use this capo daily and it's as strong as ever (have had it about a month) plus, I know it lasts much longer because I used my friends and she's had it for 6 months.

In order to use it live I had to bring two guitars to the stage, I usually play DGCFAD so the second guitar had the capo in the second fret to make it standard E Tuning but I had to tune it before the show to guarantee good pitch. When my main guitar snaped a string, I had to use the one with the capo, remove the capo and then retune the 6 strings for it to be in tune.All in all, I advise you buy the Planet Waves NS dual or tri action capo."},{"rating":"2","title":"guitar capo","review":"This is an awesome capo.

There are some plastic pads where the capo touches your guitar so you don't have to worry about scratches. The product arrived quickly and in good shape. As you would expect, it was plenty strong enough to hold down the guitar strings so the sound was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Of Bukem","review":"I am a big fan of Bukem, but was disappointed to hear the same tracks on many of his CDs.

They are clearly against adoption. They state that birthmothers are being wrongly convinced to give up the child for adoption. They believe that the child should always stay with the birthparents.

There is no way I would read a book about a character (pea or otherwise) eating nothing but candy for dinner and, after doing so, be rewarded with a bowl of spinach. The end, I suppose it was the author's idea of \\"a good lesson\\" was that veggies are good, like dessert. However, that lesson is such a tiny part of this book - most of it is a story of eating candy for dinner. Sorry, but I don't know a child that would fall for this overly simplified and laughable attempt at reverse psychology. The word \\"candy\\" is used so much in this book that I think even the best little veggie eater would think candy for dinner would be neat. Books with good messages are terrific to find.

For the most part, it's a frustrating read. The main problem is the author begins a topic and then digresses freely without ever truly completing his thoughts on either the main topic or his numerous sidebars.However, the book does have its moments. Those which come to mind are the gruesome end of George Washington and the discussion of whether the Black Death was actually bubonic plague or simply ergot contaminated rye. Essentially, the author presents a collection of anecdotes interspersed with a few facts and his own commentary. Sadly he can not refrain from injecting the poison of personal politics into the mix. Let all ye evil capitalists beware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Disorganized","review":"I rarely feel compelled to write book reviews, but this book was so unusual that I felt I had to. \\"Poisons\\" has its interesting moments, but as several other reviewers have mentioned the author has an annoying habit of rambling and failing to follow through with topics that have been brought up. The analogy desribed in one of the reviews of throwing a stack of index cards with notes into the air and then randomly arranging them into a book is particularly apt. I almost didn't continue after reading the first chapter, which seemed almost like reading a pure stream of consciousness. The gray sidebars continue to confuse me, as there seems to be no rhyme nor reason why these passages were set apart from the main text. Granted the topic is broad in both its scientific and historical scope, and much of the information is good, but the lack of solid editing has made this book a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it.","review":"This is the only Giant Sand CD I've heard, so I'm no expert, but I didn't like it.

Going by nothing other than the interesting cover art and a few seconds of listening at the store we decided to buy it. This gamble turned out to be the best purchase in several months and one of the greatest records of our collection. It blends a 1980's synth style with robotic voices and a slow beat. The end product provides for good party music that ranges from a Japanese \\"Running Man\\" show to futuristic space music. After many listenings we wondered whether or not there was more music of this genre out there. The search continues. Antonio comments: I agree with all of the above. This is definitely the star of our extensive album collection. It's somewhat remniscent of early Devo with primitive synthesizers but more mellow and poppy. Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this cd. I brought it first without listening to samples because I am a Madlib fan, and I have to tell you this one you should pass by.

She loved reading and was excited when she got her library card. She used to take out many books every time she went. Her grandparents were strange too.

This book is divided into three sections, Listening, Learning to See, and Finding a Voice. Each section uses descriptive writing to take the reader into the author's voice, thoughts, and heart. In Listening, she allows the reader to hear every sound in the exact way she hears them. In Learning to See, Welty opens the reader's eyes to a life of growing up in the South and everything that accompanies it. In Finding a Voice, the author tells of the search she endeavored to find her voice as a Sothern writer.This was an excellent book.

I believe the book might be taken from several lectures she gave at Harvard rather late in life? In any case, the book will be greatly enjoyed partly because Welty is such a good writer that she could probably be captivating if she wrote about a trip to the grocery store.I love to read about how great writers started out. What is their family background? What were their struggles? What motivated them? How did their writing develop? Who were their encouragers or discouragers? What were the hard lessons they learned? What things about the writing life did they enjoy most? Which were the most challenging? And on an on go my questions.Welty does not disappoint. Though not exhaustively, she tells her story and the book is to be gradually savored, not rushed through in three hours. An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting","review":"I found this book interesting as it brought me into a world that existed for a young girl in 1925.

I just finished it, yet would be hard-pressed to name one interesting event or situation from the entire work. She does outline where she was living and when, and there are some characterizations of some relatives, but as for getting at the core of what made her want to write and how . . . this book has, believe it or not, little to say on that subject.Try Maugham's \\"The Summing Up.\\" Now THAT book was everything this one should have been, and by a far more able writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of both","review":"One of the best of two old great, classic, country singers.

I have taken all of the ideas on how to teach certain subjects, photocopied them and made a handy desk refrence for all of her teachers.I also bought one for her school to have.I wish though, that it had more insight on how to teach multiplication to these kids. This is one area that my 7th grader just can not get a handle on!This book is great, it is easy to read, and it clearly tells the world that your child or student with NVld can learn everything if it is just taught the best way for them and the disability is all encompassing in their lives not just academically. The social issues are a huge part of it all!Thank you so much for such a great refrence through every step of our lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for Parents","review":"This book is so helpful!

I think it's in this book specifically, but you can't go wrong with any of the books. I hope he never stops writing them and Jamie never grows up. On many days, I know I haven't. Ha ha!!! As for the folks who say she's not a good example, she's not boozing and smoking cigarettes, okay? She's still a kid and having crushes on boys and being jealous starts at age 4 for girls, so Benton is not portraying anything that's untruthful, and Jamie's a better girl than many that age. : )I loved this book so much I recommended it to many adult friends as well, parents or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had it for years, and will never change","review":"I started buying this scent around 10 years ago, and never plan to change. The scent has the sort of pleasant under smell you see in Old Spice's \\"fresh\\" deodorant, and then a faint fruity overlay to it. A few minutes after application (1-2 sprays), the scent will diminish to just the right amount. You will get faint whiffs now and then, but the scent is not overpowering at all.The alcohol content is high in this scent, given it isn't one of the \\"exclusive\\" scents, and will sting if you apply it to your neck right after shaving. However, I like the scent so much that I'm quite willing to deal with a few second sting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little wild at first, but OK","review":"First, know that I'm no better at understanding scent descriptions than I am with figuring out if I want to try a particular wine from a written or verbal description.

It really does the job. Prior, we were going through vacuum cleaners 2x a year. They'd blow up, the motors would fry, and we'd have to use a wire hanger to unclog the machines at least every other day.Not this machine. It's super! We think it's the double hose system.

I really like the fact that it is written based on my home town and that I guess brings my interest in the book a little higher.I would like to see a sequel to not only this book but also her first book.

Plus, having the video for Blue be such a wonderful creation, and to see all of those talented people come together to bring the vision to life is such a bonus to watch.If anyone is a fan of this band, purchase this DVD.

Avoiding clinical claptrap, she provides insights into both sides of the issue offering important understanding about the betrayers and the betrayed.

However, the opening of 'River' pulls the listener in its flow and does not let go. In 'Colorado', Peter pays tribute to John Denver as both men have shared a strong commitment to preserving the environment. 'Ascent', updated from his prior \\"Spirit\\" and \\"Anthem\\" albums, is classic Kater with his grand piano supported by orchestral horns and percussion. It was great to hear. 'Piano and English Horn' and 'Olympiad' embue the sensitivity and celebration of the human spirit that attracted me to Peter's music back in 1985. For me, Kater's New Age and Improvisational works have not always been that satisfying. This new album marks a return to his earlier contemporary accoustic and jazz work (a masterpiece contemporary jazz ensemble album is \\"Going Home\\"). I hope \\"Birds of Prey\\" signals the resumption of Peter Kater's waltz down this musical road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect addition to the doll","review":"The bag is a great size for adding more than what is included.

The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. The music was loud and painful. The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. *so disappointed.It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly.

We let her chase us and call her over to us. It's wonderful. She also doesn't have to be held all the time and she loves it. It's like a little independance for the baby. It's fun for her and fun for us to watch. Great produce, and I do recommend it to my friends.Con's: The music is loud and its a pain in the butt to change the batteries on this.

In a day or so she figured out how to use it to walk around and all the toys took a back seat. We used the tray in front to feed her all the time.

My husband even drilled holes in the thing trying to figure out how to change the battery - only to find the battery that it comes with is irreplaceable.

Since we had bought this used, and couldn't return it, I took my dremel and cut some new notches. That worked great. The wheels were ok on the carpet and the tile. They aren't super smooth, but how fast do you want your baby scooting around the house? The biggest problem is that we have a dog, and the dog fur clogs the wheels and there is no way to clean the wheels out. I finally found a caster wheel supplier that had small enough wheels that fit, but it took 2 weeks to ship and the wheels cost more than I paid for the walker ($20).

We don't want to hurt our little one's ears. She does like banging on the steering wheel and playing with the little gadgets on the sides though. She isn't quite big enough to make it go all by herself so she just sits and plays in it while I'm cooking in the kitchen with a little stool underneath her feet.

These are heavily orchestrated muzak-style versions on which Judy sings way over-the-top. The music reminds me very much of something you would see on a modern PBS special featuring washed-up musicians in some sort of lavish production. Although her voice is still quite pretty on this album I'm just not fond of the arrangements. They're not at all the folksy renditions for which Judy Collins is known. If one were to have insomnia then this may make a good lullaby album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD, SOLID INTRO TO JUDY COLLINS","review":"This is a very good introduction CD to those who may have somehowmissed Judy Collins in a large music scene.

The production values, admittedly, are not as slick as Wiggle Time & Yummy Yummy; however, Wake Up Jeff is 2 years older than these two others. TV shows change their look as they mature, and the Wiggles are no different in that respect. At any rate my 18-month old daughter loves all 3 videos, and Wake Up Jeff has now placed the Wiggles way ahead of Barney, which I personally am thankful for :) She loves to dance and jump around as the Wiggles do, and I love to see her remember the actions to her favorite songs. Way to go to these upbeat, creative, and rather active guys from Down Under! I can't wait to see more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After a much anticipated wait, my 16 month old and I found \\"Wake Up Jeff\\" disappointing.

This is an excellent cassette, but it does seem to get my kid's attention as much as the other two.

It is a nice cassette for my 2 year old but not as much as Wiggle TIme and Toot Toot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This children's video has the least amount of singing and dance routines and suffers as a result.

All the same, it is very good video. It is energetic with great songs and very fun songs. My 14 month old really enjoys this video. The pacing is a little slow, but the songs \\"Bing Bang Bong,\\" \\"Having fun at the Beach,\\" and \\"We like to Say Hello\\" are so wonderful and fun, that it more than makes up for the pace. Also, after the credits are run, there is an additional live segment that one could miss if they did not pay close attention to the song lising on the packaging. If your kids like the Wiggles, this is a video worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up with Jeff","review":"My 1 year old daughter watches only the wiggles and loves them they are entetaining and real people instead of crazy charcters.

It immediately started accumulate white (then yellow) mineral deposits that I tried cleaning with chemicals, stiff scrub brushes, even in my dishwasher, but nothing worked. Eventually, the fan started making a loud ticking sound, probably because it was off balance from all the gunk that built up on it. Also, I thought the unit was unnecessarily large. The bottom half of the gray base does not have a functional purpose. When I first got it, I did note the fan was fairly quiet, but I didn't think it was that much quieter than previous Holmes units I've owned.

I kept the units for 3 weeks and decided to return them. When I took the units apart to return them, there was an enormous amount of calcium scale inside the unit and all over the fan. Glad I returned them! Looks like they would be a cleaning nightmare. I think having no wicks is a good concept but hunter needs to work on the design a little more.

A blinding stroke of good luck released her from indenture, then a series of benefactors helped her hide her fortune and become the adult that her childhood never prepared her to be. She escapes from earth ---- and \\"Rissa and Tregare\\" begins. She and her husband, master pirate and semi-mythical opponent to the tyrants of Earth, accumulate a small militia of freed ships, and arm them thanks to the skills of free weaponsmiths. Towards the end, mysterious aliens ally with their cause, and the prepare their march to free Earth.It's swashbuckling feel-goodism in the grand tradition. Bujold's much later hero Miles Vorkosigan (among others) follow closely in Rissa Kerguelen's footsteps - and I mean that as praise. There's nothing grand or eternal in this story, but it's huge fun anyway. And Rissa overcomes that little bedroom problem along the way.

No! This album is great. It has all the elements that a fan would want. However, if you are new to the dead milkmen, I would recomend an older milkmen album, or a collection cd(cream of the crop or death rides a pale cow)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stoney's Extra Stout (suck)","review":"The only bad Dead Milkmen album. Peter Bazooka is an okay song but that one song isn't enough for me to give this thing more than one star. Try Beelzebubba or Metaphysical Grafitti first if you're new to DM. And If you're a Dead Milkmen fan and haven't heard this album yet then I suggest keeping it that way. It's boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"There once was a library...","review":"Honestly, if you buy this, you are wasting your time. In my opinion, the man is an absolute master; at the same time, clearly not for everybody. But why would you buy this sampler to find out? Go to the library and read some of his short stories - start with \\"The Elephant Vanishes.\\" Or just pick up one of his novels. The excerpt of \\"Wind-Up\\" here is only slightly representative of the text as a whole.If you buy this, you will either A) like his writing, buy some of his books, and never need this again, leaving it to mold on your shelf, or B) dislike his writing, and never need this again, leaving it to mold on your shelf.And the \\"rarity\\" can easily be found online.It gets two stars, instead of zero, because even a tiny amount of Murakami in your life is a good thing. But really - don't spend your money here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story in Nomonhan","review":"When I heard about this anthology, I thought that it must have been extremely difficult to pick up some chapters from his long adventurous stories. I think it was true. But this anthology reminds me that my favorite story in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle even can hold as an independent story. I thought that Nomonhan story told by Lieutenant Mamiya was the heart of the chronicle. But when I read it again in this anthology, I understand that it was splendid in terms of story telling and description and you could feel anything in that story, like fear, wind in the field in central Asia, and even flash in the cold, dark, and deep well. It is worth to read even only this story and afterward you cannot help reading the rest of the story, the chronicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pinball","review":"Amazon markets this book under the title of the book Pinball. While I realized the book was random chapters from various works by Murakami, I didn't know that there isn't a word of Pinball in the book. Amazon has either made a mistake or a misrepresentation. This book, although interesting, has nothing to do with the book Amazon says it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"So F'ing Ridiculous","review":"What a waste of time! You can find all these selections in other Murakami books. On top of that, Vintage decided NOT to opt for the long awaited English releases of 'Hear the Wind Sing' and 'Pinball, 1973'. Do not buy this if you are a Murakami virgin, go and buy 'Elephant Vanishes', or 'Norwegian Wood' or 'Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman'. This collection could have been great had Vintage made an effort to collect some of Murakami's unavailable work but what we have here is basically an exercise in regurgitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value in a small package","review":"This is a great little vacuum cleaner that takes up so very little space. When you compare its price level with some larger models it becomes very attractive, as long as your needs match what it offers. I wouldn't recommend it if you have a heavily carpeted area to vacuum. But for bare floors, the odd rug, and all those dust-catching nooks and crannies, this certainly does the trick. Part of its appeal is certainly its light weight which makes carrying it up and down stairs and holding in one hand while vacuuming ceiling edges with the other trivially easy. Just keep in mind that this is a minimalist vacuum cleaner. No bells and whistles; just what you need to get the job done well and with a dash of style. Never yet been disappointed with a Panasonic product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic vacuum, lite and powerful","review":"I got the Panasonic MC-V3900 Canister Vacuum Blue, after reading these reviews and I have to agree that this little machine rocks.

A little noisy but nothing unbearable. Now I only use the Hoover for the rugs and the terrace, because the Panasonic does not work well on rugs or carpet. There is only one attachment : the crevice cleaning tool and for me is just what I need. I use an extension cord that facilitates my moving around. What a difference after having to schlep the hoover all over the place! I wrote this review after the first time use, I'll edit if it burns out or breaks.

I bought it simply for cleaning under furniture, under baseboard heaters, and all the crevices my regular vacuum can't get at (my favored regular vac is an upright with no attachments). Besides the regular nozzle, this vac has only a crevice tool (though I do plan to purchase a furniture/ dusting attachment separately for about $5 at my local hardware store). It is lightweight, and best of all it has an automatic cord retraction! The bags cannot be found in your local department store, but I have no trouble finding them online here at Amazon, and at other online vac shops (check your manual-- the bags have a different number than c-13-- use that when searching for them online).

All of the attachments (from the hose to the floor attachment to the angled nozzle and the brush) don't really fit well together and often come apart in the midst of cleaning. Also, because it is a small vacuum, the bags are small and although I've only used it about 4 times, I've already had to change the bag (I do have two pets).In spite of the problems, for the price and the small space in which I'll be using it, the good definitely outweighs the bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"La judia de Toledo- The Jewess of Toledo, what a ride on history and love!","review":"I read it in Spanish and I am looking for an English version to share with friends who do not speak Spaninsh.

I was close to crying in frustration at the thought of plunking down $200-300 dollars for something I hated. I didn't like the look of this stroller at first(I'm in AZ dark colors are a bad idea here) but I sat my son in it and gave it a whirl. He loved it and so did I!

I started with the Graco travel system, which was perfect for an infant. But now that my baby is 20 months, the big stroller was just too heavy and bulky to use. The Acella stroller fits easily in the back of my van, leaving room for groceries. It folds very compact and is incredibly light weight. The basket under the stroller is a decent size. My baby uses the snack tray all the time. Seat reclines...great for napping baby. It comes with a four point harness. Not sure it's necessary when a lap belt will do.

I like \\"See And Feel And Know.\\" And the two bonus songs didn't deserve to be buried anonymously at the end; they're better than quite a few of the listed songs.In the end, though, this album did nothing to change my opinion that Bob Mould was the real ace in Husker Du and Hart was the secondary talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"super sonic sounds","review":"Only on OLE' can you truly appreciate Maynard's reach for the high notes.

Boukreev was apparently a great climber, but after finishing this book I was convinced he had an oversize ego and an overly thin skin. To understand how Boukreev-DeWalt shamelessly distorted the facts to make their case, you only have to read Krakauer's utterly convincing rebuttal to their spurious claims, which was published in the postscript to the 1999 paperback edition of \\"Into Thin Air.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother unless you are fascinated with Everest.","review":"This might have been a very different book if Boukreev had gotten a co-writer who could write.

While I understand Boukreev's need to clear his good name (and while I think he does this very clearly), I was more interested in seeing the disaster from across the camp from Krakauer's Into Thin Air.

But now that I have, I'm not sure I see what all the fuss is about. The events the author talks about are sort of interesting but the writing is not very good. Actually the writing is really dull except for in a few chapters. Also, this Russian climber Boukreev who hired G. Dewalt to write the book, he seems really defensive, like he's got something to hide. He sure spends a lot of energy dissing John Krakauer.

I have no doubt that Boukreev was an experienced and dedicated climber but this book is presented as if he did nothing wrong up on Everest in 1996.I have read almost every book published about the deaths on Everest in 1996 and the concensus of opinion is that everybody did something that contributed to the disaster. Boukreev made his share of mistakes and I would have been more impressed with this book if that concession had been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short of the Summit","review":"The Climb gave me a new look on the '96 Tragedy other than from Krakauer and Lenne's books, so it was worth a read. However, the book should not be within the ranks of \\"novel\\" status. It should be among the \\"counter-arguement\\" ranks. It concentrates entirely too much on \\"damage control\\" for Anatoli and not on the climb. The book doesn't even hint that Anatoli may have been in the wrong on several occassions (because I believe there were several).

And the Salon excerpts do go on interminably.Boukreev is a flawed hero but a hero nonetheless.Krakauer's own compelling version of the events bear testimony to this. And as for the sniping by deWalt, has he donated even a dollar of his profits to various mountaineering causes or organisations?The very silence on this issue begs the question whether or not such a book should ever have come out.I suggest all armchair climber thinking of buying this spend their money on World Mountaineering by Audrey Salkeld instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big ego healing story","review":"I had first read Into Thin Air a couple of months ago and became very interested in climbing Mt Everest and the 1996 disaster. I thought that The Climb was okay. Boukreev dishes out a lot of critiscm to climbers when they make a mistake, but is blind to his own mistakes. He makes himself seem like a hero.

Anatoli Boukreev was one of the strongest climbers of all time, and he wrote this book because he was not happy about what Jon wrote about him. Although he is obviously not as good of a writer as Jon, I enjoyed his book more. His version goes behind the main scene and shows the business end and the intense logistics of a commercial expedition on a big mountain. Anatoli was the one who was up half of the night rescuing climbers while the rest of the survivors were passed out in their tents. It seems like almost everyone who was on this expedition wrote a book, but this is my favorite version.

I purchased The Climb with great anticipation about a separate, \\"rebuttal\\" point of view, and was not disappointed. Whatever your opinion about what happened in 1996, it is hard not to respect and admire Boukreev after reading this. Sure, the writing is not as polished as Krakauer's book, but I was still turning pages as quickly as possible. Even a completely non-narrative, factual account of the goings-on in 1996 at the roof of the world would be gripping. As a singular book, I think The Climb absolutely can stand on its own. As one in a series on Everest 1996, the story becomes even more compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"I heard many people say how badly the book was written before reading it myself. I have to disagree. The language may be simple and at times may sound foreign but I found that it only gives the account more authenticity. Having also read Into Thin Air, I would recommend this book for a perspective at least, but really for the experience of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The defensive tone of this book is a big negative.","review":"One point I'd like to make is that NO ONE knows the full extent of everything that happened up on Everest that day. Not Krakauer, not Boukreev, NO ONE. It's laughable for a reader to say that one account is more accurate.Having said that, I think that the overall defensive tone of The Climb gets old quickly. While The Climb offers a fresh perspective and new insights, it would've been much more enjoyable if the authors did not spend so much effort trying to refute Krakauer's account. At least Krakauer was willing to admit his mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hero's Tale","review":"I readed both, Into Thin Air and Breshears book before I read the Climb, and my impression is that Krakauer was not fair to Anatoli, and was not honest to the truth.Anatoli saved three lifes on his own, found Beck Weathers when he was wondering(got help for him) and never gave up on Scott Fischer. When things got out of hand, he was the only one who took action to actualy save lifes (risking his life), and that is the fact, the rest is intrigue. He was the only one who did something when people were in trouble, after the storm all the help in the world was avaiable, but during...The book is a plain description of what happened there, it is not as well written as Into thin air, but in my opinion is more honest. Anatoli is the real hero of that story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling reading that deserved better editing","review":"I found this book both engaging and frustrating. It's a compelling re-telling of the 1996 Everest disaster from an interesting point of view. However, the content editing is so poor that it slows the reader. Quotes are far too long, sentences often repeat one another and the voice is inconsistent. The author often uses footnotes when the information could be (should be) integrated into the text. That said, Boukreev's perspective is fascinating and enlightening. If you read \\"Into Thin Air,\\" I would highly recommend reading The Climb, too. As previous reviews have noted, \\"Into Thin Air\\" is a good place to start because it details the cast and story more effectively than The Climb. However, The Climb provides a more solid context for why and how things went so awry."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's always good to hear another side of the story","review":"I'm glad to have finally read this, I knew it wouldn't be as exciting, having already read Into Thin Air, but I'm certainly glad I picked it up. The Good: that we get an account of what happened from Boukreev, an explanation of his rationale and additional accounts of Fischer's expediton. We can only imagine/speculate how worse if would have gone had Boukreev not been there. The Bad: the writing. It felt disorganized, poorly constructed, disjointed ... Boukreev could have used a better co-author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star if I could","review":"This book could have been an interesting and different point of view from Into This Air. Instead it is a defensive, ego inflating bore! Boukreev is trying out for sainthood, every page has a passage about how much everyone loves and respects him and about what a great climber he is. He offers no new insights into the tragedy, he is only interested in making himself look good and Jon Krakauer look bad. It doesn't work for me. I couldn't wait to be finished with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I saw that people that read Into Thin Air recommended this book as well. I decided to take a look and found in interesting when comparing the two. Definitely worth your time! Check it out.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling story that adds important perspectives.","review":"The Climb is Anatoli Boukreev's very personal account of the story behind the Everest tragedy of May, 1996. I had formed opinions of him based on Jon Krakauer's writings and subsequent publicity. Those opinions have changed. I found The Climb to be compelling and told from a master climber's perspective. What is truth when mountains, hypoxia, greed, weather and human limitations meet head on with avalanche force? I can not relate to the passions that drive men and women to push themselves to Everest expeditions, nor understand what such risks and achievements/failures really mean. But, after reading The Climb, I know that Anatoli Boukreev died doing what he loved and in the one place on earth he felt truly at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great follow-up to \\"Into Thin Air\\"","review":"This was an equally gripping account (ref:\\" Into Thin Air\\") of the terrible tragedy in 1996. It certainly taught me I don't need to go to such extreems to \\"find\\" myself. I do have enormous respect for all of the climbers: clients, guides, and sherpas alike. It validated that one doesn't know how (s)he'll respond in such situations, and I find no place in my heart to criticize any of the climbers, even though I question some of the behaviors. The upside of finishing this book is to view the, all too brief, Imax film. I congratulate the bravery of the author. The part with his words in his broken English gave me a richer understanding of the man and his motives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story that is superbly written","review":"After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" I wasn't sure what to expect from \\"The climb\\". But shortly after starting to read this book I found that it was superbly written. The story keeps moving and the reader almost has a sense that they are there experiencing the tragic events that took place on Mt. Everest in May, 1996. Although Krakauer and Boukreevs stories about what exectly happened during the expidition differ \\"The Climb\\" is just written so much better than \\"Into Thin air\\" which helps to lend to it's accuracy. Time was taken to interview many of the survivors of the Everest Expiditions. If any one wants a thouroghly enjoyable read that grabs you and doesn't let you go than you need to read \\"The Climb\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts From London","review":"Alex Garland (author of THE BEACH & THE TESSERACT) recently wrote that THE CLIMB was the best book he'd read in 1999, that it was a story that would \\"both grip and haunt you.\\" I couldn't agree more. This challenge to the self-serving, univision of Jon Krakauer is a welcome and valuable contribution to mountaineering literature. After reading THE CLIMB I felt that I had a clearer sense of the actions and decisions that contributed to the 1996 Everest disaster, and I am left in wonder that the impact of Krakauer's presence on the decision making of Rob Hall has not been more closely examined. Read it for insight and a critical look at Krakauer's constructions of \\"reality.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book. A Great Rebuttal to Karkauers' Story","review":"In literary terms, the book is no match for Into Thin Air. However, the book is written well enough to be considered a good book.I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who has read Into Thin Air because there are ALWAYS two sides to every story, and Boukreev airs his version of what happened on Everest in 1996 when so many people died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anatoli deserved a better book","review":"When I first read 'Into Thin Air' I thought Krakauer had written a fair and balance account of the tragedy. Although Krakauer was at times critical of Boukreev, he also praised him often, and to my mind Boukreev came across as a hero. Then I read 'The Climb' and thought Krakauer had maybe been unfair to Boukreev. Now having read the Salon postings, I am convinced that DeWalt has written a very dishonest book. He should be ashamed of himself. What I read in Salon makes me doubt everything in 'The Climb.' Krakauer's book is clearly the more honest, more accurate account.Boukreev didn't need DeWalt to lie for him. He didn't need DeWalt to write such a defensive and sleazy book. Anatoli was a true hero. It's a shame he didn't find a more honest and more skillful writer than DeWalt to! present his story. He deseved much better than 'The Climb'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Perspective, but...","review":"This is an interesting read in terms of fleshing out details surrounding the May '96 Everest tradgedy. There is a ton of detailed info for anyone curious about the expidition(s) in question or high altitude mountaineering in general. Unfortunately it is quite poorly written. The narrative constantly changes from third person (DeWalt) to first person (Boukreev) and while neither are particularly eloquent, read together the prose is a practically schizophrenic.The tone of the narrative is also very defensive. Boukreev clearly produced this book in response to John Krakouer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" which was critical of his actions at times. I have no interest in taking sides in this debate. I do enjoy learning about the intracies of mountaineering and simply enjoying a good book. \\"The Climb\\" delivers in the former respect and fails miserably in the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increasingly interesting as the story progresses.","review":"Having first read Krakauers 'Into thin air' I had already formed an opinion about the events as told. At the beginning of Boukreevs re-telling it seemed to me that the story was written defensively, trying to explain what was written in Krakauers book, but by the time I finished 'The Climb' I was convinced that I had read the true telling of the story. I was not, however, very pleased with the co-authors writing style. Ínto Thin Air' had more of a 'being there' feeling. I think that anybody interested in the events on Everest should read both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mistakes Were Repeated","review":"What amazed me about The Climb was that Boukreev repeated many of the same mistakes in his 1997 Everest expedition, summitting with an inexperienced Indonesian group after 3:00 p.m. While he did establish a Camp 5 at 8,500 meters, he would not have made it back to that camp with all climbers had he faced either the weather or health problems that occurred on May 10, 1996. And then Boukreev kills himself in an avalanche. I think all these people have a death wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A copy of \\"Into Thin Air\\"","review":"This book was good but it was just a copy of Jon Krakauer's \\"Into thin Air\\". I thought \\"Into Thin Air\\" was better. This book had better pictures but thats about it. I would recommend this book only if the person had already read \\"Into Thin Air\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Golden as any Palomino","review":"This is Lori Carsons best album to date. It has the dark intensity and harsh beauty as her best work with the Golden Palominos and the lush minimalist production by Anton Fier adds to its power. Though I love all of her albums, I would recommend this as the perfect introduction to her solo work for those not familiar with this wonderful artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful","review":"I had the opportunity to watch Lori Carson perform live at Tower Records Singapore during her promotional tour for this album. At once hooked, I rushed to purchase the CD and get her autograph. To this day the CD remains one of my most treasured possessions. This is one of those rare albums I can honestly call timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"This album is exquisite and I am constantly amazed at how such a beautiful album could have been followed 2 years later by such a patchy sequel.

With a voice this pure, who needs over-layered music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visit the library first","review":"I checked this out from our library before purchasing, and I'm glad I did.

If you cannot sew, you will not be able to do several of the designs. The pattern for the handbag pictured on the cover requires sewing skills; additionally, it requires a zipper, and the size and type of zipper necessary is not included in the materials list. Also, the publishers have chosen not to list suppliers in the back of the book, and ask the reader to refer to their website instead. Well, I logged on to Lark's website, and could not find a list of suppliers for this book. Thanksfully, a google of online yarn suppliers will help you locate some decent internet sources that sell some of the more specialty yarns used in this book. I will continue my search for a book on felted knits, and pass on purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unfinished Movie.","review":"It is never a good thing when the movie you are watching suddenly stops about 20 minutes or so from the end, as if you accidentally hit the stop button. The movie 'Michael Collins' just stops at what appears to be a dramic scene, then starts again from the beginning. After playing with the remote control, I decided the it was not me, it was the product. Amazon was good about quickly processing the refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically inaccurate, mediocre-to-bad acting","review":"This movie, while somewhat interesting, was so historically inaccurate and lopsided it's laughable. Alan Rickman's performance as Eamonn de Valera deserves particular mention; there's simply no way such a weak-minded man could possibly have served as taoiseach or president of Ireland. There's inadvertent humor in Julia Roberts's attempt at an Irish accent (and where are the strong Irish women so prominent in history?). If you want to watch a movie about the Irish struggle for independence, watch \\"The Treaty\\" -- it is more interesting and more historically accurate, and it has better acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neeson is amazing.","review":"It's this movie that made me add Liam Neeson to my must see movie actor list. This man is strong in every movie that he does and this movie is extremely intense. Watch it without expectation and it's power will take you for a ride. Based on real life, don't expect a happy story with a happy ending. It's dark all the way through with a true to life ending. Having said that this is a movie that if you have not seen it or heard of it, trust me on this, check it out. Save it for a rainy day to get the full power behind it. Michael Collins is a controversial story and topic, but real history asides the movie is impressive and the extras will help you to know more about the real man as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good history","review":"I personally enjoyed this story of Michael Collins and thought it fairly accurate historically, although friends of mine in Ireland thought that there was a bit of blarney involved. For anyone interested in the Irish civil war, and the earlier IRA campaign against the British, I thhink it gives a fairly accurate basic grounding. Liam Neeson, as always, shines. It is somewhat ironic that Needon himself is from Northern Ireland, playing the Republic's greatest iconic hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor tape","review":"Having just traveled to Ireland, I was interested in the history. The story is great and the shipping was fast, however, the last 45 minutes of the tape was bad. It was scratchy, hesitant and the audio was poor.

The only reason I purchased the tape was that there were no DVDs available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot see","review":"The copy of Michael Collins was faulty and kept stopping so I have not watched it.Posssibly you can do something about this for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish on rubbish","review":"The people who have written reviews of Michael Collins are as ignorant of Irish history as is Neil Jordan. I am inclined to think of Jordan as a graduate of the Oliver Stone school of history. Michael Collins is as much a stew of lies and fairytales as is any movie made by Stone. the story of the origins of the Irish Civil War is a complete fantasy. Collins did not head the irish delegation to the talks that led to the Treaty of 1922. Most reviewers have correctly identified Julia Roberts' laughable performance as the weakest part of the movie. I am no great admirer of Dev, but the sinister caricature presented in this movie is grotesque.

Ratherthan weaving an engrossing story I thought this was more of a series ofscenes strung together for historical accuracy.

Too bad - lots of material to work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"If you would like to learn more about the great Michael Collins, this is the movie for you.

So, my Irish history is rusty and this movie helps fill in some gaps, but I think more of the history of these folks struggle should have been shown.Julia Roberts' Kitty Kiernan is character who needed further development or she should have hit the cutting room floor. Why is she involved in the cause? Who does she love Michael or Harry? Is she a country lass or a city woman? Why is she in the film again?

My first bite of one I noticed it had a hard crunch. I like crunchy cookies, others may not. I read here that you can leave the top opened on the bag overnight to soften them. The cookie is about 3-4 bites worth. On my first bite I could feel a little tongue tingle. Each subsequent bite produced the same warm tingle and THAT is what puts this ginger snap in a class of its own, never losing that 'bite'. It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie. Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream. Excellent product that I will purchase again.Note: Expiration date on the bags are December 17th, 2010 but I don't think they will last that long.--Sailor Hill, CA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"I originally bought the Mi-Del cookies at a local odd-lots store over a year ago. I felt a sense of loss after the store stopped carrying them, since no other local grocer stocked them. So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS. Twelve packages may seem like a lot, but I look forward to devouring every one of them. I've also tried the vanilla and lemon snaps, and they're equally outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Cookies & crumbs & Bad Expire Date","review":"These cookies are great if you eat all 12 bags within 2 months! It expires in less than 2 months!Also about 20% of bag is crumbs! Bad shipping & packing on Amazon! BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Chocolately, A disappointing texture and flavor","review":"I bought these cause I'm a chocolate snap lover, and I had been craving some. The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.Let's just say this: I took these over to a family party, and none of the kids liked it. NOT ONE. And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.I'd have to say skip these cookies. They don't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Idea of Vanilla Snaps","review":"I absolutely love the Mi-Del ginger snaps, so I thought I'd try these in vanilla, thinking they'd be just as tasty. Unfortunately, they didn't have the vanilla flavor I'd hoped for, and I wasn't crazy about their consistency. They almost seemed stale, although I'm sure that's not the case. As I actually prefer the name brand vanilla snaps, I gave these away to my local food pantry."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing taste","review":"I like the fact that the Mi-Del cookies are low-fat and use some organic ingredients. I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors, and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good. I'm a chocolate lover, so this is rather disappointing. The taste is similar to the ginger snap, but it's off quite a bit - slightly bitter. It's as if they didn't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder. It also has a poor aftertaste that's slightly bitter (the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more).Gotta give it 1 star - yeah, I ate 10 of these to give them a chance, but I threw away the rest of the bag. The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps, but the flavor is off. Not Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"These cookies are hard & somewhatlacking in taste. We threw out half the bag.Mostly because my children did not likeginger snaps & my husband and I did not care for these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Good aroma, good mouth feel, but the taste...flavorless. Like a crunchy lump of flour. Might help if they put some ginger in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great cookie!","review":"My wife and I prefer them just a bit stale - leave them open for a day or so to get just the right amount of chew. If you don't, they're very, very crisp (but still very good). Snappy, even. :)I'll also agree with the comment that they can be inconsistent from one bag to the next, but even when they're off, they're pretty good.As far as flavor goes, one person's spicy is another person's bland.

Nick Warren typically delivers the goods in the manner of absolutely amazing trance, as is evident if you take even a passing glance at any of his GU releases (particularly \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"Live in Prague\\"). But, like everyone else, even NW needs his down-time. Enter, this release.If you're already familiar with the Back to Mine series, you know what to expect. This is laid-back, chilled-out, sitting in your favorite chair, laying on your favorite couch, lying in your favorite bed (with your favorite person, of course), and even sitting poolside, beachside, or window-side as it rains. Smoothed out vibes, slightly trippy beats, delicious altogether.Very worth having and very worth the import price (if you order it off here).Also check out Groove Armada's effort in this series, as well as that of Faithless.

The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album. Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless \`commentary' at the beginning or end of the song. The \`commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason. It would have been nice if they had put these \`commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear. The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no \`Killing Me Softly'. Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording. Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just watch the damn movie instead","review":"NO KANYE, NO CODY CHESSNUT, NO FUGEES, NO C.S.U.

I was also disappointed by the exclusion of the Fugees track which I think was a draw to purchase this CD, if I had known it would not included I might have waited on the DVD and it is why this rating is not 5. Nevertheless, I am impressed and satisfied because of there efforts to save the substance of the genre we call hip hop...........inspired from RAP.

A remarkable effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Live Performance!","review":"I will start by saying that this performance is as solid as I have ever heard by any band or orchestra. Not only Salsa, but music in general. Ray Barretto still goes strong at an age in which some others are already retired or washed up. The band sounds tight and the musicianship is superb. The Conga vs. Bongo duel between Barretto and Roberto Roena could have been more impressive, but still it sounds great. Vilato's solo in \\"Arrepiéntete\\" is simply brutal. These other reviewers that say that Adalberto Santiago did not deliver amaze me with those comments, because Santiago sounds great and did some nice \\"soneos\\" in songs like \\"Arrepiéntete\\" and \\"Quítate la Máscara\\". If you are a Salsa fan, get this. If you are a Barretto fan, get this. If you want to start listening to Salsa and want a live performance, this is a very good entry.

But after 30 minutes of this trash I turned it off. It was horrible! The acting was horrible and it was just plain stupid. I'm fairly indifferent to Seth Green as an actor...but what was he doing in this nonsense? People say that he made a good drag queen, but they're wrong. He and Macaulay Culkin were terrible at acting like gay guys. Gay guys don't even act like that! They tried to make their speech/mannerisms look natural, but they actually looked like they were SPOOFING gay guys. It looked like something that should have been a skit on Saturday Night Live. I think this movie is offensive to gay guys everywhere. Please....I BEG you....do NOT watch this movie!

There is mesmerizing dancing, partying, drugging, debauchery, and then, of course, murder (of course you can get away with murder when you are the coolest kid in NY, right?).Seth Green really steals the show as James St. James. McCauley Culkin, in his return to the big screen, is a bit stilted playing Alig, and never really convinces the audience why Alig rose to the top. Cameos by Marilyn Manson as a beautiful drag queen and by Wilmer Valderamma (of That 70's Show fame) are excellent, as are supporting cast members Chloe Sevigny, Natasha Lyonne, and Wilson Cruz.If you can handle it, pick up his delicious power trip of a mix of glitter and blood.

It's a movie about Michael Alig who started the club kid craze in New York started in the 80's. The movie shows how drugs can destroy someone who although outrageous was actually very good at what he was trying to do. Culkin picked a great role to return to acting with. What a remarkable performance. I would be remiss though in not also praising Seth Green for his performance as James St. James. James is the person that actually trained Alig on how to be a club kid. The movie shows the rise and ultimate demise of Michael Alig. It's a very sad tragic movie. The acting was mesmerizing. The second time I saw it was on I didn't plan on watching it again as I wasn't in the mood for a sad movie, but again once started I was so mesmerized by the acting performances I watched the entire thing again. It was actually better the second time. I would definitely suggest giving this move a look see."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you like my UFO?","review":"I adore this movie. The whole weirdness of it all, plus they have Marilyn Manson as a club kid named Christina and he looks like he has the time of his life in this one. One of my favorite parts is where they have the party in the big truck and Christina is driving it, with a hit of acid on her tongue. The actor who plays Fez on That 70s Show (forgive me...I can't think of his name offhand) also gives an incredible performance, and I'm quite used to him as the character of Fez. Not once did I think \\"Fez\\" while I watched Party Monster. This isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but if you ever did the late-night raves and partying in your life, you'll feel right at home, even if you don't party like that anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A peek at club kids and the N.Y.C. club called Limelight","review":"I had a hard time liking this movie, mainly because Michael Alig is such a likable guy and Macaulay Culkin is just so creepy to watch though he does play a gay man remarkably well. Seth Green acts his role but never comes off as comfortable in it and who could blame him. Alig lived life over the top and the movie plays everything over the top. The peek inside the infamous Limelight club is interesting and you'll laugh so hard you'll wet yourself at Marilyn Manson who has a minor role but in the end the documentary that chronicles Alig and the murder of \\"Club Kid\\" Angel is much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama queens for the new age","review":"I recently watched Party Monster becasue I had once seen a preview somewhere for it and I thought that it looked just so messed up and crazy that I had to see it. My first reaction was laughter at the beginning of the film, because Seth Green's character's attitude towards Mac's character was just funny. The movie, charachters, costumes, set design, story-line and music drew me in and eventually I caught myself thinking about certain parts of the film days after I had watched it. That's what makes a good movie. Even though it was a little out there, I am expecting my copy of the book and an audio cd about the same \\"club kids\\" era any day now from amazon.com.

A thoroughly amusing film in many ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the book","review":"I suggest that you read the book instead. It explains things in detail and gives you a much better picture of the club kids. I was so excited to see the film because I loved the book, but honestly it was a let down.

Even though the people portrayed in this film were dramatic, over-the-top club kids, the acting was so over done, it was laughable. I couldn't even watch the whole movie.If you want to see an interesting documentary (minus the murder) about a iconic club kid (but so much more), see The Legend of Leigh Bowery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin, Cheap Production With Neither Moral Nor Meaning","review":"Seth Green and Macaulay Culkin team up to explore the morally and sexually confused NYC night club scene of the early '90s. Shot with a transparent low budget, it's an excruciatingly amateur production: bad lighting, listless performances, crude cinematography and creatively bankrupt screenwriting are just the tips of the iceberg. Neither Green nor Culkin seems particularly involved in their role, with each actor's strange cadence and emotionless delivery giving the constant impression that a cash-strapped director used first takes for every shot. Without a single likeable character to its name, Party Monster chooses to embrace and celebrate a lifestyle so waspy, entitled and superficial that I caught myself actively rooting against the lot of them. Overdrugged, shallow, trivial and irritating, its only use is as a showcase of fantastically absurd costumes and makeup."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"Being a casual fan of the club-scene and having read the excellent book \\"Clubland\\" - based on the same story - I had high expectations that this movie was going to take us into the club world and give a real glimpse of what was going on. Unfortunately, the movie is a campy re-telling of a truly horrific story about one Michael Alig. I got the sense that the director was trying to create something that was arty and stylized, where the subject matter really demanded a more down-to-earth and uncolored treatment. Not much point in a movie like this - neither interesting nor fun. I recommend those who want an inside look at the life get a copy of \\"Clubland\\" instead, which also has more information about the Miami crime scene behind the clubs there as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low, low budget movie","review":"After seeing the documentary on cable, I couldn't wait to see the movie. The movie lacked quality acting and did not flow well at all. The movie also lacked the nightclub seen, which was supposed to be, the basis of this movie. The beginning of this movie bored me and rest was not better. And by the way, what was with the man dressed as a rat telling the story and showing it on a video from a rat hole? I guess Disney had some input. See the original documentary. Use the DVD movie as a drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullet straight to my brain, Please!!!","review":"This was perhaps the worst film I have ever seen. I can not understand how it has received so many good reviews. I am a fan of the mythology and story, and thought the film would bring back memories of fun party days, but instead, I cringed with every horrible camera angle and misplaced line. I entitled my review accordingly, because listening to the horrible dialogue and acting was like watching a train crash over and over again. My biggest question directed at the production is, what was the casting director smoking when he chose this horrible line up? Fez as Keoki? WTF?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, but not entirely accurate","review":"Party Monster is definitely a great movie for entertainment value. MaCaulay Culkin was a good choice to play Michael Alig, but he does exagerate his matterisms a bit (but I guess that's Hollywood). He actually resembles Richie Rich (another club kid), more than he resembles Michael. Seth Green was an interesting choice for James St. James, but he pulled off the role oddly well. Marilyn Manson plays Christina, which is quite hilarious.I keep in touch with Michael Alig the best that I can. He has never seen this movie, so he cannot assess it's validity. If you really want to know the real Michael Alig, watch Party Monster: The Documentary. Still interested in Michael?

This might be OK if you live in a warm/moist area where static is not a problem -- anywhere else you should not buy it since you'll be buying batteries for it every few months.If the manufacturer could fix the static problem then I'd rank the product highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static sensitive","review":"I bought two of these and aside from the static problem (turning itself on), I consider it a good product. Would I purchase again? I don't know. I have replaced one battery in the unit thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not rugged enough for dogs...","review":"I purchased two of the Inova Microlights for my dogs since we walk mostly in the dark. The battery used is easily available at most stores and the light is (when working) quite good. The light has a steady on or a squeeze option to keep the light on temporarily. I really liked it, for about 30 minutes.Dispite the claims of ruggedness, the dogs shaking themselves off after a walk in the rain managed to pop of the covers and lose the batteries after having the lights for one day. With it being dark when I walk them, I am unlikely to find said covers again.There is a \\"lifetime\\" guarantee for the lights and all I need to do is send Inova another $2 to recieve this fine service. So really you need to figure at least another $2 onto the price if you plan on clipping these lights to a dog harness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure!","review":"A perfect way to celebrate Earth Day every day for you and your child. Earth Day Birthday shows twelve different species of animals in their natural habitats. The catchy sing-along text combined with the awesome action illustrations truly make this book a treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully illustrated picture book for young readers","review":"Earth Day Birthday is a beautifully illustrated picture book for young readers, demonstrating the wonder and importance of the planet's varied environment and the amazing creatures who thrive in it. The text by Pattie Schnetzler is patterned after the popular \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\" song; each two-page spread features lavish color illustrations and lyrics such as \\"On the eighth Earth Day Birthday the wide world gave to me... / Eight cranes a-dancing / six owls a-hooting / five spotted fawns / four salmon leaping / three panthers creeping / two grizzlies sleeping / and a bald eagle in a blue sky.\\" The final two pages offer a brief history and incentive to celebrate Earth Day, as well as the simple music for singing aloud. Wonderfully enhanced with the artwork of Chad Wallace, Earth Day Birthday is a counting book classic to share with preschool and kindergarten age boys and girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"As advertised, but...","review":"I should have paid attention to the fact that this book is comprised of \\"period photographs\\", all of which are sepia tone or black and white. There is little information about each picture beyond the site name and architect.There is likely a value to this book for an architect or historian, but as my purpose was for inspiration during my remodel, I was disappointed. Many, if not all of the buildings pictured were built at a time when detail and craftsmanship were valued, and while they should be appreciated, it would be far out of my budget to recreate such detail.If you are looking for inspiration, or current pictures (color) of older estates, I would recommend \\"California Colonial\\" as my first choice. Others to read are \\"Red Tile Style\\" and \\"Casa California: Spanish-Style Houses from Santa Barbara to San Clemente\\".\\"Spanish Revival Architecture\\" is a nicely produced book, just not what I had in mind, and I returned my copy to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish Revival Architecture","review":"Lots of photos...problem is that they are all in black & white. And, some of the photos seem to be of poor quality or taken many years ago. The beautiful color jacket cover is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not exactly what I was looking for","review":"The previous review of this book expresses my sentiments exactly. I wish I would have read it before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Home School!","review":"I recently checked this book out of the library. I liked it so well I decided to get a copy for myself. I home school my children k4 and k5) and I have a TON of craft books. But this is by far the best (geared for age 2 to 6). Lots of different ideas to teach texture, color ect. All simple and most items I have on hand. If you homeschool or just want a book to do with your preschool age children this is an awesome book.Here is an example:Bumpy Paint... childs liquid paint, salt, paint brush, smooth finish white paper or paper plate. Mix 1 tablespoon of paint and 1 tablespoon of salt in dish. Mix (should be thick). paint applying some areas thick. Microwave 10 to 30 sec. should have bumby texture when dry.The book goes into more detail and each idea gives a suply list, what you do, what your child does and what the results should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not needed to do well, might hinder your preparation.","review":"This book was not exactly the greatest prep book (Barron's is). However, I was able to practice ten tests. Problem was that those practice tests were scaled extremely generously, the SAT's I took were more strict with the scaling. This book is just to gauge your performance and should not be used as a prep book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book","review":"I highly recommend this book. The reason I gave it a four star is because the tips are horrible. The best study guide would be the Barron's 21st edition. I am only 12 doing that talented search stuff. The first time I took the test I got a horrible score. Later my score raised by 320 points because of this and Barron's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget classes, get this book","review":"I found out that the only way to take the SAT was to learn HOW to take the SAT. This book will give you 10 chances to take the test so that you can learn the crucial secrets when it comes down to taking the actual test. 10 Real SATs teaches you secrets to unlock each question in all of the subject areas. I mainly used this book to work on my timing/pacing for the test which is a key component of the SAT. With more colleges relying on test scores, this book is invaluable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but...","review":"This book is on the right track, but when you look at it, many of the tests included are pre-1995, when the SAT was recentered, making them not nearly as useful as the book could be if it were updated. Instead, I suggest \\"Gruber's Complete Preparation for the New SAT.\\" It is an excellent book and raised my score 150 points."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book!","review":"this is the best of all the sat books. its actually by college board, the people who conduct SAT. Is has everything to do with SAT. it explains the basic stuff about SAT. and above all, its has 10 real SAT and thats the best part. we can get all the practice we need to score good on SAT exams. final word : GET THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SAT Practice Method...Really","review":"Out of all the SAT books I have used [Princeton, Barrons, Kaplan] This one I believe I have benefited the most from. Nothing can compare to practicing with REAL actual SAT tests. I used a timer and took all the tests in the book a month before test date and was very happy with my improved score. Sure the other books might give you weird hints and somewhat helpful techniques, but this is the REAL thing. The only downside was the tests didnt have explanations to the answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SAT prep book","review":"I think this is a great book for anyone looking to find help with preparing for the SATs, it was recommended to me by many friends and family members and it is a wonderful book.

I reccomend this book to anyone that is preparing for the test, and it's not that expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only way to go....","review":"I bought my 10 real book, because it was recommedned to me at an SAT workshop. I will never regret spending the money. Since it gives you 10 real, used before SAT's it is most helpful to the first time test taker to learn the format, mainly the fact that you shouldn't answer every question on the SAT. I took the November 2000 test, and I actually saw an analogy question I had seen before in my 10 Real book. (This is because all SAT questions are recycled). The book also contains strategies. If nothing else, give your friends and family a test you have already practiced with, and let them give it a try to see how smart they are. It will make you feel better. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially a first time tester with at least 2-3 weeks for practice. I have used most of the other SAT prep books, and this is king of the hill, no need buying the others. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like it!!!","review":"I am Korean..

Avant has a very powerful voice. I would definitely recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avant is my idol.","review":"Avant deserves 5 stars on this one because he knows how to make beautiful music. His voice is uncomparable (even though people compare him to the style of R&B legend R. Kelly) there is only one Avant and if he is compared to R. Kelly then that means he must be great, right? There is really no filler track on this album. Do not burn this album, go and get it now what are you waiting for? Oh, this album is highly recommended for the grown and sexy. Listen at your own risk, and enjoy the love voyage."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Double AA Ball R.Kelly","review":"Avant is still a Big time Broke,Broke R.Kelly clone which ain't a bad thing if you are adding things to your own Musical game,but when you are this deep in your career still sounding like a Karoke lite R.kelly then it's a time where you will either improve or be content as a Warm Up Vegas Act.the production,writing,etc.. on this album is just aight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avant stamp of approval!","review":"Avant is so underrated and often compared to R. Kelly. Avant has his own style and his own way of connecting with his listeners. This to me is his best album since his first one. You can put it in and listen to it from beginning to end. He talks on some real life issues on his last track with Jermaine Dupri. He reminds me of the old school sould singers. Avant's songs drive u crazy from the beginning to the end. This cd will be hot for man years to come. If you don't have it i advise you to go cope it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!!!","review":"This CD is a romantic soulful classic collection of ballads! This CD is a must to any R&B collection! I highly recommend this product! The delivery was rapid and quality stellar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Good Effort","review":"Since Avant's debut CD, My Thoughts, I really enjoyed the songs because they combined different artists' qualities (including Joe and R. Kelly), and I really wanted another \\"Joe\\", smooth operator, kind of singer. Well, each CD just got worse and worse, as in many cases with singers, and the end result is this: a cd full of filler songs. The only one that I kind of enjoy is 4 Minutes. I'm dissapointed that he's transitioning into a very mainstream singer and is sounding more and more monotonous. Well, I guess if you can sing and dress well, you got made anyways..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Needed A Better Director & Direction","review":"This new installment of his music just let me down. I have been listening to DIRECTOR the past few days since its debut and it still has not made me groove or feel what I expected from Avant. There are only two songs that appeal to me the lead off single 4 Minutes and the Infectious Lie About Us beautifully crafted. However the rest of the album lacks potential and is just plain Jane to me. His best album to date is Ecstacy...now that was hot hot hot right along with the first one. I think this album was rushed because the Private Room was privately a mess and that's putting it lightly. It just doesn't capture me at all...I am a fan of his and it just didn't do it for me. Ofcourse listening to it over and over might change my mind but for now...its garbag'. I like Avant but like the last album this one will probably catch dust and the 2 aforemention songs that I like are the only two that will be frequenting the I-Podage for my listening pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!

This album, production-wise and lyrically, is one of the most creative r&b albums in a while. And even thought though songs are mid-tempo, the beats are hotter than sumthin u would find on an r. kelly album. My favorite songs are \\"Mr. Dream\\", \\"Exclusive\\" w/Lloyd Banks, \\"Lie About us\\", \\"You Know What\\", \\"With You\\", and of course \\"4 minutes\\".

Your style is truly incredible and your voice touches my soul. I am a sista that is a complete music lover and this is definatly a GREAT way to satisfy my musical appetite. My eardrums are completly pleased and my heart is content and satisfied. You out did yourself this time and I am anxiously awaiting for your next drop!!!! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.

I especially love This Is Your Night, With You, Imagination and Now You Got Someone, but the ultimate beautiful song here is Lie About Us. I love it. For fans of Stick Wit You (Pusscat Dolls) there is an urban remix version of that song on here too.To me, this is some of his best work. Better than Ecstasy or Private Room.

Finally the process in each step could take up to 6 hours to process making the whole process of backing up your DVD up to 12 hours to reproduce.
