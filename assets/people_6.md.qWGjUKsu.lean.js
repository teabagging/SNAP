I was able to get most of this cleaned off after trying a few products (nail polish remover worked best). However, a few of the marks didn't come off, and some of the dominoes had knicks that obviously couldn't be removed. If you don't play this game often, or if it's used mainly by young children, perhaps this wouldn't be an issue. But my family is full of dominoes \\"sharks,\\" and they will notice the knicks and stains as fast as a pro poker player spots marked cards. It ruins the fun when you know which dominoes are where.

So, in addition to the advice that is given in this book, we also used condoms for the first two or three months after birth(s), and 'the rest' has worked great for spacing each of my 3 children 3 years apart.This is definite reading for every married couple, but especially every woman that does not want to take the pill (especially while breastfeeding)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GREEN ONIONS","review":"OVERALL SOUND QUALITY ONLY FAIR TO POOR.NOT AS LISTED ON WEB SITE.NO GREEN ONIONS TRACK, HOW CAN THE BEST-OF LEAVE OUT GREEN ONIONS?TOOK TOO LONG TO SHIP.DID THEY BURN-IT IN THE BASEMENT?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Let's face it - the perfect high chair pad would have no \\"nooks & crannies\\" and wouldn't let anything fall underneath the pad.

It explains various subjects in pure mathematics in order to make them accessible and interesting to non-mathematicians. A great variety of subjects are covered, including abstract algebra, group theory, number theory, and especially topology, to which the author devotes several chapters. The links between different branches of mathematics (e.g. topology and group theory) are given special attention, and one of the central themes of the book is the fundamental unity of mathematics.

However my printer is 3+ years old now, and this issue may have been addressed in the more recent models.The price listed here of $4000+ is about 3-4 times more than you should pay.

No one seems to notice that one of the children is still inside the house until she shouts from a window (she may have gone back in to save the cat). And bizarrely, after thoroughly dousing the home and chopping a hole in the roof, the firefighters tell the family to just move right back in. My kids have learned that they should never go back into a burning building, so when we read this we can point out all the things that one should NOT do as the come up in the story.

I believe you could probably squeeze another set of batteries in there, as well. There is also a slim front pocket.It doesn't have enough room for a charger or other things, but if you charge your batteries at home (or in your room if you're on the road) then this shouldn't be a problem.I think it's a nice balance of max protection but without the burden of a hardshell case.

What a pleasure it was to make pesto in no time at all. Now little balls of this good stuff, which will last until next year, are in my freezer.

Griffin covers work by various artists who are fellow natives of NC, such as Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, Roberta Flack, Mike Cross and the Squirrel Nut Zippers, yet the arrangements are unexpected, brilliant and all Griffin's own. Both classically trained and fluent in jazz, Griffin's sheer virtuosity is fluid, lyrical, polished and eminently listenable--and the humor of his rendition of Kay Kyser's Woody Woodpecker theme is a delightful plus. This CD will grow and grow on you--it's in heavy rotation at my house, and will stay there.

I did a lot of research & compared many doll houses before buying this one and I have no regrets buying this barbie house! Just prepare yourself for the windows to pop out and the box is shipped in the manufactuers box, so if it's a gift for your own child make sure you are aware of when it's out for delivery!

It has lots of small pieces and cool features and my two younger kids (2 and 4) love to sneak in her room and play with it.My biggest issue with this toy is that it was sent in it's original box. I had read other's peoples reviews and knew to be careful. Thank goodness I kept my eye on the street, for as soon as the UPS guy showed up, I kept the kids in one room while my husband ran out and put it in the attic.

My husband and I found it difficult to piece together as the pieces would just pop apart. We felt it was very cheaply made and not worth the $100 we spent. It is big and bulky and a little hard to move because it's all plastic and not sturdy. The elevator would get hung up when trying to move it up and down. The furniture pieces would also pop apart very easily. It has since moved over to Grandma's house to play with when she is over there. I would recommend going with the Loving Family house. It is made of heavy plastic, folds up nicely and does not at all seem cheap and it's about 1/2 the price of the Barbie House."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun but definietly not durable","review":"My daughter received this for christmas.

Three sets of new batteries were used to try to get the sounds to work, but to no avail. The people at the Mattel hotline said there was nothing that they could do, that there isn't a part to send to me for replacement. They suggested I take it back to the merchant. But since it's so huge and purchased online, sending it back isn't practical. No complaint against Amazon specifically (they sent a sealed box, ahead of schedule), but purchasing online makes it difficult to take care of defective items. The price on Amazon was the best I saw ($89 and change), but after I purchased it from Amazon, I saw the same price at Toys R Us and Wal-Mart. Purchasing there would have provided an more practical option to have the defective toy replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it","review":"My daughter loves it.

On Wednesday I made calls to UPS and to Amazon, only to find out that the Barbie house was \\"lost\\" and never made it off the loading dock. I received no notification from Amazon saying that there was a problem with the order. They processed a refund to my account the next day because the item was no longer available. We finally found a replacement \\"Bratz Villa\\" (not what we wanted really) on Ebay at twice the cost and no other place (believe me we searched statewide), but didn't want to dissapoint the kids and it arrived the day before Christmas Eve.

The house is cute, went together well for the most part, and the electronics (doorbell, etc.) were great. My daughter loved it. Unfortunately, it didn't last very long.The doors and window frame came off too easily (eventually I superglued the windows), and some of the pieces didn't fit together well when the house was all put together, leaving the 3rd story part sagging if it wasn't just right. Naturally, a 4 year old trying to play isn't paying attention to that. After 2 months, the floor part of the second-story bathroom broke beyond repair. Because of the sharp plastic edges that were left, I finally had to throw it out. We were both sad.My little girl is very easy on toys.

(By the way, the rep. at Mattel was making me send even more of the house back but I asked for her manager and then I was told just the tiny accessories) It was very hard explaining to a 3 year old that I had to take most of the house away from her in order for them to send her a new house that works. I'm not sure why I had to pay the shipping since I only had the house for a few minutes when it stopped working... Also, the windows fall out constantly and, the doors pop out of their tracks.

Also the amount of furniture you receive is not enough. The entertainment space is more like a hall way, I don't know why they even bothered putting this extra on the house, it would have been better just to let that be an extra floor. The drawer space in the kitchen is awful and the refrigerator space. Also the washer and dryer spin but not if you put even 1 piece of clothing in it. Also the window frames pop out very easily. To me this house is just a bunch of hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie House","review":"My youngest daughter loves the barbie house!

That's okay with me, because all pieces snap back on pretty easily. What can you really expect with snap-together plastic, anyways? Reviews of other doll houses all seemed much more flimsy and not worth the money. One thing to note is we immediately put up all the teeny-tiny accesories for when she's older, as they are way too small for a toddler to do much with and seem a little dangerous for smaller kids.

However, the constant preaching and ramblings and other nonsense about Christ and salvation and stories about his valiant efforts to convert everyone around him leave a rather unexpected bitter taste for the unsuspecting reader.

(As a piano technician myself, I was looking forward to these.) While there are a few such stories, this book is mostly filled with the author's testament about how his life has been fulfilled by his faith in Jesus Christ. He travelled the world with Horowitz, and instead of sightseeing and telling us of his adventures he tells us of spending time in great cities sitting in his hotel room, reading his bible. Most of his anecdotes relate to trying to get the great pianists to pray with him, or to take a bible from him. The writing is stilted and drab, except for the flowery prose of his co-writer, when she writes her little tid-bits. Anyone want my copy before it goes to the trash heap?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth Small","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book.

Also, the production is simply horrible here.The songwriting is good, however, and would make for a good listen, except for the problems mentioned above.The fact is that AC/DC virtually died when Bon died. The guy was simply irreplaceable. He was the missing link that finally launched the Young brothers to stardom. Due to sheer talent, their momentum was so good, the inspiration at a peak, that BACK IN BLACK would have been a success with any singer, be it Brian Johnson or another. That they managed to record album after album after Bon's death, itás a tribute to their quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"THROW IT AT THE WALL","review":"This is the first time that Brian Johnson began to show clear signs that his voice was beginning to go... It has some good tunes, but the debut of drummer Simon Wright added nothing to the band, it just made it worse.

This is AC/DC, for Christ's sake !!! But to say this fine moments make a great AC/DC album is a total absurd. FLY ON THE WALL was clearly the weakest effort up to that time, coming after FLICK OF THE SWITCH. For the first time we see the clear signs of Brian Johnson's gradual loss of voice and his total incapability of writing one single good lyric, a thing that Bon Scott did with complete mastery (even when dealing with silly subjects, he could pull something new out of them ). The production is good, no doubt about it, but Simon Wright's drums lack the simple quality of rhythm of Phil Rudd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Production","review":"Songs are O.K, but the key word here is PRODUCTION. basically there isn't any.

Simon Wright didn't fit into the band, Brian Johnson started to losing any singing capability he had. It's a bad album (and I love AC/DC) . THis is the band who has sold more than 46 million copies in U.S. alone. I never expected to hear such a low quality release by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"It's one of there best and definatly the most underated of all their albums.

The grille covers cannot be removed but with a bright flashlight I could see that the drivers were much smaller than 4.75\\" as indicated on Amazon's web site. They actually had 2.75\\" drivers, two in the center and one in each surround speaker. Sony's web site also lists the drivers as 4.75\\" so this might not be Amazon's fault.On a positive note returning the speakers was easy.

The construction quality is great and it seems to be very accurate. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was that the lanyard was not long enough after tying a knot in the end to allow it to go over my head so I could wear it around my neck. The lanyard is very thin and lightweight which help keep the total weight down to just 9 grams! Do no forget to melt the ends of the nylon lanyard to avoid fraying over time since this may weaken the already thin lanyard. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to keep pack weight down but wants an accurate compass."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this one","review":"Terrible writing, terrible directing and abyssmal acting.

About 10 minutes into the game, we also realized that none of the cards can actually be used in play until you have been playing for at least 3 days.

The first is known as FSOD, frozen screen of death, the screen freezes, and all your unequipped items vanish, because the only way to unfreeze is to turn off the GC. Next is corruption. Since the games has a \\"double save\\", the memory card can sometimes reject the second save, causing your card to get corrupted, and all your saved info, ERASED. This even happens with a Nintendo made memory card. So, if you're thinking of playing this game online, create a backup character, learn how to dupe, and dupe all your items to that character on a DIFFERENT memory card.

Also there aren't many different monsters in the game.Also, most of episode 1 takes place underground; underground mines, caves and ruins. And at each place the same freaking rooms are repeated over and over again.The game play at first is OK, as well as the weapons, character types (well balanced) and character creation.

It is non-stop action and is the first online game for Nintendo. The only thing different compared to the Dreamcast version might be the graphics and controls. They will be a little better on the Gamecube. Don't listen to some people who say the Xbox version is better. The controls are harder to master and the controller itself is big and clunky.

Gameplay is challenging at first, and I would recommend reading the instruction manual if you don't want to be lost! After a short while of gaming, you will learn the basics and work your way up to being a master.

From the smallest details, like: face paint, proportion, color of eyes, costume, hair, and over 10 different hairstyles for most of the characters. The only real problem with this game is that online many people have GameShark (GS) and Xploder... People that have the GS and Xploder mess up the fun of this game...

The large compartment easily holds four, 9oz bottles with the thermal pack fitting between them. The smaller compartment will carry up to six, standard size jars of baby food with room for utensils.

(like a girl in my class at school)3. This......uh......thing, is totally 0% educational. Who could stand to buy such a thing for their daughter?I wouldn't recommend this doll to anybody, espicially not anyone under 11 years old. This is the type of doll that teaches kids the exact same oppasite of who their parents want them to be. It also teaches kids OTHER things. I won't even think about disscussing them.

The writer never should have written this book; it isn't even a real thriller because NOTHING HAPPENS! The only thing that even accounts for a thriller in this book is the reactions of fear from Elizabeth, Jessica, and Lila. Their fears are real, so that's why this book even got a single star. The rest was garbage.It was all a lead up to nothing! Everyone lived, no one died. Deliberate misleading from the back panel of the book as well as the story text.

Utterly disappointing and most definitely the worst one in the series (I thought)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, and Disapointing","review":"This book started out slow in the begining, but it really started moving fast once Lila's party got started.

It's a good value, saving you $9 over the cost of purchasing both separately. And the packaging for the Holy Grail discs is especially nice (it includes the script of the movie in paperback format, and a few other goodies).If you're a Python fan, this is a terrific value.

I understand the background history is of utmost importance but she jumps back and forth and many times I have to go back to find dates for the time she is talking about. Not sure I will be able to make it though this book. I've been to China 6 times, Taiwan two times and have a historical background but it hasn't helped much with this book.Fascinating subject matter however.

As I read this account I feel sorry for the fact that he cannot account his story accurately. I saw his fights and also watched him train. He was not an outstanding fighter because he continued to make excuses of which is evident in his book.

I found the book's section on crocodilians (my main interest) to be lacking. Unfortunately, the book was the most expensive of any, on crocodilians I've purchased, and provided probably the least information. The author's source of information on crocodilians appears to have been limited to specimens kept in zoos, and even that was not based on first-hand experience. The author's description of crocodilians is general, at best, and in some instances erroneous.

While this may not be priced along the lines of l'oreal color vive, it also is not expensive for a SALON product. Plus, if you think about what you spend to have your hair colored, highlighted, lowlighted, or any other treatment, spending a little bit more money on a hair care product which extends the life of your color is a small price to pay to decrease how often you have to have your color done. Overall, I think it is absolutely worth the money. Used with the shampoo, your hair will be light, shiney, soft, and your color will look fabulous.

It is extremely poorly made like most toys nowadays. Anytime you move the vehicle something falls off. The hinges are not durable and fall off constantly and with putting them back on all the time they are wearing down and breaking off already. There are lots of little pieces that easily will get lost. Some of the pieces of the vehicle should have been built directly onto the vehcile rather then having the ability to pop on and off.

But, this product is so cheap! I can't believe they get away with it and that people actually pay for it. It was so frustrating for my daughter because the doors kept coming off and the sofa that folds out would not work properly. It really interfered with being able to play with it at all. Furthermore, I was a little uncomfortable with the nature of it. Why can't it be a camper or something less sexualized? A party van with a hot tub and wine glasses?! That seems a little inappropriate and not exactly what we should be teaching our children.

Some of the details were nice - like the kitchen area and the bathroom but it was hard for my daughter to enjoy this because she was constantly asking us to help her fix it.

But the thought that I have lost my copy of this book brings tears to my eyes.Turnbull has created a series of stories about a quiet town in the hills of Pennsylvania, at the turn of the century. You are transported to a time when cars are a novelty, when church was sweet, and a woman who could swim was slightly scandalous.This was my favorite summer read, from the first time I completed a Readers Digest condensed version. It has mystery, excitement, gossip, romance, and the development of characters that touch your heart. Every girl should read this book before they venture into teen-hood. Every woman should read it, to be reminded that love can, indeed, come in a variety of ways. And each way is valid, beautiful, and lasting.The prose is rich, and highest quality. Its quality literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy Album Cover Doomed this Metal Masterpeice","review":"I agree with the other reviewers on this one, this is an un-noticed metal masterpiece; front-to-back. You can tell these guys (Ronnie Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Vinnie Apice) got together with one thing in mind...make a great, thought-provoking, complex, metal barn-burner that fans would like better than their previous high-point; \\"Heaven and Hell\\". In my opinion, this is musically as good or better than \\"H&H;\\" and definietly better than \\"Mob Rules\\".How did this album go so un-noticed? I don't know, maybe it was the absolutely stupid, and un-marketable artwork. It looks like they went to the local grade-school at the last minute and asked for volunteers to make a Black Sabbath CD cover. I had a difficult time sharing this CD with my friends because of the embarrasing cover! :0)That said; we all know what REALLY matters is the music, so buy it and you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album! Dio rocks!","review":"This album posesses a modern sound which is fast and high tech. That coupled with Dio's hard core rock voice, which I might add, sounds a lot better these days. After All is truly remarkable in its insight, and its innovative mix of the minor/major chords, and Time Machine is deadly fast. Those two songs make the album worth buying despite a few lackluster tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only it had lasted","review":"After mediocre and poor albums fronted by Tony Martin, Dehumaizer was a breath of fresh air. You could just see the mighty Sabbath Beast coming up through the ground ready to conquer again. Dio, Tony, Geezer, and Vinnie put together a steller album that destroyed anything Sabbath had done since Born Again.Songs like Computer God, Time Machine, and TV Crimes, are a punch in the face that will rock your world. However, my favorite song by far is 'I'. Whenever I hear it I want to tear down walls and beat the hell out of anything I'm near.I saw the Dehumanizer Tour in Tampa with Testament opening. Sabbath put on one of the best shows I had ever seen them do. Dio's writing and singing skills fit Sabbath like a glove. Unfortunately, egos surfaced again and the mighty reunion did not last.

At the time I was hoping for a heaven and hell type of release but this one worked well enough. \\"time machine' is a stand out on this one.

It is all Wrapped up in one big package Dio's vocals, Iommi's guitars, butler's bass and Appice's drumming.

THis CD really has its momentos, but they are very feel if you consider the capabilities of Iommi and Butler."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief return to form for sabbath","review":"On this album, Dio and Geezer Butler briefly return to the fold, resulting in Sabbath's best album in ten years. \\"Time Machine\\" and \\"TV Crimes\\" both rip like \\"Neon Knights\\" did. \\"After All (The Dead)\\" and \\"Sins of the Father\\" are good, plodding epics similar to \\"Heaven and Hell\\". Lyrics, as predicted by the album title, tackle the dehumanization of society through technology. Nothing particularly brilliant or original here, but solid stuff from expert veterans. Too bad, that in the midst of Seattle mania, the album stiffed commercially."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for the vinyl version","review":"Dehumanizer is easily a four star record but this is a review of the newly released vinyl version. This is a prime example of how NOT to release a vinyl version of an album. This is absolutely terrible. No gatefold. No liner notes. No nothing. It's not even re-mastered! I got it on vinyl hoping that it would sound warmer but it still has the same stale, surgical sounding production as the original '92 version. I can't vouch for the re-mastered version of the CD but this is a very disappointing product coming from a label that prides themselves on giving vinyl the proper respect and treatment it's due. Rhino should hang their collective heads in shame, seriously. Conversely the recently released \`H&H - The Devil You Know' vinyl version is incredible. Everything a collector yearns for and more. 180g vinyl. Gatefold. Poster! AND laser etching on side four! The only thing it was missing was a personally greeting from all the band members, lol. This is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the great Dio-Iommi-Butler songwriting?","review":"I enjoyed most of the Ozzy years in Sabbath & can find a few songs from every album that were great. I thought the Dio years (80-83) took it to a whole other level. Great melodic songwriting and less \\"dark\\" songs, but unmistakeably Sabbath with the great Iommi riffs and guitar melodies. I bought this one w/out ever hearing it hoping it was Heaven & Hell or Mob Rule and boy was it not! Terrible songwriting, dark dimented vocals and not nearly as full of sound as the band had from say Never Say Die up through Live Evil. I think Dio lost his songwriting knack & Iommi & Butler didn't pull up the slack. This is the heaviest, darkest and most uninteresting songwriting I have ever heard from Sabbath and it doesn't do anything for me. I traded my copy back. I did catch this tour & I thought it was great with the exception of the material from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"this is the most blatantly awful piece of crap to soil the black sabbath name. the only halfway decent release since ozzy left the group was heaven and hell, but this takes the cake as their worst, with no redeeming points."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT NEEDS COURAGE TO KNOW WHEN TO STOP.","review":"It needs courage to know when to stop. Not stop music, because this is impossible for someone who love it so much as TOny Iommi. But to stop SABBATH while the legend was still strong. TOny Iommi, just he, the father \\"of the child\\", destroyed almost all credibility SABBATH had. He released e lot of rotten albuns, each one featuring a different line-up, each one a deception to real fans. He should have stopped after \\"MOB RULES\\", because the line-up with Dio was the last chance, really. He says he tried to go as a solo-artist in \\"SEVENTH STAR\\", but the record companie didn't want that. Be he should have tried to go solo again, lefting behind forever and uncasthed the saintly name of \\"BLACK SABBATH\\". THis Dehumanizer is a cheap try to go back to the glory days of DIo, but it failed miserably, as all other records."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst For the Band","review":"This is simply the worst album the band could have put together. A reunion of Iommi, Butler, Dio, and Appice....it just plain sucks.Interestingly enough, this particular lineup lasts just this one album, making one wonder whether everyone had their heart into the album as a whole? The riff work from Iommi is quite stiff in this, not at all what he exhibits previously or after this album. RJD comes up with some of the worst lyrics to date for his capabilities. He does better with latter solo efforts, as well as his earlier efforts with Black Sabbath. Furthermore, RJD's vocal work is hardly awe-inspiring - again, he does better on his later solo work, early solo work, and his earlier Black Sabbath albums. Really one of the worst albums they've put together, IMHO, and one to avoid at all costs.Now, if you're a Sabbath or RJD collector, its obviously a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are they trying to prove?","review":"To give this album 5 stars you gotta be out of your (musical) mind! This is without doubt the second worse album from Sabbath. If you like \\"Heaven or hell\\" this is not for you, but if you think Dio's \\"Strange highway\\" is a masterpiece, I guess this one will satisfy your twisted taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANNA KNOW WHY ....","review":"I'd like to know why people get so angry when someone says that the only good Black Sabbath was that with Ozzy. THey say this is prejudice, hard-mind, etc. Well, let's see. Can someone figure QUEEN without Freddie Mercury. answer: no, so they quit. Can someone figure AC/DC without Angus Young, even being Malcolm the main songwriter? No. Can someone figure IRON MAIDEN without Steev Harris ? No. So, Black Sabbath ceased to exist when Ozzy left, even being Iomi the main songwriter. With Dio, they at least had a respectable replacement and still a lot of crative genius in Iommi and Butler. But, after that, they finished forever, and each new album bringing the name \\"SABBATH\\" in the front cover helped to destroy the myth. Sad. This is the simple truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"The little man from India should shut up.","review":"\\"Sabbath Stone\\" is an alias of a little man in India who writes barely articulate reviews and expects us Americans to take them seriously.

In my opinion, it's their best with Ronnie James Dio. It's even better than Heaven and Hell & Mob Rules. I'd recommend getting it. They've changed a lot from their debut and here, their albums always sound original and don't sound like anything they did in the past. They've had blues in their music at first and went a heavier direction on Master of Reality and Vol 4. They had some more melodic albums like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and added synthesizer into their music. This is quite a bit different than their first 2 with Ronnie James Dio. They changed and went a heavier direction, it's also their heaviest album to date. This isn't just the best of the Dio-era, it's one of the best Black Sabbath albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective by design","review":"Won't install without flash.

These type of pensions require that I subtract a portion of her pension based on how long she had received her pension, her age, and other factors. Part of her pension would be taxed and part of it wouldn't. All the information I needed was provided.

One became so attached he even brought it to his sleeping area and slept with it!!The only negative (and hence why I give it four instead of five stars) is that the product could have been made a little more durable as the cats really chew and claw it - hence a more durable build material should have been used (i.e., tougher, fabric base)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple/works","review":"Bought this for a Cat Lady friend.

Now she carries it all around the house and loves playing with it.

The songs start to get more up beat with the self titled song \\"Bad Company\\" and continue with \\"Rock \`N' Roll Fantasy\\".This album is very uplifting and can improve someone's day instantly.

Bogart, in one of his first starring roles, is a ringer as the rotten Martin, though a key scene with his disapproving mother shows a vulnerable side, too. McCrea and Sidney carry their weight as the moral heart of Wyler's mean streets, and teen actor Halop plays ragamuffin gang leader Tommy with lots of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead End: Surprisingly Good Film","review":"I was surprised at how good the film Dead End was.

But the worst thing about it, is the presence of those annoying Dead End Kids. Also, much of the acting in this film is so hammy and overblown melodramatic; you can almost smell the syrup dripping from the screen.(Some is even plain bad, like the woman playing Bogey's estranged mom.)

However, with 66 to 70 grams of fat in the entire recipe, the fat grams per serving would be 10 to 11 grams. Quite a difference!Also, the chicken & grapefruit stir fry would have at least 6 grams of fat per serving rather than the 3 grams stated in the book.

During the repair time someone else had their same tv go one the blink for the same problem. The salesman I bought the tv from felt this was a factory defect common to this tv. The JVC people I talked to never returned my calls even though they said they would within 48 hours. JVC also accused me of possibly abusing the tv. Bad tv.Bad service.

The Carl Boehm character was so listless that I could hardly believe he was a killer. The picture just seemed to drag for me.The DVD does have some nice features though even if the aspect ratio is faulty.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera Shy...","review":"Mark (Carl Boehm) is a socially-awkward young man. He's a quiet, seemingly innocent film-maker who is more boy than man. No one would ever suspect that Mark has a problem, well, many deep-seated problems. No one would ever suspect him as a murderer. Mark, like Norman Bates, is so mild-mannered as to float right below the radar. There is no suspicion of him as the perpetrator of a series of grisly homicides. PEEPING TOM is the story of a father's twisted experiments on his own son, and the resulting psychopathy in the offspring. Very disturbing for its time (1960), TOM takes a voyeuristic filming approach, involving the viewer in Marc's crimes. While not so shocking today, it still manages to pose some questions about the relationship between movies and their audience. Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It put me to sleep","review":"This movie is about a guy who carries a camera with him everywhere he goes. He starts to kill people with the end of his camera, the camera has a little knife attached to it. He also has some unresolved childhood issues.I tried watching this 3 times and everytime I tried I fell asleep within the first 25 min. Finally forced myself to watch the whole thing and it was hard to make it through.The characters are like walking zombies. The classical music playing during the 'murder' scenes is annoying and not scary. In fact theres almost continuous classical/piano music playing throughout the whole movie.Very boring actors, uninteresting characters, I was barely able to finish watching this. If youre interested in watching a guy take a camera in and out of his bag 20 times along with boring English dialogue and very lackluster suspense... watch it.. if not, dont even bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true breakthrough!","review":"Michael Powell made more than a movie, he opened the troubled mind and troubled soul of a disturbed man who suffered in his childhood extreme abuses from his father played this role by the director himself.The use of the camera and the script opened the gate to a new world of young directors who still are influenced by this film forty four years after.This film is a cult movie and undoubtedly a film ahead its own time .Powell reminds us that Peeping Tom are us too, the viewers every time we seat in front of the screen.Psycho would come after, but this was the pioneer expression of a new genre of horror.And that's why about its relevant place in the brittish cinema.Do you need another advise for buying this landmark film?Carl Boehm made an intimate and credible portrait in this difficult and even demanding role ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooring!","review":"Too bad I can't give this movie something lower than one star, because it wasn't even worth that.

If you haven't heard this band's Beach Boys-like vocal harmonizations, you will be shocked at the likeness. The performance is full of energy and captures well the live atmosphere in which it was recorded. I am amazed at the quality of the sound engineering of this live recording. The highs are crisp, the bass deep and taught, and the dynamic range astounding - a sure test of your audio system's capabilities! It's as close as you can get to actually being there!

The book's theology flows out of Holy Scripture, the Divine Lirturgy (both East and West) and Christian tradition. The result is that one learns not only about Holy Communion but about God Himself and His intention for His children (a little Christian history too). A confession: I'm not even Catholic; I'm Greek Orthodox. But I have found Mr. Clark's previous books to be thought provoking, so I gave this book - even thought it's addressed to Catholics - a try and was not disappointed. Great scholarship and a thoughtful presentation!

I read it right after finishing Bending God which I LOVED! I expected Eric Pepin to introduce the reader into te begining of awakening. He does not, This book is more a collection of simple allegories. He uses a rhetorical strategy of extending a metaphor through an entire narrative. This book is a collection of the authors philosophies. He goes as far as explaining the creation of God. I was personally very disappointed. After reading all of the reviews I can only imagine his students at Higher Balance flooded the internet with his praises.

If this book is for beginners in the spiritual field then this is okay but for others there is nothing new. Go and do a Vipassana Meditation retreat which is free in most countries in the world. You will experience profound results much more potent than any that I have experienced on any of the Higher Balance programs.

It is a blatant sales pitch for Mr.Pepin's at home systems for sale. It is full of repetitive comments with no substance.

On page 24 it states: It (The Navigator) can help you find a path among the experiences in your life and will lead, at last, into an awakened state of consciousness.\\" The book is titled \\"The Handbook of the Navigator\\" which leads one to believe that it is going to teach or convey knowledge or steps to achieve a higher state of consciousness; it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handbook of the Navigator","review":"Like all of Mr. Pepin's books an easy read.

It is nothing but an advertisement, cleverly disguised as a book that is supposed to lead you somewhere.

There are so very many books that can teach you about the Universe, meditation, \\"waking up,\\" and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Handbook of the Navigator","review":"This book left me wanting. But I suppose that was the purpose, once you visit the website and find the information you didn't get from the book is contained on a series of CD's which you have to purchase at X hundreds of dollars. which leaves me sceptical as usual about those people who profess to be helping humanity on their spiritual development for a price.However, that aside Eric J. Pepin has written a good guidebook for the novice to get to the heart of the matter. using simple terminology to describe deeper philosophical and spiritual teachings. more advanced students could also benefit from this different perspective.Like many self help books in this field, it helps you get to the door but not through it. Though it has the possibility of getting you to the door much quicker and easier than most, and that is probably where the value of this book really lies.

If you have stalled on your metaphysical journey, this is the spark to get the fire going again!!!Just keep an open mind while reading it because it is different from what most teach.

Both are covered in mind-numbing detail, while personal interactions and characterization get generally short shrift. Will the protagonist's cutting-edge AI project be shunted aside by corporate bigwigs in favor of a rival formulation that is very similar, but focuses on a higher level of the brain? Will the protagonist wind up trapped in a dead-end career path instead of making millions? If these kinds of questions fascinate you, you've come to the right place.

I am VERY suspicious this is collusion with Microsoft and Gainskeeper which, for #49.95 a year (less than 100 trades - $149 for more), would enable this import.

I purchased it this year expecting that it would continue to have that feature. When I couldn't figure out how to do it, I call Fidelity and they gave me the bad news. Still not convinced, I wrote an email to TaxCut (H & R Block) customer support and they wrote back saying that I would have to do it manually. They didn't even apologize. Now I am stuck having to enter 27 pages of stock and mutual fund transactions by hand or trash everything I have already done and buy TurboTax and start over.

(Not to mention no value add items about email hoax and Gates' sojourn into buying expensive Da Vinci artifacts)The earlier chapters were all rehash of Harddrive(short history) and anti trust battles as well as notes from his Philip Kahn interviews.

And it shows. His biased negative opinion of Microsoft shows through.Wallace is also not a very good writer.For example, when writing about the actions undertaken by the Justice Department to investigate Microsoft, Wallace documents boring details about which lawyers were involved, what their backgrounds were, etc., and he stretches this section out until it is completely out of place in this book.This is a difficult read because of the bias and poor writing ability of Wallace.<P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly delicious!","review":"This is one of my most favorite truffle products.

This will do nicely for that job. I was concerned about a 4.5\\" knife working well enough. This is not an issue.I have even used it to slice onions and other veggies. Last night I used it to slice the end off of a garden hose! It cut right though the reinforced hose.This will become my 2nd favorite knife in the house. The #1 \\"fav\\" is my kyocera ceramic blade that I have had for several years. Drop that fragile knife and all you have will be nice memories; this Wusthof knife is tuff.Thanks to all who have left feedback. I rely on the feedback when making purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but feels cheap","review":"I can't complain at all about how this knife works. I bought it for slicing tomatoes and bread and it works great. The problem is it just doesn't live up to my expectations of a Wusthof. I have a set of Wusthof Classic knives. When I hold a Classic in one hand and this Serrated in the other, the Serrated just feels cheap. Hard to explain. I like the knife at $15, but $30 is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Inorganic Arsenic","review":"Consumer Reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market. I like these crackers, but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Snacks","review":"A friend of mine gave a pack of Suzie (sesame version) and I liked it a lot. I never even heard of Suzie's Thin Cakes so I went on Amazon and read great reviews. Since I devoured the first pack, I decided to order 12 of the Puffed Brown Rice Crackers to deliver to my office.I eat about 3 crackers (54 calories) as a healthy alternative to sugary snacks. It's really good with a thin layer of Almond Butter or just a squeeze of honey. Sometimes I have it for lunch - avocado and tuna salad over the crackers. It feels me up and keeps my waist line under control.I agree with other reviews regarding the packaging - it's hard to not crumble or break the crackers when removing from the package. It's tightly assembled with a flimsy plastic wrap.Overall, great alternative for the 3 o'clock slump. I think I'll order the sesame version next time to mix it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a warmer than toaster","review":"This has to be by far the worst toaster ever built. With nearly half the heating elements of other toasters (including cheaper versions) this toaster takes 5 minutes to toast bread, 9 minutes to toast a bagel, and I am not brave enough to stick around and warm something frozen. It is a shame too, because this model has nice features such as the auto toast holders that keeps the toast in the middle. The dials have buttons to release the toast as well, but all for not as you will never find a need to pop the toast early with this machine. It will cost you more to rent space to this unit that it is worth. Better luck next time Toastmaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this model twice.

In comparision with some other videos, this is definitely the one to chose. It presents almost the same information as \\"Cracking the Maya Code - NOVA\\", only with a few more minutes, and a much more comprehensive study than \\"Mystery of the Maya\\", by detailing how the symbols were created and what they mean, both in written and sponken ways, without mentioning it covers the basic information, such as which were the grather cities, religion, maths and te decline of the mayan civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Attractive Documentary","review":"This film shows how the linguists decoded Mayan records; what they guessed with what clues. It does not emphasize how 'mysterious' the Maya civilization was. It does not exaggerate 'mystique' of Maya records.

These four women have been long time contributors to Sigur Ros, and indeed, if you do enjoy the music of Sigur Ros, you most certainly will enjoy this album. All of the four songs on this EP are hauntingly beautiful with sounds from strings, harp, xylophone, and an electronic mix. I am interested in what this group might sound like with vocals, and so I have given a rating of four stars. The music is wonderful, and I expect this group to grow and develop in great ways. Just know that if you purchase this CD, there are differences from Sigur Ros: no vocals, and a more feminine/lighter sound to the music. Again, Amina impressed me greatly enough that I went ahead and bought this EP after their performance. Hopefully there will be a full length CD coming out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"great action","review":"the series is a great series only to the end i was dissapointed ,but if they had ended it i wanted their would not be a season 3"},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like anime fighting this is it","review":"great anime just wish that the art should have been more like the first season but that a small part"},{"rating":"2","title":"intense","review":"This anime is hella tight worth watching feels like a payper view event all kind of mixed martial art styles pick this one up if u like bad ass fight scenes and raw fighting?"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a page turner","review":"I have been waiting to get this book on kindle and certainly wasn't disappointed.

Also if you are interested in teen novels and a little bit of romance. I think this author is amazing, she has a great writing stratigie that makes me picture every thing i am reading in my head, i also think she is very funy. The story starts out as a typical \\"Clique\\" book. Massie and her friends Claire, Dylon, Kirsten, and Alicia are still living their fabulus life. They go to a camp with their grade and boys from a near school. All of the girls are hoping too find and reattract their boys.

Much of it is in lousy quality video and extremely poor audio. Some of the subtitling is displayed so fast that I had to put my VCR into slow-mo to read it. I thought it would be an engaging story of an addicted pop star but I found it hard to follow and uncompelling. Just because she did drugs and made it with every rock star and producer she met doesn't make her talented. She was beautiful once, yes, but later turned to heroin and became quite decrepit. Her music was mostly uninteresting to me. Some things about Lou Reed and Jim Morrison were interesting but overall the documentry was poorly produced. I guess you'll love it or hate it.

It's not worth much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don&#65533;t waste your time.","review":"Came to this film, with a few good recommendations, but no knowledge at all about the woman, Christa Paffgen (NICO) about whom this documentary is based.NICO, a young German woman, model, created an image in conjunction with Andy Warhol and his group as an asexual junkie. As a biography, the film is weak, short on information, with a limited and jaded perspective.As a tribute, it fails miserably. I'm still uncertain where ICON fits in the whole picture aside from looking good in the title. There is little substance in the film to suggest she \`earned' any sort of recognition, stature, or approval from anyone but miscreants and lost souls. From my vantagepoint her life seems little different than many misguided college youth who gave up their lives to confusion and drugs, far too early. It's a tragic tale, I guess, but far from distinctive.The whole deal is some sort of inside joke and I sit outside, unfortunately--maybe it all got lost in the translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice one, Nico!","review":"\\"Nico Icon\\" is a powerful documentary which illuminates some of the excesses and indulgences of the clique which emerged from Andy Warhol's Factory in the '60s and '70s and included the group, Velvet Underground. Nico's descent from beautiful bimbo to middle-aged junkie is traced through her relationships with men such as Alain Delon (the father of her son, Ari) and Jim Morrison. The most memorable feature of Nico's otherwise somewhat dubious talent is the performance of her haunting songs. John Cale's song (with his extraordinary piano accompaniment), \\"Frozen Boundaries\\" that concludes the video is also worthy of mention.

Sherri's books have always stood out in this way because they are more often than not beautiful and scintillating stories, which are written quite well. Fetish is no exception to this rule. It happens to be my favorite of her books to date, and I eagerly await her second foray into the world of the vampire.My only complaint with this story is it's similarity to Jemima J, and other such books wherein the \\"rubenesque\\" heroine must lose weight to become the perfect mate for the hero, despite the fact that he seems to love her with the weight.All in all, a great read for the single gal or a couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful text about the theory of computation.","review":"It taught me how to think about the theory of computation.

Emily Lloyd is a revelation. That said, the picture is 90 minutes of bravura film making. Unfortunately the movie is two and one half hours long. The final hour is shockingly bad. Poorly written and wildly implausable the last 60 minutes of this effort fail miserably. Still the first two thirds is quite good. The chapter breaks are wonderful. An interesting failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing","review":"First 30 minutes of this movie really bored me to death. I expected more from it just because a lot of critics agreed that this is a good movie. Even siskel and ebert gave this movie two thumbs up. This movie is all about a woman who was so in love with her husband. But, what I think is, she was obsessed with him. She thinks that she was trying her best to make her husband happy. She prayed every time and every time she would talk to herself and pretend to be god. I mean.....give me a break.....she needs more life! I think that she should have been the one who got paralyzed instead of her husband. I think you guys need to rent this video first before even buying it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stupid movie","review":"This is a ridiculous movie. Unless Bess's IQ is less than 50, otherwise in the real world who will follow the evil and dying husband to do such stupid thing. There is nothing in the movie worth to watch.Besides 'STUPID', I couldn't findmore appropriate word to describe it. STUPID!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen...","review":"I found this movie to be absolutely apolling. If I could give it zero stars, I would have. The whole thing reminded me of some cheap porno video that was shot by an amateur. It didn't help that this video was shown in a classroom setting, making me even more uncomfortable. The graphic sexual scenes are something that you'd rather watch by yourself, as opposed to a highly populated setting. I was deeply disturbed by being forced to watch this in class and being a devout Catholic, there is no way I can recommend this video to anybody. Stay away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Spectacular!!!","review":"I caught this film late at night on the Independent Film Channel. I did not intend to watch the entire movie, but I got hooked at once. The power of Jan & Bess's love simply radiated throughout the entire movie, something that I never questioned, despite the dismal way the movie ended. The things that we do for love can sometimes cause us more pain than happiness, and this movie is a true testament of that sentiment. Jan and Bess are two remarkable characters - Emily Watson was simply brilliant! Her acting in this movie was absolutely astonishing! It is true that this movie may be difficult for some people to watch - there is explicit sex and sexual violence in the movie so it's definitely not for children. But if you can get past any those blocks, this movie is an absolute gem, one you won't forget for a VERY long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking the Waves","review":"Von Trier's disturbing, fiercely unconventional \\"Waves\\" features the magnificent British actress Emily Watson in a daringly masochistic role no Hollywood starlet would have touched. With her fearless incarnation of the childlike, ever-suffering Bess, who comes to believe that God's plan is for her to be a tramp, Von Trier wrings heartbreak and tragedy from her brutal encounters with Calvinist locals and roughneck seamen. And just when you're not sure how much more Bess (or you) can bear, he introduces a shockingly beautiful epiphany that will steal your breath. The Oscar-nominated \\"Waves\\" might be tough-going for some, but its ingenious camerawork and spiritual catharsis is worth diving in for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...","review":"This film does NOT endorse what it depicts. Obviously, the memebers of the church are misguided, in fact a great deal of the film points that out. But the film is not about them, it is about Bess, and about her love for God and God's love for her. What happens to her in the movie is not God's torture of her, it is human free will being exercised on a pure spirit, and the beauty is how her spirit always remains pure. That is why God loves Bess. God does not sugarcoat the world, and all who wish to follow him go through trials. Bess made it through those trials, and this is, as such, a TRUE CHRISTIAN FILM.Not to mention it is cinematically the best film I have ever seen, as Heilman says, it is transcends words and descriptions. Do not let any review scare you away, if you don't like graphic sex turn it off, but this is a film about the love God has for all the how beautiful a pure spirit is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Eh I couldnt even get past the first half of the film. Too much sex for me. Im sure it got better though, I mean almost everyone who reviewed it loved it. But for me I couldnt get into it. Not as good as Dancer in the Dark, which had me in sobs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking the Bladder","review":"First off, this film is about an hour too long. It also could not make up its mind as to whether it wanted to be a long dull romance like \\"The English Patient,\\" or something softcore they show on Cinemax. I found Watson's character so annoying, I breathed a sigh of relief when she was not onscreen, which was not often. Von Trier's documentary approach is not interesting, just stomach churning...and you thought \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" was jumpy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"god blesses all you sinners","review":"Yes all devout Christians beware this film it may well shatter your illusions, throw another book on the pyre. The all-loving infallible god who slew the first born and condemned achievement of his beloved children at the tower of Babel.

Considering the intimacy of your relationship tell him i said Hi when you next converse.P.s. oh and err.... don't eat from that tree"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Unberable Than 'Dancer'","review":"'Breaking the Waves' is even more unberable than 'Dancer in the Dark'. Once again Lars Van Trier feels he must shake the camera ALL THE TIME!! Why does this man insist on making the audience dizzy? In this film two people wed against the objection of some authority figures. The characters talk in soft voices and it is very difficult to follow what is going on, even though the story is very simple. The girl's lover breaks his neck during work. He tells her to carry out his sick fantasies. There you have it folk, that's basically the story. At least in 'Dancer' they had singing, but if you want to waste 2 1/2 hours of your life feeling dizzy and bored out of your skulls, 'Breaking' is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful acting, terrible plot","review":"There is no doubt that Emily Watson is a very talented actress, and she deserved her Oscar nomination for her performance in this film. I really liked the \\"look\\" of this film - realistic, gritty, very beautiful scenery. The breaks inbetween scenes are also wonderful to watch.However, the story blows chunks, which disappointed me. It's possible to deconstruct anything presented as \\"art\\" as being somehow \\"deep\\" and meaningful.But give me a break. This is film school angst rearing its immature head. I hope that we see the talented people who created this movie grow into a willingness to explore human nature instead of being stuck in pointless 'Sturm & Drang'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking the Waves","review":"Lars Von Trier is the world's greatest living director and Breaking the Waves is by far his best film. The best scene is when the young guy at the wedding sits next to the old guy and chugs the brew. The old guy then chugs a glass of water. The young guy crushes the aluminum beer can with his hand, only to then witness the old man shatter his water glass. That scene is remarkable. Most American peasants won't get Breaking the Waves, but Lars does not care. He mocks you as you scratch your head and wonder what it is all about. He pities your narrow view of the world and ignorance of film. Do your pathetic selves a favor and watch Breaking The Waves. The day you see it will be the first day of the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen.","review":"If you like 'Breaking the Waves' you'll probably like 'Naked,' the two worst movies I've ever seen in my life. As far as I'm concerned the movie is based on a crude cliche - 'a f*$king miracle.' About a husband and wife, when the husband becomes ill his wife, a half-wit, follows up on a suggestion by her husband to find a lover and allows herself to be raped and murdered by two men thinking by doing this she will miraculously save her husbands life and miracle of miracles as she dies the husband is brought back to health. If you watch the movie you'll know what I mean about the cliche. It isn't worth the time, money, or effort from any perspective. It's just plain vile, assinine and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing performance, pity about the script","review":"There is no question that Emily Watson gives an amazing performance in \\"Breaking the Waves.\\" Unfortunatly, it is this performance that led many to overlook the fact that the script is unbearably pretentious, remarkably inplausible, and tremendously self indulgent. 2 and a half hours mof watching a woman bed hop and humilate herslef until the inevitiable and very predictable conclusion. Full of art house cliches, \\"Breaking the Waves\\" can be appreciated only for bringing Emily Watson to the world's attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a prude...","review":"...but I found this film to be nothing more than a pseudo-arthouse exercise in the seemingly ever-popular male preoccupation with depictions of the degradation of women. 'Breaking the Waves' is a near-textbook example of what's meant by the term 'cultural/intellectual pornography', and I don't intend that for a compliment. Von Trier's work has always gotten a relatively cool reception from me, I have to admit--but I found this film to be actually and actively repellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably DREADFUL!","review":"Are you a sadist? Then you'll love this film! Emily Watson is a wonderful actress whose talents are totally wasted in this interminable orgy of bathos and pretension. By far one of the most pointlessly depressing films I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"gravity and grace","review":"200 adjectives. put them in a review. cry your eyes out. buy a camera. looks easy don't it? don't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably DREADFUL!!!!","review":"This movie is FOR SADISTS ONLY. From the beginning, you know that the central character is hopelessly doomed, and you spend almost 3 hours just watching her fall apart. It's so obvious throughout that she doesn't have an ice cube's chance in hell, and the film ponderously proves you right. I could not muster any sympathy at all for such a helpless, hapless, and totally idiotic character. The film is like one continuous, monochromatic downhill slide, with a puzzlingly \\"upbeat\\" (by comparison) or \\"inspiring\\" ending which is hilariously inane. Can be summed up thus: an idiotically naive, half-retarded woman falls blindly religiously in love with an undeserving lout and basically martyrs herself for him. Really difficult to watch...plus very pretentiously \\"artsy,\\" self-indulgent and snail-paced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assign to pretentious drivel.","review":"Yawn, yawn, yawn. Yet another film a-plenty with pretendy-Highlanders portrayed as drunken, sex-starved, violent, religious maniacs who need to be taught by liberal trendies and outsiders what humanity is. The author's artschool-level interpretation of biblical themes is risible.Myself, coming from the islands, a place where neighbours take an interest and care for each other's well-being, where both Presbyterian ministers and Catholic priests do the rounds of the house-bound and dying, this film is an enormous insult to the values that they hold. Can anybody believe that a minister would step over the body of a dying mentally-handicapped young woman to get into his church? If you hold this kind of prejudice, then you'll enjoy this film.What bitter memories or prejudices provoked the author hold to write such a text? Unless you are interested in minority- or Christian-bashing, avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see the Artistry Now let me Barf!","review":"As a fairly serious cineast, I am most patient with many films. I sat through over 2 hours of this movie hoping that it would find a way to remedy its illogical plot. If this were a comedy, I would probably be able to suspend my disbelief longer. But comedy this certainly is not! Between the documentary-like camera handling (which leaves you dizzy) and the implausible premise (Bess' husband is paralyzed neck down and all he can think of is getting his wife laid by someone else? Hello?!?!?) I don't know who is dumber, Bess or her husband! Don't waste your time with this film unless you really are into a die-hard \\"art to the death\\" fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psevdo intelectual masochistic bullsheet","review":"This movie was recommended by most of the critics. And unfortunately I with my wife spend 3 hours watching this masochistic movie. This is pretend to be a love story, but really it shows deep abuse of the half crazy pretty women. If you like us don't like when somebody torture someone stay away from this movie. What is most amazed me is the last scene. Why does her husband deserve such a really Christian sacrifice? What is it? Triumph to Christianity? Does women need to sacrifice herself for her macho?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, Pointless","review":"I usually stick to just reviewing what I like, but the distance between how some people speak of this film, and the reality of the movie itself, is so great that I feel compelled to chime in.It's incoherent and pointless. It's just a sick Sirk-like (as in Douglas Sirk) melodrama that changes tone somewhere in the middle, as the director apparently likes to do. It's adds up to nothing and it seems rather obvious that this writer/director wouldn't have it any other way - he makes smirking little facsimilies of art products, not actual art products. This is like a bad parody of Fassbinder's take on Sirk's movies.The lead actors are great, and Von Trier is technically just fine as a screenwriter and as a director. But don't be fooled into thinking that he's furthering cinema in some way with movies like this. He's just yanking chains and the only personal expression going on here is him laughing at the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cinematic hoax","review":"This film is astonishing only in its depths to which it sunk and the amount of sophistry heaped on top to make \\"artsy\\". The overdone hysterics of the acting (notably Emily Watson's) and cinema verite style mask what essentially is a ridiculously contrived and supremely manipulative bit of exploitation.\\"Breaking the Waves\\" clocks in at 2.5 hours of watching a mentally ill woman get increasingly abused by her church elders (a convenient bit of typical left-wing Euro anti-religiousity), her family and eventually her husband as she goes from one outrageous ordeal to another. Standard misogynistic nihilism that pretends to be a love story. Or about faith. But in reality, it's predictable, overrated trash, and ranks as the worst film I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emily!","review":"Emily Watson give an astonishing performance in this film. She deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for it, and it justifiably launched her film career.

It was an absolutely terrible film; slow-moving, boring, and totally unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should have been nominated for best picture of 1996.","review":"The nominees should have been Fargo, Breaking the Waves, English Patient, Jerry Maguire, and Secrets & Lies. Fargo should of won but this epic film was a close second. If your one of those people that is serious about movies you have to see this. It's emotionally wrenching and very harsh at times. But it's all worth it. The performance by Emily Watson earned a well deserved oscar nomination (Frances McDormand won for Fargo, a good choice but Watson was clearly better in a more difficult role). I also loved the documentary style cinematography. A real winner all around and a must see film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, and more boring","review":"Easily my most disappointing Trance purchase of the year.

Disc 2 is a little bit more laidback, but still has some hard beats and epic build ups. I am a huge fan of Tiesto, Van Buuren, Corsten, Van Dyk etc and this album is better than ANYTHING those guys have put out. Any fan of trance needs this cd!

Water leaks from the resevoir down the handle, the lid doesn't stay on when carrying or pouring, and the spout inevitably drips when pouring. And, when I contacted Brita to let them know I was unhappy with the design, they replied with a form letter that doesn't address any of the issues I raised.

I've seen the way Brita filters filter water. I know it takes a little time to get the water through the filter, as it should, since it's filtering water and what not. But with this filter, I noticed a small stream of water down the side of the tube the filter is in, as in the water was going around the filter.

I can't imagine how it ever passed quality control, unless they did all their testing without water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Lid Doesn't Fit","review":"Brita used to make really great pitchers and I've used them for years. However, this pitcher in particular is poorly made and doesn't function at all. I had to return four of them; I really wanted them to work, but all of them had major problems. The lid does not fit at all and falls off easily. Also, the handle has two parts, and it kept falling apart. This happened on all of the pitchers I bought. There is also a large gap where the lid opens, so if you fill anywhere near to the top, it comes pouring out. This is poorly designed and none of the pitchers I tried functioned properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible on all accounts","review":"Let's first make a list of what this product should do.1. Filter water.2. Contain filtered water.3. Pour water.Here's why it fails on each of these points:1. It is difficult to get the filter to be seated properly in the pitcher. So, often unfiltered water leaks into the pitcher.2. The unfiltered water section has a small opening that allows water to leak into the handle, then out onto the floor.3. The spout has 2 problems. First, it has a flap that is supposed to swivel open as you pour, allowing water to evenly flow out. It often fails to open, causing water to spill everywhere. Second, the spout does not have a rolled lip, so water frequently runs down the side of the pitcher instead of outward into your glass.Complete waste of money. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita SpaceSaver Lid Doesn't Stay On","review":"We've purchased Brita systems in the past, but the SpaceSaver doesn't stand up to the usual quality of Brita products. The lid doesn't fit properly. It shakes loose with the slightest movement. And there's no way to pour from the pitcher without spilling water everywhere. I wouldn't buy the SpaceSaver again ... it's badly designed. We've had many kitchen accidents with this product . . . and stopped using it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice filtered water escapes with ease, terrible design, don't buy, run away!","review":"Ok, so it does filter water.

Waste of money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep away from it","review":"I had one a few months ago. When I filled in water, the water just passed the filter quickly. I was not sure if the water is filtered. One day, I wanted to clean it. I put it in hot water for about 10 minutes. The pitcher was out of shape and I had to discard it. I believe the pitcher was made from cheap materials. I sent an email to the custom no service of Brita. I got no response. I will not buy Brita products any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Apart in Days","review":"I bought this pitcher thinking it would save me space in our fridge. The lid fell apart within days so whenever we tried to pour water out the llid would fall off. Then the little mouthpiece began falling off.

Oh, it looked nice, and I assumed it would be the same type of quality as the others I've owned......wrong! Nothing like pouring water out of the pitcher and having the lid come off. No matter how hard you try, there is no way to safely secure the lid. We humans are quick at adapting, and in this case adapting means keeping a finger on the lid as you pour. Not the way it should be done. Somebody definitely goofed up with this design. I'm giving it a star because it does do a nice job filtering the water, but because it is so poorly designed, that's all it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Design EVER!","review":"This pitcher is virtually useless. The lid won't stay on at all, the spout leaks profusely when you try to pour, and the white insert on the handle falls off with the slightest bit of pressure.

The water tastes OK, but what good is that if it can't even perform the most basic task...pouring without spilling?!! grrrrrrr"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this pitcher.","review":"I have been using this pitcher for 9 months and I HATE it every single day. The lid will not stay on, no matter what I do. If I wasn't so frugal, I would have already thrown it away. Considering the frustration it gives me every day, my sanity may be worth the twenty bucks it would cost me to replace it. I really, really hate it.

Saran wrap would be a better option than the lid it came with.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't cut it","review":"I picked this up from my local supermarket. It took a lot of convincing to get my father to agree to purchase it. Since my entire credibility was on the line with the respect to the success of this purchase, I turned a blind eye towards the fact that the lid was trash. I thought my unit was just faulty. I am a bit relieved that it's the pitcher that sucks and not me. Now that the filter needs replacing, I am going to look for a whole new pitcher that does work.The water filtration was great, the packaging was just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid = terrible. I mean really, really bad.","review":"What a waste of money. I'm frustrated with every. single. pour. because the entire lid just falls off unless I hold onto it. The spout and handle seem designed to create spills. Yes, it filters water. Yes, it saves space. But you'll never want to use it because of the hassle of the lid. Not to mention that because it's a smaller pitcher, it needs to be refilled more frequently, leading to more spills. I never use the flip top to refill it because half of the time the entire lid comes off when I press the little flip thing. I'm just echoing what everyone else has said, I know, but I felt strongly enough about this to chime in - this thing is no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world were they thinking with this lid!!!?!?!?!?!?!?","review":"This is an abysmal product.

It's easy to fill and fits well in the fridge. The lid, however, is a terrible design. It is warped. I returned the first one I bought, thinking it was just a bad one, but the next one had the same issue. The lid falls off if you look at it wrong. It's hard enough for an adult to use, let alone a child. Luckily, two small pieces of tape cured the lid problem. The spout is also a poor design. If you are trying to pour carefully or just pour a little bit of water you're out of luck. You'll get nothing until the flap lets loose with an initial gush. It works better with the flap removed.I'm no engineer, but I'm pretty sure I could design something as simple as a water jug with a lid that doesn't fall off.

The water tastes better then the chlorinated tap water by leaps and bounds, but the pitcher itself is garbage. Every time I get it out of the refrigerator, refill it or try to pour a glass the top pops off and spills water all over the place. Instead of saving money I had wasted it on this product. Frustrating!!!

The first time I tried to pour I thought it was \\"user error\\" so tried again. And then again - this time over the sink. And every single time the lid fell right off at any attempt to pour - and I was filling it less than half full! I can't even imagine the mess a full pitcher made for the poor souls that made the seemingly logical assumption that a pitcher, any pitcher, would have a secure fitting top.Just as bad, along with the top falling off, the whole filtration insert begins to slide out too, so if by some chance you started pouring and thought \\"oh, caught it!\\", just wait one more second and the whole insert will fall out and you'll have your giant mess again.I honestly thought I must have a defective one and so I came on here to check reviews and see if others had the same 'defect'.

The water sloshes out when you fill it and try to place it back in the fridge or wherever. Worse, when pouring the water the top tends to fall off, and break apart too, so now we have to hold it on there while pouring.The pitcher feels like it would crack if you dropped it or knocked it against the faucet, with sharp edges around the top.We had the same type of brita pitcher before getting this one, I paid the same for it a couple of years ago but the whole thing was much sturdier.

Those are the positives.Negatives--IT LEAKS. It leaks when you fill it, it leaks when you walk to the fridge with it. It leaks when you pourrr. A lot. Even if you are really, really careful. This leaves a small puddle on the floor that you will later A. step in, or B. catch your baby splashing in. Nobody likes stepping in cold water with socks on.The lid just pops off, willy nilly. It doesn't 'click' on in any way...it just sits on top. Relatively ineffective. Not *totally* ineffective...it would keep flies out, but only if they didn't bump it, or look at it funny. Otherwise, just carrying the pitcher can cause water to slosh out past the lid.I've recently discovered the black silt at the bottom. That'd be another negative.I think we're just going to buy a new fridge with a built-in water filter.

The lid won't stay on..it falls off at the slightest movement, the spout cover pops off at the lightest touch and then is horribly difficult to put back on, it leaks when pouring, it leaks through the handle, you can only fill the filtering resevoir halfway to keep it from leaking through the handle and even then you have hold it just so when you move it..or it leaks. I hate this pitcher...it makes me think twice about buying other Brita products. It filters fine, but the other issues with it are just too much to overcome. I love the idea of a space saving/slimline pitcher since I have a small kitchen with limited counter space...but the problems far outweigh the benefit of the space saving (which isn't much really) feature. My recommendation....DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is a waste of your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita Filter Pitcher Review","review":"I'm a nice person and don't complain much, however, I can't believe this water filter pitcher passed inspection. You cannot pour from it with one hand because the lid is just resting on the top- you must hold down the lid with one hand as you pour with the other, and must balance the lid to stay on from the sink to the fridge. When I filled it up and went to put it in my fridge I wondered why it was 'peeing' water all over my floor as I went. Turns out the handle fills with water and comes out the other end. The little filter beads float out of the filter but they never get into the drinking water, so I can deal with that. Conclusion; you can obtain clean good-tasting water from this pitcher- but it is hard work on your end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid Falls Off!","review":"This is my third or fourth Brita pitcher, and they all work fine for filtering water. However, I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this one, as the lid falls off, all the time.

I would not recommend this particular model to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fix for the loose lid-","review":"I like the size and shape of this pitcher. Agreed that the lid design is poor. What I have done to keep the lid secured in place is use a few strips of scotch tape. A couple on each side near the front, and a couple near the rear. Once the filter is in place, the lid doesn't really need to be removed until it's time to change the filter again. Just open the pop-up hatch to add water to the reservoir from the tap. Pour with abandon, the lid will not fall off. Not the most elegant, but simple and working well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid is crap!","review":"I had my old Brita pitcher for over 5 years and decided to get a new one. I bought 3 of these 6 cup pitchers and the lid kept falling off every one of them. The plastic is much weaker and the workmanship is horrible compared to my original Brita.

The filter fits in just like it always has. There are some key differences.BENEFITS--------+ Space Saving Design. The pitcher is tapered unlike the rectangular ones in the past. But it seems to hold less water than the standard Brita pitcher.+ Calendar Dial built into the lid approximately tells you when to change the filter. This is better than the vinyl stickers in the older pitchers.DESIGN FLAW------------ The lip of the lid doesn't sink into the pitcher deep enough. You'll need to use one hand to pour and the other hand to hold the top of the lid down. When you forget to do this, there is a very good chance that the lid will fall off *as you* pour water.Try another Brita pitcher instead. This one is not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a different model","review":"I have had a Britta pitcher for awhile. I love it, it makes my faucet water drinkable.

Since there is a problem with fit, the gap between the top and the handle is emphasized. Somehow water seeps into the hollow handle only to drip out slowly.

This model should be returned to the drawing boards"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's sell something that doesn't work!","review":"As the other reviews say, the lid does not really attach to the pitcher at all. It just sits loose on top and falls off when you try to pour water. This product is a sham and I definitely will never buy from Brita again.I wonder if they just had some extra lids lying around at the factory that they needed to get rid of? The only other explanation is that this is a massive practical joke on gullible consumers, because it is highly unethical to sell a product that is implied to be functional, and that turns out to be totally useless. I don't care if it's still technically possible to pour the water if you take the top off every time. It's not supposed to be that difficult to pour a glass of water!

You should be ashamed of yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pitcher makes me hate everything","review":"As everyone else has said, this pitcher is awful.

While it is possible to use it without spilling water, you have to be very careful to keep one hand on top of the lid while pouring. And sorry, that's just not acceptable to me. The lid doesn't snap in, it just rests on top of the pitcher, completely loose.I bought this after my old standard Brita pitcher finally wore out (after 10 years!). I didn't even think about checking reviews first. What could really be that bad about it? Well, it's pretty bad.I keep the lid fastened on with two strips of white, waterproof, bandage tape.

If you make the unfortunate mistake of accidentally overfilling, you are rewarded with a steady stream of water that flows over the top reservoir and out through a small hole in the bottom of the handle, all over your leg and/or foot as you are walking to put the stupid thing in the fridge. Trying to pour water is another feat. The lid invariably falls off if not held down, and the flap that covers the spout has to be held up with your finger if you are trying to pour into a container with any less than a 3 inch opening.

I kept thinking I was missing something because surely they didn't make a lid that in no way would attach to the pitcher. I was wrong; that is exactly what they did. I am so disappointed in Brita. They have so many great products. How is it that their designers allowed such a poorly made product to be put out for sale? They should be embarrassed.If you purchase this pitcher be prepared to do two things: 1. Put a hand on the lid when you are pouring so the lid doesn't fall off and make a mess 2. take the lid off altogether when you want to refill the pitcher.

Actually, it's two quarts if you also count the amount of water that's in the top part of the pitcher, before it is filtered.In the past I've used the Brita Ultramax with the spigot so that it's easier to dispense water but I found that mold grew too quickly on that (on the spigot). With the 2-quart model sometimes I get a small amount of black mold around the edges of the lid but I wash out the pitcher at least weekly and that helps.I think Brita is great. It's been in our household for years and makes the water taste great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetically poor design.","review":"(1) Lid will not stay on.(2) Handle fills with water and then slowly leaks.(3) Date thumb wheels hard to move.I was compelled to write this review on first use.

To this day, I find myself longing for a couple of the songs I heard. Unfortunately, the studio that put this movie out has all but disappeared, and the vocalist who performed much of the music is now a naturalist and audio book recorder, with nary a CD for purchase.Brain Smasher is your usual Dice movie, although his character is much more subdued than say Ford Fairlane. This must have also been one of Teri Hatcher's first roles, before she became such an over-actor. She was actually quite good and very attractive in this film.I won't go into the plot, because, well, others already have. This movie appears to be coming out on DVD at the end of Jan. 2007 in the UK, so I hope they release it via DVD in the states soon.If you're looking for something different--quirky but fun--check out Brain Smasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"The're not ninjas, they're speaking chinese!!!!","review":"Teri Hatcher plays a supermodel in london who recieves a flower in the mail from her sister in portland oregon.

In her escape plan, she runs across \\"brainsmasher\\" bouncing at a local club, and the story unfolds from there.This is actually a very funny, reasonably spliced together movie. I got this tape for 50 cents on clearence, and is available someplaces for even a quarter from a large re-tail rental store getting rid of VHS's. It is a funny movie, andrew dice clay in his prime.

It has a little of everything in it. Love, romance, guys in masks, large, scary strippers, ultimate power, and that one chick whose name I can never remember. Even better it comes with the best all-purpose line: \\"We are not ninjas!\\" You seriously can't go through life without that handy-dandy catch phrase.

This slim (but fully packed, nonetheless) volume contains many priceless physique photographs from the late 19th century to the 1950s-60s. Every page astonishes with the variety and quality of the collection that Mainardi has put together over many years. Some photographs are humorous (to our 21st century minds), some seriously dramatic and beautiful, but all are worth more than one look. One or two of the photos are bitter-sweet in the way they capture an earlier, more innocent and trusting time. Mainardi has written an essay, an introduction of sorts, that lays the foundation for why he collects, as well as some background on the field and people in question. I can't recommend this book srongly enough; it is great to own, and great to give as a gift to someone with an interest in photography, bodybuilding or history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!!","review":"Awesome collection of photos.

The muscle men presented had a good selection of body building pioneers and famous names. The pictures of everyday guys strutting themselves, while providing a time capsule of men feeling proud about their bodies, didn't offer anything outstanding in the way of physical development. If you are looking for links in the chain of what would later become beefcake photos and pioneering body builders, you'd like this book. If you are looking for a definitive history with more pictures of Sandow, Atlas, Joe Weider, and Steve Reeves you might be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"product paid for and never received","review":"Unfortunately I cannot review this product (though it was paid for), because I never received it.

I dont know if the problem was the original sources or the mastering onto CD but most of the songs sound muffled and weak. Aretha's voice is badly equalized, lost under the instruments and the chorus. The sound is fuzzy, not sharp, sort of what you get when you put a piece of cardboard over your speakers.

Second, while the introduction gives lip service to the importance of tones, the entries fail to denote them in any way. I would not recommend this book to anyone.

If you're 'smart', the Times thinks you're better, more informed. But, of course this is not true and that's why we have more boring (I use that word specifically) books by these 'smart' baseball 'minds'.

The four personalities in \\"Teammates\\" are a delight to read and learn about. I cannot give this book a higher mark simply due to the fact that I feel that I have already read it having read \\"Summer of '49.\\" There is simply not that much new material in this book. Maybe it is a testament to how good the other book is that I remembered so much about these four. Nonetheless, one cannot help but love Doerr, DiMaggio, Pesky, and maybe even Williams after this.

And, when you google her name, you will mostly find her surprisingly scathing rage-letters to various poetry contests, but barely any poetry at all (in fact, I only found one, and am quite search-engine-savvy).

Its like a wall in front of the wind, slowed me down, raised gas costs, and generally was nothing like I imagined it would be. It does the job of stopping the wind on my bike, but at the same time it's like riding through mollasis on my bike. Again, on a larger machine I think this would be a fine windshield.

The recepticles are expensive and, if used correctly, throw litter directly at you when you attempt to remove them from their snap-locks. Often times, we will have to shut the machine off and move the litter into a \\"friendlier\\" place for the rake to catch it.

The litter and receptacles are very costly to replace. You can't use standard litter. And if your cats have long hair the clumping litter sticks to them. The rake gets clogged easily.

Sometimes I pushed them sideways and more softly and eventually got what I wanted to came up. Then it hopped all around to the other items, like the date, time, hour, minutes, seconds. I had to push away to make it stop. The only thing that worked well was the clock. Used one timer for my diabetes testing and shots and the other acted the same.

Causing it toconstantly reset itself any time the clip is moved, or even touched. We worked around this by taping the clip in the folded position. LAME!

But once you've used set the timer and it's run its course, there's no way for it to get reset back to the time that you had set it before, without cycling through the memory of the timers to get it or just setting it again. That, for me, made the memory part rather pointless. What's the point of having a memory feature if you can't just hit the start/stop button again and it start again? That's why I gave the product the rather low rating. You can't push the start/stop button to start the time over again once it's finished, which was kinda the whole reason I bought it.

I'm not saying I can't figure it out, I'm saying it is annoying to have to put effort into figuring it out. This alone is enough to not buy the timer, because really, how hard can it be to make such a simple device intuitive? Also, the magnet on mine fell out after about 2 weeks of almost no usage (mostly sitting on a counter top).The final litmus test: I couldn't immediately find the timer today when I wanted it, but I didn't even feel like looking for it, I just came back to Amazon to buy a different kind of timer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the size shown","review":"I look a long time for a digital clock that also had a stop watch function.

It features a clock with month/day/year and day-of-the-week displays, a count-down timer with 4 memories, with which one can time 4 separate events simultaneously, and a count-up stopwatch.I used this timer mainly in the count-up stopwatch mode. Used as such, it was awful, because the start/stop button didn't always work. Very often, I pressed the switch to start or to stop timing an event, only to find that the timer did not start or was still going.

These scenes would have been great extras on DVDs for other Panther movies. Some of them are quite funny in an outtake kind of way.

Unfortunately, director Blake Edwards thought otherwise and, in a ghoulish enterprise, tried to fashion a new \\"Panther\\" movie with Sellers' outtakes. It doesn't work. The outtakes are OK, but they would have succeeded better in a Sellers anthology or documentary. By the halfway mark, Edwards runs out of Sellers material and the film's contrived narrative comes to an abrupt halt. \\"Trail of the Pink Panther\\" is ultimate proof that you cannot resurrect a corpse from the cutting-room floor. It's interesting to note that Sellers' widow sued MGM/UA for this artistic desecration of her husband's comic legacy - and won."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tribute to a comedy legend","review":"Critics hated this movie and called it a cheap moneymaking ploy. They also said it was offensive to Peter Sellers fans. Well, I'm a Peter Sellers fan and I consider this a superb and timely tribute to a master comedian. I don't find it even remotely offensive nor do I think it's a cheap moneymaking ploy. Director Blake Edwards says goodbye to his favorite star with some interesting out-takes and recollections of Clouseau from Pink Panther stars in character. Some of the later scenes could have been better, and Joanna Lumleys' terrible French accent could be considered a cause of offense!

The first half of the film was all right, but the second half it's kind of bland. David Niven's role has been reduced to almost a cameo part. He's so old, and Rich Little is dubbing his voice.

The title track and Land of Coufusion have great momentum and melody. But Genesis also embraced the worst of the genre, making terribly sappy ballads like Tonight, Tonight, Tonight and the even-worse In Too Deep (the first at least had good drums toward the end). Domino is a flash of the brilliant lyric and melody writing that Tony Banks had during the earlier days of Genesis, and The Brazillian reminds one of the instrumental ending track Los Endos, but they're not enough to hide the fact that this Genesis traded musical ambition for big bucks long ago, and it's sad to see three incredible musicians stretch out so little on a record."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT POP/ROCK","review":"Two tracks on this good collection of Genesis material are exceptional: Invisible Touch, which is a pop confection with that irresistable, hooky sound of Collins' most accessible songs, and the gorgeous, off-kilter Throwing It All Away, which is surprisingly moving and tender, with that brilliant instrumental part to the hook. Very listen-able; worth the price for these two tracks alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lot of hits, but also a miss","review":"Invisible Touch has a lot of hit songs on it, and at the time of its release was hugely popular. However, I don't think it held up over time. The ballads (In Too Deep, Tonight Tonight Tonight, Throwing It All Away) are decent but tiring and too plentiful on the album. The pop tracks (Invisible Touch, Anything She Does) are energetic and catchy but sound very dated. The standout track is Land of Confusion. Not really a bad album, but not nearly as good in 2008 as it was in 1986."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you like Phil Collins?","review":"Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene-who?!!? Gack! NO stars...","review":"Wow. What a sell-out.

But that is really not the problem with this CD, here. The issue is simply that it is filled with weak, lack-luster compositions. It's not a question of credibility but yes one of quality. There's nothing wrong with doing pop (I love it, anyway) but this album is stale. \\"Invisible Touch\\" is the definition of what singles are today: lame. \\"Land of Confusion\\" might have a cool video but the song itself provides the listener with nothing, either lyrically or musically. \\"In Too Deep\\" is something that belongs in a Phil Collins solo album, complete with it's drum machine patterns and sapiness.

The rest of the album is sadly infested with forgettably cheesy techno-pop. A worthwhile comparison is with ex-member Peter Gabriel's \\"So\\" - released at about the same time - which clearly shows that a commercially positioned release can nonetheless make a significant artistic statement. Artistically, Invisible Touch largely stands as a disgrace to the Genesis legacy, albeit highly beneficial to their wallets.

Progressive is actually incorporating new ideas to a system. That's what Banks, Rutherford, and Collins did all of their careers. Yes, the drum machines were annoying, but this is GOOD music compared to what's on the market today. I find this more appealing than 70's Genesis, which in my opionon was boring organ solos and guitar leads crammed into 10 minutes. Dosen't do it for me.

I can't believe I spent money on the 3rd edition CD-ROM atlas a couple of years ago. If you are a radiology resident, do not buy this! The image quality is poor, the resolution is awful, the images are too small even if you decrease the screen resolution, and the cross sectional images are worse than the images we acquire with extremely outdated county hospital equipment. The cross sections from the CT brain are acquired in an oblique projection, making them difficult to compare with the images obtained at most hospitals. The MRI images are way outdated. I just pulled up some angio images to go over vascular anatomy for the upcoming oral board exam and these images are awful! No celiac axis, no detailed pelvic vasculature.

After a dozen or so uses, the motor runs but the blade does not turn. Opened it up and found that a metal worm gear drives a soft plastic gear attached to the blade. The plastic gear was completely worn out. This design is not meant to withstand slicing anything but bread for more than a year of light usage. It was an inexpensive slicer, but it's not worth the money for how long it lasts. Save up for a quality slicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rival Slicers' Gears Break Soon","review":"Although the Rival slicers work OK and are inexpensive in the short run, their plastic gears break frequently. When this happened to my first one, I made the mistake of replacing it with another Rival slicer.

I am replacing it with an EdgeCraft 610 slicer, which does not cost that much more but has great reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed having this slicer. I make bread and other methods of slicing have not been completely satisfactory. I want thinner slices to reduce calories and make the loaves last longer. This slicer does the trick. You can't just run the slicer easily back and forth with bread, you have to manually return the bread to the starting position, but that's no big deal. Sometimes the bottom crust catches between the blade and the housing and you have to pull it out gently without breaking the bread - but that isn't a big problem either. This is just so much better than other things I have tried, and without spending hundreds of dollars (or more) on a professional slicer. Well worth the money, wouldn't want to be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slicer review","review":"This item is just o.k. It does slice the cheese, salami, etc., but not necessarily evenly. It also is difficult to hold the meat, cheese, or whatever and press the button and move it to slice all at the same time. It really works better if two people are doing the operation. It also takes some doing to take it apart and wash all the parts after use. I would definitely not have ordered it if I had known how much trouble it would be to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, so far!","review":"So far, I love this machine.Slicing cheddar cheese is a bad idea, though. It's gummy, and everything gets gunked up quickly, slowing the use of the sliding holder of the food way down.

Now, I can use the slices in my sandwich grill.I am quite happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gonna return if I could","review":"I bought this machine to slice meat for hotpot but it is really not possible to do so.

Also bits sometimes get stuck on the bottom.The unit is very easy to clean and easy enough to use so that I don't mind bringing it out when the task requires it.I bake my own bread and haven't thought to use this - but after reading reviews here, I'll try it out this weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"slicer","review":"i love this machine. great to cut my roastbeef and coldcuts.i would tell everybody to by one.great product to buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"handy little slicer","review":"A great little machine to have! I have had a slicer almost the same as this for 20+ years. It doses what it's made to do; slicing items the width of the blade. Meats, cheeses and vegetables are sliced well on the machine. The only downside is that you need to hold the power putton down with one hand while moving the slicing tray with the other. As for cleaning, all that is needed is to remove the blade with a tool which is provided, wash the blade & holder, wipe down the tray with a rag or sponge and replace blade when dry. I was going to upgrade to a newer model, but that power button inconvience is still a part of its make-up. Mine still works great, so I'll wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost good","review":"This slicer quickly cut my home made corn beef into perfect deli thin slices...and then just as quickly turned a loaf of my home-baked bread into a pile of useless crumbs.

Cheap and effective. I could have paid several hundred dollars for a proffessional slicer, but I wanted something that I would use on occassion and wouldn't be that offended if it broke on me. My wife uses it about once a week for roastbeef or turkey. We don't use it for bread or cheese. Clean up is not bad, but it does take a minute. The area of slicing can sometimes get trickey. You have to make sure to cut down your meat before attempting to make slices. Sometimes the slice doesnt come out as pretty as you like.

Our first and only use was to slice mozzarella cheese. Slices are uneven. Cheese particles collect in every seam and inaccesable space on the machine.

The folding platform collects food in spaces impossible to clean without removal or submersion both of which are impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to operate","review":"AS has been stated above, this machine really takes two people to operate. The safety button has to be held down while slicing, making only one had free. On my unit, the plastic part that controls the thickness of the food being sliced, keeps coming off, so slices do not come out evenly. We were trying to slice a beef brisket I made, became so frustrated with how much work it was to slice, and how ad the slices were turning out, I took out my mandoline and finished slicing with that!

It uses some of the basic narrative of events and characters to make a costume soap opera. It has none of the poetry, none of the philosophical musings searching for wisdom, none of the variety of characters or understanding of humanity of Tolstoy's great literary masterpiece. Even Pierre has been turned into a socially easy, seductive image for someone's erotic fantasy, with glasses the only indicator of Tolstoy's intention that he be a socially awkward, rather plump, bumbling intellectual. It has taken his beautiful novel and turned it into trash. The movie made by the Russian Bondarchuk is wonderful but in Russian and my copy is a faded 30 year old tape.

Because we are presented with the data of Astor's life, but where is Astor? There is virtually nothing communicated as to what type of person he was, WHY he was so ambitious, what he felt and thought about the various activities he undertook, his successes, relative failures, etc. In many instances of course the available data of his life do not necessarily communicate the subjective life of the psyche, only the objective actions. But it is the very task of a biographer--in my view the most vital task--to artfully connect the various \\"dots\\" of data so as to reveal the subjective life within, the drama of the mind and heart reacting to events as the events unfold.

Speaking of shock, we did get quite a bit of that but one wondered if certain explicit scenes were put in for shock value alone. i.e fine acting or the Director acting out.

This movie has no point to get. You don't envy any of the characters, or pity them, you don't care for them at all because they're all pathetic.

After reading the glowing reviews I decided to order it as I love eating vetetables, but hate cutting them. It was great cutting the carrots, but the celery got stuck even though I peeled it first. I tried red pepper and the shooter sliced a few pieces and then the red pepper kept spinning in the blade instead of being cut nicely into the salad bowl. It is even worse with an onion. I am returning it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small and Powerful","review":"I have had a salad shooter (interesting, never for salad) for years and it broke after 22 years.

I LOVE THIS MODEL! Great price and excellent quality. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another replacement","review":"Years and years ago, someone gave my mother a salad shooter. She was so impressed - and Mother knew everything \\"kitchen\\" - she bought me one. I don't even know how many years I had it, but she has been gone for 6 years, and it was long before that. Well, last week, it was grating some potatoes for me, and it just gave up the ghost. For some reason, I'd never considered that that could happen! My beloved salad shooter was no more. Well, guess what! I came right to my computer and ordered another one, which, thank goodness, came today.Maybe I should stock up in case they stop making them! How does anyone cook without a salad shooter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy","review":"This product is so easy to use that my 7 year old loves it!

We have had two. The first one the grater broke, but, that would be expected given the amount of times I used it to grate cheese - all kinds - and making hash brown potatoes, and au gratin potatoes. The motor unit on the first unit still works and I keep it and the other attachments in the cabinet as a back up or an extra. It is the handiest appliance I have in my kitchen and wouldn't be without one. Someone said they are noisy, and that's true especially when you shred overly soft cheese - make sure your chees is cold (not frozen) and firm before shred otherwise the noise is not a big issue for me.Try it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replaced my old one that I loved.

I am totally satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"After slicing 2 fingers on my hand on a mandoline slicer, I purchased this to protect my remaining fingers. I like it. It does the job as advertised. I just sometimes find it easier to use a knife than to get it out, set it up, take it apart and wash it all up. I wish I had bought the delux model that had more cone options. The slices are a little thin but it does a very good job and when I have company and need a large amount of things cut up, I use it. I've sliced cukes, carrots and shredded an orange for a cooking receipe. The clean up is easy and the parts come apart and go together with ease. Haven't put it in the dishwasher but it does say it is safe to do so. It was a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"It did not meet my expectation.

I would definitely recommend getting one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The product came before it was scheduled to and in great condition.

When Mom's happy - everyone is happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah for never shreading cheese again.","review":"We eat a lot of cheese in my home. Cheddar on lots of dishes and of course lots of mozzarella when preparing lasagna. This product saves me money from having to purchase more expensive pre-shredded cheese.

Althoug I do not use the other slice adaptor often, I have used it to shred carrots and other similar produce and it works just as great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One appliance that makes my kitchen complete","review":"This is my 2nd Salad Shooter. I owned my first one for 10 years. The months between when the first one died and when I ordered the new one, I found myself constantly going to the cupboard to get it! Very handy for many of the recipes I make, and I love that I can slice or shred the ingredients right into the bowl or pan that I am using. This item is simple to disassemble so you can place parts into the dishwasher, making clean-up easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Aid","review":"My Salad Shooter (I cheated) is from a yard sale, so it only cost a couple of dollars. But that's because I didn't know that Amazon has them for sale. It is a marvel to use, especially for carrots, hard(er) cheeses, and other firm stuff.BUT -- big warning from experience -- things like bamboo shoots and celery, that have strings in them, just tend to jam it up, so all you do is clean food-jams out (similar to log jams).Either get the strings out (celery) or chop them by hand.Also I think there may be a small problem (after bamboo) with the cutting edges getting dull. Being on the outside of the attachment, it should be possible to sharpen them with a fine file or sharpening stone, or else haunt the yard sales to get replacement parts from people who didn't like theirs...A definite must-have, from somebody who has a KitchenAid Stand Mixer with all the good attachments, and still uses the Salad Shooter for shredding carrots and such stuff. Nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUCH Smaller than it looks in the picture","review":"I bought one of these to replace my dying Chip Shot (older model Presto SaladShooter). However, this one is tiny by comparison, and won't even fit a regular-sized potato in without cutting it into pieces. Very under powered for my needs. Luckily we recently upgraded to a good food processor, so I can cut my potatoes and shred my cheese much more easily. Would definitely not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes making a salad so easy","review":"I love shredded carrots but hate shredding them by hand. This makes it really easy.

It works OK but is not as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have more attachments for this price.","review":"The Presto Saladshooter works well and cleans easily. I'm only giving it a \\"2\\" because you have to buy more attachments that should have come with it at that price. Also the low rating is deserved because it is made in China, and I'm sick to death of almost everything being made in China. We desperately need jobs in America, but the manufacturers are too cheap to pay decent wages and benefits to Americans.As is, this machine only slices and shreds in one size each. It should have been designed to aim the foods straight into the bowl or pan without making you buy a separate attachment. Also, I prefer finer size shreds for most foods, and would have to buy the fine-shred attachment for that. I've seen manual machines that produce more shapes and sizes at much lower costs. My arm won't fall off if I turn a crank or slide a lever to achieve the results I want - instead of wasting electricity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"What a piece of junk!This thing BARELY works....

It is important that the vegetables to be processed be fresh and crisp for an effective job. If your produce is limp, soak it in WARM water for 15 or 20 minutes to crisp it up. You may find that apples need to be peeled, otherwise the apple peels and part of the apples keep going around and around without being shredded. The same thing goes for potatoes for use in potato pancakes. We tried it on onions without much success, so it has it's limitations. I can't compare this product to anything else because I couldn't find anything comparable on the market.Is it worth buying?

The portrait of Alexander is a bit pale, I found several anachronisms and other mistakes (e.g. the idea that parchment and papyrus are the same thing), the characters are too much 20th century, and the story is strangely lacking in mediterranean atmosphere. Did the author (who, of course, is not really named Anna Apostolou) ever visit Greece, I wonder?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a historical mystery","review":"Set in 336 BC Greece, the author attempts to solve the mystery of who was behind the assasination of Philip of Macedon. There are many suspects, including his son, Alexander, all with viable motives.While the author has chosen an era that has yet to be explored by mystery writers, she allowed the results of her research to bog down the story. The mystery and characters became secondary to her history lesson.This is the first of a proposed series by Apostolou (pseudonym for P.C.

My biggest complaint with this novel is the author's note. The author states that Alexander's character is very much as found in the historical documents; \\"rather shy, self-effacing, suffering from panic attacks, and very shy of women.\\" Not quite. Every ancient source portrays him as gregarious, prone to excessive ego and ambition, incredibly bold and often reckless. There is no indication he was shy around women, rather that he was somewhat disinterested in them sexually until his mid-20's. Alexander had conquered the known world by his 30th birthday, and one has to question the author's opinion of his character.For those who wish to make up their minds for themselves about Alexander's character, I recommend A.B. Bosworth's excellent, \\"Conquest and Empire, the Reign of Alexander the Great,\\" available, of course, from Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting...","review":"I don't regularly read mysteries, but I read lots of books about the great king Alexander.

Unfortunately, though, I think the 'witches' of historic Salem have more in common with those who have been tortured in ritual abuse...in both situations, their innocence is not believed and their persecution is justified by the ignorant and the perpetrators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched, highly biased and totally inaccurate view","review":"Ms Nathan's book is a great apology for predators, pedophiles and criminal satanists who, thanks to such books, are getting away with murder - literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"An invitation to pedophiles","review":"This book completely abandons the true victims of Ritual Abuse in favor of pedophiles and other child abusers.

You will enjoy this story as David visualizes his teacher's description of the first Thanksgiving as he falls deep into his own imagination. From arriving in Plymouth Harbor to hunting wild turkeys for the first Thanksgiving, David realizes the hardships of the Pilgrims, the value of sharing, and most importantly, he appreciates and gives thanks for his friends and family, home and teacher, and for just being together. These are values held by every culture, and are something to be thankful for every day! A great book to open and explore with your own immagination!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Trays","review":"I didn't get the 3 D.I.Y. trays.

Now perhaps there is a delux edition of the soundtrack out there with the missing songs on it, but as far as I'm concerned the soundtrack is incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only drawback is its brevity","review":"This is a great soundtrack with a collection of great songs. The only thing that keeps it from the 5th star is the fact that it is extremely short.With 10 songs coming from the motown machine of the 60's the whole thing comes in at just about 35 minutes. Extremely short by today's standards. But, if that's all you've got, that's all you've got. The pinnacle song of course is Ben E. King's Stand By Me. A great anthem that sums up the heart and soul of the movie well. I do kind of wish there was some original material on this disc as that would have given a better flavor and personalized the soundtrack a little more. It might have given it a little more length as well.A good disc for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best soundtracks ever","review":"It's just what you'd expect if you've seen the movie.

I found when I pulled on the cord itself, it eventually broke after a few years. Now that I figured out what I was doing wrong, I believe I will have it longer than 2 years. Another tip: When pulling the top off try not pulling on the knob but wrap your hand around the sides of the top as much as possible and pull up. Although it was not a Presto brand, the knob on one of my percolators broke off. One time, I contacted the company and purchased another cord for a nominal fee rather than replacing the whole percolator. I still prefer percolators over other coffee makers because they take up less counter space as well as they are less expensive. Hope these tips help others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it based on the rave reviews","review":"The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because it's attractive and brews coffee fast. However, the coffee does not taste like percolated coffee at all. And it takes 50% more coffee to get the same tasting coffee you'd get in any low grade coffee maker. On top of that, it's a hassle to clean all the parts every time you want to make a pot. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes no coffee half the time; only produces hot water","review":"Half of the time the percolator does not make the coffee. It only produces hot water. However the coffee grinds are soggy and have to be thrown out. The percolator part just does not live up to expectation. When it does make coffee it works fine, that is why I give it two stars. The type of filter it uses is another irritation. It makes a shallow basin for the coffee to sit in and thus most of the time the coffee grinds are in the coffee and not in the recevoir intended for them.All in all not a very good experience. I had really expected something better from Presto."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"This makes a decent cup of hot coffee without taking up a lot of counter space.

I am comparing it to my very old, sturdy Farberway percolater that had an electrical failure after more than 30 yrs.It was much more substantial, but they don't make them that way any more.

It makes a great cup of coffee, clean and rich with that great coffee flavor I remember. It is easy to clean and the price is perfect.

Consequently, we ordered another one when the old one quit. Unfortunately, it did not make good coffee even though nothing else was changed. After reading numerous reviews, I decided to try the Presto percolator. It is better than the new Mr. Coffee drip unit, but the coffee is still not as rich and flavorful as the former Mr. Coffee.

I also find that it produces hotter coffee than I could get from my previous drip type coffee maker. It can be used with or without filters (some of which are included with the coffee pot).

Overall, I am quite pleased with this coffee pot thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"My coffee is weak - update and change in rating","review":"This is not a review - because I've only made two pots. Both of which are very weak and the grounds seemed almost dry after perking compared to what I remember as a kid. Because the first pot was so weak, I added twice as much coffee for the 2nd batch - and it's no stronger. Also didn't use a filter the second time around. Any ideas out there?Will return and rerate if I find how to correct this problem.Thanks.Update: Initially I was going to return product but tried adding more coffee and smaller grind - it worked. Although I'm not saving on the amount of coffee like some have noted - the coffee is great when I use 12 scoops of drip grind for a full pot. So I'm changing rating.

Good quality product which makes steaming hot coffee. Have to use more coffee to get ample strength for enjoyment. Better than drip coffeemakers which we had used for years.The only negative is not the fault of the coffee maker but our feedback, it is a little daunting to have to clean this coffee maker since we are just used to dumping grounds and rinsing the carafe. This one must be dismantled and washed in soapy hot water. To clean after there is a buildup, you must soak it in \\"dip it\\".We also purchased the circular Melitta style filters which help with an easier cleanup.

Within two days, the broken item was picked up from the recipient's home and a new one was delivered. While I have not used the percolator, the recipient says that it feels very sturdy, of good quality, and makes very hot coffee -- and keeps it that way.

The coffee comes out very weak, no matter how many grounds are in the top. Never having used a percolator, I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm wasting tons of good quality organic coffee only to end up with a very weak cup. One time, the coffee poured simply as clear hot water. The way the pieces sit in the percolator must had something to do with that. The top piece rests on a pole with a spring and you can't push it down - it sort of bounces up and down and doesn't \\"sit\\" straight.I don't know if all percolators are like this, but I'm really disappointed for what I paid and for the great reviews.

When we started using it again, we noticed that the cord would not stay hooked to the coffee maker....like the magnet wore off, making it impossible to rely on.

There are times when all we get is a cup of hot water, which seems more like a defect than anything else.While Bubbles makes a good cup of coffee sometimes, the price is reasonable, and we are working hard to adjust.

The really cheap ones that last less than a year will stay on until turned off.i drink coffee on my weekends and during the week but on my weekends i take several hours to drink a pot and was really annoyed when I had to turn it off and on all the time.This coffee maker is wonderful, I use 7 to 8 tbsp's with no filter (folders classic roast) and maybe my last cup has a ground or two, but the coffee is excellent and the unit stays on until i unplug it.The stainless steel is easy to clean and looks good.

This bothered me since everything else indicated it was completely stainless steel - so I called Presto (1-800-877-0441) and asked about the aluminum. The representative said that the perk well - which is the part that the perk tube sits into - is aluminum so that the water can heat faster. All other parts are stainless steel.

That's ok though, since I'm usually making coffee for myself. But even using percolator style paper filters, sediment still ends up in the coffee.

Unlike others, I have had no problems with the strength of the brew. I will admit the first couple of times the brew came out weak; but, that was my fault. I had not situated the stem properly and the water had not reached the grounds. Once a month I also clean it with a coffee pot cleaner, that is in addition to rinsing it out everyday.

I boiled a bit of water alone in the percolator and some particles from that residue floated in the water. I can imagine how much of that stuff went into my coffee already. I only use filtered water for my drinks, so the problem wasn't in water but in the type of material used for this percolator. Being made in China, no wonder...

You can also use a piece of paper towel to make your own wrap around filter. I love perked coffee and this coffeemaker has lived up to my expectations. I used other brand percolators in the past, and I found that they just did not last very long, they would just die.

With than being said I was looking for a replacement for my 10 year old drip maker w/ stainless steel decanter. I never buy glass because that is where the manufacturers scam comes in. They build cheap glass pots so they break often so you need to keep buying them. I am a collector of antique coffee pots made from GE dating back to the early 1900's. I broke out one of my Perculators I had from the 1950's to make some coffee until I could buy a new drip pot and discovered the taste of the coffee was so much better from the Perculator so I decided to look into a more modern peculator to buy. I was reading the reviews on this pot and I bought it. I absolutely love it. It brews a great cup of coffee and then keeps it piping hot right down to the last cup. The price is right too.

You won't cut yourself but it's not up to the quality I would expect from Lacie. Slotting in the D2 drives are a piece of cake. There are 6 tiny pieces of rubber \\"feet\\" on the base of the rack that help in not scratching the surface of your table.

The arrival of a new student (Naoki Yasukochi) and a wave of bizarre events lead him to discover the power within.This is not one of director Takashi Miike's ultraviolent films. Instead, he has made a very bizarre comedy that is mostly family friendly, always compelling, and often extremely funny. The script gets a bit sloppy at times in order to place characters where the filmmakers want them, but all of that is trumped by sheer goofy charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even for the low price it is NOT worth it.","review":"Looking for a simple toaster that would simply toast bread, I bought this piece of junk.

I loved Ephron's non-stop rating of her son (normal range, not normal range, etc.)and found it both touching and funny. The book has a winsome quality and rather than see it as Lily Davis growth as a woman, I chose to view the novel as her growth as a parent. At the beginning, I would rate her in the normal range but just barely but as the story plows ahead, she makes it to the very normal range. I also enjoyed the fact that Lily Davis does not give in to her own desires but rather to her son's, at least at the end of the book. Aside from everything else, the columns by Lily Davis were quite well written...if only writing like that appeared in every small town weekly. That's another thing...the book is about a Manhattan woman's radical move to a small town and small town life, aside from \\"Gilmore Girls,\\" was never more charming. Loved it, recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, so it's wacky, but a fun read!","review":"Well, I am going to disagree with the other 3 reviews I've just read. Perhaps I was too in love with Hanging Up and Delia Ephron's writing in that novel. I read this book in 2 days and it really entertained me - the main character is totally stressed and out of her element - that's for sure - but come on - you have to laugh that her son's new girlfriend will only speak to her in Klingon! I guess that I also wanted to keep reading to see if the woman in the bedroom that the main character saw was really dead or not.

I do believe that the reviews of this book are accurate and provide the potential reader that this is one for a long plane ride. Lily is a character not far from everyone of us that mentally experiences life. We plug in background music to situations, think about the good old times, and wish life were bigger than it really is. I enjoyed this book because of its difference. At first I was annoyed that it was a simple read but I found myself laughing and having a good time reading it. My next book is \\"White Teeth\\" a Zadie Smith novel of a more grandious literary style. I look forward to every new style of writing I encounter.

I put down the book after reading about half of it, and I'm not sure when (or if) I'll pick it up again. It reads more like a plot outline for a film, not a novel. The characters are defined only by their actions, and the actions they take are thrust upon the reader without much reflection. Some of the humor works, though most is forced. Maybe I'd like the book more if I liked Lilly; she's ditzy, condenscending, and hmmm. Why go on?

There are two historians that are interviewed, nicely dressed men that seem very credible, but they are pretty boring too.I bought this for my 8th grade daughter because it matched one of her history lessons.

If I was not awake before...So I just today purchased a second one for my office...thinking that perhaps maybe I got a bad one at home...I mean they can't all possibly made so poorly...I was wrong. I have the same exact problem with the new one.Please don't waste your money on this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 tries, 3 failures","review":"I went through three complete systems, assorted adapters, teflon tape and different washers and over $100 plus 6 hours of labor including trips to hardware store...and I gave up.Bottom line: TOO FEW THREADS on the plastic collar to adequately catch & attach to either the faucet or any given adapter. Brita even sent me a complimentary filter set and adapters. There is no way this unit could maintain a seal and stand up to any amount of stress or rotation. I would advise anyone to try another brand, get the pitcher, or bottled water. It was a frustrating waste of time, but Brita did offer to send me a free pitcher w/filters to compensate me for my loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable out of the box.","review":"My faucet required one of the included adaptors which fit the faucet nice and snug. However, the Brita unit itself does not fit its own adaptor. It will not tighten even minimally without the threads slipping. When tightened as much as possible without the threads slipping, the slightest bump or jiggle and even minimal water pressure detaches the unit from the faucet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good filter","review":"I have always purchased PUR faucet filters in the past.

If this thing holds up over time, I will not go back to PUR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I had this product (the chrome version) for about a year and it worked just fine. I am only replacing it because I moved and it seemed like a good time to start anew and buy a fresh one."},{"rating":"1","title":"On my 3rd complete replacement set after 18 months","review":"I don't know what it is about this product, but it just does not hold up at all. Actually, I do know what it is: cheaply made.When it works, it works great. There is nothing like having fresh water at the tap without having to refill a pitcher every day. But it won't take long for you to realize that this device isn't made for the long term.Within months of owning small leaks start to occur around the device. Shortly after those appear, the leaks worsen and will actually run into the water you are wanting to filter.After spending over $100 on 3 replacements and how ever many replacement filters, I have learned my lesson the hard way on this product.You really do get what you pay for in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"The plastic connector to the faucet is weak. It lost tightness within 3 months and started leaking. When I tried to tighten it, the internal plastic connector broke completely. Turns out there are only 2 small pieces of plastic connecting the two. Very bad engineering. Try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well...BUT BUY A METAL FASTENER.","review":"I bought this filter because I was tired of having tons of plastic water bottles to recycle(not to mention the environmental effects of buying bottled water). Within 2 days the filter fell right off of the tap while in use, I re-fastened it and it kept falling off. Eventually the plastic threaded fastener became completely stripped and the filter would no longer fasten on at all. At this point I sent an angry email to Brita and began to dwell on 30.00 wasted(I'm a student..). BUT I decided to see if I could find a replacement fastener piece at the hardware store, I found a QUALITY metal one(2.00) that was the same size as the cheaply made plastic original. Put the filter back on using the new metal fastener and it hasn't leaked or fallen off since and it's been about 3 months. Long story short...IF YOU BUY THIS FILTER INVEST IN A 2 DOLLAR METAL THREADED FASTENER, WHICH ANY HARDWARE STORE HAS IN THE PLUMBING DEPARTMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, leaks often, tastes good","review":"Length:: 0:41 MinsI'm so p... angry at this faucet I made a video to show how awful it is. I've had several over the years and they keep breaking for no apparent reason. When I bought the first one, I was worried about not being able to replace the battery. Not to worry, because they won't even last long enough for the battery to wear out! You can't even take it apart to fix it. I swore I would never buy this brand again. It is poorly constructed with cheap plastic. Instead, I bought the Culligan faucet filter. On the plus side, the water does taste good."},{"rating":"1","title":"not this one.........","review":"leaked like a river and lame plastic threads stripped out immediately.The PUR Ulitmate works perfectly first time.

The leak is caused by a crack in theplastic part that holds the filter to the screw ring that threads onto the faucet. Since this has not been fixed in over a year I can only assume that brita doesn't care if their expensive filter breaks after only two months of use! Don't buy one it wont last! Perhaps if enough people complain they might fix it, but I have read several complaints just like mine going back a year. Like I said don't buy one it will just break on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been using mine for years without a single problem!","review":"I use my Brita faucet filter every day to filter all my drinking & cooking water. It's infinitely more convenient than the pitcher filter & much cheaper (& lighter) than carrying home bottled water from the grocer.I'm baffled as to how the other reviewers could find this water filter complicated to use. It just screws on the faucet. When it comes time to change filters, the old one pops out & a new one pops in. It takes less than 10 seconds. The indicator light resets automatically. I've never had a problem with leaking or dripping. It truly couldn't be any simpler to use. I *love* it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita Water Filter is horrible","review":"This is a horribly designed filter, constantly falls off the faucet, leaks, sprays.

Big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need big muscles to operate","review":"There are four of us in our house, and the fridge doesn't have room for a pitcher. So we invested in the Brita tap filtration. It worked great for the first few months. But then it started leaking/spraying water around the edges and the knob to switch from the filter to tap got really tough to turn, like impossible without hurting your fingers or straining. Because of that, people stopped turning it back to the regular tap water and the filter would quickly turn to red because water was only being run through the filter for all use.Currently looking into another filter system with better reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd design, won't attach to faucet","review":"I should have heeded the warning of the other reviewers. I can't imagine why, but there are a completely inadequate number amount of threading on this device to securely attach to any faucet. Tried to install this, and not surprisingly it resulted in the filter flying off and water everywhere. I've done some pretty extensive plumbing in my day and have never seen a design this poor. Sorry amazon but this one is heading back your way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly Breaks","review":"I am not a fan of this model. The older versions that didnt have the lights but the indicator manually moved worked better.It seems every three months the light indicator stops working and then you have to buy a whole new system because you dont know if the filter is still working or not. Definitely poorly made. This is my 4th one of this model and I have had the same problem with all.For the plus side, it does provide great clean water and I do like that you can turn off the filter for when you wash dishes etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"After a week it started leaking and does not stay on no matter how tight i screw it on. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddeningly flawed","review":"Another example of a manufacturer taking a good product and slapping on cheap peripherals. This filter system is great in theory. The problem is the super cheap connectors which will fail almost at once, causing water to spray all over the kitchen. As if dripping cupboards aren't bad enough, the straight tap water will actually spray, shoot and dribble into the filtered stuff, contaminating it and defeating the purpose of the whole wretched experiment. It's hard to believe Britta would muddy its reputation by releasing a product so horribly designed. Buy this filter and run the risk of getting soaked, both figuratively and otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with a different company's filter","review":"Just as many others have said, this filter will start breaking down, with very little apparent signs of wear where you can actually fix it. We had our model for something approaching a year, but I routinely had to tighten it down, pray, tighten some more, and repeat. Even breathing on it would cause it to leak. We went with a Pur 1-click version currently being advertised, and it's been running like a charm. It also installed 10 times more easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead & Disappointed","review":"I thought the purchase of this Brita faucet filter would be a great & green replacement for the bottled water we had delivered to our offices. I was lead to believe the green light was to indicate the time for replacing the filters, now after reading the reviews I understand that is not correct. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased two filters for two of our offices. Now I am reading about defects in the manufacturing! With an office of over 25 people all using the same two pitchers but not in the volume, and as the green light is not the (time to change) indicator I expected, I now have no idea how soon I should change the filters, with so many users I think six months is too long to wait. I am a Brita pitcher user at home and I had planned to purchase the faucet filter but after reading the reviews and my experience with the two we have here in the office, I've decided to look into other options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"The concept is great but the actual product is not. Every little bit it pops off or leaks. The plastic connector is light weight and easily damaged. I will take the pitcher over this thing any day. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete deterioration in quality of tap-mount","review":"I am on my third Brita tap mount in 2 months. On the first, the indicator light stopped working even before the first filter change. The second, sent to me by the company as a replacement, didn't fit properly on the tap and kept falling off. The third, another purchase and a brand-new design, leaked copious amounts of water from the filter release button and from the filter vs. tap water toggle.I have used Brita tap-mounts for years. The previous tap-mount lasted several years and was replaced because its physical appearance started to deteriorate. Quality control has clearly declined and the new design is fatally flawed. My recommendation? Buy Pur."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"I bought a Brita filter and am thoroughly disgusted with it. The flow of water through the filter is so piddling that it takes close to two minutes to fill a 1.5 liter bottle, and the filter system itself leaks and pops off the faucet anytime the water is turned up beyond a trickle.The water (when I COULD get water) did taste better, but between the spurting all over the kitchen and the fact that the filter kept popping off the faucet, it just plain wasn't worth it.Spare yourself the money: Get something that works. A Brita just isn't worth the aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least they honor their warranty","review":"You will be lucky indeed if this product lasts a year before either it starts leaking or the aereater breaks off. I made a big mistake when I thought I would save money by buying a multi pack of replacement filters. I've ended up purchasing two additional faucet mounts just to use up the filters. On the positive side, Customer Service is very cooperative about sending replacement parts when it breaks in less than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explosive filtration","review":"If only I could give this product zero stars...* vs. the Brita pitchers -- water doesn't taste as good.* vs. tap water -- tastes better* water pressure -- on filtration mode it's not too bad.* quality -- poor.* convenience of having a big lump on the end of your faucet: minimal.* ability of this product to stay ON the end of the faucet: poor.

This Brita filter's plastic threaded connector does not stay on the faucet more than a couple seconds, if at all, because of poor quality. It cross-threads when I try to attach it, or it doesn't attach at all. The connector is like a half a millimeter too loose. Frustrated that I'll have to take another user's advice and see if I can find a metal replacement connector. Customer service suggested I go to the hardware store. I don't recommend this poorly manufactured plastic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Junk","review":"This thing has been leaking for a while now but mostly it just drops into the sink and then sprays the person using it and anybody else within a 3' circle. What a piece of junk. Plastic parts, bogus threads, and really poor engineering. Brita should be ashamed of this product. It's junk. I'll be calling their customer service line - feels like I wasted money and that makes me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy construction, soon leaks and breaks","review":"This water filter works fine for a couple of weeks, but then the leaks start and pretty soon the filter simply falls off the faucet. The problem is that the threads are made of plastic, and they will not hold. Brita is counting on people to buy a new filter unit (not replacement filters, the filter unit itself) every 2-3 months. Count me out. The manufacturer has created and is selling low-quality junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could return it","review":"Very disappointing. I wish I had read the other reviews, as I would have passed this by. My old one, also a Brita, held up for 4 years, finally leaking. This one leaked within days. I tighten. It leaks. I use plumbers tape. It leaks. I put it back on several times a day. It leaks.I'm going back to the pitcher. Not worth it. Anyone need some filters I purchased at the same time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Base breaks too often - water tastes good though","review":"I've been using Brita faucet filters since 1998. The base keeps breaking because it is cheap plastic. There is no way to take it apart and repair it. I've had 3-4 and I'm fed up replacing them so I'm going to buy another brand. When I first bought it I was worried about how to replace the battery for the light. No need to worry because it will break before then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeatedly fell off my faucet","review":"I'm sure the filter did everything it was supposed to do in filtering out our water, but it fell off our faucet at least twice a day (sometimes we'd make it through a whole day and it would only fall off once or, on a rare occasion, not at all).Before anyone asks, it was installed correctly every time; it just couldn't handle the weight of the water from the faucet coming down on it when the pressure was on medium to full. Avoid this and get a pitcher instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Trap!","review":"I am a doctor in a large metro area. I bought Brita filters some months ago, thinking that the tap water needed to be filtered. This filter started growing mold and God-knows what else inside the housing. I had been having diarrhea and upset stomach for the last few weeks before I took this thing off the tap. I had no idea what was going on, until I took it apart. There was red mold and black mold all over the water flow area, inside and outside the housing. I couldn't believe it!! This filter is made for the third world where there are larvae and eggs in the water. There is chemical and bacterial contamination in the US. This thing does nothing for that. It is a lawsuit waiting to happen. I wrote to Brita, and have heard little else but party-line. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, OR ANYTHING LIKE IT. Drink distilled water like I do now. Or just drink tap water."},{"rating":"1","title":"got an old filter","review":"Light wouldn't come on at all.

Same product, should have had the same reliability, but it did not. Whether the one I received is faulty as a result of a factory defect or any other means does not matter. I replaced my previous tap system with the new one. Two weeks later, the red light came on showing that the water was no longer being filtered. I replaced the filter. Again, same result. I thought maybe the filter was faulty, so I purchased a box of three filters. The most recent filter lasted less than a week before the red light came on. And, of course, since I truly believed that I wouldn't continue to have the problem, I didn't think to return the item within the 30 days. Now I find myself in the position of having to spend more money on replacing this one. Not happy with this product at all - and that's something I never thought I would say about Amazon deals."},{"rating":"1","title":"made to break","review":"I was really happy for the first bit with this filter but then I should have read the reviews here before I bought. I'm not even finished the second filter (not even four months of owning) and this thing pops off repeatedly due to the shallow plastic threading on the tap mount having weakened to the point of no return. I have to gingerly turn the water on so I don't get a face full of water. really poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless","review":"Got one at BB&B; and it worked fine for about six weeks. If I wrote this review during that time, I would have given it four stars. My only complaint would have been the somewhat cumbersome switch between faucet water and the filter.That said, after about six weeks it no longer stays attached to the faucet. No matter how carefully and securely I reattach the unit to the faucet, it POPS off when I turn the water on, spraying me in the face in the process. Even using plumbing tape hasn't helped.I thought that maybe I just got a lousy unit, but after reading some of these reviews, there is apparently some kind of design flaw with this product. Save your money and buy a pitcher or a different brand of faucet filter that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic threads wear out easily","review":"I bought one, the cheap plastic threads connecting to the faucet wore out. So I bought another. And the cheap plastic threads connecting it to the faucet wore out -- even quicker. I frequently go to get a drink and find that it's spraying water into my face. Brita should be using metal threads which probably would cost them about $0.01 more. After two fast failures, I'm staying away from Brita filters. I don't know what to do with the bunch of extra filters I have.After months using a new Culligan filter, I strongly recommend the Culligan instead: $10 cheaper, AND more durable.

However, when the water filter got full of water it got heavy. As a result, the system repatedly fell off the faucet, even without being in use. The two treads on the plastic mounting cap are not sufficient to hold the heavy device.

The indicator light never reset, even after attempting the manual reset procedure several times.

Same problem with the new unit.

It did not last more than several weeks when the producted started seperating from the faucet and water was sprayed over everything. I contacted Brita and they replaced the unit and told me to use the metal connector instead of the plastic connector that came with the unit. I installed the unit, with the metal connector, on to the faucet and it worked well up until two weeks ago when it started leaking around the connector collar. I called Brita and they said that this could not be corrected. THe nice young lady offered to replace the unit but when she was told that this was a replacement unit the offer was withdrawn and substituted with a $5.00 gift certificate. Apparently the unit even though it was a little over a year old was out of warranty.

I thought there may have been an installation issue, however the unit is just a uncontrolled leak, from the fitting seams, from the unit, from the valve, etc. I just bought the pitcher model and deal with filling it up which is really no big deal, however do not waste you time or efforts on this absolute failure of a product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"The first unit kept falling off the tap so I got a second one. The second unit kept falling off the tap. Duh. The connecting piece is plastic and the water pressure pushes it off the tap, stripping the plastic threads. Water Pik makes a sturdier tap unit. I've taken to filtering that through a Brita pitcher filter into a glass pitcher....well, it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time fan of this system","review":"Best faucet system as it has not only regular flow and filter flow, but also a decent spray function so I don't always need to drag out the hand held sink spray for extra force cleaning/rinsing.

Yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine lasted over 3 years","review":"It started to leak a couple of days ago, so I'm buying another one. But it's lasted a long time for a device that costs under $25. I love the convenience of the sprayer when washing vegetables. Plus, and most especially, I love that taste of the water. Of course, that may be because I also have a Brita pitcher and I use faucet-filtered water in the Brita pitcher - Double filtered. I use the water from the pitcher to make ice as well. We'll see. If my new unit fails early, I'll switch to Pur. The only negatives are that my change-filter light never worked and that I have to re-tighten the device every so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!","review":"The faucet filter is made the same way (probably the same place) as the main competitor. But this version(\\"complete\\") is worth gold! We have saved soooo much in plastic bottles and new coffee makers. I love it. The threads should be brass, like the less expensive version, but outside of that, there is nothing better. The choice of filter, stream, or spray is what sets this faucet filter apart. I can get them to last about 2 years (if it is NOT used as a handle to move the faucet around). Have tried the less expensive version and hate it. It simply doesn't work very well. So save yourself the annoyance and buy the better version, treat it well, clean the faucet screen every month or two, DON'T use it as a handle, and you will be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trickle trickle","review":"Worked great for about 3 weeks, then the flow got painfully slow. It was literally filling our water pitcher drop by drop by the time we hit 4 weeks. The unit itself seemed be fine, when I removed the filter and turned on the tap, the water sprayed out the appropriate hole fine. We were told by Brita customer service that the filter probably got loaded down with particles that it filtered out of the water, so we changed the filter after 1 month. Now about 2 weeks later, we're starting to see the slow down again and we don't have heavy tap water. The system is good, but the filters aren't and it would be way too expensive to have to replace them every month. I never had that problem with the pitcher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita leaks baddly in 3 months. Metal faucet plastic Brita","review":"The Brita Ultra faucet filter system was working great up until about the 3 month mark and then it just started to leak more and more and now it leaks horribly. I tried to investigate the problem and I think its simply this: The Brita faucet system is completely plastic and the faucet it attaches to is metal, so the plastic and rubber have just worn down and don't make a good seal. I have only removed the system about 3 times to clean it, as it was getting fairly dirty from regular use. I would like to make a suggestion to help you: Write the date on the filter because the light, that tells you when to put a new filter on, malfunctions regularly. I am still going to try and keep mine working and will contact the company for assistance. Hope this helps. Ohh, when I got mine it didn't fit my faucet but I told the company and they sent another attachment that did work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"I bought this to replace the Brita pitcher, tiring of filling it every day. I just replaced it with the Brita Opti Max dispenser. I had no problem with the taste of the water, however the flow of the water was painfully slow and not cold. The thing with the pitcher was that the water came out ice cold, with this one you must use ice (every refill) and wait quite a bit of time. Much longer than the Opti Max. My water pressue is pretty good, so that wasn't the problem. I would not recommend this over the pitcher or Opti Max."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I purchased this unit and within two weeks the connection to the faucet started to leak.Try one of the under the sink filters instead, they are more cost effective and convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe it doesn't work at all","review":"From Day 1 water sprays out all over the place from the attachment to the faucet.

Returned within 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"I've had this filter for over two years and fortunately, about two months ago, I gave in and threw it out. This is a piece of junk: it sprays from every single place imaginable. Basically, when you want to get a glass of water, you get an additional free shower with it. Not what you wanna experience when it's 10 outside. Another issue is the one of the little plastic nob you have to turn to filter your water: after less than a year of usage it became impossible to turn so I was stuck with filtered water even when I didn't need it. I went out and bought the Culligan FM-15A. I am impressed by the quality difference: the Culligan is made with metal (not plastic) so the water doesn't spray everywhere (no small spills either). The nob is also made of metal and it goes back to its original position every time you close the tap. Finally, I don't hate using my sink anymore. Thanks Culligan."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAARRRGGHH!","review":"What a frustrating piece of junk; I can't recall any other inanimate object that I have wanted to punch so much as I would like to punch this thing.The similarly priced Pur filter that I bought previously broke after about a month so I decided to give Brita a try. It seemed OK for a few days, but then it just started falling off all the time.Literally every 3rd or 4th time it is used it either shoots water in my face and then falls off or just falls off. I diligently put it back in place, test it, usually get spared in the face a few more times, and eventually get it to stay. An hour later it's spraying my wife in the face.Horrible device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction and Waste of money","review":"Bought one that didn't fit right and leaked.

Replaced it with a Pur filter and have had NO problems from the instant it was installed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It falls off","review":"I used this once, for about 5 minutes after I installed it, to get some water for iced tea. The water in my apartment is terrible, but after coming out it of the filter it tasted OK.The problem is that next time I turned the faucet on, the filter shot off into the sink. I reattached it (making sure I had the threads lined up right and everything) and tried again, but the same thing kept happening. After the sixth time or so, the thing wouldn't even screw on at all. There's just not enough thread on the faucet for the filter to hook onto securely.I've problems with these things (a few different Brita and Pur units) in all but one place I've lived, so if you're going to buy one, make sure you've got more than just 3 or 4 threads on the end of your faucet. And don't put any fragile dishes underneath the thing until you're sure it'll stay on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry ....","review":"Drip, drip, drip. One drip at a time.

It comes with two plats tic adapters which customer service admits are bad. They will send you new metal adapters with longer threads, but these are back ordered and may take two days or may take a month to be shipped to you. Although they admit their customers all ask for an estimate of the backlog, they can't or won't talk to other departments in their company to find out how long the backlog is. Their customer service staff is extremely RUDE and almost antagonistic from the start of the call. Their customer service staff were a textbook example of how NOT to handle phone calls.

The threads to attach to the faucet are of such low quality that they strip. leak and spray all over the place with any movement at all. The seals and gaskets are about as cheap as you can imagine, and their durability is zero. Tightening the threads, dislodge the washer and you get leaks. If the washer stays misaligned you have back flow through the faucet bypass and you get unpure water spraying into your cup. I cannot imagine a worse design. Shame on you, brita. You should be apologizing for this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consistently disappointing - develops leaks in 2-3 months","review":"I have always used Brita filters since the first drip pitcher came out. I love the taste of the treated water, but don't like how biofilm builds up if you don't clean the pitcher frequently. So I switched to the faucet version. While the water still tastes great, the faucet filter has many physical flaws. As mentioned many times before, you need to get the metal adapter. Also, I find that the filter does not click into place as it should. It still works, but seems to ride a little high on my base unit. The switch to change between flow through and filtered water is hard to get a good grip on and difficult to turn. My twelve year old daughter could barely use it. When my first base unit sprung a leak within a few months, I chalked it up to bad luck. When my SECOND unit had the same failure, I decided enough is enough. i switched to a Culligan and so far could not be happier. The design is so much better than Brita's."},{"rating":"1","title":"brita is a rip off","review":"When the base and filter work its great that is if it works when you buy it that's 50% of the time or if it works after several months thats about 50% of the time.The base is supposed to be reusable well it is 50% of the time.

The reason is, besides getting extremely slow water stream from the filter, you are putting yourself more danger if you overuse the filter. Because the stuff the filter has been filtering clogs it up and if you overuse it you are pretty much drinking those accumulated and harmful stuff.Now for those who complain about the plastic connector, I believe they over-tighten the connector to worn it out. Use some Plumber's Tape (2 to 3 layers around the faucet tip should do) before you put the connector on and do not over-tighten. You can get the tape from a hardware store and it costs about less than two dollars for a small roll. And it will last the connector forever with no leaks, no falling off, etc.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Plastic and Money","review":"At first it seemed to fit my tap and work well although switching to tap water took a little force, but within days it was leaking and popping of the faucet constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay on the faucet","review":"No matter what I do I can't get this filter to stay connected to the faucet. I even called Brita's customer service and asked them to send me faucet adapters (Brita will send them for free). None of the adapters helped the filter stay on. Any water pressure above a trickle will cause this filter to fall off. If I accidentally bump it while washing dishes, it falls off and water sprays everywhere. I even applied plumber's tape to the adapter before connecting the filter. If the filter manages to stay on for more than half a day, water will start to leak out of the top part of the connector, then it turns into an upward stream until the whole things falls off and water goes everywhere. Shortly after receiving the filter, the indicator light stopped working. After several months of trying to make this filter work, I gave up.Very poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Design with plastic parts","review":"We had a PUR Faucet filter, but it would only last one round of filters before leaking all over the place, so we tried Brita instead. This filter was worse because before I even had a chance to use the filter, the pressure of turning on the water forced the whole filter system off of the faucet, due to the fact that Brita uses cheap plastic parts, especially the threading inside the connector. This ended up stripping the threads and made the product useless. I would not recommend this filter. The PUR filter at least lasted through one filter, but I'm shopping around for other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wont Stay On Faucet","review":"So far, so good.

No matter how carefully you installed the device, whether you screwed it on the faucet too tight or too loose, it would eventually fall off. This is because of the cheap, plastic bearing used to connect the faucet to the device.THE SOLUTION: Buy a metal bearing! I went down to my hardware store and bought a sturdy metal connector ring for $3. It was the exact same size and fit perfectly. It even had more strands for a more secure fit with the filter.This problem is soo bad without the metal bearing that I'm convinced they never actually tested it. Besides this issue, it's a pretty great filter. Does the job and is economical. Saves me from buying plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"keeps falling off my faucet, sprays water everywhere","review":"I bought this because I was tired of constantly filling the Brita pitcher, and because the on-tap system was on sale for about $16 at a local grocery store.On numerous occassions, when I turn the water on in the filter position, the whole unit has shot off the faucet landing with a big KLUNK in my sink. And it's a pain in the neck to get it back on.A few minutes ago, I turned it on, and it just sprayed water all over me and my floor like a geyser.

The \\"loose\\" setting leaks a tremendous flow of water. The \\"tight\\" setting filters about 2 L of water before violently exploding, shooting the filter like a rocket into your sink. What's worse is that I can find no evidence of the threads actually stripping! Meaning that some overpaid oaf in quality control actually missed this little gem.

That was the case with mine and it fell of within miutes of installation. Even when it stays on you can't really touch it without it falling off. FWIW, I've remodeled and installed several bathrooms and kitchens - I'm very familiar with plumbing. I went over everything carefully when I installed it and even tried alternate washers to see if they might get a little extra more room for the threads to engage. The bottom line is that the insert is under-sized for the load the filter and water pressure put on it. They should have made the insert longer and probably out of brass or something more substantial than the plastic they used. Britta should be ashamed of putting their name on this product. Don't waste your time with this if you sink threads are on the inside of the faucet. I don't know about using it with externally threaded faucets but I would look for a better overall engineered unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great taste but do not last...","review":"This product seems to only design to last max 1 year as it will start to leak like crazy.

It is difficult to navigate the frog with the arrow keys, and this can get very frustrating. I was very disappointed, as I thought it would be a good game for computer use.

It's still not as quiet as the Febreze model Odor Eliminator, but the 04269 does a champion job of reducing odor. If you buy from DollarRite with Amazon fulfillment, you'll get the pet filter included, which is thicker than the basic carbon filter. Also, the sheer circumference of the ventilated portion of the 04269 is bigger than the Febreze model (keep in mind, however, the unit itself is also a little bigger, if space is at a premium).I still prefer the Febreze model Odor Eliminator for its quiet fan, but this model runs a close second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for small spaces","review":"This unit is great for small areas like closets, utility rooms, small bathrooms, etc. As another reviewer mentioned, a larger unit is needed for medium to large sized rooms. I most recently used the unit in a hallway, just outside of the room where the cat's litter box is located, to keep any odor from drifting to the rest of the house, and it worked very well. The filters always seemed to last longer than I expected them to, so I really feel that I get my money's worth.*The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

The modest Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) decides that he wants to rent it, since it is hard to find apartments in Paris. After a house-warming party he is warned by the owner that he cannot hold such a racket late at night, and this is the beginning of the neighborly stalking of Trelkovsky as he moves within his own apartment. As the plot thickens, the motive behind suicide of the former tenant seems to reveal itself to Trelkovsky and it warns him to proceed with caution. Everyone who once lived wall-to-wall with a neighbor can relate to The Tenant as it produces an unsettling cinematic experience that will give grounds for thoughts to question the character of your neighbors."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUBBED!","review":"Ugh, Amazon does not tell its customers that the streaming version of this movie is DUBBED!

I understand the theme of paranoia ingrained in the movie, I understand that he was so nervous about people accepting him, that his mind shattered and he dressed up as the woman that used to live there. You see the contrast between him and \\"Real\\" men in the movie. But at the same time, the ending was too much, especially with him screaming at seeing \\"Himself\\" at the end, it just was too out there. And the subtle hints of his paranoia, really hid any terror behind this film. I enjoy a strange and slow flick, I loved the ninth gate. This just wasn't my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie to fall asleep to...","review":"Sorry but Roman Polanski has done so much better then this. I have the movie and love the movie Rosemary's Baby so, that is why I bought The Tenant. I was so excited when I received it that I had to watch it as soon as possible. I remember Rosemary's Baby keeping my attention from start to finish when I first watched it. The Tenant sounds much better then it is. I about fell asleep during it. I yawned a lot. I thought it was supposed to be scary but NOT! All the story is about is a tenant played by Roman Polanski that basically argues with his new neighbors because of him making too much noise in the apartment complex. The owner threatens to kick him out a few times. I am not kidding about my description of this movie, that is about all there is to it. How boring and how disappointed I was considering the fact that Rosemary's Baby was really a good flick. Nothing against Polanski because I usually like his stuff. If you want a good movie of his don't pick this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It makes no sense.","review":"'The Tenant' is a film by Roman Polanski that has been forgotten by most of the film community, and for good reason because it makes no sense and is downright awful. It stars Polanski himself as a shy and timid new tenant to an apartment complex. He soon realizes that his neighbors are extremely sensitive and don't like the slightest disturbance. He learns the former tenant before him had committed suicide. A dress of the former tenant is left behind, and for some reason, not explained in the film, Polanski keeps the dress throughout the entire movie. As the story progresses, Polanski grow increasingly paranoid of his neighbors, having bizzare hallucinations at night.The movie is well done because of the talented director, but the story is too far-out and absurd to take seriously. There are some creepy moments, while others are embarrassing, but the entire film is ruined by the ridiculous ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaawn","review":"I don't know where to begin. I read all the reviews before I even bought this movie and all sounded great. I have to say I thought it was a horrible movie. It's about this man who moves into this building and wants to fit in but his so called strange neighbors make it hard. He picks up this woman at a bar and I don't even remember if anything happened (still don't know why they threw that in).

What I should have done is checked out Roger Ebert's 1976 review where he gave it 1 star out of 4. Roman Polanski of course, starred and directed this mess which I think was supposed to be a psychological thriller. Well, there are no thrills except when Polanski's character throws himself out a 3 story window, only to survive, climb back up the stairs and try it again. Unfortunately, that wasn't done until the end of the movie, but hey it is pretty funny, if unintended. After dragging out the NoDoz, I was curious to see if I had correctly figured this out, but along the way became so distracted by the various combinations of American/English accents and obvious dubs in what is clearly Paris, I lost interest. This movie is dumb, dumb, dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Package...That's It?!?!?!?","review":"Great film, worthy of four stars, but...The DVD packaging is pathetic! Just a trailer!

Long stretches of time where nothing happens, something quickly happens, then we are back to the monotonous pace - excruciating to watch. Never have I checked and checked to see how much of a film was left.The story sounds really good and gripping - tenant moves into the apartment of a woman who committed suicide. He feels something is going on with the building, the manager, and the other tenants. Slowly, he begins to identify with the dead girl. But the pace is so slow. The main character, played by Roman Polanski, is so boring and unsympathetic that you wish he would just jump out of the window and get it over with. He has a beautiful girl interested in him - why?The end - which I won't reveal - is absurd instead of unsettling, mainly because of the duration of time it took to get to that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right For The Price","review":"For about $10 this absolutely crushes the cheap sounding cables.

At first without doing anything it didn't really have an impact on the dark brown splotches on the carpet... but with about 5 seconds of blotting and rubbing the carpet the stains disappeared.

As soon as I heard Daniel start singing I was laughing so hard I had to pause the DVD.Genius? In a room of mental patients maybe. The fact that Daniel cannot sing and can barely play the guitar make me wonder why people admire him so much. I think the funniest thing in the entire movie is that TWO major labels were actually in a bidding war for him. and his album went on to sell less than 6,000 copies! I'm sure the guy that signed him is flipping burgers at Wendy's now.As a film, its not bad.

And what a life he has had. The whole story is almost mythological, really. The best part of the doc. is how well Daniel managed to record his life over the years using tape recorders, cameras etc. The filmmakers must have wet their pants when Daniel handed that stuff over.

Overall we were very disappointed with this accessory."},{"rating":"2","title":"great addition to the fp3 player","review":"I bought this for my daughters--now 4 and 6 yrs two years ago. It is still a well used item for them. The volume is good, it has been dropped and swung around many times and still works great. They have used it indoors and outdoors on camping trips, in the car and at home. The controls are easy for them to use on their own. I recommend this for everyone who buys the fp3 player--especially if you have more than one child. I haven't found that we need to replace the batteries too often--the speakers shut off themselves if it goes a while without being used."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"Bought for grand-daughters 3rd BD along with MP3 player and case. A bit expensive when you have to pay for all the pieces separately but you really need all three to really enjoy. Hoping to speaker are going to last. Seems they can brake easily if dropped. Also, the fitting where the mp3 player snaps in is not a real tight fit, therefore it moves around and you end up static and have to readjust it. Overall, it's a very enjoyable thing to have just watching the kids sing and dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"My three year old loves this toy.

It has all of the classic elements of a space opera: a complicated war with forces of neither good nor evil, complete character transformations, a love triangle, and brilliant animation and dubbing. The only disapointment is that the quality of the footage has not been remastered the way it could have been for the long-awaited DVD release. However, this complaint is offset by the ridiculously low price. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This got me hooked on anime!","review":"I remember watching Robotech on the SciFi channel before I went to school each morning.

The authors burden themselves with too many characters, but have no interest in realistic dialgoue--everything sounds tinny and fake.The chapters are uniformly short (3-4 pages, tops), which makes reading easy. The plot is ho-hum; standard thriller stuff, with an admirable twist at the end. However, this book could have been so much more--Darden could offer an interesting in-depth look into criminal prosecution, but instead contents himself to do a half-baked job.

Growing up in California I've been a hard core Oakland a's and San Fransico Giants fan. Reading this book makes you love the Yankees. Mr.Mcough's writing gives you the feeling that you're actually at the baseball game. Matt gives you a full on description of everything he does and if he does something bad or gets in trouble it makes you relate when something like that happened to you. It's great description and humor this definitely a must read for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Read!","review":"There are so many wonderful moments in this book that I don't know where to begin: the naive and persistent phone calls that led to the job, the letter McGough's father wrote him on his first day of work (read it and see if you don't shed a tear), the part where McGough loses his meal money to fellow players playing blackjack on the team plane, and a relief pitcher gives him a $100 bill, the road trip to Fenway Park, where the players set him up on his first date... the list goes on, but even more poignant are the personal experiences McGough had with heroes Don Mattingly and Jim Abbott, who are portrayed as both noble and funny.

However, this time I bought two of these and they have cheapened up the cup dramatically. The original cup was well built and sturdy. These new \\"improved\\" models are really junk. The handle broke clean off in two days of use. I couldn't believe it when the handle fell off as it is now just glued on. Also, they just had to change the diameter of the power cord slightly so my older cords no longer work. The plastic is now so flimsy you can see light through it.

They all had mothers, families, and were as anxious to get through the war as anyone else. This excellent book also fills in a lot of the missing details that for some reason were edited from the movie. For instance, we see the Miller's squad drive away in a Jeep... then they are walking. In the movie, so much happens that it is easy to overlook this gap. Also, when Wade is shot, the book explains much better how it happened. In the film, you have to wonder why Wade didn't stay behind instead of Upham. For those of us who have seen the film over and over, it's likely we'll want to read the book over and over too.

If you can put up with seeing nuns getting beaten , doing drugs , getting raped and then killing the bad guys . well my friends this is the movie for you . The story is sort of weak and the acting is what you might expect , but lots of T & A and killing make up for the weaker points I mentioned . The movie leaves off with the suggestion that there is going to be a part 2 . So for me and I am grading it on the type of movie it is certainly not expecting an oscar quality film . I liked it overall , it shocked me at times, being a catholic I was left shaking my head . But again its a different kind of movie , you expect killing and blood , you expect T & A and you get pleanty of both along with the shock quality just based on the theme alone .

Like most guys, I love watching hot naked girls with guns. Unfortunately, this movie is just an excuse to show rape scenes. The director seems to really have an infatuation with rape. I think these scenes are supposed to be titillating and are supposed to turn on the audience. I mean, how many rape scenes are too much? I say this movie has that amount (at least 3; I shut it off at that point). This movie has the title of a B-Movie that should be fun to have a few beers and watch. But I just felt sick and shut it off eventually. What is so fun about watching a bunch of rape scenes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grindhouse","review":"This movie is a \\"Grind house\\" masterpiece.

The characters are less fully realized than the stuff of Harlequin romances. There's a crying lack of detail in plot and setting. As just one example, Phillip cooks a meal of \\"Chinese food.\\" Yawn. This is typical. By the end of the story, we have the protagonist accepting a proposal and she still doesn't know what he does for a living. We don't know what she does, either. These are formless characters living in a void.Far worst of all, as bdsm novels go, this is as about as tame and lame as you can find. A little light bondage, a couple of smacks to the butt, that's it. Ho-hum. She's broken, but in no time at all. No wonder.

The whitening results are great, but after using this 9.5% gel for 20 minutes, I experienced intense, shooting pain in one tooth and had to remove the product before the recommended minimum of 30 minutes. It's strange because I do have one particular tooth that is quite sensitive, but that one did not bother me at all during the treatment and a tooth that has never bothered me reacted so strongly. I plan to continue using the 9.5% product in shorter intervals and hope to prevent further pain/sensitivity, but this may not result in good whitening.In the future I will stick to the 7.5% strength, which caused only mild sensitivity with use. If you have sensitive teeth, you should definitely go with the weaker solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Aware Product Burns Gums","review":"I have been in dentistry for 17 years, so have some knowledge on tooth whitening.

I tried again the next day and again after a few minutes it started burning again. So I went back to the old product Nite White which I had a little of, but it was out of date and so when I used it, nothing happened to whiten my teeth. Yesterday, I tried again and after putting trays in it burned a little but left them in 45 minutes, when I took them out my gums were bleeding and raw, today they are raw and purple, now they will need a few days to heal hopefully back to their natural healthy state. I will never use this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expired Product","review":"I received a Day White 9.5% ACP teeth whitening kit from SmileMedic. The product description indicated that the product would have a 12-18 month expiration period. The kit arrived with the expiration date deliberately removed from the kit.

I will not order another product from SmileMedic."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 25% effective in whitening my teeth","review":"I was reluctant to order this product based on the reviews on your website but thought I would try it because of the price.

Sometimes one press of the recessed button would do it, sometimes it would take a some unknown pattern of button-pushes that could only be discovered by trial-and-error, other times only re-installing the batteries and removing and re-inserting the USB transmitter would do it. Using a mouse should not require five minutes of experiments. After about a week, it entered a deep sleep - a coma, really - from which I could find no way to awaken it, despite twenty minutes of trying everything in every combination.Finally, I discovered a solution: I returned it to the store, and got a mouse made by another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"I have to agree with the number of reviews against this mouse.

For that price? This is a damned good deal and a competent wireless mouse to boot. Anything over the normal Big Lots price of 13$ is probably pushing it. I use this occasionally in conjunction with my netbook (which has a mousing area the size of a gnat). At first, I thought it had tracking issues, but nope, my table was just too shiny. I moved it to a matte surface and it worked perfectly. It's very responsive and hasn't given me any problems. I love that it turns itself off after a minute or two when not in use, which saves the batteries.Long story short, I'd recommend this mouse to anyone who doesn't use one on a regular basis and is just looking for a cheap travel mouse or addition to their net/notebook.

That is because it presents only one side of the theological controversies, the Roman Catholic viewpoint. Little to no attempt to present the Eastern view of such matters as Papal primacy and infallibility and the dual procession of the Holy Spirit in any form other than that of simplistic caricature. The only possible value I see in this book is its reprinting of Thomas Aquinas' \\"Contra Errorem Graecorum\\" (\\"On the Error of the Greeks\\") which is of historical value, and also may contribute to an appreciation of the narrow and dubious theological grounds on which such doctrines as the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son really rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern proof-texting","review":"If one wants a book which simply forwards a narrow opinion which in the ends has the stick of a personal adgenda then this book is for you.Just like a good fiction thriller \\"based on a true story\\", this book leads you into a false reality by propping up advantageous insight and history, justify's them with well selected proof-texts, ignores glaring holes and contrary facts, and then presents the conclusions as a professional work.For anyone who is looking for an honest and serious scholarly assesment, then they should keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was better stuff back then than now","review":"how lucky I was to be in the Bay Area when all these great bands were here, cowboy junkies, forget 'em. rovers had it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick release problem","review":"As with another reviewer, the quick release is a problem.

There were a few times I actually had to remove the head completely in order to get the camera off of it. Ridiculous!!!The other night it jammed and the doggone lever fell off! I had little springs and ball bearings flying everywhere. Not pretty.Now the head is useless. It's only one year old and it not only caused me countless headaches, embarrassment, and aggravation until it finally fell apart in my hands.I cannot say enough bad about this product.

Now, that I'm older and hopefully wiser, the Robotech series still holds a magic and amazement for me that is timeless. The series is great from beginning to end. It's about time that the series is released in it's entirety on DVD. The only drawback appears to be that in the first installment, you're only getting one third of the Macross Saga.

But you cant blame me if i want a little extra from the DVD. The sound quality and the picture quality could be a little better than the regular TV quality. I think the encoding is the sole dislike i had over the dvds. The bonus DVD is superb and it means something extra for the ones like me who first watched Robotech dubbed in Turkish ( or other languages).

Not enough to fill a room, let alone a sleeping area. You have to put your face directly over the machine to even get the effects. You can put menthol liquid in the reservoir, but it holds only a very small amount and the reservor it is slanted in a way that makes it drip all over the place and run down the machine.

The punctuated equilibria thing, his flirtation with saltationism, and his mingling of politics with science are more than I can stand.Yet this book is a terrible one -and I mean in the bad sense. 700 pages long, it devotes the first 150 or so to sound-bites arguments against Gould, which come close to character assassination, rethorical accusations, and name calling. More shocking, the next 550 pages are a list -an unending list of thousands upon thousands of purportedly modular behaviours, with no references or description whatsoever, that 'prove' Gould was wrong.I had hoped to read a good book on evolutionary biology, a serious rebuttal of Gould theories. This book is definitely not one of those. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gould was right..........as ussual","review":"The late Stephen Gould's analysis of humanity angered many of his coleages, co workers, and created a great many critics. This book calls into question many of thos views, and, as they are supported by hard science on Stephen's part, I find it sad that the author waited until after Stepehn's passing to launch into this tirade. Although the author has a right to the ideas placed before us, we as thinking consumers also have the right to disregard opinion, inuendo, subterfuge and professional jealousy. And I believe many of us will do just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad cd...","review":"Bought it to have the radio edit that made this song famous; unfortunately!

I really enjoyed his book The Death and Life of Bobby Z. So I got a copy of this movies to see what the film version was like.

Things don't go as planned, however, and Kearney ends up on the run with Bobby Z's 12-year-old son. While it's no worse than much of the action movie junk that makes it to theatres, Bobby Z, originally entitled The Death and Life of Bobby Z, is a action thriller with Tim Kearney (Walker) as the hero. Filled with head scratching twists and cornball dialogue, this is not exactly a brilliant movie. Yet it's got a slick look and at least a few passably enjoyable action scenes. This movie is funny, entertaining and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad.","review":"I started to watch this movie thinking it was going to be a good action-filled movie. Good actors, good story. What can be wrong with this?Well, everything! It is probably one of the most boring movies that I have seen in years!

I couldn't take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good...held my interest.","review":"I enjoyed this movie alot. I know some other reviewers didn't like it, but if you keep in mind this is a fairly low budget, direct to dvd movie (at least in North America), you'll find that you get drawn into the story and enjoy the ride.

I'm replacing a Radio Shack Model: 15-1985 which failed after a year (the second one to do this).This unit is one of the few reasonably priced ones that feature two independent outputs so you can watch one source and simultaneously record a second (different) source.Also because one of the inputs (Input 3) has jacks on both the front and rear of the unit AND you can switch between these, it is really a 5 input, 2 output A/V switch.The only drawback is that the unit is not powered, so there is no internal conversion between composite video and S-Video which means that all your sources and outputs must be one or the other (i.e. no mixing).

[In my opinion] the extent of this author's research into Alzheimer's research basically seems to consist of attending one single meeting on the topic, interviewing a handful of people there, and presenting some limited views and notions on what might cause the disease. [I believe there was] no in-depth research into what's known about this this disease -- only a quick snapshot of some Alzheimer's research presented one week at a meeting a couple of years ago. The \\"science\\" that is presented is trivialized and presented in tabloid format.

I happened across The Forgetting in a bookstore, being the intense browser that I am, and was immediately attracted to the portrayal of the subject matter.I enjoyed each page of The Forgetting. With every word, and each carefullly crafted sentence I began to see a different world, one I had been ignorant of and blind too.I discovered the severity of an illness, which in all likelyhood will continue to spread, and battled with humanity's inability to cure this storm of the century.David Shenk guides the reader through the history of Alzheimer's and the very little knowledge we have accrued on a illness which has hit its centennial mark.

That would have been a danger and at that point the dogs could have gotten them caught on something. We bought two of them, one Small and X-Small.

The book was enjoyable, and many times I wanted to reach inside and shake some sense into Becky. The character of Jake was great! We need more men like him. Sam, the housekeeper was a great addition to the book, not to mention Catherine and Lucas. I really enjoyed this book by Fran Shaff. I look forward to more of her books to read.

Imagine, a gel made especially for shaving in the shower! I started using it and haven't looked back. I was so happy to see it available on Amazon, since I've never seen it for sale in any retail store around me.

Throughout this text, O'Hara explores the diverse concerns of political punks, like: queer liberation, feminism, peace, anti-fascism, ecology and animal rights. Especially fun are the numerous photos and illustrations that grace each page, giving the reader a richer perspective on the history, politics and aesthetics of the punk rock movement. On a less cheerful note, O'Hara also delves into the ways punk rock has been co-opted by corporate record labels and perverted by certain (marginal) hate groups.

He's a hippie punk with crusty leanings, which means love, peace, anarchy and not bathing too often, and the whole history of punk is redefined to the point of pretending most everything else doesn't exist.It's hysterical reading his mental gymnastics when describing Anarchy as both violent and peaceful. This book is soooooooo poorly done. It's not a history at all, but an editorial steeped in wishful thinking and limited mental resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the punx are united, they will never be divided","review":"O'Hara's personal feelings completely undermine any compelling argument he begins to make. He includes no evidence, other than a few random quotes from zines he's selected, for his accusations (against Straight Edge punks, against Oi punk, etc.). The book is a biased attempt at personal expression of his feelings about punk--not a comprehensive overview of what Punk means to so many people in the scene. And it isn't even well-written.

None of these shows are available on dvd in the US so for now, I'd say snatch them up.Most of the events are just the main card with no pre-lims. 32 gives you the results of the pre-lims.33 is the weird show.

How much short where these people of paying for decient sound editing?The background noise drounded out the dialog and the 5.1 dolby would not register on my system (I checked with other videos and my system was fine).The special effects did not match the dialog. An example would be the order for the earth forces ships not to fire, every one agreeing not to, and every ship is shown firing. They do a very brief FX on the 100s of earth ships vs thousands of Martian ships and show it over and over.

(I'm Not Exagerating)","review":"Don't buy this movie. Don't rent it. Don't watch it for free. Don't give it as a gag gift. Don't even use the DVD as a coaster.Everything about this film is ludicrous, and if C. Thomas Howell had any sense he'd have paid money to keep this movie from being released. The script is nonsensical. The acting is laughable. The costumes and scenery are horrible, even by low-budget standards. The \\"special effects\\" are embarrassing. The music often overpowers the dialogue. There is not a single redeeming thing about this project. Most films that get this far off the tracks are canceled before they are completed.

Thomas Howell was once a very promising young actor, but after this mess (he wrote/directed/and starred in it), you have to question whether he's lost his judgment or if he's just that desperate for work."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE! JUST TERRIBLE!!","review":"I don't even have the words to describe how bad this movie is. It is nothing like the first one, which I loved. I purchased the blu-ray version cheap, and now I know why. Not the sellers fault tho. I seen the bad reviews, but decided to get it because it was cheap. I thought maybe I would have a different opinion. I was dead wrong. It isn't even worth $8.00 on blu-ray. Read all the DVD reviews on this before you buy. Why would this embarrassing, shameful excuse of a movie, even hit blu-ray. waste of time and effort. A true real stinker. stay away from this movie. Recommended for frisbee throwing with your dog and friends, or torturing your enemies by forcing them to watch it. Your enemies will be begging for mercy if you force them to view this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than Waterboarding","review":"I have seen some underwhelming flicks before, but this one is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Forcing someone to watch this movie would probably constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention. The acting is so poor it would make blind children cry. This movie is even worse than the musical Burt Reynolds starred in way back when.Send copies of this to Guantanomo and force the terrorist prisoners to watch it and Amnesty International and the ACLU would be ranting about torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker not worth the one star I gave it","review":"I gave this mess one star for the Special Effects, overall this makes Ed Woods Plan 9 from Outer Space seem like Gone with the wind.The door was open for a real good sequel but they fell way short of the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any movie that makes me laugh this much is not all bad","review":"This is a pretty bad sequel .This a a B movie. Some of the effects, acting and editing is pretty damn funny. The story will leave you cheering for the end of the world . But when you have a lower budget film trying to be a main stream movie it makes for some funny humor .When I watch a movie like this I am expecting it to be HIGHLY FLAWED. But that is what makes it funny. If you want to watch a serious Movie and be entertained by a Major Production ....this is not it . But if you look at this one and cant Laugh ...You are way to serious .Lets face it .....We All knew going in this Movie is a stinker in a BIG way. Just look at the NON STARS in the lead roles. But it is funny to me because it tries to be good. I didnt waste time watching it because its fun to laugh. If you got some time to kill this is a good one as any to goof on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't seen special effects shots repeated so many time since the original BSG.","review":"And yet there's something strangely compelling about movies made this way. Maybe it's seeing how epic they are trying to be with obviousely limited financing. This is the way cheap sci-fi movies of our era are made, and how do they compare with the really cheap sci-fi movies of the 1950's? I'd say this movie is better than at least some of them. I would advise watching it without any additional out-of-pocket expense, and late at night after you're too brain-dead to do anything else, including watching a more challenging and substantive movie. It sort of needs a guy and two robots in the lower right corner, but making up your own humor on the way through is fun too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story by CLAMP!","review":"I love all the books so far in the X/1999 series!

Since I am home most of the time, I thought I'd save some money and heat the house this way. At this point, three are no longer functioning. The first two heaters just don't turn on any more -- the lights come on, but the fan does not. With one, the heating element comes on even without the fan coming on. With the 3rd malfunctioning heater, it caused a short and small fire in the outlet (scary I didn't notice when it actually occured but rather noticed the singe marks on the outlet and plug). I stopped using the only one that is still working. I would not recommend this heater to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Like Burning","review":"I ordered this product and didn't get the chance to use it until after the 30 days to return it expired, so now I am stuck with it.

The second thing is it only stays on for less than 5 minutes then shuts off due to it gets too hot and then you have to wait 1/2 hour for it to cool down before you can turn it on again. This was disappointing because now I have to get a different heater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great heater at a great cost!","review":"We bought this heater on the recommendation of a friend to heat our baby's room. For some reason his room is the coolest in the house. He refuses to sleep under a blanket and as a result would cry in the middle of the night. We bought this heater, and our nights have been quiet.

Not the most advanced feature set, but when you're really stinkin' cold, ya just don't actually care about that, you care that it makes heat well and fast. I'm thankful for the speed with which it warms up the room, it has saved me from complete & utter discomfort during times the building boiler has had issues. This little electric gizmo is a perfect supplement for drafty days at home, perfect for toe-warming under the desk at the office (sh, don't tell the building cuz they don't allow), or a great savior for the nights when technical difficulties make it your only heat source.

It picked up the pine needles and crumbs just fine.It is great when I do not want to drag out the vacuum but...you know there has to be a 'but'... the handle is too short for tall people.

I just need a heavier, better one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nifty little sweeper","review":"This sweeper works just great for my large area rug that the kids drop crumbs on.

Great price, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep cleans","review":"I loved this bissel sweeper, excellent product for such a low price. extremely handy, perfect for small spaces but I have used it to clean the whole house. It deep cleans by picking up hair and dust that even a regular vaccuem leaves behind. I have used it for two months, I use it as I often as I need it for quick picker ups. recommended improvements would be to make stronger brushes but it still works beautifully with the ones it comes with. I normally avoid writing reviews but this product makes life a little bit easier, I would recommend it for all college students and for quick bedroom cleaning and for anyone else. It does not need to be plugged in, no batteries required, and no noise involved. environmentally friendly. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"After putting this product together I noticed that it is rather short. I'm 5'5 and I had to bend down to make it work properly.

It is silly. It's like a bad portrayal of a strong woman still being dominated by the big bad male. I have quit reading Lindsey's works. She used to be interesting. Then she got into too much abuse of women. Rapes, nasty men, etc. I can find something better to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unromantic","review":"I was searching for this book for a while after seeing all the great reviews. What a total waste of time. There was nothing but lust. Actually it felt like the author did not understand even lust, let alone romance. The punishment for women is keep her on sexual high for hours and hours? Where did the author come up with that? Ridiculous! Unfortunately this 'punishment' is meeted out more than once, making me suffer with irritation. The 'warrior' woman being fully submissive in the name of honor simply conflicted with her strong character. Challan was the only one I could tolerate. I have read other books by Johanna Lindsey and this was definitely her worst book.I completely agree with every review giving it a 1 star. I just wanted to write my own review to bump up the number of 1 stars. I was misled by the number of 5 stars versus 1 stars (my usual check when deciding on a book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"My husband, sci fi fan, and I were on a summer road trip when I picked this book up.

For me, believable characters and their struggle with themselves and their counterparts along with an interesting and intelligent story told in a captivating language are most important. Sex is part of such a relationship and I can enjoy a tender scene that is put in the right context and light. Warrior's Woman has non of this! The characters are flat and their relationship make as much sense as one between a cat and a whale. Sex (arousal as punishment!) and physical prowess are the only two subjects in this one-sentence story-line written for the verbal level of a nine-year-old. At first I was wondering whether the author wanted to write a satire or test the intelligence of her readers. A look at Amazon's Sales Rank of this book and some of the reviews here gave me the answer and the final blow to my confidence in \\"bestseller\\" lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is generous","review":"I am a JL fan and I would like to say that I have read all of her books. Unfortunately, I could not even finish this one. When I saw that it was rated 5 stars I flipped out. This book was terrible. Maybe I am not a futuristic type of woman but please!!!

Martha and Tedra stummble across the planet Sha-Ka'an, and right into the arms of Challen. Tedra challenges him to a battle, and when she loses she becomes Challen's slave for a month.

Tedra & Cahallen are by far my favourite characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully dumb.","review":"This was one of the dumbest books I've read in a long time. The author introduces a supposedly \\"kick ass\\" (literally) heroine who's a member of her planet's security forces, who turns into a shrill, bitchy, pain-the-ass when she meets the first man who's ass she can't kick. I was disgusted as Tedra was at turns petulant child and hysterical ninny. I expected to dislike Challen because of his \\"barbaric\\" ways, but he actually turned out to be the mature adult in that relationship. I actually felt sorry for him.On top of that, the sci-fi aspects of this story were pretty pathetic. Tedra is from a plant in a completely different galaxy from ours, yet her speech is peculiarly American: she refers to \\"humanoids,\\" uses the terms \\"babe\\" and \\"sweetcakes\\" incessantly, among other things. Science fiction obviously is not this author's strong suit.In short, I struggled to finish this book. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"This book is an amazing book.

If you don't take it seriously, it's great fun. I own the hardback and read it quite often. The sequel, KEEPER OF THE HEART, is also good. The third book, HEART OF A WARRIOR, is disappointing. Readers may want to skip this one entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it.","review":"I have read this book three times so far, and I still enjoy it.

Not Lindsey's fault that the book's cover mentions nothing about it being futuristic and it was in the historical fiction section of the bookstore, but I can not even envision the love story mixed with phazers, lazers, and tazers. Too Star Trekki for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rambling, superficial accounting of desperate events.","review":"Choosing a fictional novel is an infrequent happening for me.

The list price here seems to be roughly $70. Quite honestly, you could go to Target and buy a Casio that is far more sturdy and has more features for the same retail price.The band on this watch is very inflexible, stiff rubber and doesn't conform to the wrist very well. The dial around the outer edge is plastic, not metal. In fact it's so plastic-like that you can sometimes see the light gleem through. The numbered ring also doesn't turn very easily and needs to be forced.I'm not that familiar with the Freestyle brand, but this watch really isn't worth more than $20 if you look at other competitors.

I would stay clear of this and other hover brands of similar make as a $200 plus cleaner should last more than a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first day","review":"On the first day we used it, it caught the fringe of a throw carpet and wound it around the brush -- which is not an uncommon occurence. What is uncommon is after unwinding what it caught, then spit out bits of black plastic, and then the brush made a quite a racket when it was being used. Luckily, we bought from a good retailer, and they took it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Quality has Slipped","review":"This vacuum performed very poorly from the beginning and now has completely locked up, merely skimming over the carpet without cleaning at all. It is shoddilymanufactured, notable from the start when attemptingto attach the handle. First, the belts malfunctioned andhad to be replaced. Next, the brush roll needed replacing [$39]. All this happened after only very little use. Such poor quality and performance by Hoover shocked me--I have bought Hoover products for many years but will no longer do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWER PACKED--U PAY THE PRICE","review":"I PURCHASED THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF THIS VACUUM.

THE HOSE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH GIVE AND IF YOU PULL TOO HARD THE VACUUM WILL TIP OVER. BELTS ARE A PROBLEM AND THEY ARE A BEAR TO CHANGE, NO OFFENSE TO BEARS. I THINK HOOVER VACUUMS ARE THE BEST BUT A LIGHTER MODEL FOR UNDER $200 WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST FINE.

However... the vacuum is only two years old and yesterday it sparked and then started to smoke and filled the house with an awful smell. I've since done searches and found that an unreliable motor has plagued this vacuum, so I'm hesitant to buy another Hoover. I spent more on this vacuum than I had on my previous one and it lasted only a fraction of the life I got out of other vacuums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like they used to be","review":"I've used a Hoover vac for over 45 years. But like so many \\"new\\" models, Hoover really missed the boat on this one. It literally eats the belts - and they are not that easy to replace. I was told to take it to an \\"authorized service\\" place. The closest one to me was 60 miles away; but I went there. This \\"authorized\\" person told me to junk it and buy another brand!! But since it was still in warranty (plus I was stupid enough to buy the extended warranty which the \\"authorized\\" person said would not be honored), I kept it. Amazon would not replace it or refund my money--over 30 days since purchase. Hoover would not replace it or refund my money because they said Amazon should take care of this. Since Hoover manufactured this failure-of-a-vac, I went after them. It took months and a lot of screaming and yelling, but Hoover finally refunded my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Maintenance","review":"This vaccuum has had issues since week 3.

We wanted something self propelled because of the open expanse of floor. It cleaned well for the first few times and then began to growl, and finally the motor exploded in a shower of sparks and awful smell. It was 4 months old. Since it was under warranty we could get the motor relaced, which took 6 weeks. It then worked Ok for about a year and just recently the on/off switch died and it turned on only when it was plugged in. Just last week it exploded again, and would'nt you know, the warranty had expired! The vaccum repair man said it would be cheaper to buy a new vacuum. I guess it will be no more hoovers. Too Bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats through Belts - BEWARE","review":"After purchasing new from Home Depot we can't believe the number of belt-replacement problems that have been experienced with this vacuum. After putting the twelfth belt on (less than a year) I was convinced we must be missing some part that attached to the spindle (coming out of the motor which the belt wraps around and causes the beater brush to turn) because why else would this thing be eating through belts at this rate? I can't find any sign of a missing piece and the stench this vacuum puts out when a belt burns is like a tire-fire in the house.I'd recommend avoiding Hoover and this unit in particular; we certainly will be when I head out to look for a replacement.Simply awful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 6 years still going, just not very strong","review":"It has served us well. Very few issues, even the belts haven't needed changed often. The only reason I'm really shopping for a new vacuum is that the suction isn't what it used to be. It still does a decent job, and still can suck up animal crackers, but after changing the bag and checking filters the suction only increased slightly, while the noise increased even more! Also not happy with lack of edge cleaning. For the noise and lack of edge cleaning, I'd give it 3 stars. But since it does still mostly work, I have to add a star to it for a 4 star rating after 6+ years.As this model is very similar to the upper tier Hoover bagged uprights, I'm unsure what to buy. It seems development of bagged tech has stagnated aside from very high dollar machines. Not sure I'd want to deal with a bagless either. The research continues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!","review":"I guess we are one of the lucky ones that got to use this vacuum for a year before it died. Now it sits in our basement collecting dust because every time we use it, it starts making a horrible sound and smells like burning rubber. We have changed the belts several times and now we cannot use it longer than a few seconds before it starts smelling again. The brush also stopped turning. DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM unless you have a few hundred dollars to throw in the trash can. I am now trying to figure out the best way to dispose of this useless piece of junk :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I am a long-time Hoover vacuum fan! I have tried some other vacuum brands, but they just did not hold up to the quality of Hoover. I purchased this model to replace an older Hoover model. My favorite feature on this particular model is the self-propelled feature. I also like that all of the attachments are on board. My only complaint is that I wish the extension hose was a bit longer. This vacuum gives a good, deep cleaning! I recently had new carpet installed, and the carpet layer commented that my old carpet, which was 16 years old, was very clean for its age. For the past 10 years that old carpet had been cleaned with a Hoover upright. If you are looking for a durable upright that cleans well then Hoover is a very good choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.....","review":"I am actually quite upset right now. I asked for a nice vacuum cleaner for Christmas about 1.5 years ago and I got this baby. It worked fine for about a year and then I had to start replacing belts. Not hard to do on your own though and not too expensive either. Then the roller stopped moving at all. I'm out of warranty so I buy new belts to try to fix it. I took it to a repair store when that didn't work and the guy said it's the motor that keeps knocking the belts off track and that this happens with Hooovers a lot. He showed me two others in for repair where their motor wasn't as expensive to replace. So I'm back to square one. I need a new vacuum and the repair store told me that Riccar's, while expensive, are good for a long time and come with a 3 year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give it 10 Stars * * * * * * * * * *","review":"I laid new carpet in Sept. New carpet = tons of new carpet fuzz and this vac has been awesome. I have a Fantom 12 amp Bagless Thunder which just cannot compare to this Hoover. Consumers Union reports that bagged vacs are more efficient than bagless - less dust - and I think I agree. This Ultra was rated the highest by CU.

The secondary HEPA filter is a great idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Disappointment","review":"I had to add my two cents here after seeing some of the positive reviews. I, too, would have written praise for this machine early on. However, perhaps a year and a half or two years after my husband bought this machine, we have had all kinds of problems. The great suction is gone. There are burning smells sometimes, the hose gets clogged, the belt falls off and/or stretches out, and something is wrong with the self-propel feature which makes this very heavy machine impossible to push! I thought vacuums were supposed to last for years and years, and this thing is about to get tossed. I'd give it 0 stars actually. Truly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum I've ever owned","review":"I purchased this unit from ABT Electronics after having owed another model Wind Tunnel and being very happy with it. This unit has been terrible. The beater bar just stops working after about a month. Have replaced the belts and beater bar numerous times, in fact at the expensive cost of the beater bar I could have purchased a new one by now. Took it to an authorized repair shop and was told by the owner that it is probably the worst unit on the market in reliability. I contacted Hoover directly, unfortunately it was after the 1 year warranty was up. They pretty much told me TOO BAD SO SAD, they will do nothing. After only 2 years of owning this unit I am shopping for another vacuum. It will not be a Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Vacuum I've Ever Purchased","review":"Six weeks ago I purchased the Hoover U6439-900 Self Propelled WindTunnel Ultra Vacuum Cleaner. The knob used to set the floor type has already broken off and the belt is no longer turning. I chose this machine based on the Consumer Reports recommendation. Their review was completely off the mark. To be quite honest, it seems like they reviewed a different machine. If I had it to do all over again, I'd definitely choose another brand and model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onboard tools - do you use them?","review":"My review largely echoes the reviews of those who've had the vacuum for over a year. I give this vacuum 2 stars for suction power. I'm prompted to submit a review only to highlight what, as a long term owner of this vacuum, I feel is the most annoying long term drawback of this machine: the hose for using the onboard tools is WAY too short. The vacuum is quite heavy. This combination causes it to fall over almost every time you use the tools. If you need to clean ANYTHING other than your floor you will be *frustrated* (and possibly injured - think heavy vacuum handle on body part containing nerves - it's happened often). Even with all of the other problems I've experienced (and they have been numerous) I would buy this vacuum again if it weren't for this lousy hose design. I would recommend that anyone considering purchasing this vacuum give serious consideration to how often they may need to use the onboard tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very rocky relationship","review":"I am writing this review while I am online searching for a replacement for my Hoover Self-Propelled Power Drive Supreme which I understand is a predecessor version of this vacuum cleaner. I, too, bought it several years ago in response to Consumer Reports' positive reviews. Beware! Within a few months, it had to be repaired, it eats belts which are sometimes difficult to find. It has never had hard use in my fairly small home, but just now has died. I have loathed this vacuum cleaner for years, but because it cost so much to begin with (at least $50 more than the Amazon price) I felt I had to keep it. Others I know who bought the same cleaner (as well as the local vacuum repair shop) have echoed my sentiments. No more! To be fair, it has relatively good suction, but that is not enough to make me buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great suction, lousy vacuum falls apart.","review":"We bought this too after using consumer reports guide.The thing has high power but the hose, hard extentions, and belts all fell apart in bits and pieces in 7+ months.We vacuum alot with three little kids but this thing just was not up to standard at all. First off a belt that the company site says rarely breaks, well it broke. Then the hard hose extentions started cracking. Then the thing started to lean and the propelling gear stripped. If you don't have that self propell action you might as well throw it away cause you cannot move this beast of a vacuum.This is all in the space of 7 months.A letter to Hover just got a response to take it to a dealer to be fixed.

It is an excellent machine (the best we tested) when it is running and I have very much enjoyed my dealings with Hoover Customer Service. But having the machine completely breakdown every three months is much too much! Strongly recommend against this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"9 months and I'm looking for a replacement","review":"I too was bamboozeled by Consumer Reports. The brush and propulsion stopped working after only 4 months. The guy at the vacuum repair shop laughed and me and showed me all of the other Hoover self-propelled vacs that were in for the same repair. Then the plastic footstep that keeps the unit locked upright broke off, so now the vac lies on the floor between uses. It does clean great, when it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"The attachments are ok, but other than that this product is awful. The self-propelled feature has never worked properly, and I found it easier to just go without it. The vacuum is way too heavy, and it's constantly falling over when using the attachments. Replacing the belt is a joke, after 30 minutes I give up. I would never buy another one of these. I read all the consumer reports that made this seem the best of the best. I'm really sorry I didn't come to Amazon and read the bad reviews first. I spent way too much money to go buy another vacuum cleaner now, but someday soon I'm sure my patience will give out and I'll be shopping again. I'll take a little less suction power (which, frankly, is overkill on this model anyway) for something that's easier to maintain and lighter to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suction Great - Everything Else is The Worst","review":"Hoover uses a powerful motor and the suction is great. The restof the machine is terrible. Exterior plastic parts break frequently. Wands and accessory pieces do not \\"fasten\\" together so they constantly separate when being used. You can't use two hands with the accessories or the vacuum falls over (broke my toe when it fell over as I tried to clean with wand). You must always have one hand on the vacuum to balance it when using tools. I actually bought a second machine (new one on sale) so I would have replacement parts for the many broken pieces of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover WindTunnel self propelled","review":"We bought the WindTunnel for ease of use.

It goes through belts on a weekly basis. Every time a belt goes bad, the vacuum starts squealing loudly. The belts are too thin, so they stretch out after only a few uses. At $5 apiece, this problem is very expensive to fix. I talked to Hoover reps at length and they of course say they never get any complaints, and that I should take my vacuum to a repair shop.

If you want to pay lots of money for cheap plastic parts that break after a couple of months of use, you have found your match! It overheats and shuts off for 20 - 30 minutes, it eats belts like candy, it won't stay in the upright position because the latch is broken. IT IS GARBAGE and it belongs in the GARBAGE.

Have had to take it apart because the ON switch was stuck on \\"ON\\" and wouldn't shut off. Now the self propelled cable is broken and the ON switch doesn't work.

The self-propel feature is great. The carpet adjustment buttons are easy to use if you lean the vaccuum forward (like it says right above the buttons). I don't think that this vaccuum is too loud, it's the same as previous models I've had. It is a heavier vaccuum because of the self-propel feature, but I can handle it just fine. I've had no problem moving the vaccuum when it's turned off, all you need to do is tilt it back on it's wheels & it's quite easy to move & it's easy enough to carry with the carrying handle on the back.

It takes only seconds to switch over to the above floor hand attachments and has a very flexible hose. It's also very easy to switch from carpet to hard floor however the little switch to swicth over from carpet to hard floors is made of plastic and breaks VERY easily. Also the belts wear out quite often. But still, when it is working, this is the best, easiest to use vacuum ever. I have a bad back so I love the self-propell feature although that quit working after awhile. That's when I have to get a new one. In my opinion this vacuum cleans better than $1000 vacuums and at this price, I can afford to replace it when it wears out. I think it's a pretty good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Vaccum is a joke","review":"I have this thing at work (someone else bought it) BUY A DYSON - you will never buy another brand again - Hoover just pumps out lowest bidder corporate policy garbage.

So far the self-propel mechanism has broken once and never fixed properly; belts go frequently (which Consumer Reports doesn't count as a repair - see small print in Oct05 ratings). Also the carpet/floor and carpet height adjusters keep breaking and finally the roller has twice stopped working.

It worked fine for about the first year, and has been in the shop for repairs about every 3 months ever since. We have had the self-propel fixed a few times, the roller fixed a few times, belts replaced because of 'hot' smells, the carpet to bare floor switch fixed, and now the roller again doesn't work. Find something else to clean your floors with, and do your research. For over $200, I expect much more reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $300 !!! PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYING","review":"I am very very dissapointed in this product. I think the only glowing reviews that exist for this product are from those people who have not owned it for longer than 6 months. If you plan on owning it longer than that, DO NOT PUCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!In short, the brush roll will stop turning after 2 months, it will start making a ridiulous amount of noise in 1 month, instead of stretching, the attachment hose will pull the vacuum over EVERY TIME. It falls over at least 5 times each time you use the attachments. It will cost more than $100 to repair which is more expensive than many vacuums that are rated higher than this one. It is EXTREMELY heavy, but to be fair, I have heard that is common with vacuums that have a lot of suction, which it does, which is coincidentally the only good thing about this vacuum. A thousand thumbs down!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Windtunnel stinks!","review":"My husband and I purchased this machine less than two years ago and have been totally dissatisfied w/ it! It is heavy, awkward - generally poorly designed. It is top heavy and tends to tip over easily when using the attachments. The attachments are difficult to connect and access. I honestly could not recommend this to my worst enemy. Everyone who uses it expresses the same. When I filed a complaint with Hoover and the Hoover store where I purchased it, all they could say was \\"sorry\\". I did not complain until six months ago since I thought perhaps I just needed to get used to it. Hope this is useful in another person's search for a quality vacuum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"Like some other reviewers, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this vacuum. I've had mine about 8 months - bought because of the consumer reports ratings - and am ready to replace it. The hose is way too short, the tools fall off, and the whole thing falls over when you use the hose (I have the bruises to prove it). Rest assured, I WILL NOT replace with another Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this model","review":"I must agree with the previous reviews. After working well for 1 year and a half, the self-propel motor went out. Disappointing for a vacuum of that price that saw only light use. Too heavy and awkward for my wife to use as well. All in all, I would not recommend this or any other Hoover product to Amazon customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major parts broke after limited use","review":"We bought this vacuum in 2002 based on Consumer Report's recommendation. It has great suction and the self-propeller was a really nice feature... until it broke after very limited use. We spent about $80 to get the propeller repaired, but shortly thereafter the motor started overheating. After less than 10 minutes the vacuum cleaner simply shuts down and we have to wait a long time until it is cooled off before we can resume cleaning.Our vacuum cleaner repair person told us that this vacuum is prone to breaking if you lift it by the handle. You must lift it by the special little handle which is built on the back in the middle. It is not a very convenient way to carry this heavy machine around.We may have gotten a lemon, but we've decided to replace it with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover could do better","review":"Especially in this price range and with a reputation to uphold I expected more from this vacuum cleaner. The belt is VERY sensitive to breakage and not easily replaceable. You have to unscrew the bottom (4 screws) to replace the belt, where other vacuums I've owned have a bottom plate that pops off for easy maintenance. Also, when you use the on board tools for dusting, etc, the brush does not stop spinning so I have several burn marks in my carpet from where the vacuum rested in one spot too long (before I got wise and now lean the cleaner onto me as I use the on board tools). I would not buy another one, ever. The filter assembly is cumbersome to clean and even just emptying it out I usually end up with quite a bit of dust all over me. Look for something a bit better engineered. Hoover could certainly do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible vacuum-- Hoover sold out","review":"I bought this vacuum in FEb 2007-- by SEP it was dead and the engine is defective. I bought it online and now am having trouble returning it through Amazon. It is a mediocre vacuum. Go with a better made one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardwood Floors? FORGET this vacuum!!","review":"I have laminate floors in part of my home. I also walk barefoot a great deal of the time. Yesterday after I vacuumed, as I was walking around I noticed that the floor felt dusty. I got out my handy-dandy Swiffer(TM) and went over the floor in ONE room with it. The Swiffer cloth was absolutely FILTHY - covered with dust and dirt. I've always like my old Hoover but because it hurts my back, I thought buying the self-propelled vacuum would be a good purchase. Although the self-propelling saves my back on my carpets (I don't need to use the self-propelling feature on the hardwood), it is not worth my purchase if it leaves my house dirty."},{"rating":"1","title":"9 months old - dead as a door nail","review":"I picked one of these up August 2003 and I turned it on this afternoon: nothing happened. I checked the off/on switch with an ohm meter and it seems to be working. The \\"helpful\\" troubleshooting guide suggested that maybe there was a problem with my house's electrical system or that the cleaner I had not used for several days was overheated -- wrong! I suspect that the thermostat to detect overheating is broken. I agree with the other reviewers that the product is bulky, heavy and awkward. I cannot get in under the coffee table to clean because it is so large. It also tends to fall over when I use the applicances, also mentioned by another reviewer. The only really cool feature is the air-powered beater brush extension -- which I will not be using today because the Hoover does not suck...Avoid this over-priced piece of junk. Next time I will go with cannister vaccuum like the Kenmoore I had that lasted 15 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT DO IT!!!!","review":"I have had this vauum only a couple of months and I hat eit. It weighs 26 pounds for one thing! The cord is some cheap plastic imitation of a cord.

Less than two months after we bought it, the belt broke. One year later, the upright lock function broke and we had to drag the vacuum (which is quite heavy) around the house.

It works good for me for the most part. I have no suction problems or anything. I bought it 2.5 years ago maybe and the cable connector broke for the self propelled feature. I self diagnosed this problem, I could see that there is a cable when I fold the handle back and it is held on by a black PLASTIC doo-hickie that is broken... I don't even want to know how much it is going to cost for a new black plastic doo-hickie when the machine will have to be taken apart for repairing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Reports got this one wrong!","review":"Like many others, I bought this because it came highly recommended by Consumer Reports. It worked great for a while, but after about a year the brush stopped spinning. I replaced the belt (twice!) but it still won't work. If I didn't read about so many others having similar problems, I would have guessed that I just got a bad vacuum - but after reading other reviews here at Amazon, I see that this is not a model that anyone should buy, despite the high rating from Consumer Reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Vaccum Doesn't Suck...that's the problem!","review":"We chose this vaccum on our wedding registry and we were excited to receive it. After two months it began smelling bad and overheating. We took it to be repaired. The guy said I must use Hoover bags and he replaced some things to fix it. I thought I was using Hoover bags, he said no so I bought more of the same bags from him. A week later while using the Hoover bags, it overheated again. It still had a burning smell and rattled most of the time. I only vaccumed once a week. As time went on, still using Hoover bags, it would overheat after 1/3 of our smallest room was vaccumed. I'm actually waiting on it to cool off for the third time in one room. Please save your money. We are going to buy a new vaccum tonight!! I noticed the last few weeks it's just moving the dirt around anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall - a bad purchase","review":"My vacuum is three years old and everything is breaking on in.From the beginning I wasn't crazy about how it worked. The self-propelled mechanism is needed because its so bloody heavy but it works in a jerky fashion and I can't tell you how many times I've banged into furniture and woodwork. Ugh! When you use the hose and pull on it the vacuum easily falls over onto you or crashes into what ever is close. The first month one of the tubes cracked on me (duct tape ever since). The attachments are always falling off the rear. Belts frequently need replacing. I could go on but just don't get one. I desperately need a new vacuum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"bought this in 2006 recommended by consumers report I had a for a month and it broke, months later it stop working alltogether, I would never recommend it to any one sure wasted a lot off money!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover has gone down the toilet...","review":"I ordered one of these and it arrived dead, so I sent it back and received a second one, and it also arrived dead.

The price was $99.99. the condition was listed as NEW. I received it with in 3 days. After I unpacked it and turned it on, smoke poured out from underneath. I took it to an authorized dealer and I was informed that it was a REMANUFACTURED machine, not a NEW one as it was listed on Amazon. They told me that it only had a 6 month warranty not a 1 year as it would have been if it had been NEW as the listing stated. The dealer had to replace the motor and 2 belts (which cost me $7.00)If I had wanted to buy a reconditioned machine, I would have bought one of the ones that Amazon had listed at the time for $59 or $69. I'm afraid it will be a long time before I buy from Amazon again. There apparently is no way to know if the items they are offering are being misrepresented."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want service manual to fix your self, do not buy this or Hoover","review":"I have a similar model to this, Wind Tunnel with bag, and have had it for about 5 years. During the 5 years, the cable and actuator arms for propel broke 2 times. I wanted to fix myself, so I contacted Hoover to get the service manual or technical manual. They said it is not available at all to the public. The only way to fix this then is to spend a lot of time to figure out yourself, or to leave it at the authorized service center, which will cost some money.For most companies, I could get the service manuals for simple gadget or appliance for free most of the time by email attachment or for a small fee.Next time, I will think twice buying Hoover product unless they change this policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasure while it lasts","review":"I have had problems with every vacuum and have purchased a multitude of various vacuums, including 2 similar Hoover models. First, avoid any bagless models. Every bagless model (even no-touch models) require you go outside and bang a pile of fine, filthy dirt from the filter. Nothing is easier, cleaner or more effective than a bag, so skip the bagless models. Hoover offers the only vacuums with a power-drive. Anyone with a bad back or limited strength needs this feature. This vacuum's power and attachments are first rate. This is the only Hoover bagged model with a FULL 2 year warranty. Allergybegone has discontinued carrying this model and ships out $77 remanufactured models when you purchase this model, so Amazon is your best price. After you use a vacuum with a power-drive, nothing else will do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT get a self propelled vacume!! Way to heavy!","review":"I had my heart set on a self propell vac because I have a bad back. After 14 months the self propell broke! It is now easier to push my car down the street then push this thing across the livingroom because the self propell unit inside the vacume is so heavy, it really weighs the vacume down. It still sucks great but if I'm going to keep useing it I will have to go back to physical therapy.This thing is such a tank if you run into a pice of furniture it will dent your furniture!Carring it up and down the stairs while trying to vacume is impossible. The self propell unit is so heavy it really defeats the purpose of having one.Hoover is still my favorite vac, just don't get a self propell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst vacuum ever owned","review":"We have owned this vacuum for 2 years now.

Consumer reports got this one wrong!! Wrong","review":"I used to trust consumer reports but no longer will I blindly follow their suggestions!This vacuum is heavy and old fashioned. The buttons alone are similar to a 1970's model. Mine broke after 2 months. The self propelling feature is powerfull but it needs it because it is super heavy. The suction in this vacuum is incredible at first but is lost after a few uses. I must say that if it hadn't broken I would probably be stuck with it still I am glad it broke!. I bought a Dyson and I love it! WORLD OF DIFFERENCE! Hoover needs to move forward with their design features."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's a lemon - beware","review":"We agree completely with the other negative reviews. We have had this machine for less than a year. It's been back to be serviced twice and just today another piece broke off. It worked well at first, but the belt gave out after a few months and the adjustment switches break easily. Today (one week after getting it back from service) the switch went flying across the room without the thing being on - all I did was move it. Now I can't turn the brush off. The self-propel feature is fine at first, but now pulls unevenly, especially on hard floors.We were fooled by the Consumer review and tempted by the relatively low price. It looks like we have to start shopping again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I bought the factory-reconditioned version, the U6401-9RM, so thank goodness I didn't have quite so much money invested in this lumbering junkbox before I found out (just after the 6-month warranty) that it was one. All of the problems a previous review described-- eats belts, heavy, loud, clumsy-- plus the brush roller bogs down (this is what eats the belts). Useless! The worst part is that I bought this for my elderly mother so she could continue living independently. Made me look like a schmuck.Apparently there are good ones and bad ones, so buy locally from a reputable store that will gracefully accept returns. Or save yourself the aggravation and avoid this plastic pig."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off!!!","review":"We purchased this vacuum cleaner because it was top rated by Consumer Reports. We had trouble with it from the beginning. The first time we used it, it had a burning odor. A few days later, a plastic dial fell off. We returned it and exchanged it for another, thinking we had received a lemon.The second machine was no better. While it was being stored in our closet (not even in use) two large pieces of plastic fell off the front of the machine.Since we purchased this machine at Costco, we considered purchasing another machine. Another customer told us that she had purchased the Wind Tunnel and had to shell out $50. several times already because the machine kept loosing suction.We returned the second Hoover and purchased the Dyson. We are much happier with this, even with the additional cost. What a difference!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I too, was duped","review":"I usually always go by what the consumer who had used the product had to say. Unfortunately, I also listened to Consumer Reports, and of my past history of owning Hoovers many years ago.Things sure have changed! I just came in from toting this piece of JUNK out to the trash. I've owned it for about 6 months now. Each time I took it out for a spin- about once a week- something would invariably break off: the carpet height adjuster, the carpet/floor knob. The noise sounded like, and I'm not kidding, an extremely loud pile of plastic parts being trampled by a bull. The belts created a stench of burning rubber, and needed replacement way too often!Save your money- Do Not Go Near this Beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy. Poor Design. Dito the other negative reviews.","review":"Just a few quick comments on the Hoover:> Consumer Reports really missed the boat on this one. I ended up with the Hoover EmPower.

I suffer from chronic dry skin and in the winter it is a big issue, between the scratching until my skin is raw, to the slit skin around my fingers and toes. I found this product in one of the many gift baskets that my daughters and I received at Christmas. I thought well why not try it, none of the name brand lotions worked and believe me I have tried them all. Within a week of daily use, at least twice a day on my hands and once on my feet I was amazed. My feet and hands cleared up, the cracking and peeling of skin was gone, so I tried expanding the use to my legs and arms. It works wonders.

While I have on occasion used various other skin products, Medline Remedy works the best in my opinion. The most striking difference is itching under the wraps.

Or to put it more gently, this is the last time I listen to my sister's (Lilanne) recommendations. The series was like a soap opera commercial, tempting to draw the audience with tentalizing titbits but really do not go anywhere or add up to anything but a long and drawn out tale with an ending that is very fitting........for a Harlequin romance. At least we all know that romance endings are not unexpected or original. The hankie that Lilanne gave me along with books is still, just like the books themselves, dry. If Mr. Kay want his readers to fill in where his imaginations lack, then he succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of the trilogy","review":"A nice ending to a competent fantasy. Others may like this series better than I did-I find all fantasy pales next to Tolkein. But this one at least is (mostly) well written and even breaks out in originality here and there! I look forward to reading more of Kay's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Story in a Beautiful Setting","review":"I love the Fionavar Tapestry. In these books Kay has woven a beautiful, complex story. The setting is Fionavar, a gorgeous and enchanted world filled with magic and history--a world which reminds me of Narnia or Middle Earth. The story is filled with strong, compelling characters, both male and female, who sometimes have to make difficult choices. At times the story is sad but Kay's writing is so graceful that I enjoyed even the sad parts.The Longest Road, the last book in the trilogy, was for the me the most emotional and heartbreaking. I cried many times before reaching the end, but Kay's story is never bitter, only bittersweet. And within it there also lies true joy for some characters. The closing chapters of this story are magnificent in scope and feeling, and when I turned the last page I felt satisfied.I would highly recommend The Fionavar Tapestry to anyone who enjoys epic fantasy with powerful magic and attractive settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying conclusion to a moving trilogy.","review":"This series more than any other I have read has moved me to tears; sometimes a bit heavy-handed in emotional manipulation, GG Kay nonetheless has done a masterful job of knitting the stories of the protagonists together. The introduction and use of the Arthurian legend is brilliant.The good guys win, no surprise - but this novel ties up an artful telling of how this comes about.I recommend this series as highly and as often as LOtR, and for many of the same reasons. I have given it away to friends more than any other book or set of books. On a par with Zelazny's \\"Lord of Light\\" for sheer enjoyability."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful...just wonderful","review":"All I can say is...Wow! The Fionavar Tapestry now ranks among the best fantasy series I have ever read, on par with the classics of Tolkein (though no one is better than him), Susan Cooper, and C. S. Lewis. I have rarely read books more powerful in their story-telling, or more uplifting in their message. I was moved to tears at times as I read this trilogy. Kay allows you to go on the journey to Fionavar with Paul, Kevin, Kim, Jennifer, and Dave - to experience everything as they do. The mark of a truly gifted writer. I had read his Tigana before, and not been particularly impressed, but I plan to read his other works. If they are half as good as The Fionavar Tapestry, I will be satisfied beyond measure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this in junior high.","review":"I read this book in junior high and though I loved it then, thinking back upon it I find it fairly simple, yet a step above most sci-fi fantasy creations. It aspires to the heights of Tolkein, but doesn't quite reach. Still, it is a fun read and interseting effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly dramatic, poorly done","review":"I'm a big fan of fantasy, and a friend recommended this series to me. I read the entire Fionavar Tapestry on vacation when I had no access to any other books. While the premise was initially intriguing, the author's writing abilities severely hampered any empathy you had for the protagonists' struggles. He incessantly reminded you that the characters were burdened with a personal, unspeakable grief so terrible that I was amazed any of them were able to get out of bed each morning. I'd only recommend this if you were had plenty of time on your hands and no other reading material available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Characters","review":"I wasn't impressed with any of the books in this trilogy but the third had to be the worst. Over flowery prose, whole sections that didn't serve any purpose, and over used cliches. The whole Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere thread was unbearable. While Jennifer as Guinevere can be somewhat excused because she is very young Arthur and Lancelot are adults. Get OVER IT ALREADY and move on. Of course Kay also changes the concept of what a dwarf is. Most other mythologies have dwarf women just as likely to go into battle and have beards as the males. However in this novel they are stripped of any fighting power. Just like all the other female characters in these novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Timeless Legend","review":"I love the way this series reads, and consider it among the best that modern fantasy has to offer. Though it involves five college students from our time in a strange world, the whole reads like a 3 volume myth, completely involved, yet aloof at the same time. I feel the character development, some of it limited to be sure, is all quite appropriate. What is a legend without some melodrama? I like that also, helping this to read as something out of time, close yet remote, something that can't, and shouldn't be pigeon-holed into a one, or even two dimentional world. Fionavar is a world out of time, and so is this series.I've read it twice now, and am getting ready to start on my third. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good ending to a great series","review":"This was a very good ending to a very good series. The pacing of the book was wonderful, the stories captivating. I have said before that dialogue is not Kay's strong point, and that holds true here as well, but he weaves a marvelous tale.The ending was a little clunky, and I do have some issues of his basic world design. This \\"massive\\" world with multiple nations spoken of, that can nonetheless be traversed completly in a portion of a day - or even there and back in a single day at points.But this is a fantasy series, and so some thoughts of normal workings of things should be suspended and I won't let such minor issues mar what was a marvelous tale that Kay wove throughout the series. Definately worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book! Action-packed!!","review":"From front to back the action never stops. Another great book in this series.

She had the most dreamy, mellow voice that I had ever heard. Then later on she started screaming and I lost interest in her but when I saw that she had released this new CD I thought that I'd see what the intervening years had done to her style. Obviously, based upon this latest endeavor she needs the money but she better not rely on her past reputation to get her fans back. Poor Nancy - but I still love her memory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue made me Blue","review":"This album shows sadly that Nancy has lost her pipes, albeit ever so slowly. She misses as many as she hits. The arrangements are good and the surrounding cast is excellent with Bob Mintzer, James Moody , Tom Scott and many others and the artwork is superb! She looks great in the photos, and maybe that's good enough reason to buy it. But the singing is poor and her choice of numbers isn't so great either. I suspect that if she would keep it light and moving along at a faster swing-type tempo, as say Sinatra did at the end, she would sound better. Still a very classy lady though."},{"rating":"2","title":"MISS WILSON NEVER MISSES","review":"Miss Wilson is my favorite singer -- there are no exceptions -- so if you're looking for critical words you can stop right here. On this album she puts her unique style and charm to several new tunes (my favorite is \\"Knitting Class\\") but most stellar is her version of \\"Taking a Chance on Love,\\" on which she makes the most of her lower register (which has always been stellar and wonderful). This song, and some others on recent CDs, are from the \\"old school,\\" as if Miss Wilson FINALLY decided to sing some of the stand-bys, as if clearing up some old \\"to do\\" lists. We are the beneficiaries. I'm grateful she continues to record, but I miss very much her live performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless.","review":"\\"Turned to Blue\\" puts Nancy Wilson into situations she can handle extremely well.She is surrounded by jazz stars such as sax players Bob Mintzer, Jimmy Heath and James Moody, flutist Hubert Laws and bassist John Clayton.She sings with small groups and big bands featuring arrangements by Pittsburgh's John Wilson and Jay Ashby.The nature of the songs range from the soft jazz of \\"Knitting Class\\" to the swinger of \\"Taking a Chance on Love\\" and sad blues of \\"Just Once.\\" All of the songs show Wilson's marvelous talent as she cruises through the title cut and other pieces such as \\"This Is All I Ask\\" and \\"Old Folks\\".The years, nearly 70 of them, don't seem to wear on her voice at all.She is a timeless, ageless, beautiful soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow with age","review":"If you are a fan of Nancy Wilson, you will appreciate how her voice has mellowed with age.

Obviously, the aim of Seraphinoff is to prove the \\"Macedonian\\" character of Pejchinovich's works. However, Pejchinovich himself calls his language \\"Bulgarian\\" and his country \\"Lower Moesia\\".

I love big sunglasses, but these made me look like an alien or a bug. My boyfriend teased me relentlessly about them.

But, the only thing remotely funny about this movie is the bizarre make-up job on Whoopie in her transformation to a man. I give credit to Whoopie for trying, but a bad script left her helpless.

I thought this book was it -- but I was wrong. Boyde Lafayette De Menthe writes as if every American doesn't want to experience the real Japan. And describes the real Japan is some sort of secret brothel.Some of the history was interesting and the quick guide to the language was informative but, overall, the information was very dated (copyright 1995). And as a woman who loves to travel, this book left me with very few insights other than where I should sent my male companions at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't spend your money","review":"Please don't waste your time or money on this book. There are much better books available (I have lived in Japan for 5 years and didn't see anything remotely approaching insightful or original commentary). I thought this book would give me tips on how to experience the Japan of old -- which is hard to find. Instead I got a variety of short stories (none of which I found interesting or provide enough detail for you to figure out how to find the romantic old Japan), and an abbreviated history of Japan. Also, the author is always obsessing about women! I recommend to keep searching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review article based on book contains inaccuracies","review":"There is a lot of good literature out there addressing the question of what Japan's imperial family's involvement was in the events leading up to the Pacific war. I have read excerpts by these authors in various magazines, and some of the published information was false- including the claim that there have never been female emporers. (A review of classical Japanese history shows several- in fact, the earliest records of Japan from the Chinese refer to an empress !!!) These sorts of errors make me doubt that this is the book to set the record straight- look at Harold Bixley's recent book, or John Dower's \\"Embracing Defeat\\", for a more accurate take on the subject done by competent academics who can write well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Fiction; Awful History","review":"For any one who has more than a basic knowledge of Japanese history, this book is bunk. However, if one reads it as fiction, it makes for superb \\"summer beach reading\\". The fact that the picture on the cover is of the Emperor of China (after the fall of the Manchu dynasty and his \\"enthronement\\" as the Emperor of Manchuria), not the Emperor of Japan shows just how much the author knows about this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad.","review":"This is one of the most pathetic pieces of \\"history\\" I've ever read. \\"Documents show\\" and \\"sources indicate\\" is not documentary evidence. Who were the sources, where are the cites? This is bad journalism, bad scholarship, and bad history. The writing, frankly, isn't that impressive, either. And for the record, the cover photo *is* P'u Yi, not Emperor Showa. Look at the uniform; the Chinese dragons on the collar are a dead giveaway even if you can't tell the faces are different, which they clearly are. I want to rate this book ZERO stars, but the Amazon Powers That Be have not provided the option to so brand a book, so please ignore the star and pretend you see a hole there."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Wall Street, Hoover and McArthur conspired to cover up for the emperor","review":"This book on the 'history' of the dynasty that rules Japan suffers from its own sloppy sensationalism. It is not entirely useless, but nearly so. It kills its interesting subject by its manic devotion to conspiracy theories.Probably the authors are entirely innocent of the cover blunder, but it is somehow symptomatic: the cover photo is not even a Japanese, not remotely a member of the dynasty that gave the book its title, but a Chinese and probably the last emperor, Pu Yi, the monarch of Manchukuo, poor man.Seagrave wrote some interesting popular history books on China, mainly his Soong Dynasty and his book about the Empress Dowager are worth reading as an introduction to 20th century China. But forget this Japan book. Better to try Herbert Bix on Hirohito (who, by the way, does not even mention Hoover in the context of Hirohito's post WW2 predicaments)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say yellow journalism?","review":"This is the first of the Seagrave's books I have read. It will be the last. I picked it up thinking that it was written by Japanese scholars. After reading the preface and realizing the authors were investigative reporters, I was a bit turned off, but decided to continue reading.In the first chapter, the Seagraves present as fact details of ancient Japanese history that are still being debated within Japanese scholarship, both foreign and domestic. While there is likely some modicum of truth in what the Seagraves have to say, I find it difficult to take their accusations at face-value, in light of the incorrect history which is presented as fact. I don't think I could ever take seriously the work of such journalists who, from their other book credits, seem to be capitalizing on the \\"scandals of Asia\\" without truly having studied any of the Asian cultures they are writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly shallow","review":"I am not a historian. I am someone who reads history and who has a great deal of respect and admiration for Japan, its society, and its complexity. I bought this book before boarding a long flight and looked forward to learning more about the Imperial dynasty and its role in the great historical dramas. Instead, I spent my time reading a largely unsubstantiated attack. Even allowing for the author's rather extreme point of view, I found the book embarrassingly shallow, mean, and totally one-sided. Other than a few vignettes about some of the members of this mysterious and underreported family, this book offers little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterling Finally Got the Right Photo","review":"I enjoyed this book. However, it is like reading fiction as the author gives little real proof. I read the previous comments on the cover picture. The Hardcover photo is Henry Pu Yi, child emperor of China. However, the author fixed this howling blooper and finally has the correct emperor, correct nationality on the cover. Hurrah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I read this book after reading \\"The Emperor's General\\" by James Webb, a great story which gave me some context for the McArthur element in this book. \\"The Yamato Dynasty\\" seemed at first to be more historical documentary than story, but having read the first book, I was hooked, and couldn't put it down. I used to skip the bits in the Economist magazine about Japan's economic situation, but this book puts the influences on the economy into fascinating context, and has made me much more interested in what's going on now. It's full of bizarre and amazing little facts that made me want constantly to read bits aloud to whoever was nearby. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Rocky Music is Dead On Arrival","review":"In a complete departure from previous Rocky movie soundtracks, this album is mostly a collection of vocals by various artists.

The book itself attempts to be as humorous as Prof. Bamforth and while it does have a humorous tone, it sadly falls short. However, for what it lacks in Prof. Bamforth's colorful personality, it is extremely informative, with detailed explanations of every step in the the brewing process from the growing of the grains to the bottling and distribution. He also includes lots of information about current brewing powerhouses and cultural drinking trends because he does have personal relationships with Dan Gordon of Gordon Biersch and Ken Grossman of Sierra Nevada, both of whom give guest lectures every quarter.

In particular, it recounts the case of Mary Toft, a woman from Godalming in Surrey who claimed to give birth to numerous rabbits! It is clearly the result of considerable research, but the author is very far from a 'natural writer' and bores his audience throughout.

How about teaching tango as an improvisational dance, which it really is, and teaching the universal lead and follow technique, with some basic concepts that will allow anybody to just dance with anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review - The Inner Game of Golf","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. As a single digit handicap I find that the most common problem I encounter on a golf course is the interference I create through negative thoughts. When my mind and body are left free to perform without the creeping self-doubt, I tend to play very well. When I hit a poor shot, my negative thoughts begin to build upon themselves until I am a shadow of the player I can be.The ideas and drills presented in the book have helped me to \\"stay in the moment\\" on the course and have allowed me to let go of neagtive feelings immediately after a bad shot is hit. While I still have a lot of work to do, I know that I will be referring back to this book to improve my play on the most important part of the course, the nine inches between my ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inner game of golf","review":"YES, I DID GET MY INNER GAME OF GOLF BOOK IN DUE TIME AND PERFECT FORM...I WAS EAGER TO READ TIMOTHY GALLWAY AGAIN AFTER KNOWING HIM FOR HIS INNER GAME OF TENNIS AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.

The inner game principles and exercises remain valid, but are enhanced by apporpriate connection to technical teaching. The simple act of paying attention in various ways to the various aspects of the game does actually enhance the enjoyment of the game -- at least for me. One can get over-driven to be technically correct and results focused and forget the simple pleasure of the game. So far I am only dabbling with this, but I am already feeling more natural in my learning and overall approach to the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK!!!","review":"I Have enjoyed this so much that I am reading it for a second time..

After I read this book, I felt like I knew everyting I needed to know about this odd religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating inside look","review":"I have observed, with fascination (I am not a Christian Scientist), the continuing decline and fall of the Christian Science Church. A thoroughly American religious movement, it has been unable to stop the hemorrhaging of members, and churches stand empty or close down with astonishing rapidity due to its unwillingness to modify its message of total avoidance of medical care for healing. What has been so fascinating has been the anecdotes of great dissension, suppression, and harassment within the church. This book pretty much gives a complete history of all of the battles which have been fought. A real page turner. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A painful yet panoramic view, especially since 1910","review":"As difficult at times as this book was to read for this supporter of CS, I had been sensing for some time that an expose' of this magnitude was somewhere out there lurking, just waiting for a writer with the courage to challenge the Board and set the record (reasonably) straight. Yes, some of the facts Ms. Fraser presents regarding the life of Mrs. Eddy can be called into question (what biography of a notable person HASN'T had this problem since the advent of the genre'?) but her account of institutional CS over the last 90 years is essentially correct. Still, upon completion of this tome, I couldn't help but notice that the following maxim still holds largely - and frustratingly - true: for those individuals of faith, no further proof is ever necessary; for non-believers, no further proof is ever enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"An expose with a heart","review":"While the author may, at times, err on the side of blaming Christian Science (rather than fanatical parents themselves) for the neadless deaths of Christian Science children, this book is still worth reading. Frazer not only provides a complete history of the Christian Science Church, she also exposes the special legal privilages which continue to allow church members to provide bogus \\"healing\\" , often at taxpayer expense, while getting away with murder when this \\"healing\\" proves fatal. Fraser is also willing to take her research a step further than most would dare, linking Christian Science practice to many current New Age healing fads, and warning that these fads, too, could someday prove fatal to unprotected minors. A worthwhile, if depressing, read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISBELIEF","review":"It's sad what has happened to some of the kids who were victims of no medical treatment when they need it. I'm christian so I pray when someone I knows sick so I'm not totally knocking that Christian Scientist belive in healing . The real problem is their view on Christ. Mabye they should read Christ's words in the Bible instead of letting they're interpritation governed by Marry Baker Eddy. Who stole the idea from Professor Quimbly then claimed to have a revelation. It truly upsets me how many lives her lies have ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Larry King on Sept 30","review":"I think anyone who is truly interested in gaining a more objective view on Christian Science would benefit greatly by tuning in to Larry King Live on CNN on Thursday, Sept 30 or else read a transcript of the interview with Virginia Harris, Chairperson, Christian Science Board of Directors. The public deserves to hear the Christian Science Church's response to Fraser's new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor. Inaccurate. Boring. A waste of time.","review":"It's too bad Amazon doesn't offer zero stars - that's what this book earned. Clearly, the author is writing a \\"Mommy Dearest\\" - and clearly she is clueless. The topic is dull, research shallow, and the author's bias'are showing. A waste of energy and thought both for author and reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the facts, ma'am","review":"If one were to seriously investigate the sources from which Fraser draws her conclusions, one would inevitably find that she has used sources that can only be described as \\"yellow journalism\\" - meaning that they serve no purpose but to discredit Mary Baker Eddy for discovering Christian Science and to blame her for the \\"needless\\" death of innocent children. If you compare the record of healing between the medical profession and Christian Science, it is clear that Christian Science has a pretty \\"clean\\" record. This is not to say that the medical profession has anything but the greatest intentions in there pursuits to \\"fix matter\\", but let's try basing our judgements on fact not fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is true about Christian Science?","review":"When I was a bookkeeper, I didn't blame the science of mathmatics when I couldn't balance my books.

I would expect more from a person who possesses a PHD from an elite university; however, it should not come as a shock to most that this author published a book based on fallacies and sensationalism, seeing as she has never found respect in her own field of study (Literature).If you believe all Muslim extremists, and those who bombed the US on 9/11, are representative of the Islamic tradition, then by all means buy this book, which similarly portrays a handful of extreme behavior as emblematic of the Christian Science religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to go to the actual source than spend your money here","review":"It's funny how we will spend many hours learning about something through the grapevine yet aren't willing to go straight to the source and judge for ourselves. Gossip is enchanting, but few who fear Christian Science have actually read Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures--their thoughts are determined by what a third party (like this book) has said. Thankfully God's judgement does not proceed in this manner. Like Him, each one of us has the ability to test every spirit for ourselves, rather than being blown to and fro by the human opinion of the day. But then, that's how science works. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Windows Have Been Opened!","review":"God's Perfect Child is an excellent read. Caroline Fraser has opened the windows of a previously closed and shuttered room and has let the light of reality shine in.This book reveals that Christian Science is neither Christian nor Science. Dr. Fraser factually exposes the cult of Christian Science without bitterness or anger. Anyone reading this book with an open mind must be impressed with its research and thoroughness. God's Perfect Child is truthful and honest history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining? - Yes Accurate, authoritative? - No way","review":"A great read, as much fiction is. But for an objective view or even an accurate one, it is hopelessly flawed.Based on an unhappy childhood and a dysfunctional family Ms. Fraser then takes a skewed view and compounds it with poor sources for biographical information about Mary Baker Eddy.Celebrity news is interesting; but one must question its veracity when so much of the other portions of the book are neither objective nor carefully checked out.Sadly disappointed as a source book; very entertaining fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"two months down and broken","review":"We've had this machine two months....yesterday, it stopped showing a picture, but still plays sound.

Koss is a horrible brand and I've had nothing but problems since the day I bought it. I should have just gotten my money back when I could instead of hoping it would turn out to be a great deal.

I've owned this VCR for about a year now and very rarely, if ever, use it. First, there's the almost impossible task of getting HD content into the thing. Second, as a regular old everyday-use VCR, it sucks. It's very slow to start playing a tape, it's tracking is terrible, and it doesn't even show a picture when you fast forward. My $99 Mitsubishi VCR is far superior for everyday VCR use. Although with TiVo and Netflix, I really don't use VCRs much anymore! I miss the awsome VCRs they made in the early '90s...with frame advance, jog shuttles, etc. I thought this would be the best VCR they make these days, and if it is, I think it's safe to say the days of the VCR are drawing to a close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and complicated.","review":"Does not make law easier.

It make the air circles in all the case.Pros:- 2 fans.- variable speed control.- low noise fans.- easy to install.- Long lifetime!- Cool blue led light in the fans.

Prior to this fan, GPU temp under load was about 80c. Now, with the fan on low (extremely quiet,) it barely spiked to 51c. With the fan on high under load it didn't get any higher than 40c. High setting is much louder, but it does have a variable switch (like a dimmer switch) so you can probably find a happy medium that works for you some where in between. Moves A LOT of air on low and even more on high setting. Very impressed for such a cheap price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really do what it should.","review":"Got this hoping that it would keep my GPU cooler, but it actually made it about 7C hotter idle and didn't do much on load.

Realistically, it's only going to have a significant effect on the two cards that it's in between as it doesn't draw fresh air or exhaust, but it will blow around the air inside for more of a chance for the hotter components to approach the average temperature inside the case.One thing I worry about though, is the claim that the card is \\"Made from UV sensitive material\\" which would mean either it would need protection from UV (to not degrade) or, for instance, where UV hits it, there's an etching left. As Mandy Patinkin said, \\"\\"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you kilt my father, prepare to die.\\" No wait, wrong quote - that has nothing to do with \\"UV sensitive material\\".

It does get quite noisy, when the speed is increased. I didn't need the LEDs, as they cannot be seen outside of my computer case, but that is no biggie. The main drawback is that you need an empty PCIe x16 or a PCIe x4 port, in order for the tabs on it to support it, which I didn't have available, but with a little ingenuity, it is working well and not sitting directly on my GPU."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty loud for the amount of air it moves.","review":"After buying this, it did not actually cool my GPU down much (1 degree Celcius at the most), partly my fault because I have a reference ATI card, and the heatsink partially blocks it.

Even on the lowest setting, it is audible over the sound of all the fans. If you have a reference GPU card, this probably will not help you cool down your GPU.

But when Lin is offered a job as a dance instructor in Mexico City, she abandons her husband and children and pursuits her dream. However, guilt courses through her body when she encounters abandoned children in the mean streets of Mexico. Will she leave it all behind and continue to pursue her career, or will the ties of motherhood bind her back with her children? The author of Mark of the Angel delivers another haunting and beautiful tale of love and sacrifice in Slow Emergencies. Her writing is poised and elegant, yet dark and disarming. The building of tension and emotion threaten to jump out of the pages as the flooring conclusion approaches. Nancy Huston hasn't let me down. I look forward to reading more of her work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding causality poses no danger!","review":"I take issue with the previous reviewer.

Meanwhile her father, Charles I, was executed and the future Charles II wandered from country to country, a charismatic and charming man.Minette fell secretly in love with the young Sun King, Louis XIV, but he was oblivious to her and she ended up in an unhappy marriage to his homosexual brother Phillippe.

The action is also very interesting and the game is far from easy. If you like a challenge it, this is the game for you. The game is never boring and there is a ton of upgrades. Also, you get quite a few heroes and each has two very cool abilities.

The last scene, where the spirits wander off into the mists is a little too reminescent of stuff like Godzilla and is far too drawn out.

However if you've used Maya or Max before and want to learn more and polish your modeling techniques, this is a good one to start with.Some pictures are used to show examples (end results) but screenshots of the progress and exactly what menus are being accessed and where they're located would've been very helpful rather than listing out the instructions and showing end results.However it does provide a lot of information and who better to learn from than the source, Alias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Starters","review":"This book was used in my Intermediate 3d Animation course and it's pretty good for the basics of rigging a bipedal character. However, the book tends to be inconsistent with some of its naming conventions for certain bones while rigging, which could confuse a beginner. For example, when they go through and tell you to name all your bones, they tell you to name the \\"knee\\" joint \\"up leg\\", then a few chapters later, they refer to it as the \\"knee joint\\" instead of \\"up leg.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Animation","review":"I bought this for my 13-year-old daughter as she wishes to be an animator.

The tap water in Philadelphia is very chlorinated and difficult to drink. It was like drinking pool water. Doable but awful. We bought this unit for our kitchen sink. It came with the 20a filter which helped a lot, but we upgraded to the 30a and have been very happy.It did have the high pitch whine when on full, but it went away. The water pressure did decrease but it's very easy to live with.I've recommended this to many of my friends. I'm happy with it and would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After several hours of work, i was unable to install this product.

I have it connected to the cold water line of my kitchen faucet. I'm using the D20 filter. It slows the flow just a little, but I don't care to pressure wash my dishes. It is a water saving feature. My friend just purchase 3 Britta filters for the price I paid for this and this filter doesn't take up space in the frig. Everything taste better now and the filtered water is leaving less or no film on my dishes. Very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but pain to install","review":"This is the second one of these I've bought - this new one is for a part time 2nd home. My plumber installed the first one, and I should have looked closer at how he did it. Those push-in compression fittings were difficult to get working without leaks! I did finally get them to stop leaking, but this connection type gives me an uneasy feeling that they might pop-out at any time!Anyway, the way my plumber did it was to push a short length of 3/8\\" Copper tubing into the fittings on the filter (instead of the plastic tubing supplied), and then convert to screw-on metal-braided tubing for the rest. It is better this way, but requires buying more parts at the hardware store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent filter","review":"Luckily, this is exactly the same filter as the old Ace Hardware model that I bought about 10 years ago.

I have ripped the assembly out of the wall every time. I have tried up to 200lb. wall anchors and either removing or installing the filter has not worked properly. The included D-20A filter works great with no pressure change and water comes out better tasting and clearer than before. I did upgrade to the D-30A filter and water pressure dropped significantly. Installation is simple and easy the main downfall to this product is the pressure drop and unit being ripped from wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks","review":"The quick-connects, plastic connectors that attach the PVC pipe to your under the sink pipes, are not high quality.

I spent 2 days fixing leaks from compression fittings, after all the leaks were fixed the filter works OK.

I put this in my machine (HP6210) and printed a test on HP paper. I printed a second picture when a put the no. 94 cartridge back (in effect making it a 'four color' device, which is what you would normally have in the printer). The same picture looked better when printed with the four colors. Most notable were the flesh tones-MUCH more lifelike. I would hold off on spending $24 for one of these, primarily because the result is not worth it, but also because the manner which HP designs the ink set-up.

This is in an interesting format, each eps is a different month...IE: March, April...you get the point. Over all I loved the show that I saw...so I'm excited to see the legal version and how well they translate some of the funnier parts, which ushually have to do with the fairy's missunderstanding words, or thinking they mean somthing else...which is easy to do since lots of japanese words mean more than one thing in different context.

The magic in this book is just a plot device -- it does no real work except to occasionally have a spell misfire in some uninteresting way. Turtledove has done some very interesting work with magic (see, e.g., the Toxic Spell Dump) but he hasn't done it here. I love Turtledove's work, but this book offers little to the reader to justify its hardcover price. It's not actually bad, you understand, just not up to his usual standards. I'd put it into a class with \\"Into the Darkness,\\" which shares its flaws.Harry, you're a hell of a writer.

With each page the author conveys the reader to a London of vintage technicolor punctuated with spurts of bright orange/red blood and bruised purple flesh. The mystery of the identity of The Ripper centers around a creepy Arkham Asylum-type charity hospital and only strays for quick jaunts to the local pub/brothel, Scotland Yard or the occasional dark alley. The suspects are all archetypes, base on real life persons-of-interest or characters from other Ripper fiction. All and all, JACK THE RIPPER is a fun exploitive read that will surely entertain Hammer film fans with it loose and fast interpretation of the infamous crimes, while raising the blood-pressure of Ripperologists from across the pond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berlitz makes better products","review":"I bought this set before going to Italy for the summer. Since it had 4cd's, 2 books and a dictionary, I assumed that it would be a great help to me in learning some Italian. But it wasn't. The presentation is not particularly orderly or succinct, and an entire section early on is devoted to how to say absurdly complicated things like \\"I'm married, but my partner has just left me with our children\\". And what I really wanted to learn was simply how to buy tickets, order food, and hold brief, polite conversations.If you'd like to get started learning Italian, I'd recommend Berlitz's \\"Rush Hour Italian\\" which does a good job of going over the basics and helping you remember them."},{"rating":"1","title":"She talks too much","review":"I bought several videos at once and this was my least favorite.

Also, you will have to change the water pretty constantly, but it does cut down on the weight. For the price I got it (115) there is no better and it does a fairly good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"This item does not come with the advertised Steamvac Mega Carpet Care Kit.

Unfortunatetly it is greatly overrated. It is little more than a vaccum cleaner. On carpet with a pattern, like sisel or wool carpet, the brushes do not reach the carpet material.

Big Mistake!I recently attempted to use the hand attachments to clean my chairs. WHAT A MESS!! The hand attachment sprays all over the place. In order to get WARM water, you have to hold down the water spray button for several seconds, leaving your chair cushion saturated, and your floor wet!Hoover should be ashamed calling this a STEAM vac! Its down right misleading. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover should be ashamed","review":"Would like to use this product but it arrived missing the three nuts listed on the instructions.

I purchased an earlier version of this cleaner about 10 years ago so when it no longer worked I purchased this unit. Just a couple of comments to the engineers/designers:The older version had a handle for the dirty water container so you could carry it, the new one does not making it interesting to pick up and carry.The older version had a hose already connected to the machine to clean stairs and upholstry --ready to use but the new one requires you to connect the hose manually to the unit and the dirty water tank too; not fun. Opportunity to spill water increases.The new unit actually heats up the carpet which is very nice. Speeds up the drying!Really love this unit even though the older one had its day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to use","review":"The biggest problem with this carpet cleaner is the instruction booklet.It really makes it alot more complicated than it needs to.And nothing is in order of using it.But once I realized that I did not need to even use the big hose (only used on furniture)....I zoomed thru the rooms with ease.The dirty water holder does not hold much, so that needs to be emptied a couple of times for each large room.

It had been over a year since they were cleaned professionally and were really dirty. This machine WORKS!!!!!! It takes a bit of going over the same areas numerous times, and refilling the tanks but it works wonders!My suggestion that I found very helpful was to go over the area 1st with cleaning solution provided, and throw a scoop of OXYCLEAN in with the detergent.Step 2 is to go over the area again this time with PLAIN mircrowaved or boiled hot water alone. No detergent is necessary the 2nd time, because the amount of dirty water will astonish you! If the water the 2nd time around is really black, as mine was, then you can go over the area again a 3rd time to pick up more dirt again using ONLY Hot water.I highly recommend this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"What a great cleaner!

I thought buying one will allow me to keep it clean constantly. It arrived in a day from ordering, packaging was no issue. Assembly was easy. And it worked perfectly. You might need t o move it slowly and with strength if your carpet is so dirty as mine was, but that's it. Pretty easy to use. You just need to put in hot water, add the cleaner, and you're good to go till you need to change the water. Will try to remember to update the review when I use it more, and if there were any issues with it. So far, so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"I am very happy with how the carpet cleaner worked. It was easy to use and clean afterwards, and judging by the color of the water I emptied, it did a good job. I used the power clean function on high traffic areas and that helped a lot. The only drawback I can think of is you might want a machine with larger water containers if you're cleaning carpets in a large home/room. It gets a little tiresome filling and emptying the water containers. If you have average sized rooms, this one will work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assembly From Hell","review":"The point's been made that this is a great carpet cleaner. It is. I used it yesterday and was happy with the results. You should totally get it.There's a couple down sides though, and that's assembly/learning the tricks of how to use it. Putting this cleaner together isn't quick and easy. In fact it was a serious pain.HOWEVER, once I got past all that and a few trial and error sessions of the dirty water tank not being picking up because it wasn't situated properly, it worked well. The carpet is clean and fluffy once more. The dry time is EXCELLENT. You won't be stuck with soggy carpet for that long.Be prepared for a hassle the first time you use it. After that, it should be smooth sailing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would buy this again!","review":"This carpet cleaner works great and is definitely worth the price. I paid a professional almost $300 to clean the areas I did with this cleaner, and had just as good of results. I have loaned it out to two other friends and now they are purchasing one for themselves. It's easy to use and dries quickly. It is plastic, so some of the parts are fragile. Already have one piece broken off, but the cleaner is still usable. I figured if I can at least get two major cleanings out of it, it's a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900I received the steamvac in 3 days & was very happy.

I had Regina SteamCleaner for about 9 years until I bought Hoover F5914-900 yesterday. Hoover is made in USA and the quality shows in overall design and operation. This is as close as it gets to the Hoover pro machine I rented once that sells for $1099. Amazing cleaning power with 12amp motor and ease of operation. Quality heavy duty durable plastics used, makes it a better value all together. Consumer product still made in USA, not China or Mexico is worth the price tag itself, you will not find a better value in this price range. I looked at Bissell machines also but did not like its overall design, somewhat cheap thin shiny plastic look and low web review ratings.Use as directed with hot water to loosen the dirt, and go slow give the machine chance to break the dirt and suck it out from the rug. Tanks are smaller than in the pro machine, but machine is lighter and smaller than $1099 Pro Hoover SteamVac monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"SteamVac","review":"The product arrived well-packaged and with relatively easy assembly instructions.

Low and behold the machine worked for about a year and the suction mechanism stopped working! I have a fairly big house, but I am the only person living in it and I mainly used it on the high traffic areas. I wear no shoes nor do I allow anyone to wear shoes in my home and these 2 machines just gave up on me. I am extremely disappointed.I will probably not buy any more hoover products ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Good for a little while","review":"This worked well for a couple months, then it would stop sucking up the water.

The machine does feel a bit cheap compared to our last shampooer which was a Bissel. This Hoover definitely performs better than the Bissel, I just hope it lasts. We are having the same leaking problem I see others are having. It leaks badly only when we use the hand attachment. I have read from other reviewers that I may have not assembled it properly.

She has been renting a Rug Doctor once a month to keep everything fresh and clean. She was very excited to have her very own cleaner, but I could tell she had some doubts on how well it would work. She called me the next day and told me she was using it right then and it was AWESOME! I asked if it worked as well as the rug Dr and she said it was actually better. What else could a mom ask for? A college daughter who is actually happy to have a cleaning appliance!

Ridiculous. Last unit leaked from the bottom severely! This one does not leak as bad but still leaks through the bottom. I have now saturated my carpet while cleaning my couch because I was unaware my new unit was leaking. Luckily, I was able to suck up the water from the main unit. I have no idea why this gets such rave reviews. The cleaning path is very small, as well as the detergent canister. You can't clean an entire room with one fill up from the detergent tank, you will need to keep refilling. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected.","review":"This product does not removes stains very well. Its more for everyday use and not actual deep cleaning. I had a few stains where juice and coffee were spilled and tried to go over the spots a few times but it didnt remove any of it. I'm assuming the stains were too deep for the short brushes to reach. I even tried leaving it on a stained section with the brushes running at full speed, but it just looked like someone wore out my carpet in that spot.Overall, good for very light cleaning, removing dust, surface dirt, but will not remove deep stains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I bought this thinking in the middle price range I was going with a good thing, especially after reading the reviews, well most of them. First assembly was easy except putting the back hose on was a little confusing but no big deal. Well for one the steam is for drying the carpet not for cleaning. Next, it left all the water in my carpet it sucked up some dirt and dust but no water, I felt underneath and to me there was hardly any vacuum power, next I tried using the spinning attachment and it went so slow that it didn't clean anything. I sent it back for a refund think I will try a bissel this time, my bissel vacuum can suck a bag up 3 inches away, no joke either lol. I do however like the two tank system, too bad mine didn't suck any water up. As always though, Amazon is the best place to buy, hassle free return, wonderful customer service and great prices. I will always buy from Amazon Thank you Tracey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great, then...","review":"Suction is fantastic. Detergent distribution is very good. I would highly recommend this except for one overwhelming fact. It's designed to break.The first thing you'll notice with this unit is that the triggers are very stiff, uncomfortable to use and fragile. Your hand will become tired very quickly holding the triggers. They will also fail after about 15 to 20 cleaning. The plastic retainers built into the handle for the pivot points for the triggers is thin and very weak. There's no possible way they could last long at all. The replacement part is available online for under $10, but count on it failing soon, too.The entire upper portion of this unit could use a complete redesign. The lower portion seems fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my steam cleaner!","review":"When I received my Hoover steam cleaner, I was so anxious to get working with it that I went crazy going room to room, like a robot!!

It finally broke and to replace it, I thought I'd try this.I followed all the recommendations here about making sure the lids and hoses were tight. I pressed the Clean Surge button. The water container leaked AND there was no suction.I assembled and reassembled five times to make sure. Nothing.I tried to hook up the hand cleaner to see if it would work. Nothing.I called Hoover. Guy said he didn't have a manual in front of him and to take it to the store. He was so impatient to get me off the phone.Called the store and the local branch is no longer open. The next closest place would charge me $15-20 just to look at it. Why I am out this money and not Hoover?Worst Amazon experience ever. I've learned to buy heavy household stuff from a brick-and-mortar store were they can at least replace it without shipping.Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The secret is the suction","review":"The secret to success with this Vac is the well designed, sealed suction that slurps up that cleaning liquid so fast, the deep ground in dirt can't help but flow with it. I was simply blown away about a stretch of carpet I 'rescued' with just two passes of the Hoover. My hallway of beige carpet had become deeply, darkly grey and occasionally urinated on by my cat over the course of 3-4 years. A couple passes with the clean surge depressed and appropriate dry cycles, followed by a fresh water rinse (hot) about 30 minutes later, and the carpet is looking and smelling amazing. Used the pet enzyme formula which has a fantastic smell. I had already planned on replacing the carpet, it was so bad, but with this machine I can hit the hallway every 6 months or so to amazing results. It's not much bigger than my Boss vac and it's lighter. All around a great product in this price range, and suitable for single family homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 22 monts","review":"Bought this 1/31/10 and everything was going fine, but used it yesterday and it no longer extracts water from carpet or bare surface.

Would not recommend or buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"I love this steam cleaner. I had been borrowing the Bissel Proheat Pet from a neighbor and decided to get one of my own. I did a little more research and found that this one had better reviews.

I was aware of the leaking problem mentioned by many people. I read the directions thoroughly, I assembled it correctly, and on first pass, it worked great. On second pass it sucked up the dirt well, but leaked all the water all over the rug when making my second pass.I rechecked all attachments, rehooked, reclasped every lid and tried again...it worked for awhile, but again, when I went to change the water, the second time it leaked...it leaked while I tried to figure out why it was leaking, and it is still leaking...it may be the man, not the machine, but the frustration factor coupled with the tempermental leaky machine is not worth the time, money or frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The name is a bit misleading, because there is no steam, just hot water. The vac was simple to assemble and it works well. No complaints. The hand-held tool is indispensable for doing stairs, upholstery and small areas where the machine would not fit. The carpets are WAY cleaner than they ever were before, you could really tell a difference. It seems to also reduce my cat allergy symptoms a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure","review":"I loved it! It did an awsome job cleaning my cream colored carpet, my carpet looked brand new after using this product.The only thing I didn't like is that the handle part tends to lean back for some reason when it is in the upright position.

I could not believe the color of the water the first time I used it!!! Carpet stayed wet for about 2-4 hours after cleaning. Product is somewhat difficult to set up initially, but once you get the hang of it it's not bad. Product is a little heavy to use, but works well. Also, it does leak if you forget to lock the handle in place AFTER EACH TIME YOU CHANGE THE WATER. You must remember to push the black button on the underside of the handle. All in all it's a good carpet cleaner and I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"If you want a product that works without breaking the bank then this is it. We live in an apartment and have 2 cats, so I found this steamer to be the solution to not having to go rent a rug doctor every time there was a spill or a pet related accident. I will say the first time we used it the water was almost black so it definately cleaned up something. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you have to empty the water in the dirty container, which isn't really that difficult but can be a pain at times. But overall its good, easy to use if you follow the directions to a tee, and easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"carpet cleaner","review":"After reading several reviews I bought the Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac. I knew that it really wasn't a steam cleaner(doesn't heat the hot tap water!) but by the reviews it also looked to be the least likely to break down. I have successfully cleaned two carpets and all of the stains have come out. Hopefully we won't have any of the problems that I have read about in the reviews. Very simple to put together and operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Model Number for Hoover Steam Vacs","review":"You definitely want the F5914-900 when shopping for steam cleaners. The suction power on this machine is terrific, there are separate tanks for the dirty and clean water, AND the price is under $200.00. You really can't beat it. It does a professional job.Important Note: When the unit is assembled properly, there is some play left in the handle when you are through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is my 2nd Hoover SteamVac. The old one lasted much longer than it should have. Being so pleased with it I bought another one. So far I am just as pleased with this one. The only problem I see with it is when it is in the upright locked position. It doesn't sit quite upright and so with no water in the tanks it tends to tip over easily. But that doesn't seem to affect it when I'm using it. So I can certainly deal with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"I've had it for about a month and used it several times. Its good points are that it cleans well and quickly whether it is on stairs or area rugs, and the attachments work well. It does not leak and while the cleaning fluid should be heated, that is not a nuisance to do. Cleaning it out can be difficult because of the baffles inside the recovery tanks, and reattaching the upholstery and stair case tube hose usually results in part of that not staying hooked on. But for the money and the deep cleaning result, I'm satisfied.Updateg: two years later: One significant flaw has appeared. The flimsy rubber tube that's needed for the hand-held unit easily separates from its connector, particularly when the water is hot. That causes a fountain of water and cleaner to spray out unexpectedly. The rubber tube should have been thicker-walled, and made serviceable (replaceable by the buyer). Otherwise, the unit is holding up even with noticeable brush wear."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],C={key:0},N={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(o(!0),i(f,null,y(r.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(D,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-76219bd0"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/6.md","filePath":"people/6.md"}'),R={name:"people/6.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
