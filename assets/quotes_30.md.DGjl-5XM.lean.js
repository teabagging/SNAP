She has in several book given false information that could only have given by not doing the research, she also seems to suffers from the poor poor pagan syndrome in that she blames all the wrongs within paganism, on Christianity, Pagans of course have never done any any wrong, nor have they any reason to take responsibility for anything. She has a good eye for what sells but seems to not care about facts, or actually teaching. But I guess I shouldn't expect much in a world where everything seems to be sell. Even religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for a beginning witch","review":"I have been wanting to be a witch for many years, finally I have found a group of ladies that are teaching me more, this book is a good way to learn magik.

Instead, try reading books and articles about the folklore. D.J. Conway's book is about putting a veneer of Celtic deity names over basic Wiccan practices. Her \\"facts\\" are inaccurate; her correspondence table is both misleading and inaccurate. If you want to know about Celtic deities, refer to Miranda Green's _Gods of the Celts_."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful....","review":"Please pick up something different on the celts.This is just a new-age version of Wicca, wrapped in green saranwrap with shamrocks on it.Riverdance will teach you more celtic magic than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"This book offers a very brief and cursory look at Celtic Magick as perceived by D.J.

I boguht this book when I was just beginning my life as a Celtic Druid, and this book, which failed to even /spell/ Magick correctly, confused me to no end. The terms are outdated, the lore and myth is painfully butchered, and this seems to be, more than anything, the attempt to slap a Celtic label on a book of inexperienced Wicca. But, then again, I've always believed nothing can take the place of an experienced, practiced mentor in matters such as spirituality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm....well....","review":"This book was good for two things: 1)It was the first book I read when I started my exploration of magick , 2)The charts are alright but not the best.

I thought it would contain useful information on the Celts... wrong! This book is really awful. DJ Conway hashes up old information about common magical practices/items from older authors, has inaccurate historical information and presents the book in a way that you have to do a dedication to Celtic deities first before explaining anything else. Should have been called Celtic Wicca. I don'' have a problem if it was present in a way of Wicca with a Celtic flavor.. but saying the Celts were Wicca? Come on.. Gerald Gardner 1950s... everyone knows that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro","review":"This is a good intro for people interested in the Craft for a religion or just curious.

I recommend it highly for jumping of point in exploring your own spiritual path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong genre","review":"DJ Conway should have been a fiction writer. Basically, all her books that I've ever read are fiction.How does it help the Pagan community at all to perpetuate these romanticized fantasies as history? It makes us look like idiots to the rest of the world, and basically authors like Conway are doing the exact thing they accuse Christians of doing-- they have an agenda (selling books) and are lying to people to suck them in.It's downright dispicable. And she puts the same stuff in her books over and over again; this repurposed material is just a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"beginners only","review":"There are many problems with this book, starting with the fact that the magic system presented, while effective enough, isn't really Celtic at all, more of a basic Wiccan/Ceremonial system. However, if one wants to learn this there are better books out there to do so. The tables of correspondances are handy enough and are practically the only reason to recommend this book, but again, there are better sources with more in-depth knowledge. This book would be great for a beginner, but advanced practitioners are advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has VERY, VERY few redeeming qualities","review":"I cannot recommend this book as anything other than a cheap read to pass the time. The information in it is grossly inaccurate and on the whole a farce. It seems that the author would rather compare the, in reality almost non-existent historically, relationship between Wicca and Celtic pagan worship. There is very little information on spellwriting/crafting, and relatively little talk of the Druidic lifestyle. This book will do little more than steer a beginning Celtic pagan or Bard in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserved ZERO stars ....","review":"This is the WORST book I have ever read about Celtic \\"magic\\".

Don't waste your time or money on this book, I can't believe it was even published."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Gobbledygook","review":"This is yet another wicca 101 primer rather than a reference on Celtic Paganism. Much of her claims fly in the face of archeologic evidence and credible historic research. Many of the sources Ms. Conway quotes are (at best) out of context.

This book has come in for a lot of criticism here, and a lot of it's justified.However, this was the book that set me on the pagan path, and as such I guess I feel a little sentimental about it.The history is bad. Okay. That's something you're likely to find in most books on paganism these days, and at least it's vague enough to make people (such as myself) read up on it and learn the \\"truth,\\" so to speak.I thought the correspondence tables were quite nice, even if there's next to no information on too many of the deities listed there aside from the mention of their names.The rituals are the high point of the book for me. Even if they don't quite suit your personal practice, I'd recommend a look at them for ideas on how to write your own.All in all, a book of limited use, but it makes for a nice read anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"inaccurate and misleading","review":"Having been born and bred in Wales and being Celtic through and through, this book is totally inaccurate and misleading. It dwells more on Wicca rather than Celtic Paganism, if you want to write a book on Wicca, write a book about wicca, and leave Celtic Magic to those who actually practice it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Badly Researched, Badly Written Book By DJ Conway","review":"What can I say? The woman has 18 books in print, and they're all basically the SAME BOOK. Just with different god-names added in.

This book is not a good reference on Celtic ways. The myths are very touch and go, and written in a way that wold be confusing to someone not familiar with them, and if your familiar you won't learn anything. The table of correspondences is not a druid one, but a modern one having nothing to do with tradition, one fact evident of this is that aluminum which is named in the table was not invented for centuries later. Book is worth reading, but not entirely true, take everything with a grain of salt. I did enjoy the section on the Ogham Alphabet, but it alone is not worth ordering this book considering much more in-depth coverage of it is available. I would say if you are new to Celtic ways, and don't plan to do much other reading on it, get it, otherwise don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for fun.","review":"My only comment is this: Compare this book word for word with Norse Magic.

Over all, it's a good product, I wouldn't recommend long-term use, just a few hours a day at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Historical!","review":"The book devoted too much of its pages to the breeding history of the Scottish Terrier, not enough to the caring and maintenance of the breed. Also, there were no color pictures which I hated and no mention of the dog's personality traits etc. This book may be alright for Professional Breeders but in my personal opinion it's TOO EXPENSIVE a book for what it is. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Far Better Books","review":"This book was a big disappointment. Instead of a useful overview of the Scottish Terrier breed; it's history, temperment, health and so on the book focussed too much on lineages, particularly related to the author's own dogs. It seemed cobbled together from unrelated sources and does not appear well researched or thought out. Primarily, I suspect it is simply an advertisement for the author's own kennel in order to advance her in the dog show world. Muriel Lee's book on Scotties or even good old Dorothy Casperz various books are far better than this one which is definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The author focuses way too much on the dogs from the kennel she is associated with. Would like to have seen a broader perspective of the current breed rather than so many Anstamm dogs. The Muriel Lee and John T. Marvin books are much better overviews of the breed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pages devoted to lineage","review":"The book is 242 pages in length and the first 143 pages contain the different breeders (kennels.) I found the reading to be very difficult. However, I did see the names of two kennels my Scottie is descended from. I thought the book would contain more information on the history of the Scottie. There are a few pages devoted to the history of the Scottie though. I think the book would be great for breeders and those who show Scotties. For you people out there who want to learn more about your Scottie as a pet, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent compliment to course work","review":"This is a very comprehensive book with lot of information explained in a conversational style that is an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content, but unprofessional publishing","review":"I can disagree about the ease of understanding and the knowledge of Stephen Robbins, but Prentice Hall, the publisher of this book, has blown it.

I found the first book verging on silliness in places, but this book was much less so.One of the \\"blurbs\\" on the book compares this book to the Harry Potter books, but I wouldn't put it in that category. It is more pensive and is rarely as funny or fun-loving as the HP books. The HP books also have a down-to-earth-ness about them that this book doesn't have as much. It is definitely fantasy.The reason I gave the book only four stars is that I have a bit of trouble really getting interested in the characters. There are several that could be interesting, but the in depth development just doesn't seem to be there for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best","review":"Great book.

Did I miss the sign in the store says this book was limited to 12 years old readers?Max is some kind of a secret agent. What kind exactly you can see when he doesn't wait much before telling Lola about his job. Not sure he would be hired in the real world by ANY agency (and some readers talked about the vast research Ms. Gibson has done on the subject - come on!).The plot was boring, soooo boring...I used the book as a sleeping pill for two nights in a row before I realized this will never be TRULY MADLY YOURS.Sadly, Rachel Gibson moves to my buy-it-only-used books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lola Carlyle misses the mark....","review":"I'll admit that I was disappointed and didn't finish the book.

What sexy bra and thong model would get seriously upset about some naked pictures on the 'net?...and would a person really get someone to pay $25 to see them? No. When Lola realizes a stranger is on the boat, why didn't she pick up her cell phone instead of a flare gun? It is all so far-fetched, and ultimately, disappointing.

It was funny and had a little bit of heart at the same time. However, this last one \\"Lola\\" was so bad it gave romance novels a bad name and that's pretty hard to do.

Was this supposed to be funny? It wouldn't be so bad if Max didn't go on and on about how 'brave' she was. Please. Brave and courgous she was not. Lola Carlyle didn't do anything more special then the rest of us would've done in that situation. For crying out loud she hyperventilated while escaping. Of all times.*SPOILER* Yes she did give Max a chance at a relationship. Knowing that he could leave at any time and may never return.

The book takes a realistic look at Lola's bulimia and her struggle to recover. Max is a security consultant/undercover operative having a really bad day when he meets Lola by commandering the boat she's sleeping on to get away from drug lords who want him dead.

Hollywood's first WW2 film is a very authentic account of the early days of Britain at war. Good use of actual aerial battle-scene footage. And Grable adds a touch of much-needed sex appeal in her scenes with Power. In the original story Power's character was killed in battle, but when the British War Office heard of this, they pleaded with Zanuck to change the ending as it would have a bad effect on the morale of UK citizens!

Most streams, lakes, and trails that are mentioned are not shown on the very skimpy maps used. Most of the information is a decade out of date--the author is constantly referring to what the fishing may be like by the mid-1990s which according to my calendar was a decade ago.

Denon knows nothing about it.We also tried a Marantz IS201 dock on this receiver and it wouldn't pass video. When you would press the menu on the IPOD and then menu on the receiver you would then get the IPOD menu underlaid with the Denon menu. This product works flawlessly on other Denon receivers. It seems that the upconversion on the AVR 2807 has a problem with S-Video.

But the sheer beauty of the sound, the creamy texture, the totally secure delivery is, as always, a totalpleasure.

Way too long in the intro area and any dance club crowd would have long dispersed before the actual dance beat comes on. Upside Down is not bad, but not great either. Someday We'll Be Together sounds like one of those records where the needle gets stuck------the intro goes on and on and on.No point in going further. The people who do these seem to feel that by making the song longer and adding a few cute studio tricks the song will be better. They should all take a mixing lesson or two from Dan Hartman. If you can get this disc cheaply it would be nice to add to your collection, but do not pay full price for it because it is not worth it. You will not be playing it very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad treatment of some great songs","review":"I have to say that all the song on this collection are first rate...that is they were the first time out. I found all of the selections were laden down with heavy base in addition to a recomposition of the entire song structure. Where this usually works fine when producers are mindful of the artistic integrity from which the song was born, the sprit and/or flavor in which these songs were recreated here is completely lost. The one song I was particularly sadden by was \\"Someday We'll be Together\\". This song has always had a wonderful gospel feel to it that served The Supremes, and their fans, well as their swan song. However here it is reduced to horrible mix of misdirected instrumentation and a tempo that has to be an insult to the songs composures Beavers/Bristol/Fuqua."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing remixes!","review":"These remixes completely ruin the songs on this CD. I wish I could send this back. Instead of truly extending the song with clever and energetic remixes, this collection is nothing but a kinda of trip-hop/house beat mix on each of the songs. It reminds me of the kind of late night background mixes they play at a club-when everyone is not really dancing anymore but hanging around the bar drinking and \\"grooving\\" to the house beat. This album should be called Diana-Extended HOUSE mixes. Very boring CD. She should have had Gigi d'Agostino or Erasure remix it for her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana Exhausted....is more like it.","review":"This is one of, if not the worse remix album I have ever heard.

Avoid this one by all means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising concept fizzles out","review":"It's difficult to be captured by stories that seem to have been rushed. The whole Sexcapades thing was a promising concept, but the stories fail to deliver the amount of romance and eroticism that said concept required. All three novellas lack story development. The characters jump into the sack before the reader gets to know them. There's no building of sexual or romantic tension. Janelle Denison is one of my favorite erotic romance writers, but His Every Fantasy is an enormous disappointment. I couldn't finish Carly Phillips's Going All the Way. The aforementioned novella had more cliches than the average romance novel. Vicki Lewis Thompson's Illicit Dreams is passable, albeit insubstantial. All in all, Invitations to Seduction is a feeble effort. I'll stick to Kensington Brava anthologies from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"3 short stories that took me 1 day to read.

The rattan basket dresses up the glass dish when using it as a serving piece at a potluck dinner or on a side buffet table (which we all know you already use your other Pyrex baking dishes for!)The glass dish easily goes from the oven to the fridge / freezer to the dishwasher for easy clean up. The snap-on lid makes transporting food a worry-free event (*don't put the lid in the dishwasher though - it warps after a while).It is a shame this has been discontinued, but I suppose it was the precursor to the food carrier sets that they make these days. Try to find one of these on ebay if you can.

This book is not for a beginner who does not have a sharp Exacto blade to take out the pages he/she does not want or need.

If you're going to put a piece of glass onto an expensive lens, you want that glass (filter) to be of the highest quality. That's just what this filter is. It has a multi-resistant coating which most filters don't. The filter does what it's supposed to do. It removes reflections from the light and gives more intense colors, gives a blue sky and enhances the clouds. You get the best effect if shooting at a 90 degree angle to the sun. Move around a little until you get the effect you want. If you're shooting outside, a polarizer is a necessary for the best quality shots. And this B+W polarizer is of the highest quality glass. You will know that as soon as you pick it up and compare it to another filter you might have. I highly suggest this polarizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"B+W is the one to buy","review":"Top notch in every way. More expensive than the competition and well worth the extra cash.

Does exactly what it should, and that is polarize without distorting your images (at least as best as anything can).

I couldn't wait to see how much this filter would improve my images, how the colors would pop, how professional my work would look. For the most part, however, I couldn't see any difference at all compared to using a UV filter. The only instance in which I could see a noticeable change was when I was able to remove a reflection on the surface of a pond.I know how to use the filter, how it should be oriented to the light source, and I spent a whole two days shooting with nothing but this filter. I tested it over and over and over, rotating the bezel bit by bit just to make sure.

Its optical quality is excellent (one takes this for granted with B+W): no visible distortion, with good multi-coating to reduce flare. It is also wonderfully well constructed. It screws into place on my lens very smoothly. The rotating ring is damped a bit more than the ones on my other polarizers, requiring a little more effort to turn -- not so much as to be difficult or annoying, but enough to give it the feeling of a very solid, precision-made instrument that won't drift out of position by itself.B+W filters are not cheap, but they're the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made","review":"Great quality in B+W and no complaints with this filter.

I tried to remove the clip from the hard shell case and it snapped into several small pieces!

I have read the patent section of my IP supplements to prepare for the exam, and I by far recommend the IP hornbook. It's a little longer but WAY worth it over this book. If your library doesn't have a copy and it's too expensive for you, then try Examples and Explanations, but whatever you do, don't just rely on this book, you'll look like an idiot when you completely misstate some things.

That's great for people hanging a heavy bag from the ceiling.

And while that seems like a total \\"Yeah-sounds-like-any-other-first-love-teenage-book-of-growing-up-and-finding-yourself\\" it really is much more then that. Virginia's story gets much deeper when her brother, (who also happens to be the one person in the entire world that she admires and looks up to the most) makes a huge life changing mastake that will follow him for the rest of his life. And while all this is happening Verginia decides that she is not going to take any of her mothers [stuff] anymore and stop looking the way her mother wants her to look, and starts being the person that she has always been deep down inside, and not just the fat, shy, loser girl that people once knew her as.

I personally didn't like her \\"Fat Girl\\" rules list. But it's how people feel.What I particularly liked was about how when she discovered that when you get attention from your mother, it's not always good attention. When she pierced her eyebrow, when she dyed her hair, when she bought that purple dress, she was discovering herself, and she loved and understood, that she didn't have to please anyone else if she was happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you have time to read it all in one sitting!","review":"I promise you, once you pick up this book you will not want to put it down.

The narrator was easy to relate to, interesting, and not whiny (which was what I expected).I found myself in tears a few times during the book, as Virginia deals with more than just her weight, but also an over-achieving family, romantic hardships, isolation, and a crime that her brother commits.I picked up this book because it was on a banned book list. I have a hard time recommending this book for high-schoolers, even though Virginia (the narrator) is in high school.I would, however, recommend this book to any girl (probably aged 17 and up) who has ever dealt with being overweight.

Her father is a top executive whose favorite hobby is ogling stick-thin women, her mother is a successful psychologist and a diet and exercise fanatic, and her two older siblings are blond, wafer-thin, and all-around perfect. Virginia, on the other hand, shops in plus sizes, consumes junk food daily, and adheres to the \\"Fat Girl Code of Conduct.\\" As if all this isn't bad enough, her best friend just moved to Walla Walla (the complete opposite side of the country!), and she's afraid of her new \\"friend\\" Froggy Welsh the Fourth (his real name) will look up her shirt and never come back.

This book will hit home for anyone who has ever felt self-conscious or has had to re-evaluate the choices they were making."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This book is a delight. The humor is wonderful, and the main character so well drawn. There aren't many novels like this-- fast-paced and very funny, yet also deep and memorable.I started this book last night after dinner and finished it around 2:30 a.m. this morning. I couldn't put it down.The story is of an overweight girl with very low self-esteem and a selfish family. Gradually, she learns to love herself and to see her family's flaws and thrive in spite of them. It's an empowering book-- for overweight people, for teens, for females, for most readers I believe.I reccommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book.

Anyway these kids can be real monsters, literally. In one story the kids lift someone into the air, and he keeps going higher and higher then they all start floating. The book is In the Land of the Lawn Weenies.I thought of this book as a weird fiction book. It doesn't make sense but, it's funny and really is a good book once you get into it enough to understand it, but it is a little confusing because it switches stories ever 5-6 pages. I don't care for the cliffhangers that are on it. I really want to find out the rest of those stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"It scared me","review":"This book made me afraid to sleep at night, especially \\"Crizzles\\". It just creeped me out. However, this is a great book and don't let my weak nerves deter you from reading this. It's written very well and has great charecters. Like the kid in the centipedes story.On a side note, \\"The Road Weenies\\" wasn't nearly as creepy because no one died, I liked this one better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't stand it","review":"I have to say, I read only one story. But that was enough. It must have been the 8th story, since a child died in this one as someone else mentioned. This book reminded me of Pulp Fiction-type movies. I actually found Pulp Fiction hilarious, but it is not what I want my 8 year old son immersed in. The cynicism and violence, to me, is just not what children's literature is supposed to be about. They get enough of that in the real world & on TV. There's no innocence here! For this reason, I thought perhaps the book might be appropriate for a teenager who needs easier reading, but not for younger children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slight Caution","review":"This was recommended to us by a 9 year old. Our son, also 9, who read all of the Harry Potter books said he was creeped out by it. Sounds like pure fantasy so maybe it was just his reaction. We might save it for later. I would say try one in the series if you are interested and monitor how your child reacts to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for younger or sensitive children....","review":"My 9 1/2 year old son was intrigued with this title and the description which promises 'harrowing' but 'hilarious.' He's a very good reader with a great sense of humor, and he likes slightly scary stories, so I bought it. However, he read only eight of the stories before he put the book down with great disappointment and disgust. He said the stories he read weren't funny, none of the characters were at all likeable, and that a kid is killed in the eighth story.So I read those first eight stories, and I have to agree. These stories are harrowing, as promised, and more creepy than scary. They are not poorly written, however, and one was even a little funny (thus, my one star), but they're certainly not for every kid. If your kids, like mine, believe even fictional children shouldn't die for entertainment, pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Golden Glove","review":"Omar has continued his fantastic career from Seattle to Cleveland...I plan to ask him to sign it, then will present it to Seattle pitcher Arthur Rhodes and see his reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Player - Not so good a story teller","review":"I bought this book to hear the dirt about Jose Mesa.

Pearl Jam also stood as one of the greats in the Grunge movement, Eddie Vedder and co. really brought out all the best on 'Ten'. I mean, it's just a classic! Totally one of the best albums I've ever had the pleasure of hearing, I was brought to the attention of Pearl Jam when 'Jeremy' & 'Alive' was shown on a music channel and I was totally blown away!Since then I bought 'Ten' and was amazed with how clear and fresh it sounded what with all the copy-cat type grunge-wannabe bands try to do today. Obviously I'm talking Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Seether, Creed, and other talentless losers who rip-off the originators of the genre!Please fellow CD buyer, DO NOT purchase anything from THOSE bands, only listen to the original intelligent bands like the ones I recommended at the beginning of my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their first \\"Release\\".","review":"For some people, this isn't just the best \\"Pearl Jam\\" album ever, it's the best grunge album ever. I'm not one of those people. I do think this is a great album, and it's definitely their most straight forward rock record, but I also believe they've released better since. They're also a much diffent band today than they were then. \\"Ten\\" may be the epitome of grunge to some, but musically it also reminds me of alot of the hair bands they helped to make extinct, much like \\"Mother Love Bone\\" before. Anyway, I'm getting off the subject. This is a good disc, full of many rockin' songs, I just don't enjoy it as much as \\"Vs.\\", \\"Yield\\", or \\"Riot Act\\". I give \\"Ten\\" a 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that started it all.","review":"Pain, agony, life, death, and kids shooting themselves in front of their classmates. This is what Rock n' Roll is all about. This debut from the only Seattle band left around these days smacks of Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament's infections grooves, Mike McCready's frenetic solos, and Eddie Vedder's nihilistic lyrics. After wearing the CD out years ago it's hard to find favorites that stand up to some of their later material but non-radio friendly gems like Once, Why Go, Porch, Deep and Release make this album a must have. And the extended intro to Once that follows Release shows that this band is not all about testosterone and stage diving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Deluxe Edition with Remix - BAD sound quality.","review":"Just a quick note:Not a big fan of Pearl Jam but willing to give this \\"classic\\" a go recently. Song not bad, appreciate the work they put in for the remixed tracks... Can't say which (remaster vs. remix) I prefer.BAD part: These CD's are a sad example of the nasty loudness wars ([...]). They sound horribly compressed and certain parts distorted on high quality sound systems. Perhaps not a big issue with grunge but still wrong is wrong.Easily 5/5 if they allowed the album to breathe with full dynamics. As it stands - 2/5 since audio quality ESSENTIAL for a remaster.."},{"rating":"2","title":"ten box set","review":"this set was worth the wait.watching the dvd took me back to where pearl jam began.love it.great stuff.have been a fan since the begining and always will."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Reasons Grunge Was Good.","review":"The first being Nirvana's \\"Bleach\\", the second being this instant classic. Why do Pearl Jam, let alone this CD still remain powerful? It's quite simple: Solid music, with easily synched instruments and captivating vocal work by Vedder. At least, that's my opinion. No matter what you may think, there's no denying the impact this band has had and continues to have, even after 20 years. They have been and probably always will be, awesome. And this is their best work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grunge apex","review":"This is most definitely Pearl Jam's best album. This album perfectly mixes Pearl Jam's melodic style, the Seattle Grunge sound, and their politics (agree with them or not.) This album is one of the pinnacles of Grunge. Unfortunately, after this album, Pearl Jam basically departed from their Grunge roots, never to be the same, or as good, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with \\"Alive\\" on the remastered disc???","review":"IF you go 27 seconds into \\"Alive\\" on the remastered disc, the audio clearly drops down to a dull a slighty muted/muffled sound, then for the next minute goes back to sounding ok again. How did they miss that?It's great to have the dvd of the Unplugged performance but after listening to both discs, I don't hear any difference (other than loudness) in the remastered version over the original release.The remixed versions are interesting at first to listen to, but they certainly are not any better. In some songs, it's much worse. Yes it's good to hear Vedder more clearly but in so many songs the guitar solos are pulled back and get drowned out by other instrumentation. Other times Vedder sounds so separate from the music that it's almost like he's singing in a closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Seattle Grunge Sound","review":"There isn't much that can be said of Pearl Jam's Ten anymore. It is certainly an album that has stood the test of time, with many of its tracks still played on on rock and alternative radio stations across America today. The music is solid and straightfoward; pure Seattle grunge that defined the era. However, superb songwriting, excellent guitar work, and Eddie Vedder's gripping voice full of emotion, pain, and torment, solidify this release as head and shoulders above much of the grunge sound that appeared in early '91 and '92. As such, this is definately an album that every rock fan should have in their catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to have this masterpiece!","review":"First, sorry for my poor vocabulary, I'd like to have the finest and appropriate words to describe such a powerful work of art. I'm always going around telling whoever I can that this is the best album of the 90's, and the more the time passes, the more I believe it! From my personal point of view, Eddie has the most emotionally powerful voice I've ever heard, being deep, sweet and aggressive on the same song or on the same album, letting us exploring his \\"insides\\" (using his word) through his evocative lyrics. Reading the other reviews, Eddie is not causing the same emotions to someone else, but I guess these are exceptions...I owe the whole PJ discography, and every cd has its \\"pearls\\" in it. But this album... remains my favourite. Black, Jeremy (the best one), Even Flow, Why Go, Release, are the highest expressions of PJ, and, in my personal opinion, of the music scene ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten out of Ten. Held up Through the ages.","review":"Pearl Jam's Ten is one of few albums that can be listened to from beginning to end without skipping any songs. From the opening firey lyrics of \\"Once\\" to the quite end of \\"Release\\" this album is 100% quality. The musical talent soars through the roof and the vocals are stunning, especially compared to today's baron wasteland of musical talent. With most of today's bands spitting out overused power chords pathetic lyrics and whiny dramatic voices. Ten is put together like a work of art. Each instument speaks to you, and the songs's lyrics make you think. These songs are constructed and have character and depth. If your a fan of music in any way, Ten is for you. If it doesn't already belong to you, it should very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best Pearl Jam yet, excellent laid back rock&#65533;","review":"This is still one of my favorite CD's for just kickin back and listening to great rock. Being a fan of heavier metal rock, this is a relaxing CD for me. My favorites are Even Flow, Alive, Why Go, Black, and Jeremy. From the harder drum and bass of Why Go and Porch, to the laid back vocals on Alive, Black, and Jeremy, to the almost too soft tunes of Oceans and Garden, wrapping up with the almost mystical finish of Release, this is one great CD to add to any rocker's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pearl Jam CD. Ever","review":"Back in the early 90s this was one of the best cds out there. Now in the new millenium this is one of the best cds ever. Pearl Jam found the right formula for success, and captured raw energy that they have yet to duplicate. Maybe the reason for the success of the album is how one can emphasis with Vedder's lyrics. If you don't own this cd and you like rock, you owe it to yourself to pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic for your collection","review":"I have to fight my 16 year old son for this cd. Of course, he has to fight me for Vitalogy. He asks me on occasion if I have heard of Jimi or Cream or Led Zepplin, so I know he is ok.(Kids!) So for you over 40 something rock music fans this cd belongs with those artists. A a debut that establishes Pearl Jam as one of rock music's great bands.And Release is an overlooked classic.Sit back. turn it up, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the start of a revolution","review":"I have not been a PJ fan since their establishment. In fact, I didn't like them from the few songs I first heard. I thought \\"Jeremy\\" wasn't anything special, and \\"Release\\" was just a grunge band's attempt to write a ballad. However, they grew on me... A LOT. This band grew on me so much that they became my favorite band. This album is not my favorite album, but it is VERY GOOD. It is among the most influential albums out of the 90s. Do yourself a favor and enlighten yourself with the grunge genre's founding fathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!!!!!!","review":"Even after all these years, even when the Seattle invasion (bands like Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden) is long forgotten, Pearl Jam are still producing masterpiece after masterpiece.\\"Ten\\" their debut and finest piece of work to date is just fantastic. Containing many of the early singles such as Even Flow, Jeremy and Alive as well as the brilliant Garden and Once you will soon find yourself listening to this album over and over again.The finest track on the album without a shadow of a doubt is \\"Black\\", I believe Eddie wrote this from a true experience.Most people especially in this country point to Nirvana's Nevermind as the greatest grunge rock album, I disagree; this is better balanced and more original.Finally if you don't believe this album is as good as I say go see PJ live and watch the reaction when a \\"Ten\\" song is played - it will blow you away!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good songs, but you have to look hard to find them","review":"In the tradition of bands reviving music styles popularized in the '70's, we have PEARL JAM.

So, I would only be able to recommend this to fans of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"the only record by them i like","review":"this group was way overrated.aside from the jim morrision comparisions of eddie veddar to there isn't much substance to anything they do.take eddie away and you might have a good lounge act and that's pushing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check The Vinyl For Mold Release","review":"Check The Vinyl For Mold Release A WHITE SUBSTANCE ALONG THE EDGE OF THE VINYL, To get it off you need two use isoproply alcohol.

ELEVEN YEARS LATER, and I can see this CD for what it truly is, an uninspired, bland commercial pop knock-off.Songs like \\"Alive\\" and \\"Even Flow\\" have dated horribly in the past decade, while stiff like \\"Jeremy\\" was considered MTV-fluff even back then. If you didn't fall for the hype (like me) and wasted your money on this, then good for you. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid anything Pear Jam","review":"\\"Ten\\" is one of the most unoriginal albums ever written...\\"Alive\\", \\"Ten\\",\\"Black\\",(One word titles,how clever) are the most boring songs I have ever heard, lyrically and musically. A down point in American music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless","review":"Yawn. Yet another '90s band with a bleak view of life.This whole album just belongs in the dumpster. It was really laughable that \\"Jeremy\\" became a hit. That so-called \\"song\\" was just plain awful. One of the worst songs of the '90s -- and that is saying a lot, because the '90s was absolutely, positively the most pathetic decade for popular music so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond boring","review":"Not only does \\"Ten\\" have the worst album cover in the history of rock n' roll, it has some of most boring songs ever written. The songs aren't bad, but utterly uninteresting and are the essence of boring. I'm completely dumbfounded by their success. When Nirvana, Soundgarden and even Mudhoney were creating a sludgy heavy metal punk pop sound known as grunge, Pearl Jam shows up and while supposedly being part of this group, just play hard rock music, that sounds more inspired by Aerosmith than Black Flag. Eddie Vedder has an interesting voice at best, but can't compete with the emotional intensity of Kurt Cobain or the bluesy voice of Chris Cornell. As for the rest of the band, none of them left enough of an impression on me for me to even remember their names. Basically, Pearl Jam brought the dinosaurs back to life. Their influence on other artists is profound as well, creating other similar sounding boring bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Candlebox and Silverchair."},{"rating":"1","title":"pearl jam ...maybe for free","review":"i cant believe the hype i've heard about Pearl Jam....i mean dont get me wrong here, they make good music but doesnt it seem a little strange that they sound just like Creed and even Silverchair back in the day. now thoses bands have talent and originality. so if your thinking of buying Ten or any other Pearl Jam album, i would suggest Creed's Human Clay instead. God Bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up with Nirvana and Soundgarden as a Classic","review":"Great album! Pure emotion and lyrical geinious the whole way through. Not a bad song. Never slows down. Considered one of the best albums of the 90s by many critics. Even Flow has a great guitar riff and an awesome guitar solo. Alive is pure genious and Vedder demonstrates a beautiful singing voice. Black is one of the best slow songs ive ever heard and Jeremy is wild the whole way through. This is a great grunge/alternative cd and for anyone serious about music it is a must buy and probably among the top 10 cds of the decade. Pearl Jam's never made a better effort yet. This stuff is amazing. Buy it buy it buy it buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Jam ??

First of all Eddie Vedders voice sounds like the son of a bullfrog on crack and toni braxton and ruins any song that has a decent guitar riff. People love to overate this band because they didn't make videos or release singles, but Metallica did that before them and actually made good music. I like grunge but am not one of those people who hates commercial music. I listened to Guns N' Roses Motley Crue and Van Halen in the 80's and early 90's and I still like their older albums. I don't judge an album by its commercial accessability but on how good the music is. And Nirvana and Soundgarden are both better than this s**t. The only good songs on this album are Once and Even Flow so just download those off the internet and forget this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Humanity's Greatest Creations","review":"This album is one of the greatest things that has ever been created by human beings. If my house was burning down, I would grab the kid, this album, the woman and the cat in that order, before I ran out. This particular version has 3 bonus tracks, sure, great. The original was perfect, but now you get perfection plus more Pearl Jam, which is a no-brainer. This album is so amazing, that the last time I listened to it, I cried tears of joy inspired by the art that is this masterpiece. What is a perfect death? Being surrounded by your loved ones as you slip into the void (or head into the light, whatever you believe) while listening to this album, just as the last few notes of \\"Release' are slowing fading from the stereo speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good debut","review":"Every once in a while, an alternative rock band comes along and proves to me that no, rock did NOT die along with John Lennon. Nirvana, R.E.M., Coldplay, U2 and the Red Hot Chili Peppers have already done so. Well, add Pearl Jam to the list!I had always loved the big hits from this album (Jeremy, Alive, Evenflow, Black), even though they got a LOT of airtime, almost too much. These four are definetly the best tunes, but there are several others I like, namely Once, Why Go and Garden. And hey, the hidden track at the end of Release is pretty cool. But this isn't perfect - Oceans and Porch could've been removed. Still, this is great alternative rock, which is as it turns out NOT an oxymoron. Eddie Veder's vocals are great, very emotional and a highlight of every song, even a couple weaker ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another piece of CRAP!!!","review":"I can't stand one moment of Pearl Jam. They are very lousy and Vedder sings even more worse. Grunge is the worst most pathetic genre in the world. Ten is horrible, stay away from this as well as albums by GNR, Nirvana, and Pink Floyd.

Avoid this and go with Foreigner 4 insted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I'll never understand why people like Pearl Jam.

You understood the lyrics and the ORIGINAL riffs courtesy of Mr.Gossard and the deep vocals of Mr.Vedder and who can forget the hauting bass of Jeff Ament. While Nevermind was basically Kurt Cobain screaming over pop tunes.No I'm saying Pearl Jam is or was the better of Grunge bands, because Nirvana made Grunge the biggest part of music. But this album is alot better than Nevermind. But Nirvana's In Utero supasses PJ's follow-up VS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landmark in rock and roll","review":"This is truly a monumental release. Remember the good old days of the early 90s when MTV actually played MUSIC and not the college frat boy reality TV crap they play now? The year was 1991 and glam metal was just starting to go out of style and the music scene was giving way to grunge. Pearl Jam simply dominated the scene with this album. Lots of hits on here including Even Flow,Alive,Why Go,Black,Jeremy you name it. Of course there are other great tracks ranging from the hard rocker Once to the calm Oceans. So buy this album and take yourself back to the early 90s when the music really used to mean something."},{"rating":"2","title":"....","review":"OKAYNIRVANA FANS...SHUT UPThis is a Pearl Jam Album... so stop talking about nirvana...If you want to recommend them... fine... but stop saying their much better... its opinion... they are both amazing bands in my opinion.... so why dont you stick to talking about the album and its songs rather than saying... \\"OMFG THIS ALBUM SUCKS, THEY RIPPED OFF NIRVANA....

The first: Uniqueness of sound. No past or future recording will ever sound quite like Ten, no matter how hard bands such as Creed may try. Much as they do on Mother Love Bone songs, the drums have a full and echo-ey feel to them. The bass and guitars blend in concert in an unrepeatable fashion, and sound almost as if they are being played live. Most people, upon hearing Eddie Vedder's voice, hear only its low range and supposedly \\"angry\\" sound. These people fail to realize that the singing on Ten is remarkably tight and clear. The songs are complex and do not resemble those of any other band. All these elements blend together to form a sound never heard before or since. Second factor: Beginning to end enjoyment. Master/slave brings you in and takes you home, without as dull spot along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"breath of fresh air","review":"Nothing is original in rock anymore!

That is open for debate. There's Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction, Skid Row's Slave To the Grind, Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power, Pantera's Far Beyond Driven, Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood, Guns N' Roses- Use Your Illusion I & II and Metallica's the Black Album. Pearl Jam's Ten was a #1 album and sold millions of records and produced #1 rock tracks in Jeremy, Even Flow, Black and Alive. Pearl Jam's ten is a classic album and one of the best albums of the 90s. Let's not forget Anthrax- Sound of white noise.Pearl Jam's Ten is an essential album- but there are better albums. Metallica's Black Album gets my vote for the ultimate album from the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"good packaging, but what about Dave Abbruzzese?","review":"I thought this was a pretty good set, however I think a few things are missing from the unplugged show though. My only real complaint about the set is the fact that on the dvd it only shows Eddie, Stone, Jeff and Mike on the dvd menu, what about Dave Abbruzzese? I kinda thought that was pretty rude, he was an awesome drummer and had a lot of input in the band.I noticed they also blanked him on the photos contained in rearview mirror (the best of) Anyway the remix cd was cool and it was awesome to see unplugged on dvd even if it has been cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's for the \\"Good James\\"","review":"First off, I would like to mention that the disgusting psychopath who pointed out that everyone who listens to Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Rage Against The Machine is Satanic and Anti-Christ is NOT Mormon.

Plain and simple, he should have stuck to his day job. You especially realize how bad he is when you compare him to a REAL lead singer like Robert Plant or Ozzy. He can't even hold a microphone to David Coverdale, who is not exactly one of rock's immortals.Once and Why Go are okay, but otherwise, hold your nose when you walk by this album in the store.Signing off,Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little a bit overhyped by PJ fans (Rubbish really)","review":"When I bought this album, I thought I was going to get a rip roaring rock album that rivalled Nirvana, AIC and Soundgarden as Seattle\`s best Grunge band.

This is not Pearl Jam's greatest hits, it's their record they put out in 1991. They have since put out very good records with very good tracks, including their latest effort. All this time and I'm not even talking about the record, ask yourself these 2 questions. 1.Do I like rock music? 2.Do I like alternate music?

The musicianship is absolutely atrocious: aside from a few solos, the guitarists sound like they can't play at all. The drumming is unbearably simple. David Grohl who used to drum in Nirvana can slaughter this drummer without trying. Eddie Vedder can barely sing, although it is nice that he has influenced much better vocalists such as Aaron Lewis (Staind) and Scoot Ward (Cold). With poor production, the music is boring to listen to. The lyrics seem to be most of the focus in praise for this, but I say nonsense unto you. Lyrics are profane and try too hard to be arty or thought-provoking.I will conclude by saying that if you wan't to hear anything average from Pearl Jam, try their \\"underground\\" followup to this.

Listening to Pearl Jam is like being hit over the head repeatedly with pieces of foam. 'Ten' is full of bluster and little substance. 'Oceans' is my personal favourite on the album, its atmospheric and works really well, but theres little else of note. 'Even Flow' isn't so good without that great video... Or 'Jeremy'... Once again, the masses worship an album that really doesnt deserve worship. If you're into real music, avoid this. As far as grunge is concerned, Soundgarden were a far superior band. Nirvana too.

Their income streams include millions of albums sold, thousands of sold out concerts, hundreds of self-released official live bootlegs and now a re-release of their highest selling album. Excellent money-making skills but probably not in line with their ideology as a band of the people. They got rid of their best drummer Dave Abruzzesse because he liked the rock star life too much. What a shame, he would have fit in perfectly with their plan now and they would have made better albums.The only reason to get this package is the MTV unplugged concert which should have been released years ago anyway.

I've always been in the fan club and I seen them perform at least 10 times. I've been proud when they succeeded and supportive when they went up against the man, but I can not follow them down this path. Eighteen years after the initial release there is no good reason to try and make these classic songs sound better. It's a weakness that all successful bands face but the very best avoid. As an artist I understand the urge but as a fan I'm let down and slightly offended. Please do not do this with the rest of your catalog. Look at your peers, this kinda thing always ends bad.

The Pearl Jam today is no longer Pearl Jam; it's a wannabe folk band that likes to collaborate with other artists. The Pearl Jam back in 91/92, however, were an excellent hard rock band which essentially opened the scene for 90s alternative rock (and alternative metal). What was so great about the album? Well, each track told a story. Not in a spoken-word way, in a \\"Van Morrison way\\" with guitar riffs and deft bass work in the background. Their live shows were pretty cool, too.(At this point, they're all pretty old, but they could always make a comeback!)

Along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" it helped launch the nationwide popularity of grunge music and spawned countless inferior imitators. \\"Ten\\" is a nearly perfect collection of songs. This is intellegent hard rock for those who would rather use their heads than bang them. The ace singles \\"Alive\\" and \\"Jeremy\\" are the highlights of the album, the latter song anticipates the Columbine massacre long before it happened. Songs like \\"Oceans,\\" \\"Black\\" and \\"Even Flow\\" are also examples of first rate songwriting, while the closing track \\"Release\\" builds to an atmospheric climax like the release of intercourse.Overall, \\"Ten\\" is a classic album and one of the best rock albums of the 1990s.

I love Nirvana as much as the next person, but it didn't end there. Pearl Jam is not Nirvana and they are still around. Pearl Jam is still going strong and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten is the \\"track star\\" of modern rock","review":"I have had this CD since its release in 1991, and it has been a cornerstone of my music collection ever since. Ten is one of a handful of CDs that got modern rock on its feet and running. (These albums include \\"BadMotorFinger\\" by Soundgarden, \\"Core\\" by the Stone Temple Pilots, \\"Nevermind\\" by Nirvana, and \\"Dirt\\" by Alice in Chains.) It helped lay the foundation for all the music that is now called \\"alternative\\", and it is still representative of the rock music scence. The dark atmosphere afforded by songs such as \\"Garden\\" or \\"Deep\\" presents the listener with a raw perspective on life. Don't buy this CD just to say \\"I own the first Pearl Jam album\\"; buy it to immerse yourself in the rough and artistic modern rock of the early nineties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then nevermind I would tend to think so","review":"ok whatever nirvana were huge blah blah blah nevermind rocks. Sure nevermind is great but this is better. Sure nirvana were inovaters but pearl jam brought the talent to grunge the way it is to me and I may get flamed for this nirvana brought the style pearl jam brought the music.

I listened to 'Alive' on headphones and the right channel drops out from :27-1:19...you can actually hear it come back in! What is with that? My original cd from 1991 didn't have that issue and I would think that the Quality Control folks at Sony would've caught something so blatant.This is one of the greatest debuts of all time.

True they havent been all that great since Neil Young started influencing (poisoning) thier sound. Forget about Alive, Jeremy, Evenflow and Black. You've all heard those countless times before.

Yeah, I have VS. and Vitology but they couldnt measure up to TEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give it 10 stars.","review":"This the best debut grunge album ever ( I bet alot of people didnt agree with that). But anyways this is an amazing album with alot of great songs. Black is on the top, black amazed me so did even flow and alive.Jeremy is an ok song but black was great. Mostof the other songs were good too why go is amazing and so is deep the others are alright porch kinda bored me tho.

Then i downloaded Oceans 'Unplugged' and i was hooked i bought ten and never looked back. This is seriousely one of the greatest albums i think i will ever listen to i dont have a favorite song because it changes everyday. there good songs in every spectrum of music. they dont just play the same kind of songs over and over. and adding to that every one of the band members are incredible muscianists. take it from me this album rocks"},{"rating":"2","title":"in one word brilliant!

You don't have to like alternative to listen to Pearl Jam, you just have to like good music. The emotion on Black is amazing and the messages on the other songs are great. Edd Vedder is a master. He didn't just jump on the bandwagon of grundge--he helped create it. I think Kurt was as great as the next guy, but without PJ grunge is nothing.

It has became legendary for it's popularity, and unfortunately, for it's great amount of rip-off artists. It's a very sad time for all grunge fans because there are so many imitators out there, which make me believe that grunge may be dieing. Just like Nirvana and Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam is no different.First, their name is terrible. Jam doesn't do anyone any good and is a measly food for measly people. I guess these guys are just all out of creativity. This brings me to my next point, these guys were obviously inspired by grunge masters Staind and have copied their sound to the very core. To sum it up, this is just terrible and you can't even understand what the vocalist is saying half the time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"terrible album!

Once is such a dumb song. That's all I need to say about that. Even Flow sounds like some idiot in his bedroom trying to be Hendrix with Mr. Garbage Mouth himself (that's right Eddie Cheddar!) throwing on his \\"timeless\\" mouthings about sucking (...)for crack in San Diego. Then you have Alive. Normally I'd like a song about a guy banging his mom, but sorry Eduardo! Not happening! Dumb, dumb, dumb. Why Go is another stupid song. Seriously. Then you have Black. My lord, what a crappy song. Could they try any harder to be INXS? I think not. Jeremy killed himself in class today! Awesome! Too bad he didn't kill Eduardo Veduardo instead! Now don't forget the other five songs. One, two, three, four, five against THEY ALL SUCK! BAD, BAD, BAD! THIS IS SUCH A CRAPPY ALBUM! IT MAKES NEVERMIND SEEM GOOD! DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting interpertation but could have been better","review":"I liked what they did with the remix on the original album, especially the slower songs like Garden and Black, but I think Jeremy as well as Breath and SOLAT were slowed down too much. 2,000 mile blues has a cool vibe to it-very Doors like. Should have left evil little goat off. I've always liked the live feel of Pearl Jam's music and think they should have stuck to that formula a bit more. The Porch remix had more energy to it. Overall, I'd say this is more for the hardcore fan but I would pick up a live concert over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book for any child","review":"I love this book and it should be in every child's book collection and savedfor their children.

When I got home and read it to my kids, it just didn't catch their interest. It is a novel idea to have the book done with photographs, but they are weak and seem to be taken from video. Sams is a noted photographer, so it is too bad the quality is lacking. The text is marginal at best and has no rhythm.

Not enchanting at all - would have been better if it had just been a picture book and the author left the reader along to think up a story. I guess I don't get into the talking animal movies and this is like that except in written format.

Bungee cord wrapped around the cable would work just as well or better as a hanger. Product needs redesign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the extra tracks","review":"The extra tracks on this version - with Barrett just accompanied by his guitar - show how the original was almost completely ruined by a completely awful production; horrible, weeny organ, weedy drum playing, pointless noodling guitar. In contrast, the sparse, haunting versions of 'Rats' and 'Dominoes' in the extra tracks section show how it should have been done in the first place; just Barrett alone, voice and guitar. Its a pity that the original producers (I think it was David Gilmour) didn't have the fore-sight to at least try this approach. To me, Barrett's songwriting contains elusive moments of brilliance, and is somewhat reminiscent of another great English singer/songwriter Nick Drake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its mediocre to his only Pink Floyd album.","review":"The first Pink Floyd album which was almost completely written by Syd is his best stuff, way better than this solo album. Although it is entertaining to listen too, all the songs sound the same with the exceptions of a few titles. Only recomended to the die hard Syd Barrett fans. But Pink Floyds first album, Piper at the Gates of Dawn is spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barrett","review":"The album cover gives a good indication of the music. Scratchy little insects like a child's drawings. Thanks to the producers the collection of songs hangs together but one has the feeling that Syd isn't really too bothered if the whole thing disintegrates. That's what makes him so special! Lyrics like no-one, (except maybe Beefhart), could pen set to unpredictable music and sung out of tune. Anyone can write a song about Dominoes but Syd did it. You can keep over-production and meaningful words sung by nice, predictable 'musicians'. I prefer my popstars cracked and off the rails. And the good news is he's still alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly confused...","review":"Let me first say that I am a die hard Floyd fan. I am grateful to Syd Barrett for one thing only...founding the band. I have every CD they made but, the cuts by Syd, well, I just don't understand why anyone would think he is good, let alone great. When I hear a song written by him, I can only feel bad for the man... he was obviously very troubled. The songs written about him are far better than the ones written by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemonade","review":"Though not as good or impressive as 'The Madcap Laughs', there's still NO WAY THIS ALBUM COULD BE BETTER! 'Baby Lemonade' is a classic, that perhaps even surpasses anything on the previous record, 'No Good Trying' and 'Dark Globe' excluded, and arguably any of Syd's work with Floyd, 'See Emily Play' excluded.'Wined and Dined' is a stunningly attractive and close-to-divine song, a little bit realted to 'Here I Go' from the previous record, but arguably better.'Love Song', 'Dominoes' and 'It Is Obvious' make up a strong foundation for the record, while 'Rats' and 'Maisie' are a stranger kind of beauty. 'Gigolo Aunt' shows off Syd's whimsical side, and the poppy 'Waving My Arms In The Air' is another essential highlight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shine On You Crazy Diamond","review":"Syd was a true genius,in his music as well in his painting. Nobody ever wrote songs like him, and nobody probably ever will.This album unfortunetly shows Syd going downhill in his life.Dont get me wrong! This is a great album, my personal favorites are Baby Lemomade and Love Song. But then when you look at songs like Wolf pack, and rats, you can tell things were not looking good for Syd.I sometimes listen to this album just for the bonus tracks to hear all the crazy stuff David Gilmour and Syd say. With Syd's reactions and slow speach you can tell hes not going too well.Im kind of angry that the song \\"Milky Way\\" wasnt put on this album, due to Davids demand. But whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for IR","review":"This type of dark red filter is generally used for increasing contrast and making black and white photos pop. However I use this with my camera modded for full spectrum, for near infra red pictures.The filter itself seems of good quality and construction.

Problem is we have pets and this vacuum is not up to the task. With all the pet hair we have, I have to vacuum the same spot about 5 times just to get most of the hair. And the mini rotating brush attachment stopped spinning after about 1 months use, even after constantly taking it apart and cleaning it. And like another reviewer said, I have to put it on the bare floor setting for it to even pick anything up. One last complaint is the hose attachment, it plugs into the side and to activate the hose suction it just needs to be pulled out. Problem is it is always falling out or will get bumped against something and fall out, causing vacuum to stop suction on floor. Not a very good design. I would not recommend this vacuum even if you don't have pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dyson Wannabe","review":"A 17-pound vacuum that does the trick!

Sucking power is horrible and it doesn't pick up hardly anything.Keep in mind I have been using this vacuum for a year now. I have two big dogs, a black lab and a shar pei, and they shed, although not a lot but they do. I also have two small kids.

The artwork is simple pen sketches, nothing dramatic, but good. I am buying this book for every kid on my team, and I believe they will enjoy reading it as much for fun as they will for instruction. It is truly a fun book to read for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries out too fast!","review":"It's truefor more than a day, here in the desert.

Most of the hits are here, but for me the heart and soul of The Byrds is on album cuts such as \\"Deportee\\", \\"Time Between\\", \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\" or \\"Renaissance Fair\\", none of which are included here. But if you need a brief collection from which to start listening to this extraordinary band, you could do a lot worse than this neat CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Greatest Hits Collection","review":"This is a good CD to get if you don't want to spend more money for the full Byrds Boxed Set. This CD gives a good cross-section of The Byrds hits across their career. I really liked the recording of \\"Jesus is Just Alright\\" and \\"From A Distance\\". A good CD to get if you enjoy listening to great rock from the 1960s."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather lackluster","review":"This one went into the CD recycle bin after three listens. Too formulaic.

My favorite is Fran-dance, with first Cannonball and then Coltrane improvising wonderfully on the simple melody. Coltrane's is just a lovely composition all by itself, the kind of thing I listen to repeatedly to try to memorize. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sober Modal Jazz","review":"Excelent album in the style of Kind Of Blue, with some things remarkable respect to the last one. First, John Coltrane didn't mess up the things with machine-gun like solos, second, the playing is more equilibrated (no one got any stellar role during all the album), third, it isn't so abstract like Kind Of Blue and fourth, Bill Evans was given a more preponderant place in the playing. I don't think there's out there some other album in the same line of this (except Kind Of Blue) even in the Miles Davis' Discography. Highly Recommended for those who look for concrete and definite Modal Jazz"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE PIECE OF CRAP","review":"Back in the day \\"Stella by starlight' was included in the original version of Milestones, it was my quest to find a great version of \\"Stella By Starlight\\" that lead me to this CD.

I kept searching for the same mood in different versions of this theme, but never found it. Some historians say Miles was influenced by Ahmad Jamal's treatment of silence and pause and this was one of Jamal's favorite tunes. The arrangement surpasses any concept Kaper or Jamal might have hinted. \\"Love for sale\\", as approached by Miles here is a class in modal improvisation, and, of course, enthusiasm. The rendering of \\"Straight, no chaser\\" is an all-time spirit lifter. I think this was Miles's best unit ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This heat dish is great at what it says it does. If it's really cold outside Presto feels like the sun is shining on you inside! After my dog chewed the cord on my first one, I tried to bear a winter without my heat dish. It was miserable so I'm really glad I bought another one. I like that I don't have to turn the heater on to heat up my whole house when I am in just one room. The whole house heater is also really loud but this is really quiet for the heat you get (it doesn't make any sound actually)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Current model not as good as previous ones","review":"I bought one of these a few days ago at Costco without paying attention to detail, assuming it would be just like the one I purchased several years ago (and which still works great!). The two big safety improvements may make the lawyers happy, but one is just silly (the nightlight), and the other renders the unit considerably less useful than my older one, in that the forward/back tilt is no longer adjustable, and the degree of back tilt is such that unless the unit is right at your feet (too close for me) it shoots the heat over my head.If the lack of tilt won't be an issue for you, then this is a good heater for its style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing","review":"Pro:1.

This heater was designed for exactly one specific purpose. The only thing on this heater that can be adjusted is the temperature setting and for the lower temps it doesn't do that very well. You cannot change the direction of the beam (up or down). This heater does not oscillate.

Well, you get what you pay for. Apparently, the reason it costs less to run, is that it can't heat anything anyway. I am literally sitting 3 feet in front of the dang thing and it is on HIGH. Can I even remotely feel the warmth? No.I have a basement with very little heat from the rest of the house and this thing is such a waste. Not to mention that if I turn it off but forget to unplug it, I think my room is on fire because I see this bright orange glow from the base light all the time. I wouldn't recommend this at all. It doesn't do the job unless you are standing directly in front of it (within a foot or so...and no, I'm not exaggerating.)The bottom line: I'm out the money I bought this with, out the energy wasted on trying to make this heater work, plus I'm still COLD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Personal Heater","review":"Presto HeatDish Plus Footlight - Parabolic Electric HeaterThis, I believe, is a perfect personal heater for one person or possibly two sitting close together.

I was dissatisfied with convection type portable heaters I used previously. I have high ceilings and most of the heat would end up on the ceiling while I was still cold.

It was a gift from my mother for Christmas for one of my first apartments. Being a poor college kid, this was the perfect solution. We could keep the heat down and still be comfortable. Now that I am a home owner, I still use my heat dish. My pets love the heat dish and as soon as I turn the thing on they all race for front row seating.*The only problem I have had with it is the light no longer works. It could be as simple as the bulb being burnt out, but since I never liked the light feature, I've never sought to replace (or fix) the light.I highly recommend for single person use.

When I did this I touched the plug prong, after it was disconnected, for just a second or less and it was so hot it burned my thumb.I then noticed that the thermostat housing was very warm, almost hot.

When I went in, the dish was still on. I thought it was my fault because I was drowsy. It has happened well over a dozen times, then when I re-turned it off it would shut off.

Works okay.","review":"I have had good results with this heater set on less than the medium power setting; otherwise on the higher setting it gets too hot and the buzzer alarm sounds which is really disturbing to hear.It is good for heating small spaces and it is directional where the heat is directed. I have used mine for a few years now. I go through lamp light bulbs; but other than that it has been trouble free. I do like that the power supply stops if the heater is knocked over. The alarm is a loud constant buzz sound. I ordered a cleaning tool from the Presto company which amazon might sell; it really makes it easy to keep the dish clean.If the dish is dusty the alarm will go off; so it one needs to keep it dusted to use it. I use it now about 1/4 of the power setting or it buzzes. It warms up a small space if left on for a long time. It is physically light and easy to pick up. It cools down fast if you turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"iDisappointed","review":"The concept of an iPod docking station and lamp is great, but the finished product was a total disappointment!There is absoultely nothing to like about this lamp--especially if you are an owner of an iPod Nano.The area that looks like docking station is really just a plastic compartment hoping to prop up your iPod. It's sized to fit bigger versions. The audio out from the iPod runs through an external wire and there is no charger.Oh, and if you like to listen to music...the speakers suck. The base is way too big, the speakers can detach but do not extend far from the base and the speaker don't stand on their own--they wobble.As for the lamp...the goose neck is too short and the actual light doesn't illumuniate enough area to be functional.I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Happens","review":"This was a good movie!

Both my kids loved it. There was a lot to see and do -- songs, funny things that happened if you clicked on the picture, and nice graphics. So when that storybook finally died, I ordered this one. We were so disappointed! The graphics are simplistic, the storyline choppy, there are no songs, and very few fun things happen when you click on different parts of the picture. When you click out of the story, you have to endure a slow listing of options before you can get back to where you were. This seems to have been put together quickly and cheaply and is not worth the money.

A gem I discovered on an editor's personal library in Hamburg, Germany. Tough times in the late 1980's provides the backdrop for a travel tale about the relatively unsheltered life of the characters who inhabit the \\"Storm Country\\" of America's midsection. The unmatched and random ferocity of the Midwestern tornado serves as metaphor and reality during this recession-afflicted, post-Vietnam era. Davies is simultaneously at home with poetic observers of the sweetness of nature's beauty and equally attuned to the raw humor and extravagance of Storm Country's deeply flawed and admirably virtuous characters alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should really use the Lee 4X6 or Cokin P grad NDs","review":"This filter is very hard to use because even with the depth of field preview button you struggle to see the gradation line. Also, you can't move the line up and down as the scene demands. I really recommend, and have personally gone to, the 4X6 rectangular graduated ND filters and the results are far superior. Hitech also makes an acceptable resin filter in both the 4X6 and Cokin P sizes (go for the 4X6 if you can). Singh Ray's are the absolute best as they are glass. A bit pricey though.

With that said, this is my opinion on this filter.Is great to produce better landscape pictures, you can get more detailed clouds and sky, you can improve this type of photography removing that washout effect that you get when there is a lot of light in the sky and not so much on the foreground.Easy to put on and remove from my lenses (tried a couple).Built quality is good.You see the difference with cheap filters quickly and easily (believe me, I've got a couple of cheaper filters in the past)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great B & W Filter, helpfull","review":"Another great B & W Filter, Threads on smoothly Easy to adjust for your desired effects,and very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"I purchased the 77mm graduated ND filter #501 and used it with my Canon 40D. Although this is advertised as a one stop filter, I did not achieve that result. It was neither darker, nor were colors in the sky or elsewhere noticeably improved at all. The graduation is so subtle, and the full effect is so far to the edge of the filter (this is not a hard edge in the center of the filter), that I could only notice the difference if I aligned the dark edge of the filter with the narrow side of my image and it was only 1/3 stop darker. Even when aligned with the corner, I did not see much more than 1/3 of a stop difference. I used a tripod, and set my camera to manual when testing this. Perhaps a full frame sensor camera would achieve closer to the advertised one stop, but I would recommend you purchase the two stop at least (#502) or go a store and try a few of these out before purchasing.This was a very disappointing purchase, which I immediately returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality filter - has worked fine for me.","review":"Have not had too much chance to use this.

For it's small footprint, the sound is nicer than one would expect to come out of a small radio. However, in no way is it as nice as a small set of decent bookshelf speakers. It just can't produce the accurate highs that come from a seperate tweeter, nor can it produce low end frequencies with any real presence (I am NOT referring to boomy bass here). Overall, the sound is a bit tinny. It would make a great clock radio if they improved the reception, and it was 1/4 the price.

Plus, they just don't make movies like this anymore - must have spent a fortune in costumes. And, since I don't believe they had available special effects, the cost of wrecking a train must have been extensive. Betty Hutton's acting, as always for her, was a bit over the top, but maybe not so much, since the character she played was highly immature and emotionally driven. It's good family entertainment, with a plot believable enough for all but sophisticated adults, and the cameo shots of various celebrities, such as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, e.g., seated in the circus audience added a curious interest. It's packed full of old stars, again making it worth the price, just to have some of them in one's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Me Out To The Circus","review":"Cecil de Mille's THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH won an Oscar for best picture in 1952.

The stunts are both funny and fantastic, the animals majestic, the circus comraderie feels genuine, and you can practicallly smell the cotton candy. Yes, there is a plot here too. A very young Charlton Heston is the circus manager who must ride herd on everyone. Betty Hutton and Cornel Wilde play trapeze artists; Jimmy Stewart is a clown with a past. There is a romantic triangle as well as good guys triumphing over the villains. Almost everyone-- but not quite-- winds up happy in the end.You should certainly see-- if you never have before-- this movie but don't take it too seriously.

The plot has tinges of a soap opera, with the woman caught between two men, the clown with the secret and several \\"shocking\\" moments, mixed with \\"impromptu\\" musical sequences to show off Betty Hutton's attempts at singing (she's not my favorite). The parts that don't have any acting, just ones that show circus doings are the most interesting and are a bit nostalgic, as not many circuses travel the country as they did back then. The film is too long, and there are too many audience reaction shots - however look for Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in a cameo.

Grace Metalious deserves to be exposed as a fraud. This biography was okay, but without knowlege of her plagiarism, any speculations on what motivated Metalious' behavior after Peyton Place hit the big time is rendered moot.

One big dissapointment is that the exercises are demonstrated by a model, not by Callan herself. Most of the photos are small and not all that easy to follow.

I relegated it to holding up a single aluminum ladder weighing in at 25 pounds just because taking it down and returning it would be a larger hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad execution","review":"I've been using a bike hoist from another company for years. When I purchased kayaks recently, I thought the best way to store them would be to hang them from a pulley system on the garage system. I purchased Bac Industries PH-01 storage pulley hoist. When I put straps around the kayak and attached the to the hooks, the metal that the hooks attached to twisted. When raising the kayaks (55 lbs for my wife's and 63 lbs for mine), the rope comes off the pulley. It comes off both the ceiling mount and the hanging hook. It happens so often, I started keeping my ladder in the garage instead of in the shed. The metal twisting is fine but the rope continuously jumping the pulley is unbearable. Caveat Emptor (buyer beware)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product.","review":"Do not buy this product. This product is rated for 100 pounds.

It pulls the kayak into the rafters, our of the way, and overhead. It was fairly easy to install. My only suggestion would be that they use SAE hardware. The metric bolts are long and you will need to use a drill/driver to torque them. They are larger than any of the standard sets that I have so I replaced them with SAE hardware. I didn't have the problem others described with the cords pulling unevenly. The cords are just like those found on a window shade or venetian blind. You need to pull both evenly but they are easily held together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but could have been better","review":"This figure looked great coming out of the packaging. But, because of its odd swivel-boot articulation(and me not realizing it), I snapped the leg off at the boot almost 3 minutes after opening.

The lightsaber also doesn't stay in Dooku's hand for squat. Because I don't play with these, I was able to super-glue the lightsaber into his hand.

His retellings are both informative and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greek Myths Made","review":"Spivey is a professor of Classics at Cambridge University, so I expected a little more from him than this. I can appreciate what he was trying to do, retelling the ancient myths for today's audience. But he didn't carry it off very well. Here's a clue: adding sex scenes does not make it modern.Also his understandings of the myths leave something to be desired. An example, he makes Andromeda a black woman. Why? For the sake of political correctness? Well it's true that she was a princess of Ethiopia. But the nation of Ethiopia back then was not where the modern country is. Back then, Ethiopia was a Phoenician kingdom (not a black African one) stretching from Syria down to the shores of the Red Sea.

Active cooling should be unnecessary in most cases. Even when seeking, the drive is quiet. Though not as silent as units from Fujitsu or Samsung, the drive is nonetheless quieter than recent units from Maxtor, themselves not exactly roaring disks.The 400BB's WinMark scores shatter previous records... they stand in a class of their own. IOMeter scores, though not staggering, represent improvement over previous models (and some of the competition, for that matter). When combined with quiet and cool operation, such performance makes WD's unit a viable alternative to the Quantum Fireball LM (fast but noisy) and, depending on final pricing, the Deskstar 75GXP (fast but relatively pricey).

There is zero character development for anyone in the movie.

As they threaten him and his family, he uses all of his detective skills to destroy these sinister forces. The movie is well paced and well acted, with the music score and visuals that greatly enhance the whole experience. The twist ending also makes you rethink many aspects of the movie, which comes as an added bonus.If you are looking for an entertaining horror flick and are not too squeamish about the cutting/dismembering scenes then give this movie a chance. It may not be the most outstanding horror film you'll ever see, but it's certainly worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Great Spooky Thriller","review":"I watch this movie practically every night. For two main reasons, first because Kiefer Sutherland is in it and second because I love thrills, chills and horror in movies. This movie was very creative when it comes to mirrors. I give it two thumbs up. The movie really opens up in a thrilling chilling scene where the prior security guard Kiefer will be replacing is running is the NYC subway station in Harlem from something creepy and winds up hiding in a locker room where he finds a small window which he hopes to escape through but to his \\"Oh F***!\\" surprise when he opens it he finds it is bricked up and he cannot get out. Being he has hit a dead end he turns around, apologizes to the mirrors and suffers the unthinkably brutal fate in store for him by the mirrors. And here is where the terrifying story opens! Watch on and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good premise but unmemorable in the end","review":"This film starts off with a good premise, but it just progressively falls apart, despite the valiant efforts of Kiefer Sutherland and other cast members.

Kiefer Sutherland does a great job as the hero of this ghostly venture. Also, great effects and a few jump scares add up to an entertaining feature. Amy Smart does a good turn as the younger sister. And the finale where Sutherland goes mano a mano with an antagonizing spirit is well executed.One matter of consternation is that the movie's visuals are really grainy.

The problem is that the concept, as presented, is too silly to be scary. It's a movie about demon-imprisoned mirrors, but characters taking it seriously just make you laugh.

No, it is not a mindblowing hollywood flick, but a reasonable horrifying tale, something that is meant to scare you from within. Many factors are responsible for the neat and brilliant flow of this film, firstly it's the wonderful cast performance that is enough to glue your eyes to the screen, Kiefer Sutherland simply steals the show and the rest of the cast delivers decent performances. Overall, a decent horror cinema that surely won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good the second time around","review":"This movie is not as good the second time around. Of course I never saw MIRRORS before, but everything in it is a warmed over cliche from a thousand predecessors. There are people vomiting, people pulling on rubber masks that are stretched over their faces, lots of movie blood, actors startled by sudden loud noises, and nary a scary scene in the mix. The other reviewers thought Kiefer Sutherland did a great job acting, but he must have acted only in the last ten minutes of the film, because he did not act any in the first part, and I turned the movie off before it got to the last ten minutes.Amazon has some great horror movies for sale. This is not one of them. If you want the crap scared out of you, try a really creepy classic like DRACULA, or PHANTASM, or if you REALLY want to scare yourself, PET SEMATARY. I am partial to CURSE OF THE DEMON, but not everyone agrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you'ved seen 24...you've seen Mirrors","review":"The effects are better in Mirrors than in 24, but the plot is the same. In 24 Sutherland tracks down imaginary terrorists to protect ignorant innocent people, and in Mirrors he hunts down the invisible evil spirit in mirrors that are attacking ignorant innocent people--including his family. He plays the same self-centered, psycho-dramatic character who knows he is doing the right thing despite his schizo-paranoid tendencies. He saves the day and the paranoid wacko becomes the hero of the day, yet again. The end. It is not that scary, and the suspense only picks up after approximately 50 minutes into the movie when a storyline actually develops. This is not a movie to see let alone buy, unless you are just as confused as Sutherland and his writers are as to what constitutes suspense and perplexed heroic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vengeful Ghost Deja Vu.

How often do you really see a person running through a subway where EVERY SINGLE DOOR IS LOCKED? I understand that they needed a reason to kill the first character to get the ball rolling. But come on. That was stretching it a bit far.2. Can we really believe that this Dark Force (that was so omniscient that it could turn water into a death trap) who wanted back this nun was not powerful enough to find her in a convent?It was OK to burn up a couple of hours, but this is not a movie that you will want to see time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE WORST EVER....BUT NOT GOOD AT ALL...","review":"The story sounded pretty cool: ghosts haunting people through mirrors by using their own reflections against them. And there's a few scenes that are fun to watch, like Amy Smart getting her mouth split open like a pumpkin. However, the entire story between Keifer Sutherland and his wife/children is way too cheesy to be in a \\"scary\\" movie. The section of the movie where the ghosts/demons/whatever are chasing after Keifer's family and traveling through water was ridiculous - I actually felt bad that the director thought any of these scenes were decent. And the story of the nun at the end....wow. I couldn't wait for the end to come, just so I could actually watch something good to get the sour taste of this movie out of my mouth. So, to sum it all up: maybe I take it back - maybe this IS the worst movie ever!

Of course no one believe's him about the mirrors till it's to late for the non-believers, all in all it was a satisfying movie and the way Amy Smart's dies was AWESOME! Didn't mean to spoil it for anyone but it was great!!

The story jumped all over the place and it went all wrong. It basically involved this guy, who was a cop, and was having family issues. He took a new job, and the mirrors were responsible somehow for problems that were going on. From there, our \\"main character\\" - goes all around to find answers and save his family. If the plot sounds confusing to follow, it isn't because my summary is random, it is because that is the way the movie is. Another problem was the music in the film - it totally sounded way too over the top. Another problem was the fact that the movie had like 3 plots happening at once, and not enough time was spent developing any of them.The DVD was made professional enough, and while the menu looked great with all the bonus features, it wasn't enough to save this mess of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irredeemably awful","review":"I actually really like horror but this is basically as unpleasant as it gets. It pulls many CGi shock effects (rather than the more classic camera moves). But fundamentally this is a dark film that strives to make the audience miserable - and succeeds. Even writing a review seems to justify this film, which I detest doing.Apart from the fact that the plot is flimsy, the characters are 1-dimensional, and there are no redeeming elements, the antigonist is fundamentally deranged in a way that leads to no conclusion nor resolution.Just avoid this one.

The top compartment would be good for a sandwich and bag of chips, but for those of you like me, who bring either things in tupperwares or lean cuisine microwave meals. This bag fits neither.....also it only velcroes close so it doesn't keep things very cold for long...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The lunch sack is nice. I can fit a sandwich container and a bag of chips in the top and a soda in the bottom. I haven't tried any other drink, such as a sports drink, but I don't think the bottom is big enough. It's very convenient. The only problem I have is that the bottom zipper on mine sometimes doesn't zip properly, so I have to sit and patiently work it shut.

That's pretty amazing to me, because she can demolish any other chewy item in less than five minutes normally (which defeats the purpose of the chew-to keep you dog busy!). When I give her one of these, I stick it inside a 10\\" sterilized bone, so a little sticks out both ends. She hates the sterilized bone, but with the bully stick inside, it's magic.

In fact, I like it more each time I hear it. These guys have great range, they rock very hard but also have a good amount of melody and soul.

In a struggling rock scene in South Africa this band did the amazing and broke into the american market(something every band in South Africa hasn't been able to manage).Most of these songs are from their first album Fragile. But the rest are very new and very good.I mean...How good do you have to be to play on the Ozzfest tour in your debut year in America?????Very good:)Do yourself a favour and buy this CD.

A little 'gothy' in sounds, but, it works with the raspy voice of Shaun Morgan, very Kurt Cobain-esque voice.The hits like \\"Fine Again\\", \\"Driven Under\\", and \\"Broken\\" are a little slower than some other tracks on the CD, but, very good nonetheless.

I went out to buy the cd, which I found very cool that there were different covers to choose from.

While the album is full with rockin', radio-friendly songs like that, it also has it's share of dark, heavy songs that sound similar to Drowning Pool or Staind. This is a VERY good album, one of the best ones of 2002. I promise that if you like Creed, Staind, Nickelback or Bush, you'll like this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Seether's album is quite different from many other rock cd's. The lyrics definately sound similar to many other bands but the band talent's is different. They have the transition to go from hardcore rock to soft rock. I don't like every song on here, but the majority of them are good. My favorite songs are \\"Fine Again\\", \\"Sympathic\\", \\"Needles\\", \\"Fade Away\\", \\"Pig\\", and \\"Broken\\".If you like a rock cd with a variety to it, this is a good selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know if my order was right or not","review":"I was sent Seether, Disclaimer II, a red labeled CD I do not know if it is the one my husband asked for or not...

I would just like to say that if you were inspired to get this CD by that song, don't. To me this album is nothing new and you might as well just buy a Creed CD, or even better, a Pearl Jam album. This album ended up sitting on my bookshelf and I only listened to it twice. Fine Again is the only song worth listening to. I got rid of the this album quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lamer Nirvana album","review":"So if Nirvana were still around today making lamer music like Pearl Sham is doing, you would have Seether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight to the point: Don't get this.","review":"You know what the first thing this band probably said when they decided to become musicians? \\"Lets just ripoff a bunch of talented musicians and hope that it covers-up how bad we suck\\". This band is obviously nothing more than a huge ripoff of Cold and Nirvana. In fact, I went around playing \\"Fine Again\\" to people I knew and asked them what band it sounded like. Each one of them said they sounded like Cold. The only real differance between the two bands is that Cold is actually talented and can actually be consistent in making good songs. Seether, on the other hand, are a generic grunge band with only three good songs. Wait...make that three average songs.Anyway, if you liked the single \\"Fine Again\\", then just buy a Cold album and don't waste your time with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut the crap, this band kicks a**...","review":"I hate it when a band gets a little bit famous, and all the sudden people hate them. Wtf is that? If you like a band, don't you WANT them to get some recognition? Of course, its an entirely different story if that band changes their style... N*E*Way, I've had this CD a long time, and after tons of listens I can say it's pretty much above average. Some of the songs (Driven Under, Fine Again, Broken w/o Amy Lee, Fade Away) totally kick a**, while others (69 tea, gasoline, pig) don't quite get to kickin. My favorite though would have to be F**k it, cuz the screaming kicks a**.Highly Advised for fans of: Trapt, Smile Empty Soul, Three Days Grace, Linkin Park ect..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't realize I already had it...","review":"I didn't realize it until I received it, but all the songs on Disclaimer 1 are already on Disclaimer 2.

Seether tries to sound too much like Nirvana. I am the type of person who likes to feel the music...but Seether just doesn't seem to put much into thier music and it shows. Two thumbs down. Don't by. Go buy Breaking Benjamin \\"Saturate\\", Project 86 \\"Truthless Heros\\", Flaw \\"Through The Eyes\\", or Sevendust \\"Animosity\\" if you want some talent and feeling in your music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice edition to any collection","review":"A new band to the scene, this cd is a nice edition to anyone's alternative rock collection. They seem a lot like Three Doors Down and maybe a touch of The Union Underground. The hit \\"fine Again\\" is a great anger, aggression, and yet uplifting at the same time. Seether also put on a great performance at Ozzfest this year and will hopefully be back soon with more hardcore rock.x"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Release of 2002","review":"Every so often a band will come along that has a good CD the whole way through. Yeah, yeah, you'll hear people say that about all their CD's almost all of the time, when the truth is that they skip three or four tracks during the duration of the CD. Seether's Disclaimer is amazing the entire way through, and has not left my CD player since I purchased it. Whether you are in the mood for a chilling ballad (Broken) or an angry neo-grunge song ([FXXK] It), this CD's musical versatility is unmatched. All songs are rock, but everyone has a different tone and vibe for a different mood or feeling. It's a great CD to listen to...anytime, and no matter how many times you listen, it will not grow old.So, for the best release of 2002, turn to a band that will get, as it happens with most bands with amazing talent, almost no recognition. You've heard \\"Fine Again\\" on the radio...how about you hear the rest of your CD. It's an incredible release, and you won't be sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good debut","review":"This debut album by Seether produced very good radio succes and also contained many hidden gems on the CD. Fine Again and Driven Under were very radio hits while the CD also contains other great songs like Needles and F*ck It. Some of the other stand out tracks to me are Pride, Pig, and Broken. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes rock music that is both angry and melodic at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"babes","review":"Excellent movie for what it is.

OWENS does provide nice vocals to his solo yet does nothing new to make the Stevie Wonder classic shine. JACKIE PERKINS attempts to tackle a DEBORAH COX song and ends up sounding like a discount version of PEBBLES. The sentimental favorite, LASHELL GRIFFIN, does perform a nice mature version of a HOUSTON ballad but the musical arrangement is weak and at best a standard KARAOKE BACK TRACK for the song.

When I opened this filter and held it in my hands I knew immediately that I had made a great investment and had received a precision piece of equipment.

The impact shattered this filter and jammed the ring on the lens but after using a pair of pliers to break the rest of the glass out of the filter ring, then lens still worked good as new.It hurt to lose this filter and rip it apart with a pair of pliers, however it probably saved the lens from sure destruction.

The plot and setting in the book were very good, we knew were they were, and in the movie, we just saw places, not names, well, only like Dairy Queen and like that. I actually imagined the setting and characters a little bit different. For example, the church I imagined it like in a hill, and taller. I was kind of disappointed with the movie. The mayor themes in the book were descriptive and they explained everything that was happening at that moment. The book is much better than the movie.

Even though the extra footage is great and some was definately needed in the original, I would still recommend getting the original version.The music often doesn't fit with what is going on in the movie and ruins the feel as to what is happening. More times than I could count there was music with words being played at the same time that dialogue was happening and it was very difficult to hear the dialogue and the music drowned out the scenes.

I enjoyed watching the new scenes, and the features with the cast was fun to view. However, the only thing I really didn't like was the new music score that was added. I think it detracted from the movie in many ways. I didn't like BLUE MOON playing when Johnny was talking to Ponyboy, for example, about having no place in the world and wanting to kill himself. I think the music pulled us away from the emotion and power of the scene, almost making it comical when that was so poignent to the character and his actions later.

It's truer to the book and gives viewers a better sense of the Greasers' personalities.In addition to the opening, THE COMPLETE NOVEL DVD adds in other previously-unseen scenes and provides a new soundtrack, including Stevie Wonder's \\"Stay Gold\\" during the opening credits.Don't get me wrong -- this is a good film and worth buying.

All of the extras are top-notch. The commentary tracks on disk one (the movie) are fine. Some of the re-inserted deleted scenes are a nice addition, too. But you know what? All of that is overshadowed by the new soundtrack, which completely devistates the movie.You want a lesson in how important music is to a movie, play this cut side-by-side with the original.It is terrible what Coppola's done to the score. He turned what used to be a dark, moody film into a light-hearted romp full of loud, boring surfer music and inappropriately-placed Elvis tunes. The only reason I can see for doing this is if he wanted to create a \\"kiddie cut\\" that isn't scary for children. The problem with that is that I saw \\"The Outsiders\\" as a child and it was powerful. It was cool, sad, beautiful and really spoke to my teenie kid mind about classism and justice.Now it looks like a \\"Simpsons\\" parody of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The Outsiders special edition is what a special edition should be about. It's packed full of extras and previously deleted scenes.

The scene where Pony is talking to Cherry up on the hill with the \\"future greasers\\" playing in the background at sunset was so great with the original score. Now it is junk.

The plot and the setting of the book were really good represented in the movie and it really seemed to be a small town and not the big city. When I read the book, I thought of Ponyboy and Soda more handsome and no so grown ups, and I also thought that Ponyboy was a more good person and not so mean and cursy. I also imagined Dallas meaner and stronger. It discussed the main idea of the book really well but the bad thing of the movie is that it jumped like 5 chapters of the book at the beginning. I really prefer the book because the movie skipped some important parts of the book, and also because the book has more family background and personalities of the character than the movie shows. I got more interested in the book because it's so descriptive and when I saw the movie, I got bored and didn't pay to much attention to it.

And the ending where Soda Pop ran away just to give a lectue to Darryl and Pony is just sooo out of character! Seeing the movie in its uncut version (and its HORRIBLE SCORE!!!) simply gives a valid reason why they were cut to begin with AND gave me the impression that Pony is some sort of a girl! There were simply waaaaaaay tooooooo much crying by the greasers! Even Two-Bit cried????? C'mon... I paid big bucks to archive one of the best movies from Coppola and what did I get??? Absolute LET DOWN!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good video crappy music","review":"I would have given this new release a 7 out of 5 if it hadn't been for the very unfitting music. Places where I wanted to have my heartstings plucked by a sad melody, Elvis was swaying his hips. Dallas needed to die to lonely ballad, not some \\"shake, rattle and roll.\\"Great extras!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coppola, why oh why?","review":"I must agree with the music criticism- I remember this film for having a somewhat melodramatic feel - due to the cinematography but mostly thanks to the music. Coppola has gone and screwed up a good deal of this film up by messing with the soundtrack. There however, are portions that feel more authentic with the new tunes.Still ...instead of 'adjusting' his old films, how about trying to make a new one some time soon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT MOVIE RUINED!!!!!!!!","review":"Please watch the original if you have never seeen this film. The added footage is good, but the new soundtrack / score destroys a classic. Elvis' Sun Sessions (1954) are great on their own but here along with the other new tracks they are distrscting, sometimes plain silly, innapropriate (story takes place mid-sixties), and at times they completely drown out the dialog altogether. I think FFC either had nothing to do with it or has lost his mind. I look forward to him scoring the Jonas Brothers over Apacalypse Now. Awful!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good movie!","review":"I really like this movie, butI am more of a \\"soc\\" (preppys in my school) thana greaser (Scum-bag, in my school) so it was sort ofhard to relate to, but I read thebook and now I have a greater understandingof what it is like on the \\"other\\" side. And thisguy, Conner is EXACTLY like ponyboy it was ALMOSTscary!!! well g2g! LUv ya!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A ok movie but it is boring.","review":"This movie is boring well to me anyway. It dosent have anything fresh in it it is just old and not ariginle plus the acting from all these grate actors we now well they did not do a vary good acting job. And I understand it was one of there first movies but still I have seen better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Is Much Better","review":"I read SE Hinton's beautifully written novel in English class as an assignment. Through the book, I felt as though I was with the characters or apart of them and I almost cried with the heartbreaking ending. Not so with the movie. I was appalled at the horrible acting and the movie missing important scenes such as when Ponyboy (played by C. Thomas Howell) gets beaten up the Socs, which, in my opinion, starts off the whole book. This movie dives right in to the movie scene, and you're left wondering \\"Who the heck are these people?\\" when they're presented to you. It took me almost 20 minutes to figure out who Ponyboy, Johnny (played by Ralph Macchio), and Dally (played by Matt Dillon) where because there is no introduction like there is the movie. The acting had no feel to it and it made me cringe to think that most of the actors are famous now-a-days who can act *much* better than this. Don't bother watching the movie, just read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question Actually","review":"I was wondering if anyone knew if this particular version was the one with the court scene and the scene where Soda runs off. My copy doesn't have that and thats one of my favorite scenes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT PICK!","review":"The Outsiders truly was a great movie! The thing is though, a lot of things in the movie aren't really explained, so you have to read the book first. Also, a huge chunk of the novel was left out; the part in the end. I think that the actor that played Ponyboy was really good! I do think that Soda should've been a larger character. They cut out nearly everything with him in it. Even the part at the end. But it was a great follow-up to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic example of movie makers ****ing up original classics","review":"DON'T BUY THIS!! If you love the ORIGINAL version of this film steer clear of this one. FFC completely ruined this classic film by adding the worst possible background music at the worst possible times.I had not seen this movie in a long time before I bought this edition. I don't remember there being as much music in the original film as there is in this version. FFC turned it from a dramatic masterpiece to a piece of fluff that sells out to the \\"High School Musical\\" generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets do it for Johnny man,Lets do it for JOHNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Excellent story,excellent movie.

This situation certainly does not encourage me to shop on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"This was exactly what I was looking for! It shipped really fast and made it in time for my kids to watch it after we finished the book. Language was a lot worse than I expected being PG but overall a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"This was exactly what I was expecting and more! I love The Outsiders novel and movie! This special edition came with two discs, one with the movie and one with nothing but special features that gives a lot of interesting information about the movie. The only thing that I was not very satisfied with this movie was the music. At some points, the music should have been a little more sentimental, but instead they played 60s rock and roll music that I did not like. But, this does not interfere with the actual plot and movie. Besides, that has to do with the makers of the movie, not amazon and that great special edition. Not to mention, this special edition comes at a great price. I still love this movie and buying the special edition of The Outsiders was the greatest buy I have ever made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect!","review":"My daughter is a HUGE Outsiders finatic, so when I saw this special edition move of the Outsiders on DVD I decided to buy it for her. She went crazy when we got it in the mail...it was in perfect condition, just like new! DVD didn't skip at all and was in great packaging condition. This was well worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I fell in love with the book The Outsiders, and have read it over and over, but I felt that this movie barely gave viewers a sense of the plot, let alone the relationships between characters. The story was fractured, and, had I not already known all of the characters' names and roles, I would have been unable to keep track of them. The sense of tragedy at the end was lost on my family, who had not read the book. I highly recommend the book to anyone, but I found the movie to be a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Outsiders","review":"At the urging of my 16 year old neighbor girl, I read the book before I watched the movie with her. The movie followed the story in the book very well. It was very well filmed and cast. We are from a rural, quiet area and it gave us both insight into the city life for young people. I couldn't put the book down and we both were ingrossed with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic remake","review":"An excellent movie. The additional scenes are brilliant. I felt that the original movie showed Steve as more of a main character than Sodapop which was not how it was in the book. Don't know about the updated score though."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME PEOPLE MISS THE POINT ENTIRELY","review":"Wow, what a scathing review I just read of this terrific movie! Although I will agree that \\"The Outsiders\\" is sometimes sappy, it is overall an excellent movie which stands on its own with or without S.E. Hinton's novel. Yes, the Stevie Wonder song does make it a little too Lifetime-y, but other than that, it's pretty darn perfect as far as film adaptations go. Coppola is a masterful director, and this film is no exception. The cinematography is glorious. Look at how the night scenes are filmed; the lighting is fantastic! The use of the song \\"Gloria\\" is another one of Coppola's techniques that make the movie work. Call it Lifetime for guys, call it sappy, but you can't call it crap because you can't appreciate it. The cast, although a who's who of teen actors from that time, have by and large gone on to bigger and better things since this movie was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This special edition is the worst movie I've ever seen. You see, I love the Outsiders. it is a great story, filled with great characters. I've wanted the movie for a long time. Than i finally got the special edition one. Really, the worst part about this edition is the music. it is horrible! it just ruins the movie. For instance, in the scenes were Dally dies and Jhonny kills the scos, their playing rock and roll music! it totally ruined the moment. And the music is constanly playing, so it's hard to concintrate on the movie. And, the added scenes in the movie are totally unnessary. if you are an Outsider fan, whatever you do, DON'T GET THIS SPECIAL EDITION MOVIE! Just stick with the origanal. It's much better, and presents the story in a much more memerable way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Travesty","review":"I don't know if you could find a bigger fan of the original version of this film than me. I watched it almost every day growing up and can still repeat every line as I watch it today. I was so excited to see it on DVD but the movie was 100% spoiled by the new soundtrack. I am STUNNED at how many reviewers have said it is an improvement and how Coppola could have done this and thought it was good. The new music completely changes the tone of the entire film and removes all of the tension, drama and tragedy that are at the center of this movie. To replace the emotional soundtrack at key moments like the murder of the Soc, the rumble and Dally's run from the law with chipper surfer tunes is so confusing and jarring that I am no longer able to enjoy the film. This is a travesty and should never have been messed with - where can I find a VHS copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great movie if u are reading this in shcool great also but make sure you know the differences between the book and the movie and their are differences"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies i've ever seen","review":"this was seriously one of the best movies that i've ever seen. I am a huge fan of the book, and when i watched the movie i loved the way the didnt alter the lines at all. The acting was so good i felt like c. thomas howell was really ponyboy and i was experiancing the life of a \\"greaser\\". I honestly dont think the acting could have gotten better, or that the director could have picked a better cast. This deserves its 5 star rating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing movie","review":"This is an awesome movie. I've watched it 6 times in the past 3 days. Does that give you an idea? This movie is great for a few reasons.1) The cast. Every actor suits their role and the movie is well-acted. 2) It's believable. 3) It's very moving. 4) The special effects and makeup is all really well done.I really liked this movie. There are a few intense scenes, such as the drowning scene, the fire scene, and the rumble scene. But it is well worth seeing it. They did leave some stuff from the book out, but it's still a fabulous movie that I recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleck!","review":"Oh my gosh! this was really bad.

But when you combine it with the storyline of \\"The Outsiders\\" - one of the finest coming-of-age and class tensions novels ever written, and by a 16 year old at that - you get an unforgettable movie. See it if only for young Tom Cruise and Matt Dillon (who are super in their roles as tough Steve and hoodlum Dally). If you like movies like \\"West Side Story\\" and have read S.E. Hinton, this is the movie for you. But please read the book first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cast of Characters Yet!","review":"Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillion, Emilio Estvez, these are just a few of the MANY wonderful actors in this movie. It's about a family of three sons whose parents die and leave the oldest son to make sure his brother's are kept out of the \\"welfare system\\". Their friends are a group of boys who experience everything from robbery, murder and beyond. They are truly outsiders who find trouble when they aren't even looking. The younger brother becomes a witness when Matt Dillion kills a townie (Leif Garret) when he brings his friends along to taunt the \\"outsider\\" and his friends. This is a sad story of how being rejected can change the outcome of lives for ever.

I am in Secondary 2, and one of the books that we had to read was this one. It deals with real life issues, and the actors in the film portrayed the characters beautifully. Even if this is a 1983 movie, it is still an excellent film. I recommend the book and the film for everybody to enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Reviews- 8a class #20","review":"The actors from the movie did play their part right, but I have to add they didn't show that much emotion as the characters in the book. I also missed Pony's voice over in the movie, what happened with all his thoughts? The only character that was really the same as the book was Johnny. The setting was great I really felt that it was just as the book. There was one tiny little problem. In the book the Greasers are east, and Socs are west. In the movie Greasers are south and Socs are north! That made it confusing if you had already read the book. Even though of that mistake it was just as I imagined. It didn't discuss the themes in the book correctly. It missed so much stuff. Like when Ponyboy was sick and everything. The message of the book didn't get through the movie. I think the book was so much better! The book is awesome I seriously recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is what you get when you mix Grease and Road House","review":"this movie is cool. it has an all-star cast in it. what more could you want? most of the stars in this movie have had other roles before or after this movie.

I loved the book, so this crapfest was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music shoulda \\"Stayed Gold\\"","review":"Like many other fans of \\"The Outsiders\\", I too was unimpressed by the music in some of the scenes of the movie. The surfer music played during the rumble scene and Dally's death scene were totally inappropriate. It took away the drama and seriousness of the story. Other than that, I must say I was glad to see a lot of the deleted scenes added into the movie. I was looking forward to seeing Sodapop's girlfriend, Sandy, added back in the movie, but those scenes were still unadded. (If you go to the movie's official website, she discusses her small role being cut.) Anyway, it was great seeing most of the cast now watching the film and reminiscing on their experiences. I've loved this movie since I was 6 years old and I'm now almost 23. It was such a treat to see the film the way it should have been originally released 22 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Personaly, i thought this movie was great.

Instead, he directs this unconvincing trash that doesn't live CLOSE to the 1967 book. I am shocked and stunned, really I am.The movie is a lot like the book in events and word phrases. But the book has a special something that created more attention. I really had great expectations for this movie. Boy, was I disappointed! Trust my advice, you would not like this movie. If you have to read it for school and did not finish reading it and the test is tomorrow, then I would suggest the movie. I really belive that the idiots who gave the movie four and five stars really did not pay attention to the book.

Subject indexes make it a little easier to find just the market you are looking for, although I still think the book could have benefited from some further (and perhaps different) organization.

The book is centered on a man who has lost the love of his life and is despised by his fellow citizens due to his unwillingness to sell his land for a new Stadium.With the exception of some clever names for the main characters and a bizarre meeting with a football hero, the promised laughs were never delivered.

I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but the Cold-Eeze cold remedy Tropical Orange flavor lozenges start out good but after a minute or two start causing my mouth to dry up and I start getting this horrible metalic taste and tingling sensation on the back of my tongue and throat. It is a horrible flavor after that. I try to endure it but spit them out instead. I would much rather have the cold or sickness than take these ever again. Even after the lozenge is disolved, I cannot taste food for 30 min after and have to drink something fizzy to regain taste and to make the slight tingling numbness feeling to go away.

I wish I would have spent the extra $1 because Cold-ezee was the biggest waste of $5 I have spent in a long time. I started taking them within the first 24 hours after my cold symptoms appeared. The only thing that it did was help my cough. However, it always made my mouth feel very dry, which most other cough drops do not do.

Once my colds get started I am headed for two weeks at least, longer if it gets into my lungs. About a year ago I started to get a sore throat and bought a box right away on impulse. I was VERY surprised that they actually worked. No other remedy has worked for me before. It seems to stop the progress of the cold from my throat into my sinuses. This is consistent with the theory that it stops the virus from propagating, allowing the body time to get the upper hand in fighting the infection. This would also explain why it is essential to start right away in the early stages of the cold.

Hmmmmm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Mount but the stick-on mounting is marginal","review":"The part of this bracket that holds the GPS is terrific. But the stick-on base is a joke. If you have treated your mounting surface previously with any kind of cleaner, polish, or wax, you will find it nearly impossible to mount this bracket. They supply cleaner and instructions, and on brand new surfaces I suspect it works better. But beware, this thing will let your nice GPS go flying just when you can't afford it to...Buy the garmin Marine Mount for your GPSMap 76, drill a couple holes and hard-mount the unit - you won't regret it. Alternatively, look at the various RAM mounts made for the GPSMap 76 series - they too have hard mount solutions that will secure your unit as it deserves to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usability depends a lot on the car","review":"The other three reviewers must be driving 1960's trucks or something. On a sedan you'll be *very* hard pressed to find a proper surface to attach this to.Mind you, it only has two degrees of freedom, and in the vertical one it only rotates 180 degrees or so. This is a major problem. Unless you have a vertical windshield, forget about attaching your gps to it. You'd only be able to rotate the gps screen downwards, so you won't be able to read it!The only alternative is to attach it to a horizontal surface. Good luck finding one. Garmin does a good job explaining what NOT to attach it to (air bags etc.), but there's hardly anything suitable left.Also, the sticky base needs a perfectly flat surface to attach to. Hard to find one in a modern car. In my Protege I attached it next to the base of stick. This puts my gps pretty much out of sight. I need look down whenever I get a beep from my 76 to read what turn I need to do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Automotive Mount for Garmin GPS 72 and GPS 76","review":"This product works great! hold GPS firmly and securely to the dashboard, even traveling off road!

Wodehouse","review":"The highest compliment I can pay this book is that it is the only American work that truly bears comparison to the great P.G. Wodehouse. Dobie, though far from a confirmed bachelor, captures some of the inspired daftness of Bertie Wooster's narration of his own impossible adventures.I loved this book when I was a teenager forty years ago, and loved it just as much when I reread it last year.

You won't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book!","review":"I have read all of Shulman's books or nearly all and this one seems to have the most sophisticated stories.

I might have been twelve or so when first I stumbled across The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. The television series had not yet appeared, and the only thing I knew about Shulman was that the nuns who taught me did not approve.It was a more innocent time, to be sure. I'm not at all confident that his brand of raucous, sexy humour would raise more than a disdainful snicker from today's world-weary adolescents. And that's a shame. Shulman was the first writer, in my limited experience, to write about sex as though it was funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank goodness!

A few days later, I received another FS1403. I returned that and customer service reordered the FS1404 again (for the same price special). This time, the order stayed my pending order list for a few days, then disappeared without any notice or warning. There was no trace of the order and no ladder ever arrived. To top it off, the orders for the FS1404 on my past order listings, changed to indicate that I ordered the FS1403.

After approximately 10 months, the maker no longer freezes the ingredients. The most likely cause is a leak in the refrigerant line. My suspicion is that KitchenAid, upon return for refurbishment, didn't fix the leak but rather simply recharged the R134A. They offer only a six month warranty on refurbished units and the recharge would in all likelihood last beyond that (as it did). Again, this is my suspicion. I've heard others having many problems with KitchenAid's Pro Line toasters. I cannot recommend KitchenAid Pro Line series of products. They've discontinued various products in this series, possibly due to quality control issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"well-written, sanitized account","review":"Well written but often \\"half-way\\" or sanitized history.For example, describes some of the wackier CIA plots to kill Castro in the Bay of Pigs era, such as explosives in cigar, but fails to mention the more ominous, documented proposals (fortunately vetoed by JFK) that the CIA stage terrorist acts on American soil and make it look like the work of Castro.Unavoidable facts such as the CIA's role in destabilizing govts around the world seem to receive very brief and reluctant mention. No mention of the well-documented LSD mind control experiments and some of the darker activities of the CIA.Although well-written, I give it only 2 stars because the book title promises \\"The Inside Story\\" and delivers less than halfway.This book may be suitable as a \\"feel good\\" history for people who aren't comfortable with the complete or unvarnished truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste and prevention.","review":"I have been using Cold-eeze products for years and they really do lessen the length and severity of colds if used as directed.

They accidently shipped me chocolate flavor instead of the unflavored. I called Amazon CS and they told me to call Drugstore.com. I got some incredibly rude person who kept me on hold for 20 minutes while she \\"checked\\" something. She came back and said that they no longer carry the unflavored kind. She pressured me to keep the chocolate ones and it took a lot of convincing before they finally agreed to give me a refund.

I wound up shipping it back to Amazon after a frustrating two months. HTC should be embarressed. They must not even stock this item because everytime I called they kept telling me they were waiting for parts.

I boat mostly on the bays of Long Island so chop and wakes are a fact of life. This mount could not stand up to those conditions, stripping out the angle adjustment twice. The adjusting area is insufficient for the size and weight of the Garmin 76 GPS.

The fillets are fleshy, not dried up in salt like most of the anchovies I have eaten before. The consistency of the meat is preserved very well. While most anchovies are salty with the characteristic, wonderful ... stink, these anchovies are also flavorful in addition to being only stinky. I am not sure how this is done - perhaps by shortening the time the fish is cured in salt?The price is unjustifiably high though - one can get 2 lbs of Moroccan anchovies for the same price.Nevertheless, these are (from far) the best anchovies I tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"These best anchovies ever!!!

The disk then contains a few lesser animated shorts, but the worst is several very boring and tedious discussions with real life kids about their dreams, sleeping etc. I found the blind child interview especially to be inappropriately DEPRESSING and not fitting for what I thought was a kids animated DVD.

It's quickly become one of her favorites and she wants to watch it regularly. One concern for me is the suggestion of monsters and nightmares...if a kid doesn't already have them this video could suggest that they do. We particularly like the Brahms Lullaby segment as that was already my daughter's favorite lullaby. And I confess, I get the biggest hoot out of the adorable New Yorker children's interviews. They do crack me up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 1/2 yr old quotes it!","review":"We rented this from the library originally b/c my daughter LOVES the book. Turns out the movie exceeded our expectations and she would watch it five times a day if I allowed that much television:) There are three books read by professional actors/actresses, three songs sung by well known artists, and children between the ages of 4 and 9 (I'd guess) telling about dreams and sleep. It's very cute and appeals to little people! Purchasing this was one of my favorite things to do for my little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful","review":"My daughter's very favorite book brought to life beautifully by both Susan Sarandon's reading & the later reading/discussion of the children.

Tar Beach and Goodnight Moon kept to the original story. I was disappointed while watching There's a Nightmare in My Closet, that the original story had been changed. I am a school librarian and have the read this story numerous times and was saying the story with the movie. Instead of the little boy having a cork gun they changed it to a toy sword. Something minor, but as a mom and librarian, I wish it would have kept true to the original classic book. I could've explained to my son that you don't play with guns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodnight Moon - VHS","review":"We were highly disappointed in what had been recommended as a top notch children's film. The expected quality (story content, choppy presentation, sound track, color and universal appeal) simply was not there.

We have chosen to discard rather than forward to our grandkids as a purchased gift. Submitted by a disappointed set of great grand parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Terrible! I bought this for my 6 month old. First of all it came already opened, so i figured I would check it out. Absolutely awful, don't waste your money. I was extremely disappointed with this, as I grew up on this book, and figured I would get this for my son to share with him. Don't bother!If you are going to spring for a DVD for your little one that you want to hold their attention, go and buy the Gigglebellies (vol 1 and 2). I ended up sending this back because I received it opened. Amazon was quick in processing a refund, but I do not recommend, you will be highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"My son received this as a birthday gift. I never played it as a child, and am not familiar with the original. But there are a couple of major things wrong with this toy. My main gripe is that - once it's installed - it will not fit back in the original box. That's a recipe for losing the 5 beanbags it comes with, and makes clean-up difficult. I'm tempted to just toss this thing across the garage, into the trashcan, but I'll probably end up donating it to my child's preschool to avoid putting another giant piece of plastic crap into the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this toy. This version of Toss Across is just not the same as the one I enjoyed as a kid. The game and beanbags are smaller and it's geared more toward playing on a table rather than on the floor. The worst part for us is that once put together, it is too big to fit back in the box. It might be able to be taken apart and then put back in but that would be a huge hassle. This makes it more difficult to store neatly and guarantees some lost beanbags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"Definitely cheaped-out, not the same substantial wood(?) game that I played in the 70s. My 8-year-old had to put it together herself, complete with sticking on the x's and o's. I think the original had the x/o carved right into the square. Anyway, it works alright, hence the two stars instead of one, but you have to be accurate and throw high/hard to keep the bean bag from just sitting on top of the square and not turning it.Wouldn't bother, even for the memories..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap version of the original game.","review":"I remember having lots of fun playing this game as a kid and bought it for my own family to play. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and found a cheap knock-off of the original, sturdy game. The bean bags are tiny and have little weight to them, and the games overall size is smaller too. You have to put the whole game together, including the decals for the X's and O's. That would be fine, if the plastic was at least heavy duty instead of the cheap, bendable plastic that makes up the game. There is nothing about this game that says \\"quality\\" and there is no way it will last with even a moderate amount of playing. Might be good for a toddler, but that is about it.I usually do not write reviews, but this product disgusted me so much that I had to.If you owned or played the original game, I think you would have to agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic Game for Holidays","review":"I remember this game being larger when I was a kid.

It was easy to set up and we had a blast taking turns seeing who could get 3 across first. We set it up in a hallway for playing so we could make it more challening with a farther distance to throw.

Sometimes we have \\"hard top only\\" and kids can't go into the field or on the equipment, so having a game like this is great. It's light weight and easy to carry. My only criticism is that sometimes the X/Oparts come lose and need to be snapped back into place. It's more fun than paper and pencil tic-tac-toe because the beanbags can change an \\"x\\" to an \\"o\\" in one easy toss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to assemble because Mattel included wrong pieces","review":"I remembered this game from my own childhood and knew my son would love it. He was so excited when he saw it, then terribly disappointed when we could not assemble it. Mattel had included 3 exterior \\"bar pieces\\" and only one interior \\"bar\\" piece which made assembly impossible. When we contacted Mattel, we were informed that no replacement pieces exist. Offered money instead.

It will not be a book that I carry around though. I find the English representation of Thai characters very cumbersome and with little merit. Though the representative sound system is the most widely used method of understanding pronunciation, I have never found this method easy. I started with Gordon Allision's EASY THAI which uses standard English characters to present the sounding of Thai character combinations. Much simpler than what is used here, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to read it! Be sure to pass it on to friends!","review":"Many years ago, I read this book for the first time.

One of my favorites. I believe that the NDE described in this book really happened exactly the way Dr. R. saw it. However, his comments about his NDE, (what things meant, etc.) I do not agree with at all. People tend to think that, \\"Since the NDE is true, the authors opinions about what the NDE means, and the authors opinions of heaven, hell, and purgatory must be true too.\\" This is wrong.I wish Dr. Richie would have simply wrote about his NDE and kept his opinions about what it meant to himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and thought provoking","review":"By far the most thought provoking book I have ever read. I have heard of similar stories and have read a couple of others but not told with such finesse and emotion. I have always thought and believed to be a Christian. I have been born again and baptized.Even having done all of that, I continuously question and wonder. My faith is more frail than I would like to believe. In reading this book, it is as thought the most important question is revealed. It is revealed in a very inspiring way. I encourage everyone and anyone who has been curious about Christ and the afterlife and the here and now, those questioning his existence, and those questioning your faith to read this book. It is well written and fast paced. I read it in one sitting!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgetable..........","review":"I can sum this review up in one sentence-trust me you will not be able to put this book down until your finished with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return from Tomorrow","review":"I found this testimony a little hard to believe.

Ritchie, confronts him in session and tells of his own, real-life experience of life after death.Flashing back to 40 years before, George describes in depth about what happened during the near 10 minutes that he was clinically dead. Describing the details of everything that had happened from the actual \\"death\\" to when he \\"woke up\\", he was very discriptive in everything. Coming back to present, George tells what he has learned from all of this and sheds a new light on many aspects of the whole situation. This book fills curiosities that many people have about what happens, of may happen, after death. It is a very intriguing book and will keep your attention throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"introspective","review":"definitely makes you take a second look at how you're living and no matter what you believe there's nothing wrong with bettering yourself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little book","review":"This is a very thought provoking book.

We need to open our minds and hearts to these experiences. There\`s so much to learn from others and to share our own with them. This book is a enlightening story of someone who tasted death and his account with meeting Jesus Christ. I truly believe “absent from the body present with the Lord\\", and found his experience very credible and enjoyable to read about. With an open mind you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This present moment, in Christ","review":"It\`s all about Jesus. Why come back, why obey, why bother...

I was hesitant because most of us have heard the experiences of those with near or real death and then come back to tell about it. One day I picked up the book and starting skimming through it to the part where the death experience occurs, I couldn't put it down! its totally different than all the others I've heard about. In fact, once I finished the book I immediately started over from the very beginning. I bought this book to loan out to others and to re-read myself, it can be read in a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctrinally Mormon","review":"This book doctrinally lines up with Mormon beliefs of the after life. I would not have read it had I known, but it was an interesting glimpse into the ideas of the Mormon faith. Being Christian, I believe in a physical heaven and hell, as opposed to the unbiblical notion that some of us are forever enslaved as demons to the sins that haunted us on earth, and then floating around the earth in the form of ghosts. The book does a good job of describing Jesus' love, His light and the overwhelming peace and joy of being in His presence. This and other Biblical truths captivated me as I wrestled with the decidedly occult teachings being presented. If you want a biblically sound book about heaven, read \\"Heaven is For Real\\". I LOVE that book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Inspring Book","review":"Return from Tomorrow by George Ritchie is a wonderful book. I am a Christian and I believe that some people have experienced dying and coming back to life. It is amazing that Dr. Ritchie can remember so vividly what happened, what he saw and how he reacted to the different scenes that Jesus showed him. It really makes you think that every action you do will be cause for judgment and we would be lost except for the blood of Jesus. I recommend this book to all believers."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Uncle's \\"Vision\\" A family member speaks out!","review":"I am the nephew of George G. Ritchie.

Ritchie denigrates Scripture2. Ritchie believes in reincarnation3. Ritchie believes that man's ultimate destiny is to become a god.4. Ritchie believes that his experience is more authoritative than Scripture.5. Ritchie's account is not consistent with that of Betty Eadie, Dannion Brinkley or other NDE'rs.

It is full of slow images and scents, sensual but not explicit. Ondaatje weaves Sanskrit and Tamil words and forms into the poems in such a way that you don't even care that you don't know exactly what he's talking about. \\"The brush of sandalwood along the collarbone/ Green dark silk/ A shoe left on the cadju tree terrace..\\" \\"The pepper vine shaken and shaken/like someone in love/Leaf patterns/saffron and panic seed/on the lower pillows/where their breath met...\\" What's a cadju tree?

This book has 46 pages of instruction; thirteen devoted to personal appearance and seven devoted to wine. With four pages of illustration this leaves very little space for what could be considered Business Etiquette. Most of the actual advice offered is sound, if shallow and incomplete. I object to the suggestions that people with southern accents or nasal voices should take diction lessons. Also disturbing was the chapter titled Interviewing Techniques that lists four \\"items necessary to ensure a positive interview.\\" The fourth necessary item is to not be overweight. I could not in good conscience recommend this book to anyone needing serious advice on business manners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for PDA or PC connection","review":"The GPS 76 is the perfect portable GPS unit for connecting to a PocketPC based PDA or a laptop.

I have also tested it with a friend's PDA using Anywhere Map (a moving map/EFIS type program for flying) and it worked great.

Who knows whether he deserves a footnote in the history books for his role in Live Aid? I am certain he only deserves a mention in the chapters on flatulence, shallowness and irrelevance in any credible pop music history. And yet, Dancing With Tears In My Eyes does lodge itself in that unerasable jukebox in the memory and you can't avoid a waft of nostalgia at the lyrical insights of \\"Answers To Nothing.\\" This collection assembles much of the output of Midge's tenure with Ultravox as well as the hummable hits of his solo career.

I have used it with regular dry milk and rice milk soy milk and almond milk, but liked it best mixed with vanilla soy milk.

I have been cooking vegan for quite some time, and i am always open to new, weird, or even down right fancy cooking, but i was extremely dissapointed with this book. I think, and i am NOT exaggerating here, that there was only about 5 recipes that even sounded realistic. I don't know about you, but i like to know what the heck the ingredients are (and how to pronounce them) if i am going to eat a meal. For a great vegan cookbook i would recommend The Mcdougall Quick and Easy cookbook (it has over 300 low fat meals you can prepare in under 15 minutes!) I am not an advocate of low fat, or Dr. Mcdougall...but this book comes in handy for us working wives/mothers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much I wanted to cook","review":"I have bought several vegan cookbooks recently, and like this one the least of all.

We found them bland and unappetizing. The combination of spices and ingredients is tantalizing, but the final product is bland and unsavory. The Curried Chickpea tart was heavy and had no curry taste. The Cauliflower-Fennel sauce was flavorless. The directions are not detailed enough. I was unsure about most of the recipes I tried, the process was nothing like the author had described. Very frustrating introduction to vegan cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scavenger hunt","review":"Although we are experienced in international vegetarian cooking, we were completely put off by the abundance of unfamiliar ingredients in many of Kornfeld's recipes. How many grocery stores or natural food stores carry pasilla or ancho chiles, yucca, kudzu, black turtle beans, asafetida, kuri squash, guajillo, epazote, anasazi beans, frisee, kaffir lime leaves, fresh galangal, or achiote seeds? The author does, at times, suggest substitutions. But after we've been forced to make multiple substitutions, we can't help but wonder how the original recipe was meant to taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative gourmet meals","review":"This is an amazing book, not only for the delicious, diverse and different recipes, but the way the author has created a complete 'menu'. I find this invaluable when catering for a dinner party. I recently made the Thai Stew, there was a tofu dish and a rice dish made with lime leaves and coconut which complemented the meal beautifully and really added that professional touch. There are quite a few recipes which require exotic ingredients and require a bit of preparation, but for those of us who need some excitement in our diet this is the book for you. There are also lots of helpful hints for preparation. An excellent book if entertaining is your thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i hoped for","review":"As other reviewers have said, the recipes are time consuming. I have tried the adzuki bean recipe, and it was much less tasty than I had expected.

There are better, more down-to-earth vegan cookbooks out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make room on your cookbook shelf.","review":"Who said vegan was boring?

Plenty of the recipes were yummy, but none were simple. This book is a bit more complicated than I have time for. Being a vegan is hard enough without having to run all over town looking for obscure ingredients you'll only use 1/2 teaspoon of.This would be a good book for entertaining guests and serving elaborate food, but I just wanted a book with simple skillet suppers and the like, a book I could use everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food Fantasy Come True","review":"I'm a convert, and I don't mean to vegetarianism, but to gourmet cooking. Ms. Kornfeld, please open a restaurant so that I can not only whip up my own gourmet meals from your book, but also be pampered by your obvious brilliance as a chef. The fabulous complete menus (what a great idea - the individual recipes are great too) have inspired me to start a monthly dinner gathering with friends where we make a different menu each time.

I highly highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Read--Better to Eat","review":"After receiving this book as a gift it looked so appealing I gave a copy to a friend I knew was interested in vegan cooking. She raved so much about all the recipes and how much she enjoyed actually \\"reading\\" the book that I decided I needed to take a closer look and was I ever impressed. I'm not a vegetarian however I can't eat any dairy products and it's always a challenge to find interesting recipes that don't use milk or cheese. I just got a new pasta machine so tonight I made the squash ravioli with white bean sauce, frizzled leeks and sauteed arugula. I couldn't believe how creamy and decadent the meal tasted. mmmm.... Even my meat eating boyfriend had two large helpings!! (Bummer no leftovers). The book also has lots of good cooking tips and takes the difficulty out of menu planning. I'd highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and delicious vegan food","review":"You will never miss the meat in any of the dishes. I am a personal chef and have vegetarian clients. This is my favorite book to use. The paella is a favorite, not only with veggie clients but also meat eaters love the dish. I do, however leave out the cherry tomato dish. Even though the recipes are arduous, to create a complete meal can take most of the day when you include shopping, it is worth the effort. At christmas I had a lunch party for around 20 people. I decided to do vegan food for serious meatlovers. Everyone enjoyed the creole dishes that I made from the book. Sometimes, if I don't have time, I will adapt the dishes to make faster. You will not be disappointed by the book and there is nothing out there on the market that competes.

Although the book covers a lot of ground, it is very shallow on the details, and even gets some of the facts wrong.For example, uses less than a page to discuss the Son Tay raid, but even in that small of a space gets one main fact wrong. Leebaert states that only satellite imagery was available. Wrong, both manned and unmanned platforms were used.Leebaert's writing style also makes the book hard to follow and comprehend.

Dwayne sends one of his deputies to investigate Perkin's house, but unleashes the fourteen people from a cellar, all whom are now zombie-like-killers!This is the worst movie in the After Dark Horrorfest III. The acting is average for a horror movie, but the pacing is too slow, the makeup effects are horrible, and the dialogue is laughable. I forgot to mention about the countless plot holes! The cops in the movie are unbelievable! Hooper's daughter is a teenager, but I find it odd that she is dating a guy that is probably in his thirties and Hooper doesn't care!

The author's story of life as a student in Europe is ho-hum. It does pick up a bit when she returns to Iran, but never reaches the heights of the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"If you haven't read the first Persepolis, you will not fully understand Marjane's story. And if you have read the first book and have not read this one, you really ought to get your hands on it.The book is in a comic book format, like the first, but this only conveys the author's story even more than if she had just written in a traditional novel format. Her simple drawings are elegant and convey so much emotion. We finally get to see what path Marjane's life goes down when fleeing Iran in the 1980's and her return back. The story itself is amazing. The art work only makes it more intriquing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Follow Up","review":"This book is about Marjane Satrapi's years in Europe when she went to school. It focuses on her social problems and addictions before she returned to Iran. In Iran she continues to rebel against the strict religious laws of the extremist government but she is far from a perfect citizen.I liked the first book better for the somewhat silly reason that Marjane was a child then; and with that, there is more innocence and you are not forced to confront Marjane as a flawed character (not that Marjane is a villain, she's just grows up with some problems).It is not necessary to read the second book; but it can give you another look at the daily life of an Iranian in and out of Iran - the social effects of growing up with out parental guidance, dealing with a home nation in crumbling condition, and the angst of growing into an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Charm Wears Thin","review":"The first novel in this series succeeded because its childlike graphics and gee-whiz storytelling matched perfectly with this subject matter. We could imagine the infant/child author telling her story in exactly these terms.This sequel fails because the issues of growing up and dealing with the disillusionment with one's own culture are much more subtle. The story and the graphics remind us constantly of the nuances that are left out, of the issues of women's rights and humanity that are sentimentalized, of the real conflicts that this child/woman is undergoing that are completely unexplored.There are a few quibbles to be explored: the view of vienna is odd and the little vignette of the narrator peeing standing up seems forced. But most importantly, the mismatch between the story and the way in which it is told ends up making for a read that turns boring quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"In the second installment of Marjane Satrapi's retelling of her coming of age we find our heroine lost in Europe. Confused about who she is and what the world sees her as she falls into a series of misadventures before returning to her home country of Iran. It is a beautifully told story about a girl becoming a woman and coming to terms with her turbulent heritage. There aren't enough awards you could give Satrapi for her brilliant work. She has captured her life story with honesty and amazing talent. Reading her books is a joy and I only hope that she will put out a third volume in the future. I will never tire of hearing her story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Love love love this book! A must read for everyone!

Then sax parts. This album showcases a very effective, subtle mixture of very different styles of music.

He seemed to use that to take shots at people who can no longer defend themselves, and that turned me off.

The black lace series is written by women for women... so the books tend to read like romance novels sometimes... but dirtier. It's nice to see an erotic novel with a well written plot that lendsitself to the sex... instead of the plot being because of the sex.

So when I heard this disc for the first time, even though it was a bit different due to the changes in style and recording and so on, I didn't need any time to settle in to its sound. Man, he was gooood!I really hope that eventually some day some company will release some of the 60's country albums in their original form. Country music was phenomenal during that decade!

It is a very attractive watch but with a series of design flaws. The first is the tiny pins which are far too weak for such a heavy watch and band. Also the holes the pins lock into are too shallow. The watch band fell off within the first week and continued until the band itself broke. The crown is unprotected and is easily pulled out from regular wear stopping the watch. Pulling your hand out of a pocket always catches the crown and yanks it out. Over time this has damaged the insides enough that you can move the entire face of the watch with the crown.

The plastic screen is foggy, making it not so clear when glancing at the screen while jogging, lifting or whatever. Lastly, the pouch is poorly designed. The arm straps pull at the bottom corners of the plastic screen protector causing it to disconnect with the armband to a great degree.

For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.

Part 3 is released on DVD here in regioun 4 land, released by Magna. That was the best one, tho it wasnt much of a horror flick, it was funny as hell.

Of course there are missing scenes as this DVD mainly focuses on the story of the main characters, but personally I don't care to relive the unimportant stories. I can honestly tell you I don't think it wasn't edited haphazardly. If you've never seen it before, it's easy to follow along.

This would be fine and dandy on its own, however throughout the rest of the book the 'author' (it's written in almost a narrative format) seems pretty knowledgable about the werewolves.

I gave him 20 pages to redeem himself at page 40. Sophistry, sexism and parental phobia run rampant through his poorly constructed sentences. His argument against chronological causality is rendered defunct when he argues for daimon as the cause. I do not deny the possibility of the daimon but why must it be so single minded? Are there not multiple callings? Cannot a person be coded or guided for multiple missions including love? The absence of love as a destiny, of daimon inspired parental love makes Hillman's book chilling and uninspired. I would argue that Hillman, if being true to his daimon, is destined merely to be exceptionally bitter. The fact that this book was published would indicate, according to his philosophy, that Hillman's daimon resonates with many others. Cannot the daimons be at fault?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosopher King","review":"Hillman laments early on in Soul's Code that the western mind splits over binary opposites like mind and matter and good and evil. The result of this opposition is a feeling of disconnection or alienation. Agreed. But then Hillman protests toward the end of the book his liberal democratic difference (bona fides?) from straw men conservatives. He fails on this protestation to account satisfactorily for whether he himself can be at the same time both democrat and Platonist and rather forcefully thrusts a sloppy interpretation on us. His style of argumentation would land us in the realm of the philosopher king in Plato's Republic. Is this the character of Hillman's \\"daimon\\" or \\"calling\\"? Hmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice dress watch with useful stopwatch functions.","review":"The brief description on the website does not point out that one of the smaller dials is actually the sweep second hand.

I've read all of her Rolling Stone books, I have her book on Olympic Athletes and always look for her work on the cover of Vanity Fair. This is her tightest collection yet. You can tell how attached she is to her subjects from the First Lady to women on a farm, to activists in San Francisco to movie stars. Her passion for women is outstanding and clear in her work. I feel each image and feel that connection despite the extreme difference in backgrounds and lifestyles. An absolute must for every woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"Superb photography, amazing subjects. Very interesting essay by Susan Sontag.

The photos themselves are so rich with texture and color that it feels as if you are experiencing that very moment with the subjects. The photos are of National Geographic quality. They will move you. It's easy to forget the genuine value of individuality because we're so caught up in our looks and in trying to be the best. It is filled with women from every type of work, socioeconmic status, region, and experience. Every reader will be able to relate immediatly. This book takes an ordinary moment in time and makes it a glittering treasure. I bought this for my mom and we sat and absorbed each page together and it really brought us closer and created interesting discussions about women in our society. It is thought provoking, visually pristine, and will stir up a bit of magic in your soul. Postive, enlightening, and worth every penny.

For the low cost, what else would you expect, but I would pay more for a more heavy duty holster. Something that would hold up to \\"On The Jobsite\\" use.

His honest pain at the death of his young assistant pushes him to help Dr. Hendrix, the inventor of the virus and his daughter. They are held hostage to a mad plan to control the West. Very timely. Muslim terrorists fuel the plague. The bad guys are really bad. The good guys are very human. The finale is stupendous. Everyone is present for the rousing ending in the hearing rooms at the Capitol.

The author uses a clumsy style of poetry that mixes rhyming verses with non-rhyming verses making it very awkward to read aloud. Also, instead of focusing on one of the many stories concerning Elijah, it tries to cram all of them into too limited a space resulting in a jumbled up mess. My last complaint is in regard to some of the wording. I prefer to teach my children from the NKJV or KJV, but in the part of the story where Elijah is fed by the black birds, the author uses the translation that Elijah is brought food by an angel. Children who are already very familiar with the story of Elijah may be able to sift through this book and make something felicitous of it, but it would probably take a child who is far outside of the target audience's age range to do such.

The rack started to stick during the rack cycle and make this HORRIBLE thump thump sound. You'd have to nudge it about half way through so it could complete the rotation. The problem only got worse. The problem is that litter gets kicked into the motor area and gums it up. There is no way to crack open the case to clean it. Now the rack part is completely useless. It gets to the half way point and gets stuck. THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP. I have to manually push the rack thru rest of the cycle.

I needed one that would not smell, and that would keep litter in the box.I had looked at and researched the Litter Maids and Purrforma, and this box. Of the 3, it looked like this box may be promising.It was actually well designed, but poorly executed. The gears stripped within a week, and the rake had to be pushed to get past the problem spot, not every time, but once in awhile. It also had a tendency to spill litter and it did not get the waste at the very bottom of the box.I returned it and purchased a litter robot, which has worked out very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I wish I had read the previous reviews before I had spent $$$ on this litterbox.

Big mistake. The weak motor regularly got stuck and the wire scoop would always miss the poop on the edges. The unit was totally useless when we tried using clumping litter. We found ourselves always manually scooping out the poop and wet litter, so the unit was just a very expensive cat litter box. When we got a second cat we had to manually scoop the poop twice a day and ended up just buying a large plastic storage box.

That is the only way you can get your money back or get a replacement.Anyway, there was a defect in this new one too. I tried using it for a couple of months and it too became a manual scoop.

The oddity of this film concerns the relationship (yes, I said \`relationship') between Proteus (the super computer) and Julie Christie. What follows is both intensely scary and bizzare. It certainly isn't your typical computer gone mad scenario. Julie Christie's performance is top-notch, and Robert Vaughn provides a great menacing voice to Proteus. I really like this unique movie.

The book might cover every formatting object in the W3C XSL-FO recommendation, but it's more like reading just that, the recommendation (which can be found online).It's a bulleting of objects with minimal examples and sometimes difficult to understand explanations.

My personal favorite is \\"Culture Revolution\\" There is not much more to say other than the fact that this song and others make me wanna get up and just break stuff.

Plus Chris has a cool sound to his voice.I also like the essay's writen in about some of the songs by the authors,thats really cool that they did that.

With Underground Network, they prove themselves to be the best political punk band of our generation. That's right - Anti-Flag is our Crass. Underground Network is, from beginning to end, a classic punk rock CD. Taking on targets like war (\\"The Panama Deception\\"), the media (\\"Underground Network\\") and the education system (\\"A Start\\"), Anti-Flag is armed with the intelligence and hooks needed to fuel a punk revolution. Oddly enough, the best song here is the only one that's not explicitly political. \\"Spaz's House Destruction Party\\" is a hilarious ode to a party that went way out of hand.

It is a straight transcription with all the same errors. Its only useful function is to grade your exam, but reviewing your work with the answers is difficult due to the user interface.

The interface does not actually make it easier to target the difficulties - I had to copy by hand all of the problems I got wrong so I could look them up in the explanations mode.Some of the other prep books have errata online - REA doesn't.

This is such a unique band, they can make hardcore harmonic. It's a thing of beauty. The singer, Tim, can go from screaming one second to singing with amazing tune and precision. Every single song is good, and the lyrics are some of the best in punk rock. They are thought-provoking and intelligent. I can't find a single flaw in this cd.

His books are a waste of trees since he insists on reprinting the same tired stories over and over. This volume is no exception; its only virtue is that it can be read in the bathroom or while lying in bed.Yaawn. I recommend www.snopes.com, the Urban Legends Reference Page, for far more entertainment in the form of fresh, tasty urban legends and no dead trees. Visiting the Snopes site is not without risks -- the endless theorizing about the role urban legends play in controlling social behavior is quite boring, and Barbara Mikkelson's (Mrs. Snopes) passion for cutsey \\"internyms\\"[i.e., Joe \\"I Wrote It\\" Smith] is seriously annoying.

I bought Dr. Brunvand's book to read up on these myths so I could easily answer the worried callers.I now know how to spot an urban legend when I hear it, and I also had several hours of humorous, entertaining reading.My only complaint is the author's tendency to point the reader to one of his other books for more information.

Math teachers motivate by giving grades, giving out achievable amounts of work for homework trying to establish a positive climate and guide students attempts, but mostly math teachers motivate by making math meaningful in their students' lives. As a student I was really good at math, but found little use for it and eventually stopped taking classes in it. So part of teaching math is teaching students how to use it.Yet math and math problems are not politically neutral. In one problem students are asked to buy 12 candy bars at 43 cents a piece. This problem promotes consumerism and unhealthy eating habits. Another math problem asks to figure out the daily wage of a child working in a WalMart factory if they are earning 43 cents an hour for 14 hours.

The other one made it three weeks, during which it jammed all the time and required lots of pressure in order to staple anything at all. It wouldn't open all the way, so I couldn't use it to staple papers to a bulletin board either. Finally, the second one broke durnig regular use, when I was simply stapling two pieces of notebook paper together. It jammed and was impossible to unjam without popping the spring.

I believe there are some other stabs at Bruckner's symphonies by him, but nothing induces me to seek them out given how stiff and unnatural this performance is. Ormandy had a reputation for splendid orchestral execution and bland interpretations. Here the Philadelphians sound nowhere near as good as the Berliners and the Viennese, and Ormandy tends to punch out accents as if that alone will solve the tricky problems of tempo relationships and disjointed structure that make the Fifth the most difficult of Bruckner's works to bring off successfully. Instead, he walks straight through the score's sinuous curves, and in the process delivers a wooden, unthinking account. Even at bargain price this is a Fifth to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nero, the wonder spray","review":"I do not know how I could have ever gotten along without this product.

I bought this for a trip this weekend and had to return it and get another stroller on short notice, which was a giant hassle (thank god for prime & free returns, but still.) The \\"recline\\" was also a joke - an inch at best - and the harness was very flimsy, so even if they hadn't specifically excluded younger children, I would have been totally unwilling to even consider risking it with my 5 month old.

I have to deal with it every single time I put him in, so it's a major thing.The snap that locks the stroller closed when folded up is worse. It doesn't close unless you put all your effort into it. I don't even bother.And the wheels fold up on the canopy when you close it - dirtying it, no matter how hard you try to keep it clean.It's the little things that make you wonder.

Its easy to pack and takes up minimal room in the trunk of a car. Its high quality without an outrageous price tag, plus it comes in a variety of colors to suit everyone. I have come to really love the chicco line of baby stuff, we got one of the infant seats and realized we also needed a stroller to make trips to the store easier. But we didn't want to buy one of their big expensive strollers, this one is perfect for what we use it for. I love it and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"seat does not recline","review":"Despite the advertising the seat only reclines a fraction of an inch. If reclining is not something you plan on doing, and that would be for an older child and not an infant, this would be a good stroller for you. I have a one year old grandson who needs to sleep and I had to return this stroller because it didn't allow him to do so.Chicco C6 Stroller Tangerinehttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/f9/e9/e56d419328a0db2d566fd110.T.jpg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to short for me or wife","review":"We (My wife and I) want to like this stroller, but every time we use it we get back or neak pain becuase of the awkward way we have to push it to avoid kicking the wheels. If the handles were adjustable this would be a great stroller. As is don't buy it if you are taller then 5'6\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Convenient, wheels a bit stiff","review":"I was super excited about this stroller, it weights practically nothing, it takes two seconds to close and open, great! Makes getting on the subway a lot easier and small enough for entering small spaces. The cons would be that the wheels are a bit stiff feeling. I'm thinking about oiling them up, maybe that will make a difference. I noticed that BabysRus has come up with it's own version of this chicco stroller in a great deep mauve color. I'm still happy with this purchase....All in all I would recommend as a light weight stroller if you want something basic and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around stroller...reasonable price","review":"I bought this stroller (in the 70's print at Babies R Us for $60) for my 11 1/2 month old and used it this past weekend on gravel, concrete, slippery store surfaces, bumpy sidewalks, etc. and didn't have any trouble. I had tried it out in the store prior and really liked it. It is lightweight, truly has a one-hand fold, storage compartment is small but better than the cheaper models, the 5-point harness is easy to buckle and unbuckle (and has a strap to conceal the buckle from my curious little one) and the shoulder straps stay attached to the waist strap. It takes up practically no space in the trunk and the canopy is easy to engage/disengage. One drawback is that you have to remove the canopy in order for it to fit in the carrying case (that is included) and as others have mentioned, isn't great for taller individuals. Although my husband (who is 5'11\\") said that it isn't that bad. I have had multiple compliments on it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stroller but dirt on wheels is an issue","review":"I actually bought the aqua color last year, but they are all pretty much the same. It is a good, lightweight stroller for a walk in the park or mall or a shorter daytrip. The basket is not large, but sufficient for a purse and small diaper bag. I quickly found out if you place too many shopping bags on the handle and take your child out of the seat, the whole stroller tips backwards! (yep, in the manual!) The travel bag it comes with is good for car travel, but got pretty beat up on one airplane trip. It's not made with strong material and the seams are weak.My only complaint is the way the stroller folds - the wheels (always dirty) come into direct contact with the underside of the canopy when folded. Unless you remove the canopy each time before storing it in your trunk or SUV, it gets dirty and is difficult to clean. You also have to buy your own cupholders to attach, but all in all a good lightweight stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for 18+ mos old kids","review":"I was so excited when I ordered this stroller. I really liked it when I checked it out at the store. I couldn't wait for it to arrive after I placed my order here at Amazon.What's the problem??? The CROTCH STRAP! Too short for my 18mo old who is only 24lbs. She's at 50th percentile in height and weight. And this stroller is supposed to be for 37 lb kids?I was very disappointed. So, I sent it back to Amazon. I wish they would fix the strap because I'll be waiting to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New harness system is terrible- buckle digs into my baby's thighs","review":"I called Chicco because what I bought vs what I tested in the store was not the same product. Per Chicco, new regulations required that they move the crotch strap to the middle of the seat late 2009. The pictures you see online are NOT what it looks like now. Needless to say any normal size baby will end up sitting on the crotch strap, which is a problem but not the reason why I'm rating it 1 star. Because it's in the middle and the crotch strap is SHORT and NON-ADJUSTABLE, the plastic buckle digs into my 15 month thighs. Just note she's 50% weight and 50% height on the growth charts - not a big baby. I don't know if any baby over 9 months can comfortably sit in that stroller with the stap in the middle of the seat. Do not buy unless they change the harness system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not take on airplane!","review":"Don't listen to the advice of the woman in the video for this stroller. This stroller is not durable enough to be checked at the gate of an airplane. I know from experience.... the handles broke off in transit and the frame bent. Note that most airlines will not cover cost of broken strollers. Its a check at your own risk. Maybe it was mishandled by the airline but there are better constructed strollers for airplane travel.

I also used it to fly by myself with my daughter and it was extremely useful the ease of folding and also opening for quick transition. One thing that is not ideal but still minor is one set of wheels hit the canopy and get it dirty. The wheels do touch on the underside of the canopy so it is really not awful.

However, we have to struggle a lot each time to buckle him in. Main reason is that the crotch strap is very short, making it very tight to put in.

So I chose this and after using it for a couple weeks I wish I had chosen something different. My husband complains about the fact that the handles aren't tall enough so it doesn't keep the stroller far enough away from him so he is constantly kicking the wheels. I am only 5'7 and I kick the wheels when I am walking behind it to! Its so frustrating! And as far as getting it to fold down...you either have to use your shoe (which is gonna end up being messed up) and use your hand (which you're gonna end up pinching your finger) because its a pretty tough clasp! It is however lightweight and doesn't take up a whole lot of room but I just would have rather spent a little bit more money and gotten one I want to use after all my child is gonna be riding in this awhile!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stroller!","review":"We purchased this stroller as a travel stroller that we leave in our car so we can have a stroller handy whenever we need one. One of my favorite things about this stroller is it's height. Many umbrella strollers are not made for tall people but this one is. No more sore back from hunching over. The color is great and I love how light weight it is. I would recommend this stroller to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight But Not Comfortable","review":"This stroller is lightweight, but it hurts my back.

And since the minimum age is 6mo, we got 1.5 years out of it.

The height was perfect for me (I am 5'11). It also has a strap that connects to it when it is folded up so it makes it easier to tote, which will come in handy at Disney World, or you can place it inside the carrying case and put the strap on that. It also has a small basket under the seat and the back can unzip to let the child recline in the seat. Both of my boys love this stroller and don't cry to get out of them like they do with the double stroller. Overall, it is a great lightweight stroller for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"crotch strap is way too short","review":"My son is 19 month old and 29 lb.

Currently, the straps are still so huge that the shoulders hit her ears, and if she bent her legs on the seat she would be able to maneuver herself to slide right out on the one side at the bottom. This is with each strap tightened as much as possible!We are looking forward to whenever we will be able to use this stroller, and hope that it will last for at least a little while for us!!I would recommend trying the fit for your baby in a store, before ordering this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Didn't Like This Stroller","review":"I picked this stroller because it was sturdy and I liked the print- I had the light green one with polka dots- but I almost immediately regretted the purchase.

This makes a great stroller to leave in the trunk and pull out for quick shopping trips.

I've tried walking around the neighborhood with it, but I prefer the stroller from my Chicco travel system, as it's easier to steer and my feet don't bump the back wheels. Again, I've been pleased to have this for trips to the store, and my child appears comfortable.

The rubber footrest just broke and customer service said it cannot be replaced since it is riveted on--poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Stroller","review":"We've taken this stroller on 4 trips. We bought it primarily for this purpose since it's light to carry, has a carry bag, and the under-carriage storage basket. It's held up on all 8 flights wonderfully! I'm 5'6 and I don't have a problem with my stride with this stroller as other reviewers mentioned, but my hubby at 5'9 finds it uncomfortable for more than a short walk so I'm usually the one pushing it when we travel. The storage basket doesn't hold much, but it's okay for things like a spare blanket or jacket. I usually adjust the straps of my messenger-style diaper bag to hang over the handles, which is handy. If not, I attach a string bag I bought and that holds plenty.Even though we bought it for travel, we use it a lot for just walking around our city. Things like a quick trip to the park, etc. It's much easier than hauling out the big travel-system stroller.I will definitely be getting another one of these gems for my 2nd child and my next trip in May."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I own an aluminum ramp already of good quality but wanted a wider ramp for easier loading.

This is not back ground music, this is music to focus on and think about. As good as they were in their time, Stones in the Road and Come On Come On were recorded at a time when there was still potential for Carpenter to be played on mainstream radio. Room for intelligent and grown up voices doesn't exist anymore, and so, like many others Carpenter seems to have stopped caring. And, like so many others she has found her true voice in that vauge collection of music that has become known as Americana. These songs pull you in and let you think about life, love, loss and self--all the things that mainstream outlets seem to want give us easy answers. Carpenter doesn't profer the answers, in fact, she almost never seems to know them. However, unlike the mainstream, she seems to have figured out the questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"The album is very special, with carefully tailored melodies, meticulous production, and with Chapin's trademark sharp, insightful, and often inspirational lyrics. If there's a part that's missing here, it would be a few more lighthearted, upbeat moments and songs along the lines of 'Luna's gone'. That doesn't take anything away from the individual songs, it just makes the listening experience a little less varied.Compared to her previous release (T*S*L), the production on this album adds a few more Country elements, which I find definitely benefits her songs.All in all, the CD is way above average compared to what's out there musically, so it's defintely worth a recommendation, but it's not outstanding when compared with her earlier work ('Come on, come on', 'Stones in the road')."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure!","review":"Mary Chapin Carpenter is one of the few singer songwriters who still amazes me.

You need to really listen to albums a couple of times to truly fall in love with them.The album is spectacular with cuts like: \\"Luna's Gone\\", the title track, \\"Elysium\\", \\"Beautiful Racket\\", \\"Shelter of Storms\\" and the very moving \\"Grand Central Station\\".This album won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing","review":"As always, MCC gives us another relaxing ride through space and time... great up loud or playing softly at night or on the road.peace and pills :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album!","review":"I own serveral of MCC's albums, and I think this is my favorite.

Except for maybe one or two tracks that are mildly enticing, the whole album plays like one extremely long, drawn out song that you hope will pick up but never does. All of the songs on this new album were penned exclusively by Carpenter, which could explain the monotony and highlights the fact that some artists may need collaborators to reach their full creative potential. Whatever the case, this latest effort falls way short of any of her previous work. Let's hope it is just a fluke, and that Mary gets on a good antidepressant and back to making the kind of music we've come to love and expect from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper in the bunch","review":"All I can say is how disappointed I was when I heard it.

Virginia Fleming paints an accurate picture of the attitudes children may have toward those who are different. At the start of the story, Christy sees Eddie Lee, a neighbor boy with Down's syndrome, as a pest and a mistake of God. While Christy merely tolerates Eddie Lee per her mother's request, her friend JimBud shows total intolerance for his peer. Christy's growing acceptance of Eddie Lee is realistic, without seeming forced, as it is a shared appreciation for nature which draws them together. The oil wash illustrations are detailed without being overwhelming and clearly identify Eddie Lee as a lovable child who has Down's syndrome. Though targeted for lower elementary, this story can teach children of all ages a deeper consideration for individuals different from themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for Down Syndrome Awareness","review":"Wonderful book for siblings of a Down Syndrome child as well as peers, friends, relatives to read...great book for Down Syndrome awareness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre.","review":"The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because I liked the general idea of the plot - young boy, getting picked on, finding one friend, etc. What ruins it for me though is two things: 1) Everyone once in awhile, the dialogue makes you wince, and 2) The illustrations scared the crap out of me.

Always happy, always laughing--certainly not the real picture of people who have feelings, hopes and dreams just like you and I do. The illustrations, although lovely, exaggerate the physical characteristics some people with Down syndrome have in common. Instead of pointing out that people are more alike than different, this book points out differences. If you are looking for a book to educate readers about disability issues or Down syndrome, there are many better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish 0 stars was an option for this condescending","review":"and insulting book. Though intentions may be good, this book clearly perpetuates the myth that persons with disabilities need to treated like infants.

I found that if I plug the cable all the way into the 1/4\\" jacks, they don't make contact. I have to pull them out a little and then they make contact. It's a pain, and not a reliable way to operate. I disassembled the jack to see if it was miswired, it didn't seem to be. The issue appears to be with the jack itself. They both have the same issue, so it wasn't a fluke.My solution will be to hack the cables together now, but that's unfortunate, since I spent REAL MONEY on these adapters so I wouldn't have to do that.I haven't tried the Pyle version of this pigtail, which is actually a few $ cheaper, but I wish I had bought those instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurt Elling is KING","review":"I love his voice. This is a great cd! I can't wait until his next live recording drops this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIce, but too nice","review":"I bought this CD on impulse. Kurt sang on radio one day as I was driving down a busy street and he did something with his voice that caught my ear and I thought: Mmm, nice. It was nice and the entire play list is nice, but it's too nice, safe and, ultimately, for my ears, boring. I thought Kurt might experiment a bit more, float a bit more, extend, go out on a limb, twist, turn, play, but he stayed safe. I own it now. I've played it now. I will give it away now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much crooning!","review":"As a long-time fan of Kurt, I was hoping this album would continue his tradition of walking the innovative \\"tightrope\\" that defines the tradition of vocalese as pioneered by Eddie Jefferson, Jon Hendricks, and Mark Murphy. Instead I heard an entire album of moody crooning derived from his concerts dedicated to Johnny Hartman. I believe this album was recorded in an attempt to widen his commercial appeal - in that regard it appears to have succeeded. However, this was accomplished at the expense of abandoning the cutting-edge style of vocal jazz that brought him initial acclaim in Chicago. Hopefully, Kurt will come to his senses and return to the dynamic vocalese that played to packed crowds at the Green Mill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful.","review":"Right now, I can't get enough of this CD.

But the story was so predictable and there were several literary mistakes (wrong names, titles, etc...) that it was not an especially good read.

It would probably take just a few months. Nuclear war would follow immediately, killing all life on the planet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring but fact-dense story","review":"Teenagers looking for nonviolent heroes like Dr Martin Luther King, Jr, need only read this book to find one. Diane Wilson, a shrimp fisher in Texas, learns that chemical factories which provide many jobs are also poisoning the water, reducing her livelihood and affecting the community's health. She rapidly becomes a hero to environmentalists and an enemy to the companies and local government, and has to undertake a hunger strike to get the federal government to enforce its own laws. Black and white comic-style illustrations flesh out the story, with a background of full color paintings depicting the natural systems affected. Like a graphic novel or Larry Gonick's Cartoon History of the World, the illustrations brim over with facts, which may overwhelm many readers. But those who persist will understand just how much willpower it takes to overcome environmental injustice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not feeling this one...","review":"I love Blaze's flow when he is collaborating, but I'm not digging much of his solo work. He has the perfect hip hop vocals but his beats need some serious work. He should take a listen to Prozak, Project Deadman, Tech N9ne and Boondox. Toe Tagz is the only good song on this album as far as I'm concerned and has a pretty bad ass beat to it too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Break backs, cutthroat, bullet hole, gunsmoke","review":"Considering the quality of the work on this album, this price is a steal.

The Infotainment Scan passes the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of mid 90s era Fall","review":"Hardly the greatest album by The Fall, The Infotainment Scan is certainly one of my favorite ones from the early to mid 90s era. The album is made up of short, concise pop songs that don't really challenge the listener's expectations of the band so much as strengthen their ability to work well in this context. It rewards repeat listening with some sharp songcraft and the cover of \\"I'm Going To Spain\\" (once called one of the worst songs ever written) vastly improves on the original, making it a highlight here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Bunnies!","review":"Everything in this movie that some would complain about actually makes it so much fun. Giant killer bunnies, Janet Leigh trying to pose as a young wife and mother...all of the absurdities join together for one fun film. What makes it even more fun is the idea that the film makers set out to tell a serious story.While it is not gory or graphic in the sense that modern films are, use discretion when watching with kids. Since I was told that it was \\"not scary\\" at all, I let the kids watch it with me after we received it. My daughter cried and my son curled up in a ball and I finally had to shut it off. My kids may be oversensitive - but just know that it's no Disney movie and younger, sensitive kids may very well be scared by it. Even my eleven year old was a little spooked by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed in this release. They deleted the best WORST parts of the movie. For instance, there was a scene when the rancher was being attacked. He and a guy in a rabbit suit crash through the window. They wrestle around on the floor and bed, basically fist-fighting each other. Then, the large rabbit is back outside next to the toy models again. It was one of the many reasons I couldn't wait to see this movie again on DVD! I can't believe MGM said, \\"Wait! Before we release this, let's clean up the really bad parts first!\\" Very disappointed, indeed. Otherwise, it's a 5 star C movie from the 70s. Did I mention, I was very dissapointed???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lepus....That's Latin for rabbit.....","review":"So what's Latin for tripe? This is the sort of low-rent cheapie you'd see on TV late at night before cable came along and ruined everything.

I was wrong.It's not scary, not really gory, and its way too boring for a long time in the middle.Killer rabbits seem like a more creative idea than they actually are, as proven by this film. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's still crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great movie. What is not to like about Mutated man eating town destroying bunny rabbits? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.It is terrible. The acting is hilarious. Blaming small children for destroying the world. Night of the Lepus is hands down my favorite movie ever. It's appallingly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Rabbits","review":"This is not a movie for people that want to be scared by a horror movie, and this is not a movie for people who want to sense or good acting. This is the giant carnivorous bunny movie. If you find rabbits running in slow motion across miniature sets funny, if the idea of extreme close-ups of rabbits with horrible fake blood smeared on their lips tickles you, and if a man in a rabbit suit tackling people for the close up fight shots amuses you, this is your movie. The entire joy of the movie is watching them try to seriously make a gaggle of bunnies from the pet store scary.As a warning, this movie has a few bits that might be disturbing to some viewers. Mostly the stock footage of a real rabbit round-up at the beginning, which involves the animals screaming in fear/pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worshipful music","review":"These songs were tastefully done and create an atmosphere very pleasant and soothing.

Without at least an introduction to these topics, you can only write a program with \\"1970s mainframe style\\" output: lines of text on a command screen. You cannot write a program with any user input (buttons, text boxes, mouse clicks). Forget about any graphics whatsoever.These topics are not wildly advanced.

Once I got to the train wreck that was He's On My Team, (a lame version of The Boy Is Mine by Brandy and Monica), I knew there was no hope. Stay away from this CD at all costs.

A LITTLE BIT. I ESPECIALLY LIKE HOW HE BLENDS PRO-TOOLS LIKE VOICE ENHANCEMENTS WITH THE NORMAL RANGE OF HIS VOICE TO MAKE THE MUSIC LISTENING EXPERIENCE THAT MUCH MORE INTERESTING.

The contrast between \\"sleepy\\" songs and \\"wake-up\\" songs is perfect for an EP. Rarely will I buy an EP, but I can't imagine this album being any longer or shorter. Will Sheff continues to improve his songwriting yet still keeping Okkervil Rivers' distinct sound. Again, this is a must buy for Okkervil River fans.

I've read them over and over. Then came Kill and Tell and Now You See Her which seemed written on auto-pilot with the reader (and I fear the author)developing no connection to shallowly written characters as opposed to the emotional ties you felt to her characters in the past. I'd hoped things would turn around, but All The Queen's Men is yet another let-down in my opinion. I found it marginally better than Kill and Tell and Now You See Her but still a far cry from her earlier works. I miss knowing a Linda Howard book will be a keeper, and don't plan on buying any more of her work until somebody tells me she's gone back to her old standards of quality writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"The author Linda Howard who once described herself as \\"easily bored with murder, mayhem and politics\\" has proven herself to be most interested in exactly that- for the third book in a row. I recognize any creators right to evolve and change view but I had always been able to count on this author for a truly rich romance story and the ultimate in alpha male characters-not anymore. After reading the words \\"scatter-burst transmission\\" for about the fourth time I asked myself what the heroe of the story physically looked like-I could not remember. The bits of information she relays about spec-war technology and techniques are very interesting but the characters are flat, the plot half-hearted and the romance virtually non-existent.

And, after buying both Ms. Howard's last books in hardback, I can tell you it WON'T happen again! Her last book, Now You See Her was stupid, with it's hurried-up ending, and dragged out sensuality. This one is just plain boring. Where was the romance? Pray tell me, what was the mystery, that made this a romantic supsense? And why bother with those stupid love scenes? They were just thrown in to add spice. This is definitely an author who's talents are depleting with each book. Read her old ones for the first time, or reread them! Skip her last two books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lite & Breezy, Dumb & Cheesy","review":"I was in-between books and a coworker of mine recommended this one. I love trashy novels (like Jackie Collins' books!) and was told this book was fast and trashy. Well, it just didn't do it for me. It is very fast paced but the story was just too ludicrous and formulaic without any surprises- Smart, beautiful woman gets involved with espionage and romance while all the men fall at her feet (of course). The characters were too wooden to find engrossing and the plot wasn't nearly trashy enough to keep me interested either. (By the time there's finally a fairly raunchy sex scene you're almost through with the book and then the sex scene isn't all that great anyway.) This is really a pretty short book but I found it so boring that it took me about a month to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't even finish it","review":"I love Linda Howard...I have read every book she has ever written.

I can only assume that Ms. Howard's other books were romance novels written for an audience who needs constant doses of rather juvenile lust, peeking at various awe inspiring body parts and a highly improbable bizzare sex scene in the villain's library.Medina is an interesting character but goes nowhere near his potential under Howard's influence.If you like Clancy, Le Carre or anything like them stay far away from this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the Queen's Men","review":"The book made me long for adventure.

All the adventure drama were there with a great alpha hero & gutsy heroine, but also a very \\"likeable\\" baddie in the name of Louis Ronsard - i too hope he'll get his own story one day. The other reason that i love this book is the second chance storyline where Medina has been in love with Niema for 5 years. I love the sex scenes and didn't feel they were violent in any way...more so a testament of Medina's intense feelings for Niema that he couldn't control his response to her hence the exciting hard, fast sex. The book length was just right for me not too long that it'd get boring but enough so that you feel immensely satisfied with the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A THRILLING ADVENTURE NOVEL","review":"John Medina is the CIA's legendary Black Ops specialist, Niema Burdock is a communications expert.Five years ago, Niema and her husband, Dallas, worked with Medina on a mission in Iran that resulted in Niema's husband's death.The bombing of an airplane brings Medina and Niema back together.

The charachters were itteresitng and some of the scenes were hot, but it was not the book I was expecting. After the build up in Kill and Tell this book was a let down.

I await her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average for a howard book","review":"Expected much much better from a book on John Medina. Have been looking forward to it, but found it a letdown. Firstly, we have John, who is a superman who can do everything, maybe even sew a dress. In his line of work, he's constantly surrounded by murder, mayhem and worse, yet he manages to keep his humour and optimism intact without even a hint of cynicism. What does that make him? Ok, superman. Other than this, the lack of suspense in this romantic suspense story really irks. If one wants to know what is truly a romantic thriller, one should check out Anne Stuart's books.

The plot is a long slow build up of two people going undercover to get information from an arms dealer in France. Some parts were a little slow, but other parts very good.CAUTION SPOILER: I did not like the part of the story in which the two main characters made a stupid decision. They had been fleeing from the bad guys and finally got away. After a short while being safe, they decided to treat themselves to a tourist-style walk in a nearby town. This was stupid because the bad guys were still searching for them in that area As a result, they got caught and then hurt by the bad guys.

Not knowing that Medina has been keeping tabs on her for the past five years, they meet again and join forces for a operation in the South of France to uncover a operation with an arms dealer.

But be warned, this is not much of a romance. It was a rather boring attempt at writing a thriller. I put the book down in the middle and had to force myself to finish it the next day. Niema and John Medina were almost cartoon characters who lacked all depth. This book was an enormous disappointment since I have really enjoyed Howard's work in the past and even liked her recent attempt at mystery in Now You See Her. Don't bother purchasing this book in hardback if you are looking for a Linda Howard romance. There was very little romance in it. If she is trying to break into the mainstream Johansen/Coulter market, she'll have to do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is my first Linda Howard book, and I like the suspense, mystery and romance in it.

Slow movements are kept flowing, and finales are hectically fast, but played with such verve and diamond-bright articulation that there is no feeling of breathlessness.

Both Levine / VPO and Herbie / BPO both have something TO SAY in this repertoire. Uncle Claudio is content to play the notes and leave it at that - a deeper interpretative point is missing per se.

Guinevere's greatest 'flaw' thus far is a slight level of sexual naivete and a stubborness that really isn't so much of a flaw, anyway. These are virtually the only aspects of her character, except for being ridiculously powerful. At one point she makes a mockery of Merlin-- when she's 13!The plot is interesting, but slow-moving. The second half of the book flips back and forth between what's happening to Guinevere and what's happening to Arthur, and it gets rather confusing.I noticed in the 'about the author' information that Alice Borchardt is actually sister to Anne Rice.

I was wrong.Borchardt manages to work her wolf character into The Dragon Queen with wonderful results. She makes Guinevere a very magical, very Celtic and very human person.

I'm the kind of person that won't put a book down once I find a decent one, and let's just say it's been a few days since I've picked The Dragon Queen up. I also find it strange that Maenial can turn into a wolf, and the whole story just seems weird-I would strongly suggest that someone interested in Arthurian legend try either Stephen Lawhead, or my all time fave Jack Whyte, who takes an ancient Roman viewpoint on it all, in his Camulod Chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dragon Queen","review":"I picked this book to read because 1) I liked the cover, 2) I liked the Arthur/Guinevere legends, and 3) I read the first bit of the book and it had a lot of potential.Unfortunately, as I kept reading, this book became more and more confusing. As many other people already mentioned, there are quite a few moments when I had to re-read the scene because I had no idea what was going on.I also liked the character Guinevere, but in a way she was too perfect!! And I'm also still wondering why Alice Borchardt decided to make Merlin evil.I kept reading this book hoping that my questions would be answered, but sooner than I thought, the ending was already there and I was more confused than ever.However, the great thing about this book is that I actually kept reading it.

I first heard about \\"The Feast of All Saints\\" when I saw pieces of the made for tv movie on Showtime. I couldn't believe there was a movie, let alone a book written by Anne Rice detailing the ups and downs of Creole people in the pre-Civil War era. It was exciting! Rice does an exceptional job depicting a time that seems so long ago and forgotton. I absolutely could not put the book down. This is a real page turner and it reminded to never forget where I came from. I found a whole new understanding and meaning behind the world which I had a hard time understanding as a child while hearing stories about relatives from my grandparents and great-grandparents back in Texas and Louisiana.

That is why I love her work.Unlike many writers who make it big with one genre of writing and are forever trapped in that mold Anne transcends the barriers and brings us a heart wrenching story of this small society in New Orleans and the struggles within society and within themselves. I was so captured by this book that to this day I consider it one of her finest works and think it should definitely be a compulsory read in literature classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top five favorite","review":"Let me start by saying as a general rule I am no fan of Anne Rice's work. That being said, this is truely a phenomenal book. This book is so well written you feel like you are there spying on the characters.

Published in 1979, it's Anne Rice's second time out of the gate. The story is set in her beloved New Orleans in the 1840's and the subject matter is one of extreme interest; a much overlooked part of New Orleans society of the time, the free people of color...Creole offspring of white landowners. The writing is rich (as is all of Anne Rice), so rich it almost drips...and so delicious! Beautifully written and tragically told...one of her best! If you love her vampires (and who in their right mind doesn't?), then you gotta give this a try (along with her 3rd book, Cry To Heaven...but that's another story)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I had fallen in love with the Vampire chronicles, so \\"Feast\\" was a unexpected, but a very pleasant surprise. J'aime beaucoup! I could not put this book down. Rice is always very educational, but this story made me feel transported back to antebellum New Orleans and the description of the Saint Domingue (Haitian) revolution is fantastic. Rice does a wonderful job of describing these gens de couleur libre (free people of color) who are coince entre deux chaises (caught between two worlds). As a Trinidadian I can identify a lot with this Creole history.Do read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in story","review":"I am new to reading Anne Rice. I have read The Mummy and The Vampire Cronicles, so I was expecting something of that nature. This is a different type of story and I just did not care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Wading Through Treacle or Drowning in Chocolate Cake","review":"I am on page 200 and will probably not go on. I agree with the reader who said reading this book is almost painful, it is SO SLOW and there is so little PLOT. Just dense dense background and evocation of New Orleans in 1830. I love re visiting the New Orleans of 1830, but this novel is so artificially constructed. There are many build ups where the reader thinks: at last something is going to happen - only to have another very flat climax. On one page our 14 year old hero spoke \\"wearily\\" 3 times!! I too was speaking wearily after drudging through this book. Probably only for true Rice devotees."},{"rating":"2","title":"History not Fantasy","review":"my favorite Anne Rice novel -- historical fiction that evokes New Orleans in the mid 1800's through the eyes of a mulatto boy coming to maturity in the French Quarter, son of an upriver white planter and a free woman of color. A portrait of the complex and little known Creole society that included scholars, artists, craftsmen, even opera singers, whose members enjoyed a strange status - able to own property, even slaves, but disenfranchised and relegated to subservience to even base whites. Fascinating! and complete in one tightly written volume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A neglected piece of history that deserves to be known","review":"Like several of the previous reviewers, I too have read this book at least three times since it's publication and am fascinated by the free people of color. This was indeed an eye-opener and though I found it hard to swallow the fact that blacks were enslavers themselves, this novel helped me put it all in perspective. I know many people of creole descent, but very little was ever discussed regarding their heritage other than speaking of family members that they know that have passed for white and assimilated into the white race. It could be many of them especially the younger ones know very little of their history and the part they played in literature, the arts, and craftsmanship. When I was asked to name my favorite all-time book, Feast of All Saints was at the top of the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to get into","review":"I tried to like this book, I really did, but try as I might, I could not fall in love with it, even a little. I dont know what it was, but it was almost torture to read it. I found it disinteresting and quite boring at times. I found myseld losing track of who did what and which character was which. I usually dont have that issue when reading anything. I was truly dissapointed as I love Anne, she is my favorie author. I breathed a great sigh of relief after finishing it because it felt like I had just ran a marathon and was tired and out of breath after. And not in a good way. The last few chapters were much more interesting but it was not enough to redeam this mess of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Yo Animorph fans.You really like the Animorph series,right?Well this book has almost twice the amount of pages so it lasts longer.Rachel one day gets anemisa and forgets everything including her name!Meanwhile the other Animorphs are haveing to deal with a monster that sucks up everything that is morphing.I can't tell you the rest because its action packed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the absolute coolest book I have ever read!","review":"This book totally rocks! In my opinion it is the best book so far, but they're all good. I don't think it's possible for any of them to be bad.

Keep up the good work Katherine!","review":"Im a devoted Animorphs (and now Megamorphs ;-) ) fan. I got this book two days ago (May 16th) and I stayed up from 9:00 to 11:00 taking my time and reading it. I rate it a 9 because it was kind of weird when Rachel had amesia, it was sort of confusing. But the Veleek was sooo COOL!!!!! It was alost neat how Applegate wrote about every Animorphs point of view.

When he tries to demorph, things go wacko, and this...this thing is after us. Like a dust storm. A beast. And on top of that, before Rachel had a chance to go to her gymnastics thing, she morphed eagle (for some fresh air) and got mobbed by jays. Now she doesn't have her memory, Cassie's gone roach, Visser Three's \\"dog\\" is on the loose, and Tobias's sleeping! Six morphs might have made us sick, but we're the Animorphs, and we won't let any Veleek, even if it is from Saturn, detect us morphing, wrap us up, and carry us up to the Visser!

The rest of the aspects of the CD are up to modern levels, of sound quality and mixing. The songs are very well done, for me this is just what the blues needed shot in the arm to get them back to the roots. If you like the older blues but have been looking for something new, here it is Villanelle.**** 4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting!","review":"Once again, Dean Koontz has written a super, thought-provoking book. He makes his readers think about possibilities, not only realities, but \\"what-ifs\\". He is my current favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"One of my favourites from Koontz. It is just great. The story is a page turner and the characters are just amazing.

Wierd, very hard to digest, makes no sense.. All characters are so two-dimensional. I forced myself to finish it just to find out how he will manage to end this bizzare story. Really suffered through the book. Can't understand how anybody can rate it 4 - 5 stars. Waist of time.."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I am on page 240 in this book and I am bored with it. So far this book has no horror or even suspense to keep me reading. Maybe it will get better, but I have already given up. I am disappointed because I have read a few of his books before and found them interesting, but I don't recommend this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"this boring book","review":"This was the most boring book i have ever read. i do not recomend it to anyone. The three different storines in one book about the same person is very stupid. I think dean koontz was on drugs or something when he wrote this book. i didnt even want to read the rest of it it was so boring. steven king is a much better writer if you want a good book to read pick up a steven king book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good bad guy wasted.","review":"I don't want to reveal too much about the book, but a couple of points.Is it possible to create a good bad guy, but place him in the wrong story? I think that is what happened here. Cain Jr. is a very interesting antagonistic. But he seems rather out of place in a book filled with good guys(and gals)with superhuman powers.About halfway through the book I realised poor Cain didn't stand a chance. So there is really no suspense or excitement at the end of the story. Just Cain running around killing off secondary characters that are within his abilities to do away with. When he finally does run into young barty, it is like a moth flying into a electric bug zapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz lost sight of the plot!","review":"I read a lot of books, all genres, & used to be a big Koontz fan (back in the Watchers & Strangers days) but this book was awful. The description on the back cover did not jive with the book at all. Whatever was the point in Bartholomew losing his sight? Too many details that had no bearing on the plot. I couldn't take one more verbose paragraph about Edom & Jacob and their penchant for disasters...enough already! It appeared as though Koontz changed his direction midstream. Very disappointing & I do NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays with you","review":"I read this book about 6 months ago and am just now writing this review--the point being that this book has stayed with me ever since I read it. There are some wonderful ideas in this book, things that make you think \\"What if a parallel universe is real?\\" \\"What effect do the decisions I make have on the world around me?\\"It's purely a good vs. evil novel, where the evil is incredibly evil and the good is too good to be true. It is also very readable and the characters are very well-drawn, you'll find yourself racing through the book to find out what happens to each character. And despite a somewhat questionable ending, I still think about the story and the characters months after I finished the book.This is highly recommended reading, even if your not a Koontz fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"the spooky factor","review":"i always look forward to reading dean koontz, because there are some surprises in store for the reader (that's me) and i like scary books. this was an enjoyable read - things were rather rushed at the end - and i think the author concentrated on the protagonist too much, but all in all you will find an interesting and somewhat challenging (the quantum physics theory explanation) story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time","review":"As an avid Koontz reader that has spent days of enjoyment with his books I feel really bad about giving a bad review. I really wanted to like this one, but after one hundred pages waiting for something to happen, I put it down never to be picked up again.Something has happened since \\"False memory\\". On later years Koontz seems to be under contract to produce two books a year. Even though still good reads, this is not the Koontz I knew and that had me up all night. We can only hope he returns to form. In the meantime; you might want to revisit, or read for the first time great books like \\"Watchers\\", \\"Whispers\\" or the excellent \\"Estrangers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catastrophy","review":"English is not my mother-tongue. Nevertheless, I think that I have acquired sufficient knowledge of it, in order to pronounce this book of Mr. Koontz complete failure.I have purchased it from Amazon.com., allured by some favourable opinions (presented by Amazon.com), and, knowing some other works of Mr. Koontz, expected genuinely good book.Wham!Imagine the story where are about a dozen of saints, battling one bad guy. Naturally, my sentiments were on the side of the bad guy, especially because he was named Enoch Cain Jr..?Original, isn't it?Shame. Koontz'theory about lives and afterlives is simply laughable, his description of the people that are so saint-like, people that are not believable, so good that .... You know what happens when you eat too much chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Happy to Find This!","review":"One of my favorite stories. It has such rich story lines, endearing characters and a wonderful childlike fantasy about it. One of my favorites by Koontz. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"First time reading a book from this author...and I have to say...I will probably never read him again. The first 3/4 of the book was great. Very much a \\"page turner\\", but when it came to the ending it just kind of fizzled out. I was very disappointed on how neutral the ending was, there was no great climax. No sad ending. It just ended. I was sitting there thinking...that's it, that's all he could come up with. A total let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand in the Corner","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. The main antagonist was bizarre to say the least and his problems with every killing were comical and had no reason in the whole plot line. Then when the book is ended it's like he was tired of writing and decided ok i'm done. It's like a Stephen King ending a lot of pages with no great finish or any finish. I don't know what happened but this one sure missed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Corner Of His Eye","review":"Dean Koontz has long been my favorite writer, but with this he has surpased himself. 'From The Corner Of His Eye' is the best book that he has ever written. It does contain the reacurring theme ofgood vs. evil that he is famous for, but with this book he makes you believe again, not only in God but in man and the power of hope and belief. I love this book and I have the greatest respect for a man that can not only imagine this but can make you believe and fill you with wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but....","review":"This is not his best work, but I must say that while the bulk of the book was mostly spent on character development, the characters are very compelling and interesting. I was a little disappointed that the final confrontation was so quick (I was getting suspicious when there weren't very many pages left!) and kind of anti-climatic, but it was a very good book and proves that Dean Koontz can really persuede you to care about the characters. They felt like my family at the end. Enjoy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow start","review":"I am finding this a very hard book to get into 40 pages in and it is weak-should I go on? will it get better? and is it worth it to read all those pages? Maybe he has abetter book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off closing your \\"eye\\" & just thinking","review":"I've been trying to figure out why this book gets 4 - 5 stars. What am I missing? This book was boring, elongated, stuffed with nonsense to enlarge it to over 600 pages. The whole premise was incredible and the characters well, weird. Why, you say, did I persist in reading it; guess I kept waiting for the good part which never happened. Forget it....dust the blinds instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was Koontz Thinking","review":"From the Corner of His Eye is a little over six hundred pages long. The story itself can be told in two hundred pages. The drive in the story is that the main villian, Cain, is after the child Bartholomew, and the two only meet briefly near the end of the novel. The pace is slow, and the conflict is trivial. The emotional pull to hate the antagonist is not there. Actually, the voice of the narrative doesn't even come across as allowing the reader to feel anything for Cain. 'So, he is a killer with a crazy thought process' is what went through my mind when I read the novel. Overall, the book was a bad novel. The reason why the book gets two stars instead of one in my opinion is because of the emotional anguish that Bartholomew's mother had to face when she found out that her son would lose her sight. That portion of the narrative was beautiful. Koontz has written better, and I hope he will write better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this to be much more tedious and sacharine than most Koontz stories. He took almost a third of the book just to set the stage before the plot really got moving. This was not nearly as clean and crisp as many of his books, and not nearly as gripping. I finished it, but would rate it as one of his most disappointing efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Koontz's best books ever!!","review":"I have read many of his novels, including Intensity, Lightning, Night Chills, and Watchers. Like in Lightning he puts the a paradoxical idea into the plot; time travel in Lightning and different demintions in From the Corner of his Eye. Of all of Koontz's novels I rate this one up at the top of my list of favorites, with Intensity and Lightning. I have seen some of the miniseries's adapted from Koontz's novels, and I believe this novel should be the next one. I have read in other reviews that only the beginning of the novel is good, for after the first 100 pages the novel is slow, but if you love Koontz's books you will not care. The book is as fast moving as a 600 page novel can be. Also do not let the length of the book stop you from reading it, for it moves quickly. All in all I rate this as one of my all time favorite novels, not just Koontz novels but all novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new road for Koontz with the best of the old preserved","review":"I very much enjoyed this book by Koontz. The style has maintained all the best elements from the past, while adding some new style features. This book will touch you and move you, but will still give you that familiar shudder. I was very surprised that the Amazon review already reveals that the central character Junior Cain throws hiw wife off that tower. I did not know that beforehand, and literally gasped at that moment in the story, because it was SO unexpected! The heavenly element in the story weaves very naturally in his normal style. All characters become dear to you and you want to know what happens with them. Because of the different viewpoints, you get to ride on everyones 'rollercoaster of life'.Good to see that Dean Koontz is back on his original quality track. I almost feared that he would not let go of his Christopher Snow-storyline, which I disliked - ugh.Buy this book! Thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"This story started out very good and it got really exciting and then it was like the author went out to lunch and never came back. Total disappointment! The ending was so stupid, that when the tape was finished after all the hours of listening, I kept thinking somewhere I missed something. James Patterson could have and would have had a much better ending then this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea Horribly Executed","review":"This was my first, and probably last, Koontz novel. While the premise was interesting and the plot fairly well put together (enough so to merit the 1 star), the overblown, purple prose and inconceivable dialog only served to accentuate the improbability that characters such as those in this story could ever exist. Especially annoying was the use of unlikely names for so many of the major characters (Enoch, Seraphim, Celestina, Harrison, Bartholomew, Edam, Neddie and Googlie, to name a few). Although the book has adult themes and a few adult scenes, it seems to be written on about a sixth grade reading level, an odd combination. A few S.A.T. vocabulary words have been thrown in to try to raise the bar, but the effort falls short of making the work challenging. On the plus side, the story was compelling enough to keep me reading despite the many grating qualities of the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puhleeeeze!!!!","review":"I either really love or really hate Dean Koontz's books. This one falls into the latter category. It seemed as if the book could have been finished in about half as many pages as he wanted to drag these people all through. From the first, it oozed with a sentimental sugar coating from Agnes' pies, which by the way only served to make me very hungry while I read it. I thought it was a little far out that all these people came together to make this one person suffer. That the villian(I won't name him as it will give a way the best surprise in the book), would be so gullible as to believe the stuff he does makes him more than deserving of his just desserts in the end and I don't mean Agnes' pie either. From the Corner of His Eye reads like a Hallmark Christmas movie of the week. I did not expect something so cutsie from one of the kings of Horror!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback, if then","review":"I usually enjoy Koontz, but this time he blew it. The novel moves much too slowly and with one excepton, his characters are one dimentional, either all bad (irritating is a better word) or all good (and irritating). It's a bad thing when one doesn't care who comes out the winner, but with this book, just let it end, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imposter?","review":"FTCOHE is so far removed from his usual excellence that I'm not entirely convinced Koontz wrote it.After *classics* like lightning, dragon tears, strangers...something sure smells fishy. We can only hope dean recovers from this bad patch quickly.Too long, too boring. Missing too many Koontz trademarks (ie: witty character dialogue). Cain is an interesting character, but at 600 + pages even he becomes stagnant. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Luck Next Time","review":"I read the first eight chapters and thought, \\"Yuck!\\" The good characters were so syrupy sweet that I wanted to puke right alongside Enoch Cain. I guess that's why he pushed that perfect wife of his off the tower, right? Anybody out there agree with me?? I continued up to the part where Barty's parents are involved in the car accident. The perfect husband names his son before he dies, and the couple share a 1970ish melodramatic goodbye. Then I put the book down. I talked to a friend, who is also an avid Koontz fan, who told me that the ending was lame. Some reviewers agreed. I'm sorry to be such a harsh critic on this one, but Koontz should have worked on his characters some more. Some reviewers complained that the story was too drawn out. I like long stories, if I care about the characters. Sorry, Koontz. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Ending","review":"The book keeps you going and then in the last few pages he drops the ball and ends the book. Almost like he hit a deadline to publish and finish and just tied it up ridiculous. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos Koontz!","review":"What a great book! This was my first book by Koontz and after reading this I must read more. I couldn't put it down. I just wish that something different happened to the \\"bad guy\\". That's the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read from shocking beginning till end","review":"Koontz was able to shock my socks off in the first twenty-two pages and I was hooked thereafter. I do have to take off one star for a little sub-plot with no conclussion concerning the former gambler and the twins which left me confused. While I admit the climax was anti-climatic as someone else already pointed out and the ending was too rushed, I feel Cain was by far a great villain and this book an otherwise excellent read. It did what the writer wanted and that was to entertain. What else could you hope for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping Page-Turner","review":"Corner... has ascended to my favorite Koontz book to date. It is a maze of intrigue and suspense that ties together in the end. A lot of characters are introduced throughout, but it is done so masterfully.You will absolutely hate the villian, which is the reaction I'm sure Dean Koontz was going for.I've suggested this book to everyone I know who loves suspense, and they have been positively intrigued by it. The downside of a page-turner, is that they are over before you know it.I agree that the antagonist's outcome in the end could have been elaborated on, but I let that slide.Helluva tale, Koontz! It taps a myriad of emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Another disappointment! I'm a huge Koontz fan but this book is making me believe he really is off his game. Not as bad as his \\"Odd\\" comic books mind you. Big build up and everyone peters out. He makes this undeniable case the bad guy is not evil but truly insane before the good guys torture him. So much potential to build around the kids and their gifts but we spend two thirds of the book in the mind of a madman. This book didn't need to be 730 pages long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from his usual but WONDERFUL","review":"This book is very different from the typical Dean Koontz books, but I loved it. I loved the characters that Mr. Koontz chose and look forward to another book of this type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book PLEASE!","review":"I am so thrilled with this book, I think I will even read it again very soon. I love the way all the lives of these exceptional people intertwine to form such a captivating story. The only setback to this story is that the ending is kind of rushed. All the characters are extraordinary. Koontz skips so many years at the end, I was left wondering what interesting incidents happened during these years. This is a real page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW TO RUIN A GOOD BOOK","review":"This book held my interest until the last hundred pages. I did suspect it was getting a little wacko when the kid walked in the rain and didn't get wet. Well, it got worse. This was the first book I read by Koontz and won't go for another. Is there an error on page 603? Thought it should say \\"vow of poverty\\" not \\"vow of property.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Dean Koontz's Standard","review":"I give Dean Koontz credit for taking on new ground in this book about quantum mechanics theory, but the story doesn't really work overall. Some of my ojections are the extended time frame and number of characters, all of which are either too evil or good to seem real, and tragedies that seem contrived only to maximize emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"well...","review":"At first, this book seemed great! A little boy-genius who has amazing abilities, and a foe he'd never heard of, and a little girl with artistic talents.Unfortunately, Koontz did a Terrible job in creating this children in a way that would make them believable. Also, the good guys were FAR too good, and seemed faultess, while the bad guy was, well, bad and stupid. He was, however, almost three dimensional, which a lot of authors have difficulty doing(creating \\"bad guys\\" who aren't completely flat).The end of the \\"bad guy\\" was sad, a few hundred pages spent building this character until he seemed practically undefeatable, and one sentence killing him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and torturous","review":"I had a very difficult time keeping myself from throwing this book out. Even with only 30 pages to go I am struggling with finishing it because it is SO AWFUL! The summary on the back of the book is meaningless and it is clear that Mr. Koontz wrote this book with an eventual screenplay in mind... There is so much nonsensical space filler in this book that I have now decided to skip over because I'm tired of reading it. It was really exciting in the middle for about 100 pages... but I'll never ever ever recommend it or read another koontz book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"what climax?","review":"Very strange book indeed. One of my favorite Koontz books was 'Ghost's' and I've been reading him over the years for light hearted topical suspense.This is what happened to me w/ this book... I got to the *cherished* climactic end -- and had little idea I was there! Reason? Uneven pacing, benign characters, and a goody-two shoes plot line that finally numbed me. I actually got to the end, saw 'author's note' and realized I had just cruised thru the last chapter. But truly, the last chapter, last paragraph could have been re-written half way through the darn book with out to much effort. Generic, oft-repeated lines of thought, and a lack of a closure or final \\"Oh -yeah.. ah-hah!\\" that we usually get.I like you Dean, but let's get back to basics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're bored...","review":"This book was good, but nowhere near his best. The main \\"bad guy\\" of the book is linked psychologically to the main \\"good guy\\" somehow. Bartholomew, the \\"good guy\\", and his girl friend Angel, another \\"good guy\\", have strange abilities. Basically, it's good vs. evil on a strange scale, but predictable. When you discover their abilities, you can predict the outcome. I finished the book because I was bored, not because I wanted to read it. I had no other book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum: Koontz makes haste slowly.","review":"Koontz takes well over one-fourth of the book's 600 plus pages just to set the opening scene (dozens of pages alone for the car crash, Barty's birth and hospital stay) which led me to wonder how he was ever going to get to the end of the week, let alone Barty's thirteenth birthday. Despite being a long-time Koontz reader, I felt a lot of the suspense and disbelief I experienced was more about Koontz's glacial pacing than about the story. Koontz seemed to realize how long the project was getting and sped things up about 300 pages into the book but not for the better since the climactic encounter with the villain and our saintly heroes occurs 600 pages in and lasts for only a couple of paragraphs. That's it! The whole point of the book - the encounter between good and evil - and its over in a blink and a push! I feel Koontz just started typing without a real goal in mind until he neared his 600 page contract requirement and decided to wrap things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"It's undeniably boring book. I usually don't read Koontz for exception of Watchers that I have read some time ago. There's a certain qualities you expect and don't expect from the book of this caliber. Indeed one can't anticipate it to be a classical kind of literature but rather good easy sort of reading that keeps your attention to the very end. Not so with this book. This book is BORING, characters are either sugary good, or bad evils. The story plot is slow if not to say the least. There's a praise that publishers sometimes put in the very beginning of the book. According to its (book) own praise from USA TODAY: \\"Koontz tries to create serious literature. He largely succeeds with From the corner of his eye\\". I mean, why would anyone tried to \\"create serious literature\\" if he was doing fine with easy good thriller , at least as I remember from funny but highly entertainable Watchers. The author isn't good with serious literature he's horrible with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Having trouble finishing","review":"I love Dean Koontz novels, but I am having a problem with this one.I don't know if I will finish.

Koontz), I have to say that this ranks among his best. Koontz has had a tendency of late to become a bit lazy and fall back on tried and true formulas (an innocent taking on a nefarious government secret plot, et. al.). This story breaks form with his prior efforts, branching off into new and very welcome territory.His villian Enoch (Junior) Cain is among the best characters Koontz has ever created. And he takes us so effortlessly into the mind of this madman, creating a twisted logic for his every action, that you end up almost feeling sorry for this psycho. (I said \\"almost.\\")On the downside, the book could have done with a little judicious editing. Cutting by 75-100 pages would have picked up the pace just enough to make this effort truly sing. But it's well worth the read as is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dizzying Tall Tale!","review":"Once again we are face to face with the master who has made suspense his trademark, and has blurred the line between fiction and reality.His characters have become my instant friends; his prose, my standard poetry.

The way all of the lives of the people intertwined seamlessly really captured me and the secrets that lie in \\"other worlds\\" made me think and view the world around me in a different way.Was disappointed that Junior Cain was dealt with to what seemed to me as \\"easily\\" ........ Didn't feel the characters were too good or insipid.Way different to most other Koontz I've read but extremely enjoyable. Would be interesting to see the life and discoveries of young Mary Lampion in a sequel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"I've read many Dean Koontz novels, and this one is, so far, my favorite. Not typical Koontz \\"horror\\" but still infused with elements of science and spirituality. Lots of the quirky Koontz humor I love, and also a very heartwarming story. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"this is a brand new book . it's exactly perfect as if never even been opened. I am very pleased with my purchase at such an incredible price. also I got it very fast. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"As with most authors, Dean Koontz pretty much sticks to the same types of story plots. But this one was a little different. When I started this book I couldn't put it down. It has a great story plot with a heart warming ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Koontz book to keep you glued.","review":"He has done it again. This book was another great Koontzbook. The only reason it lost a star from me was becausetoward the end, it started to lose something. I can't quiteput my finger on it, but the ending came and went too fast (inparticular with the Cain character). Aside from that however,I recommend this to every Koontz fan as you won't bedisappointed. I have read almost every book of his and this iscertainly up there with the best. I want to know where he getshis imagination from!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not scary... still cool.","review":"Many people grab up Dean Koontz's books because they're scary. This one's different... but try it, you might like it.\\"From the Corner of His Eye\\" begins as parallel stories. In one, Agnes Lampion gives birth to a prodigy son, Bartholemew. In another, Junior Cane pushes his wife off a fire tower. In a third, Seraphim White conceals a rape and resultant pregnancy.Soon, the stories and their many characters are interwoven, and miracles begin to happen. It's an engaging, entertaining read, with very likeable good guys. The bad guy is a bit underdeveloped, which is too bad. Ultimately, though, the story isn't about him (even though this may be what we started reading the book for). Rather, this is an other-worldly tale of love and hope.The audio performance by Stephen Lang is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the corner of his eye","review":"This book was spectacular and I highly recommend it. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable story, bad ending","review":"I have read several Dean Koontz books and have always liked them. Therefore, when a friend lent me this audiobook, I was anticipating a good story, although I was somewhat unnerved by the length of the book. The plot was absorbing and the descriptive words Koontz used were great. I was eagerly anticipating the revenge of detective Tom Vinadium (sp?) and the demise of Junior Cane, and could not have been more disappointed in the way Koontz resolved this. After it happened, I thought, that's IT? After the length of the book and the detail Koontz goes into throughout the book, I thought the resolution would be extremely satisfying. I was completely let down. I would have liked to see/hear Junior's reaction, but there was nothing. I felt like I had wasted all that time listening to the book for nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Amazing","review":"I read this book many years ago and it is still my favorite. It is one of those rare books that really sticks with you. An amazing read that takes you out of your comfort zone and introduces you to \\"possibilities\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was the first dean Koontz book I purchased, and one of the best stories I've read of his. Great charactors, and story line, and fantastic ending that brought me to the edge of tears. I've since read 8 and am on my 9th Dean koontz title, and I must say that From the Corner of His Eye ranks amoung the best I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading...Until the End","review":"I have to agree with Justin regarding the ending of this book...disappointing what happened to Cain. I thought, at least, in the final pages, we would see what actually became of him. I won't go into great detail about the book because the others have done so, wonderfully, but I just couldn't put it down. It was definitely a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Very Intriguing and Well Crafted","review":"This was an excellent book. While it did have the supernatural side to it, it wasn't overblown and turned into a total science fiction novel. It had several plotlines going at the same time but it wasnt too confusing and they all tied neatly together at the end. This book does have a good sensitive side to it as well. I particularly like the Vanadium character. I found the scene regarding his patience waiting for Jr Cain in the hospital at the beginning to be very clever and provocative."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the corner of his eye","review":"This is definitely not one of Koontz's better books. It is long and drawn out and is difficult to follow. He jumps back and forth from one character to the next. One of his characters in the book you don't even hear about until 25 chapters later after her birth. He should stick to what he does best; horror.Definitely not his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Separate Lives with One Connecting Force","review":"In Bright Beach, California, Agnes Lampion holds her newborn son Bartholemew. Even though she has just experienced a terrible tragedy, her son will give her the will to go on. In San Francisco, Celestina White watches her sister die in childbirth. She vows to hate the baby, which was conceived during a brutal rape, but her sister's last words inspire her to raise the baby as her own. In Eugene, Oregon, a killer decides upon an evil mission to dedicate his life to. Unbeknownst to any of them, they are somehow connected and will all come together with a new understanding of themselves and the world around them.As usual, Dean Koontz creates strong and complex characters. His tale of tragedy, human compassion, and inspiration is well written and excellently paced. Although I would not consider this book one of my all-time favorites, I would definitely pick it up and enjoy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrill Kill","review":"From The Corner Of His eye, is a novel of suspense and intrigue. It holds you in a grip of both fear, terror, and ultimately compassion. It is a story worth reading,with its never ending plots of dangerous twists and turns, Dean Koontz will leave you breathless and inevitably wanting his next novel. However, the mysterious ending of the novel, prevented me from giving the novel the full five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my taste for suspense...","review":"This summer I planned to catch up on my mindless, suspense novel reading however, after this book I believe I may take on mindless, romance novels instead. I haven't read a Koontz book since high school, and I recall being thoroughly absorbed from start to finish with those books I read. Although this book is quite enthralling for about 200 or so pages,it ends with complete failure to really amaze me. The only reason I completed it was to find out the \\"whys and hows\\" and if the bad guy gets the awful fate he deserves. I should have skipped right to the end so I could get my answers, put the book down and start on something else. I don't reccommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Corner?","review":"I haven't read Dean Koontz in a very long time and now I know why. I don't understand how this book received such great reviews.

Yahoo..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears of boredom in the corners of my eyes.......","review":"I have read many Koontz books over the years, and this is by far his worst. Read all of the bad reviews here and you'll get the message. It's amazing that from the author of a great book like Watchers comes this dribble. If you insist on reading this book, skip every third paragraph, the entire middle, and the end...you won't miss a thing !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are all his books like this","review":"Being a big history buff, my reading had previously been limited to that Genre. Recently, I have expanded to mysteries, fiction etc. Love Grisham's books, including Painted House...M.Connelly books were good. Decided to try this book... I can't wait til it's over...I feel I am finishing just to see if it somehow comes together. Is this an abberation for him or are they all like this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinlein reborn","review":"Just as little Barty could not get enough of Robert Heinlein, this book is somehow reminescent of some of Heinlein's work, especially in the melding of several families such as in Stranger in a Strange Land.

The character developement, and plot were great up to a point. The ending was horribly anticlimactic and juvenille. Pitiful. I feel violated having had such high hopes!Bits and pieces of greatness with no real cohesion. Several minor characters and sub-plots were brought together, but not masterfully. Food for thought without the follow-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me the good old days of Koontz","review":"I agree with the folks who found this book disappointing. I have read every Koontz there is. Even the pen name Koontz and they were ever so much better. I would have enjoyed re-reading \\"Whispers\\" or \\"Watchers\\" or any other than this. Keep this book out of the front of your eyes, better yet..... don't even open the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The King of letdown endings","review":"As always, Mr. Koontz spins a fascinating tale that keeps you glued to the pages until the very anticlimatic ending when you close the book and say; \\"Did I really just read 600+ pages for THAT?\\" My advice, as with any Dean Koontz novel, is to enjoy the story, but stop just before the ending, and use your own imagination to decide how it turns out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something??","review":"This book was a major letdown. The characters are diverse to the point of being ridiculous, and equally unreal. The antagonist (Junior) was impish and his ultimate demise (really...i'm not giving anything away here...Koontz's entire antagonists line-up all end up on the losing end) was a colossal letdown. It's time Koontz stop churning out cookie cutter novels and take some time to write a decent book, like his book Lightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"If there was a compelling story here, I missed it. The quoted reviews must have been written by folks who didn't read this one.

I don't usually read books twice, but I will read this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I looked at the other reviews and I was quite surprised. This book was the first one I picked up probably since high school... was never much of a reader. But this book got me back into it. (I've read several since.) I hadn't read a book (besides Hop On Pop) in such a long time that I found it very refreshing. I enjoyed this book a great deal. Sure, I've since read better, but I'd still recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Okay, I've read a handful of Koontz's books, (really loved Twilight Eyes), and my biggest complaint is that he never kills the main character. (If he has, I must have missed that book) Anyway, this book is so confused. The main \\"evil person\\" races through the book to meet his nemesis, and then disappears after swapping about two sentences with him, and it's not even at the hands of his nemesis. Huh? And the book is only 3/4 over. You've still got more to read. I must have missed the point of this whole endeavor. Not only do I not recommend this book, but I've yet to meet somebody that does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have cut out 100 pages without losing anything","review":"Well, I have been a fan of Dean Koontz since I picked up \\"Dragon Tears\\" in an airport bookstore and couldn't put it down. However, this book was a definite disappointment. I neither despised the villian, Enoch Cain, nor liked the heroes, and by page 300 or so, I was willing to shoot Bartholomew myself just to put an end to the story. Koontz suddenly (and unbelievably) brings back Thomas Vanadium after killing him off early in the book, and dispensed with the villain in a couple of paragraphs (making him about the weakest bad guy I've ever seen). The significance of Bartholomew's being able to walk into other parallel worlds was never explained (other than some vague references to quantum physics), and the reasons for Junior's evil nature never become apparent. I'm definitely going to get his next book out of the library and then decide if I want to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Wisconsin","review":"I as a long time reader of Mr.Koontz,was very disappointed in this latest novel. To be frank, I was bored. It simply doesn't live up to Mr. Koontz past achievements. I can not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danielle Steel meets Dean Koontz","review":"This is garbage. Dean, when you run out of things to write, take a vacation or something.This is a cross between Koontz's own Intensity (Junior Cain is a rip-off of the lead in Intensity) and a sappy, disgusting Danielle Steel novel. Koontz, who I considered one of my favorite authors before this piece of junk, bit off a little bit more than he could chew here. He babbles on about \\"other worlds\\" and parallel universes, and the characters he employs are obnoxious and annoying. The only reason I gave this two stars was that the reader (audiobook) did a decent job considering the crap he was given. I wondered throughout the book whether the reader had to break from time to time to just laugh at how ridiculous this book really is.This would be the worst book I ever read if it weren't for James Patterson's First to Die, which was just Godawful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great","review":"Koontz is still the master. However, either he is letting down or I am getting too used to his style. Of course It held me spell bound and I could not put it down. But like a Chinese meal a few hours later I was hungry again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each one was a good read!","review":"I usually don't go for short stories, but I must say that I was really impressed with Ms. Connolly's book.

I even enjoy philosophical rantings when they have a point. However, I found this text to have little to no substance. The thoughts were deep but seemed to be more self serving of the author than to have a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with an interesting premise but doesn't deliver","review":"I like Ogilvy's premise that we should stop striving toward a distant Goal and be more artful about the small details of living. Unfortunately, though, most of the book goes off the deep end into unreadable philosophical abstractions (\\"Narcissism Degree Zero,\\" \\"Semiotics and Sublimation\\"). Most readable are the stories about real lives -- the author's, Howard Hughes's, Lila's, Spike's. If you're interested in this topic, your time is better spent reading Julia Cameron's THE ARTIST'S WAY or Thomas More's THE SOUL OF SEX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In today's pace driven world, I was looking forward to a little respite in James Ogilvy's book. Unfortunetely, it didn't deliver for me. What suggests to be a guide to finding creativity and fulfillment, ends up being nothing more than the author's sterile philosophical rantings. Actually, I don't know how it ended since I only made it through half the book. I would have liked less history and more \\"evidence\\" or anecdotes from the author's life that promote this way of living. Ogilvy wants to sell us on \\"goallessness\\", but doesn't offer any kind of convincing argument. Too bad, since I would tend to agree with this point of view!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title","review":"I was very excited when this book came out back twelve years ago.

The facts based upon research and experience are overwhelming. The only successful treatment for a true alcoholic is total abstinence from alcohol. Barrett offers his readers a false hope that further experimentation at \\"controlled drinking\\" will bring different results than in the past. The worst part of offering such false hopes to those in the throes of addiction is that in their desperate state the wishful thinking contained in this tome prolongs their agony and makes a potentially perilous outcome of their situation even more possible. Time and again it has been proven by experience that \\"rational\\" recovery is a pipe dream. Carl Jung's theory of the need of a \`psychic change' or \`spiritual awakening' to break the cycle of addiction still stands and is proven by thousands each year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"Easier/Softer Way \\" Book","review":"I began reading this book several years ago just as my problem drinking crossed the line into full blown alcoholism.

One who had read it and was still drinking unsuccessfully. All it did for ME was set me up for another failed attempt at quitting on my own.

First off, these guys have a sound that is so evil, it's beyond trying to describe. I mean, some parts of songs really freak me out. There's such an evil atmosphere to their recordings, only Hate Eternal's I,Monarch, comes to mind as anything I can compare to the releases of Drawn And Quartered.Needless to say, this has become what I think is 'the' intro to this band.

It marks the start of the Coen brother's lost period after the promising debut they made with Blood Simple, followed by Raising Arizona. The Hudsucker Proxy, which tells the story of how board members at a leading firm attempt to put an imbecile into the presidency so the stock will fall and they can buy it up on the cheap, followed Barton Fink, one of the worst films I have ever seen. The dialogue is unconvincing, the characters are boring, and the wretched movie just drags on and on through a valley of cliches.

I did a lot of research before I bought this TV and narrowed my choice to the Sharp or the Samsung.

The problem was, however, that Samsung had just come out with their new 4661-5 models. I decided it was not worth the extra $$ for an extra HDMI port as I'm only using one now and probably won't need three. I am running my Bose 3-2-1 through my cable box and the sound is great and I'm down to only two remotes LOL. Hi def broadcasting is beautiful but the regular programs can be a little grainy but I'm sure that will improve as more programs are put out in Hi def.

As many people, I did extensive research and was debating between Sony Bravia XBR and this TV. We saw both at Best Buy and it was rather difficult to choose by just looking at the images on the screens. What made us choose this TV was 1. better reviews for this model, 2. better price and 3. more features (like PIP) in Samsung vs. Sony. Once you get the TV from the store to your house and compare what you see on HDTV to your old regular TV, it is absolutely amazing. I also love the fact that I can hook up my PC to this TV. I don't like the regular VGA port designed for PCs in this TV and rather use the HDMI connection.

So, we decided to take it out and see what is going on. When we tried to lift it, the bottom of the stand broke by its own weight. Since it is still under warrenty, I called the customer service to try to get it repaired. I cannot believe what I heard? They said this is physical damage and it is not covered by the warrenty. I don't know how they can have such an unreasonable rule. Is it that Samsung did not make a good stand, so they purposely exclude such problems. My recommendation is, be aware of the warrety trick and the potential of weak construct (or just bad luck).

The Sharp Aquos was the other option, I like how it looks but I thought its not worth it to be paranoid with \\"banding\\" issues. I never heard about any negatives with the Samsung and now that I finally got it, it was well worth the wait. Been playing a lot of console games on it such as Gear of Wars on xbox 360.

Obviously, I can't test 1080p, but its a probably a good thing to have for 'future-proofing'. ( I did see a Samsung demo of 1080p on this model...its quite impressive).The native resolution of 1920x1080 also works great for connecting to PC. Movie Picture mode produces great black levels comparable to Plasmas.Advantages -1. Great looking - elegant.2. 1080p with 1980x1080 native resolution.3. Great dynamic contrast ratio - 6000:14. Separate Game mode.5. Great even for SD.6. 8 ms response time7. less expensive than XBR.Disadvantages -1.

What makes a genius writer portray himself through his own works as a \\"...thing writhing in the coffin,\\" as Stoker described Dracula. Isn't there some honor among authors to write to please an established audience. HNITC gives this heretofore avid fan a feeling of betrayal.

It made me wonder about the accuracy of other information.I did enjoy the journal-like quality and variety of writing styles (e.g., essays, lists, scripts, news clips) and diversity of focus for individual pieces (e.g., events, places, people).

Third, its harmonies are often flat wrong (check out \\"Catch a Wave\\" and prepare to be horrified). Fourth, it ignores all vocal parts except the melody, even the most obvious echo lines. Fifth, there's a picture of \\"the Beach Boys\\" on the cover, and Brian isn't included--enough said!

It has a quirk with the sorting of wma drm files. I loaded a drm-ed audiobook onto it with filenames in the form of \\"audobook-##.wma\\", but the files were ordered randomly. It was fairly difficult to find out which file I wanted to play next, because the filename scrolling is poorly designed and incredibly slow at the fastest speed setting.

Once the battery gets to a low point, but not completely drained, the player can be turned on, but the song lists cannot be browsed, and sometimes it can't even be changed to the next song unless paused, but it will still play."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!!!

I bought a jetAudio iAudio U2 1GB player instead and it's awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet deal","review":"If you want a reliable player to jog with, runs on regular batteries, has no hard drive, uses musicmatch to make play lists and is easy to use, then look no more. I've used this one about 5x/week for over a year and it works great. I get about 15 hours per AAA battery and have had no problems with this one. If you like the idea of not having to worry about hard drive failure and battery issues with the iPod, this is a sweet deal. One suggestion, pick up some better earphones to maximize the sound quality of the player."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to use","review":"This is my first mp3 player, so I don't have anything to compare it to ...I find it hard to use.

When attempting a large download \\"sync\\" no matter what I do, whether it be aquiring licenses beforehand, removing files that need conversion, and what not, I still end up either with no files, or at most 8.

I have been considering getting a digital voice recorder, USB storage device, and an MP3 player. This device acts like all of them. I have not had any trouble with the device at all. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it does not support the OGG Vorbis format. (Ogg Vorbis is a fully open, non-proprietary, general-purpose compressed audio format for mid to high quality audio. It is technically superior to MP3.) I copied files without any difficulty. It acts like any other Sandisk memory device, which makes it very easy to use. (In Windows XP, no special drivers to load.) I would not purchase it again because the manufacturer does not appear to have an interest in the OGG Vorbis format."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it....","review":"I got this one as a Christmas gift. It was not my first choice. The sound is clean and clear, you just have to set the equalizer to make it perfect. I have copied several hours of music on mine without issue.

The warranty had just expired and Samsung told me tough luck. One minute were watching tv and the next the screen turns purple and for the past week hasn't changed... just a nice purple screen with a few white lines through it. The techs that came to look at it said the entire panel needed to be replaced but couldn't really explain why. I've now searched the net and found numerous other instances of this issue. Basically the tv that I spent $2,500 on is now worthless. I HIGHLY recommend that you choose another TV... this is a common malfunction.

There is noticeable improvement when you cycle the PS3 from interlaced to progressive, even with a low budget film like TN. 8ms refresh is adequate to capture most of the race scenes with decent crispness. The one thing I am not happy with is the PC controls only correspond to the VGA input and are not configurable w/ HDMI, which my PC has!

Check out Amazon's post-order price guarantee if you are not already familiar with it.If you want to hook up a PC to it, you have to go with a VGA cable. Using a DVI-to-HDMI cable is probably going to drive you crazy (overscan vs panning). Maybe with a different graphics board/driver... VGA looks fine.

The PQ rivals expensive Sony sets, and I much prefer the look of these to those other brands. The only \\"issue\\" I have with the TV is the lack of overscan control over HDMI ... when using the PC over HDMI, it clips an inch or so around the border, making it difficult to recover maximized windows or even use the Start bar. There is probably a firmware update available for this, and if so, I would definitely give this thing 5 stars. There is no overscan over VGA though, so I can live with an analog PC connection for now. Chances are, if you do even a little research, you'll conclude that this set is the best bang for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"Finally Upgraded to HD and wanted to future proof with 2 HDMI inputs and 1080p.

I was called on a Friday to have delivery scheduled for the following Tuesday (Between 1-5PM). The delivery driver called about 15 minutes before arriving to make sure I could still be there. Like others, the reason for the 4 stars is due to sound quality. However, 90% of the time I use different speakers so it is not an issue. I would also recommend adjusting the energy savings level as soon as you get the TV. I put mine on low (standard is High) and it makes a huge difference for brightness. The price dropped about $70 after I bought it but Amazon credited me the difference when I e-mailed them. I don't have cable, but am using standard rabbit ears to get a great digital signal.

Happily, Crossing California did not disappoint me. Langer effectively created an ensemble of diverse and compelling and-- with the exception of the Rovner women and Muley's father--sympathetic characters. (Although Larry Rovner was, in my opinion, the funniest character in the novel.) I particularly liked the evolution of Michelle Wasserstrom--from a relatively unsympathetic girl going nowhere into someone who, while quite jaded, has acquired a sense of direction in her life. Since many of the characters were going through adolescence, a time where we let go of much of our innocence, it was very effective for Langer to set this story from 1979 to 1981 which, as others have already noted, can be considered the figurative end of the idealism of the sixties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant???","review":"This is just a terrible book...nothing good to say about any of the characters with the possible exception of Muley.

It has a shoved down your throat style that never finds relief; nothing lightens and nothing is redeemable here; and it's too thick with Jewish ethnicity. Not to say there is anything wrong with that, it's just that here, it comes off as too much of an \\"inside club\\". I mean, I felt like I had to borrow a yarmulke to continue reading. (maybe that would have helped, though)This book did nothing for me; I didn't mind the cultural aspects, the political climate of the times; but all in all, the story virtually goes nowhere. The characters come off as flat & two dimensional, and the doing away with punctuation in the dialogue was bothersome. Obviously, the author has friends at the publisher he's with. His writing is so predictable and he has nothing new or refreshing to say like so many writers out there.For my time and money, give me David Sedaris, or George Carlin's latest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Is Not From Chicago!","review":"Interesting how the liner notes state that the author grew up in Chicago in the neighborhood where the book takes place -- west rogers park. If so, how did he go to middle school in Evanston and graduate from Evanston Township High School in 1984? Just check the 1984 yearbook! Either he is lying or his family owes the Evanston school system a boatload of money for the free suburban education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not California, but Chicago","review":"I'll wager many will buy this book thinking it's going to be about California. Not. It's set in Chicago. But I'll also wager that they won't regret their purchase. Adam Langer's book is epic in its sprawl and its sometimes insane attention to detail and the minutiae of his characters' lives, but it spans a period of only 2-3 years (1979 - 1981). Focusing primarily on the members of 3 families who live on one side or another of California Ave, the street that divides a Jewish neighborhood into those of the upper middle class from those of the mostly working class, the book allows us to see all aspects of that important time in America's 20th century through the eyes of a group of teenagers who come together, drift apart, and come together again in a different mix.Really, really, really, really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more","review":"As a native Chicago suburbanite, I believe this book does portray the late-70s there quite well. As an avid and experienced reader, by about page 390 it dawned on me that the book had become shallow and even quite vulgar.

After getting the watch and quickly learning the functions I was very excited. The HR monitor function worked great for a couple of weeks, however, after a short time it took the watch increasing amounts of time to find and display my Heart rate. After one recent work out, the watch did not find the signal from the monitor until my work out was over - it beeped to tell me I was below my target heart rate. I mean at least that function worked...right? OK, long story short - I had to replace the batteries in the monitor itself twice within a period of 2 weeks. I think I might have just gotten a dud, but I am not willing to try the product again. In my frustration I returned the item. Not recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"The watch is easy to use and navigate. I use all settings except the programmable workout, I prefer to use the review function and look at the heart rate for each segment for which I hit the split/lap button which is a fantastic feature. The only difficulty I ran into was using the heart rate monitor in the cold. Without a good sweat and contact between your chest and the monitor, such as can happen when running in the cold (below 20*F in my experience) the monitor is unable to pick up heart rate accurately. However, I would fully expect this same thing to occur with any monitor. I have run into the odd problem of the watch spontaneously reverting to factory presets. Not only is this annoying but it makes for an unreliable alarm which I used my previous watch for."},{"rating":"1","title":"great functions, low quality","review":"The funtionality is really great.

However, after reading up in the training manual and strapping it on for my first workout, I noticed strange behavior; it read my resting heart rate spot on, but after starting my workout, it kept reading significantly low rates for the first half hour of the workout. It was like it kept \\"creeping up\\" on my heart rate. 15 minutes into the exercise, I should have been low 120's and it was still in the 80's and climbing. Towards the end of the workout it finally peaked over 160, and stayed there, when it should have been 130's to 140's. Strange! I thought maybe it was calibrating itself, but it did the same thing the next time out. Definitely a problem with it. I turned it back in, and decided to get a Suunto T4C HRM...much nicer IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"This was a very disappointing purchase. First one I received read way too high on my first run (30-40 bpm above normal). I called Timex and they sent out a replacement chest strap which they said they would test before sending. This read way too low. I sent both back to Amazon and received a replacement the next day. It also read way too low. Gave up and sent it back for a refund. I've had Timexes before and they worked well. This model just doesn't seem to have the same reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Watch, Good Price","review":"Ok, I have been looking at these for a while and I have to say for the money this thing is probably one of the best options.In terms of functionality you'll get more bells & whistles then you will probably need.

I had the previous model of this Timex and it worked great, until I broke it on accident. I thought this would be better because it's a newer model. I disregarded the previous reviews and thought they must have gotten the bad batches. I tried it once I got it, and I couldn't get a heart beat for the whole entire time I worked out. 45-minutes of cardio is long enough to get some kind of reading. I lost my trust on Timex that day. Good thing I tested it right away, I was able to return it to Amazon, with no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I needed and more","review":"Excellent product. My first HRM and I am more than satisfied. It has really helped my training as I was kind of a naysayer to these before I got one.

I just checked out Jabra's web site and they have the same product listed as \\"support headset and handsfree profiles\\".

Not only is it wireless (no more cords to get entabled with!), it is also very ergonomic (just slip it over your ear, and let it hang naturally). When connected to my SonyEricsson T68i, it is unbeatable. Press one button on the headset, and then speak your voice command over the phone, and now you are making calls. Also, unlike some of the other boom-type headsets, I don't have to worry about the mouth piece getting caught, and abruptly pulling the headset off.Drawbacks? Hardly any that would compromise the good. It does catch a lot of wind noise, making it hard to make calls is slightly breezy conditions.I hightly recommend this for anyone who has a SonyEricsson, bluetooth-enabled phone.

It says it has a range of up to 30ft, but at 5ft it lost signal. The sound quality was good, but without the constant fear of losing signal, I couldn't justify the cost of a wireless headset.

The reception was totally unpredictable and would one moment be fine and the next be inaudible for no apparent reason.The only good thing about this headset how comfortable it was, but it hardly made up for its defects.

The lead female is supposed to be an educated professional woman. However, she has no problem at all that the so called hero at the end of the book tells her that all of his unusual behavior is because he is a government secret agent and everything is just fine.

It's an interesting blend of fiction and non-fiction. The real-life math sidebars demonstrate how scientists and others use math in their work. There is a cute story around which math facts are presented. The book's \\"Math fairy\\" who goes by the name of Nora, is a memorable character with much enthusiasm for her subject. The concepts are not delved into deeply, but there is enough there to give the reader a clear idea when topics such as symmetry, probability, and moebius strips are discussed.

I will not buy another sandisk mp3."},{"rating":"2","title":"mp3 player","review":"For the price this player is well worth it.Very easy to download music. Sound quality great.Some disadvantages: no seperate folders for files, with the small round button to adjust volume & change to next song with the same button, you don't always do what you intended to, while running or biking.The fm radio does not pick up all local stations in our area for some reason.I would recommend this product for anyone wanting an inexpensive mp3 player for music while excercising, arm band works great, there is no clip included for clipping onto clothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice","review":"An earlier reviewer mentioned that his mp3 player freezes. Mine not only froze, but sometimes turned itself on and off for no reason. This happened from the moment I took it out of the box. Then I downloaded some music and everything seemed fine ... until I tried to download more music and was told my disk was full. This seemed odd, since I only had about eight songs on the player. I deleted all the files and tried to start from scratch, but the player continued to tell me that my disk was full. This mp3 player has been a headache since the moment I received it. Suddenly the reasonable price made sense. The manual that comes with the player also leaves a lot to be desired. My advice? Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent device, horrible service","review":"After only six hours the earphones stopped working. Serveral days of emailing tech support later, SanDisk refuses to send a replacemnet. The display screen is also slow to display. It has no alternative means of power (like an AC adaptor). The radio receiver is a nice addition. The included arm strap is fairly useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome MP3 player. A++++++++++","review":"This is the greatest MP3 player. It is so simple to use it. I have windows XP and all I did was plug the mp3 player to my usb port and BAM!. A File opens. Then the next part is to drag the mp3 into the file and you have beats. It hold alot of songs to. It comes with a strap to go around your arm, which is key while working out. I give it 5 stars. I also put all my family and friends so they can get one. Plus the price is right.Lets Go J-E-T-S"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a month or so....","review":"This player worked great at first except for the occasional skipping. Now, I have to push the head phone plug in and hold it down for me to be able to hear any music. At first, I thought it might be my headphones but after trying 3 other pair...now I know it's the player. I don't recommend the Sandisk MP3 players to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great out of the box","review":"It's great out of the box. You can use it with minimal studying. Loading files is easy.My only complaint is that for some reason the files play out of order, and the player is not set to shuffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"not buying another one","review":"This was the first mp3 player I've used, so I can't say much about the ease of use. I found it hard to find my spot on my audio books, but maybe they are all like that. I thought it sounded great, but maybe they all do.Problem with it was that after only a few weeks, it started having trouble with the earphone connection. I lost it, and looking for a new one,so I can't say how much worse it would have goten, or how long it would have lasted, but I won't be buying another to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"SanDisk 256","review":"My daughter loves it, she is happier than a fish in the water.

That was my first mistake. Sound quality is horrible, controls are confusing to say the least and the user manual is a joke. Got it on a Tuesday and shipped it back on a Wednesday. My suggestion would be to pay more for a quality player because quality is not what you will find here."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I only used this thing about 5 times, just sitting at my desk at work.

Nice radio though-----","review":"I received this unit last week and I havent listend to more than one song, the unit freezes and the battery has to be replaced to get it working again.

Don't try and put a folder in it... don't try to overwrite a file... don't try to do anything more than deleting or adding normal files to the root directory or you'll have to keep restarting the player... luckily under windows xp you don't have to restart your whole computer...I really hope that sandisk plans on making a firmware update for this baby so it works correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"This is my first mp3 player and I love it. I was a little worried at first that I wouldn't be able to use it, because I'm no computer expert,but within 10 minutes of getting itout of the package I had music downloaded and playing!!!!!! The set up sheet provided with the player is very brief but gave me all the information I needed to get started. The sandisk website has full instructions on how to use this player, which I have found very useful.I'm not a great music expert but the quality of the music sounds great to me. I use the player at the gym and it is so lightweight on my arm I barely notice its there.I would recommend this player to everyone, its so small and compact its hard to believe so much music can fit into it, and the price is excellent compared to other MP3 players I've seen around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasts forever!","review":"I've had this little unit for a couple of years now. I've had no problems. I use rechargeable AAA batteries which last for quite a while in here.Sometimes I wish this this little unit wasn't so durable; I run and bike with it in my pocket and I carry it around in a backpack that gets thrown around. It still plays great and has no cracks or problems other than a few scratches. If it didn't last so long, I could buy a newer, cooler unit with more features and more memory.That's not to say this doesn't have enough memory. I've never really felt like it doesn't have enough space. I carry over 10 hours of spoken word (high compression - don't need the quality for speech). I still have room for 2 or 3 dozen high quality songs.The only complaint I have is that the voice recorder records in wav format, so you can only record about 15 minutes IF you have nothing else in the player. You can't really use it to record lectures or speeches."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product n service","review":"I was a little sceptical when I read other reviews regarding the battery life,but the product works just fine.Even the sound quality is pretty decent.The service is very fast,got it within a few days ! All in all,I think its a good return for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value; small, easy design","review":"Small design is easily kept out of the way.Comes with a good arm-bandStores enough music for workouts/bike rides, etc.Setup is easy to use (this is our first MP3).Durable (stands up to our 4 year old).I like the fact that it has an FM radio. This is a great feature! If your not able to constantly update your music, you can switch to radio and not be bored during your workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice little player at a nice price","review":"I bought this for my daughter who really likes it.Software interface and controls are pretty easy to learn & use.FM radio is excellent as well as the unit's sound.If I had the opportunity to do this over, I would have bought the 500k or 1mb even though this one holds quite bit of music in WMA format.All in all, I'd do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use!","review":"This is my very first MP3 player. I mainly got it to use when I got out walking. It was VERY easy to use! I plugged right in and loaded a playlist from my Win Media Player. Did not need the instruction booklet! Very user friendly. Not overly fond of the head phones but those are easy to replace. Plenty of memory for those long mileage walks. The sports band is comfortable. Would definitely recommend. In fact I think I might buy a second one for my 13 year old son for his birthday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!!! This is a Nice 1!!","review":"Wow!!! I just bought the Sandisk 256mb mp3player and wow.It was so easy to use. all i did was plug it into my windows98 computer and it automatically it opened a folder for it. all i had to do was drag and drop. With the USB2.0 cable it has it is very fast in transfering the files. I would recomened this to any first time buyers of mp3's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 player for first timer...","review":"This is my first MP3 player. I have looked in several stores and websites to check prices. For this size player, I find it stores roughly around 120 songs depending on size of file. (.wma) The headphones are not the best but will do in a pinch. The color is great and although the case is plastic, it helps to keep the player from getting scratched. The sound, look, and feel are all 5 stars with me. My main complaint at first is the fact that their manual is on CD and their quick start guide sucks. If you know how to use your computer to download to other devices then you shouldn't have a problem setting up. It took me a bit but I'm a happy camper now. I also want to say that based on price and s/h. I couldn't touch an MP3 player of this quality and for this price. Thanks Amazon.com!!!! I used the free s/h...however it really tests your patience if you're in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF THE FIRMWARE UPDATE !","review":"IMPORTANT UPDATE !I just tried to update the firmware as described in their webpage and the player went totally DEAD ! Don\`t do it ! I am waiting for a response from customer service.Old review:This player will not play audible files and doesn\`t have a bookmark function, making it pretty much useless as an audiobook player. The resume function is only useful if you don\`t change the file. If you stop the book from playing and listen to a song, you loose the resume and it goes back to the beginning.Navigation is also a nightmare. I also have an old Rio 600 which is ten times better in terms of navigation.Otherwise, the sound is good and it is an ok player for those who only want to listen to some mp3s."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 months were great...now not so much","review":"I really enjoyed this player while working out at the gym for about 2 months, now it won't play WMAs at all. It just skips them or refuses to go into play mode. I spent a few days at the gym just fiddling with the stupid thing. I have tried formatting it, changing the batteries, changing settings...it just will not work. I would recommend trying something different from the Sandisk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Lover","review":"This is a great little Player.I had it up and running within minutes. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the fact is you are pretty much on your own in figuring out how to use it. The Manual offers little information if any. The sound is decent and I did try the earbuds that came with it. If you are not looking to store a lot of music this is worth $60."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little player","review":"Tiny, light and works as advertised.I originally bought this to play birdsongs and animal calls through external speakers (it will hold about three CDs worth of material), but now I wear it every day at work to listen to the radio.It is easy to use and sounds good, big screen for its size, my only complaint is the battery life - I get less than half the advertised life when using the radio. Time to invest in rechargables!Steve"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"This device has been problematic since out of the box. It has required frequent re-formatting to play any MP3 files. The display is unreliable and troublesome to navigate...when it works at all.

I could get it to do what I wanted it to do, but only after a struggle, and even then it seemed to work by accident. After a few hours' use, it stopped accepting new songs. (No, it was not full). My computer simply gave me a message that the device I was trying to write to is defective. It is worthless.

Overall it was great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ich bin ein Berliner","review":"Ignatieff has written a wonderfully warm and captivating biography of this Jewish public intellectual who occupied a place certainly as prominent in England as Walter Lippman did here or Raymond Aron in France. The reader should be familiar with the \\"The Hedgehog and the Fox,\\" if not some of Berlin's other essays, and have heard at least one of Berlin's BBC broadcasts. Ignatieff can do little more than allude to these as he traces Berlin's complicated relationship to his Russian homeland, to England, to Zionism, to the United States and with his wide circle of friendship with the best and the brightest that each of them had to offer. Why is this book such a pleasure? I think it a combination of Ignatieff's felicitous style and compendious research, together with Berlin's wise observations, his humor, and, above all, his remarkable, if self-centered, modesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"a biography of one of the great historians of ideas","review":"Ignatief has done a fine job here in detailing not simply the life of Berlin but in actually digging into his past to provide insight into the biographical context of many of his views. Ignatief explains that Berlin's Russian roots were never fully covered over by his passionate embrace of his adopted country of Britain. His identity became what postcolonial theorists refer to as an example of \\"hybridity,\\" meaning that he was niether fully one or the other.This hybridity helped to form the basis for Berlin's belief that life is in essence tragic and there is no way to reconcile all valid worldviews.I found this to be an incredibly compelling interpretation of Berlin's famous defense for pluralism. Finally, anyone interested in Western ideas in the aftermath of the Second World War will benefit greatly from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A So-So Collection","review":"Any fan of New Wave will likely already have the best of the tracks included on this collection. And what you don't have, you could find at a retail \\"Cut-Out\\" bin.Some of the transfer quality is questionable. You could probably obtain a better quality by taping your local radio station's \\"retro\\" 80s show. But as I mentioned, you probably already have \\"I Don't Like Monday's\\" floating around somewhere!If you see this CD around cheaply, it's worth picking up (to, if nothing else, save you from having to acquire the better songs one by one). There are a couple of cool tunes which take you back, but all in all, the CD is a hit-or-miss collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Groome has some very practical ideas which can easily be implemented in the classroom, I have found, without too much effort. An excellent book with some limitations, it has helped me in my Masters of Religious Education to acquire a new approach and has synergistically taught me that the purpose of education is to teach the student to think and evaluate all things, being equipped to come to better conclusions, the better the process of thinking works in the individual.

We took it into a toys r us store and their assembler took an hour and still couldn't put it together. We were told by the store manager that they didn't have a special tool available to them at the time and to pick up the trike a day later. She also told me that if they were unable to assemble the trike that we'd get to exchange for another trike. I'm waiting to pick up the toy.At this point I'm extremely upset, because my 2 yr. old son loved the buttons on the trike and he hasn't even had a chance to ride this trike.

Put a bead of super glue around the \\"base\\" of each brush, gluing the wires into the center \\"holder.\\" Do it on both sides. I do this routinely as soon as I receive the brushes. The brushes last a lot longer - the wires essentially wear out before they come out. These inexpensive brushes are so much less expensive than the \\"name brands\\" that it's well worth the few minutes it takes to glue the wires in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"These wire brushes look like a good deal (24 total, and cheap!), but save your money. When used to clean heat discoloration on mild steel, each brush lasted < 60 seconds, during which time the brushes shot out their wire bristles like a porcupine in a blender (not that I've tried that - but you should definitely wear gloves and eye protection). The bristles are not stiff. They have very little scraping power and shape memory - the bristles that don't immediately fall out bend and twirl, so that your brush quickly looks like the Milky Way Galaxy and becomes useless. Then you spend another 60 seconds changing out the brush for a replacement. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better light than most for this price","review":"I was tempted to give 5/5 but on absolute value rather than comparative it has to be a 4. This is a much better light than most Maglights and other quality lights. But where they and many others go cheap rate is on the switch. This is a solidly constructed light with a good beam pattern, they don't have anything to improve in that area. However, what most of these lights share is a cheap-to-make momentary action switch. This isn't a good solution on ten bucks worth of parts with an asking price in the fifty buck range. Cheaper Maglights have a vastly better switch, there are even cheaper lights of this configuration with a better switch. But when all is said and done it's a very good light and better value than any alternative I know of. But take a look at a Surefire G2 as an alternative, same type of switch though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inova Flashlight","review":"Very reliable and durable. The diameter light distance is clearly seen from 180 ft away and lids the area very well. I just wish the flashlight had the button the top rather at the end of it.

It is so sturdy, bright, stylish, and durable. I dropped it in water, and it survived! I dropped it from my balcony - and it did not get a scratch! Unlike many other flashlights, this one does not consume batteries fast. You can even use rechargeable batteries if need be. Invest in this flashlight instead of buying a cheap plastic one from your local store that wil break down just when a hurricane steals your electricity! This is reliable and will not let you down! I can literally see hundreds of feet away and scare racoons out of my apartment community trash bin! So effective and useful. So worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but expensive","review":"The flashlight should be bright enough for any use. The problem is the cost of batteries...unless you buy 1,000 at a time.

The Hungarian-born conductor, Eugene Ormandy, was very, very good.That said, I believe the performances of Willi Boskovsky and the Vienna Philharmonic have the edge. The Philadelphia Orchestra's sound is richer. But, the Vienna Philharmonic under Boskovsky seemed to play the music more sensitively. And, the timing was impeccable.Yes, Boskovsky conducted the New Year's concerts in Vienna for a quarter of a century. This envirable record reflected his instinct for celebrating the lilting nature of the music.So, I would urge anyone who loves the Strauss family's music to listen to some clips of Boskovsky and the Vienna Philharmonic and then decide which CD's are must-haves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial refrigeration handbook","review":"I was very glad to see the examples in the book were in SI units since I was not born in 1800's.

A book on logic should provide lots of examples for the student to follow as well as at least some answers for each of the practice problems that are given.

Fair distribution of job opportunities is systematically denied to poor through a \`colonial' education system where quality education is available only to those who can afford to learning at premier institutions where expenses are very high - more than what an average family can earn.This book must be an eye opener for the poor, but alas! They do not understand English; hence an Urdu translation of the book is most desirable."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"My friend got me addicted to this lip gloss...it smells fabulous and has great colors!

My daughter has other barbies too though and for some reason notices that these ones are a little different so they don't get played with as much because the clothes and stuff don't exacly interchange with other regular barbies. The haridos on these barbies also get messy very fast and start looking kind of raggy. Some of the accessories they come with are a little bit cheap and didn't last long. Most of the small pieces are long gone and I'm glad because my baby can't find them now.

The movie captures the atmosphere of the time very well (if you ignore some very modern-looking houses during a couple of scenes) and presents a more balanced view of the resistance movement. Political infighting, ruthlessness, betrayals etc are as common with the Resistance as they are within any organization, and its members are depicted as anything but heroic. The brutality of the Nazis is evident, but they are not portrayed as absolute monsters, giving the movie extra realism. Acting is superb.Definitely worth a watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Suspense!","review":"Excellent WWII Film very well made, Acted and Directed! Film is Foreign with English Subtitles!

I really got a lot out of what the author had to say on show structure, choice of tricks, and organic integration of different elements in to a strong performance and have been using his concepts to build a new routine. The messages were so broad that I actually think that dancers, comedians, and other live performers other than magicians would benefit from it too.As a heads up, the author does talk a lot about card magic (which I'm personally not in to) but it was easy enough to skim it, get the point he was making with the example, and move on.

These marines were not recon they were ambush patrols. The chapter where the squads fort is overran is unforgetable. The books author was at the village but he writes about the men and not himself. While in the Corps a Lt. O.West asked me what was the best book on Vietnam I had read I told him \\"The Village\\" Only than did I find out it had been written by his father.

What I want to communicate is the historical impact The Village has had and, rightfully, should have. If you're readng this review, you need to read this book. Its effectiveness is rooted in its simple approach and language-- leaves the B.S. for hollywood and the magazine excerpts. Hopefully as school children, college students, policy makers, and writers study in the future, they will increasingly turn to this book as an unfiltered account of one small part of the Vietnam War, which, I believe, transcends just that region, just that war, and into battles and struggles throughout time. Every 7-10 years it seems like pop culture decides to revisit Vietnam. In a way, I can only hope they continue to skip over The Village because it would only ruin the book's true impact.

My families lived in Laramie in the late 1800's/early 1900's and I wonder how did they do that. Anna Lee told how they lived, had fun, enjoyed one another.

I am a film buff and love older movies. However, I think all the reviewers (and many national critics) have been blinded by Godard's reputation retroactively. The movie has interesting pieces and beautiful cinematography in the final third. However it is shot through with meandering asides, swipes at Godard's producer, and long \\"intellectual\\" quotes from people Godard agrees with. This is hardly good filmmaking!! He was striking back at the studio system which he disagreed with, but to drag the audience through his personal antipathies doesn't advance the story and is frankly, a bore. I purposefully didn't read anything about this movie before I rented it and it is a LONG slog. Again, interesting for a film student, but if you want to see a fine older French film, try Truffaut's \\"400 Blows\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfire on Blu-Ray","review":"This is,without a doubt, one of the best films ever made by Godard and his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard.The Criterion Collection transfer is impeccable - sharp focus, well-balanced primary colors, great sound.The Blue-ray disc (not from Criterion but Lionsgate's Studio Canal label) is a major disappointment on just about every level - especially with the color levels. There appears to be a yellowish cast to everything. No hard reds, blues, yellows or greens.Skin tones are dull and gray. It seems to have been made from completely different elements, with no reference to the original intent, or even the Coutard approved transfer.At least it was not panned and scanned, about the only thing in it's favor.If you have the Criterion version already - keep it.The \\"up grade\\" to Blu-Ray is NOT an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Though Not As Fun As I Anticipated","review":"First of all, gorgeous restoration - the image is sharp and vivid, and since primary colors are a big part of this movie that matters. The story of a failing marriage told through the prism of international filmmaking, it's mostly a chamber piece. in typical Godard fashion, the two lead characters are both recognizable and enigmatically opaque.My only complaint with the movie is that it's kinda glum.

Mabel was singing Cole Porter songs when they were new in the l930's, and Mr. Porter considered her-- along with Bobby Short--to be the best interpretors of his music. Frank Sinatra openly admitted learning much about musical phrasing from this very special artist.

So even if you build this kit you don't really learn anything about amplifier circuits (unless you already happen to know what all the components do).

Some sound like the artists are having a blast while they're recording. \\"Hush\\" is a delightful mix of both.Most of the songs are pretty quiet save for my three favorites. You've got a lot of traditional and classical music with Master Ma's beautiful playing and McFerrin's incredibly versatile voice.My favorites:\\"Hush\\" with lyrics by McFerrin\\"Hoedown\\" with vocal riffing by McFerrin\\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" probably the most fun the pair hadRebecca Kyle, December 2008"},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtuosi produce beauty, grace, and fun","review":"This is a really fantastic album that you should definitely check out. McFerrin sparkles throughout, and the duo stirs up some really great-sounding, fun, and beautiful performances. Both men bring a certain charisma, benevolent attitude, grace, virtuosity, and musicianship that is broader than any one style to this record. I think that this recording can be appreciated by just about anybody who appreciates artistic beauty. In my opinion, McFerrin and Ma are the perfect model of what a modern, classically-trained musician should be like. The ablum is a mix of McFerrin's cool-sounding, gesture-filled, very accessible originals, classical pieces, and lighter numbers, including a really funny intro to Bach's Musette. This version of Bach's Air (on the G String) is sublime in its beauty and grace. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a brief overview","review":"If you're still unsure about whether you *want* to buy a house, then this is the book to help you make up your mind. It covers the basics of mortgages, to finding a house, to deciding between types of houses, i.e. condos/new/resale/fixer-upper/etc. It's a quick and easy read, nicely defined words, pictures, but for if you decide to buy a house/condo, or have already decided, then you definitely need something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!!!","review":"This book has really made a lot of decisions easier.

He'd tried all the high priced prescription drugs and they did nothing. Prostalex Plus gave results quickly, and although not perfect, there is a great improvement. I only have to get up at night 1 to 3 times, daytime urgency is greatly reduced, and when I feel like I have to go, I actually do go for the most part. The urologist just shrugs his shoulders, but I can attest that this product does indeed work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"no luck at all with this product","review":"First of all thinking I was ordering the same brand I always use but in a different package,not so,you take 2 daily not 1 so its a 30 day supply ,this product did not work for me at all,I used it for 2wks then ordered the prostalex plus that comes in the box,your best bet"},{"rating":"2","title":"prostalex plus, great product","review":"Was having problems trying to empty my bladder, or was going all the time.

I have THREE of these pens for my chins to run in, and combined with other toys and boxes, is a good option for them to get exercise. They still want to get out to the rest of the house, but this gives them a lot of room to run while keeping them contained. They're plenty tall, mine have never escaped (nor would they be able to unless I were to badly place a box/toy). It is kind of a pain in the butt to set up three pens for them, but thus is the price of having high-maintenance pets. Would definitely recommend this product (but definitely not the matching cage shown in picture - wire cages are terrible for chinchillas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Alcatraz","review":"My two pet rats must be super rats, because they can shimmy up the wires and escape from this pen. They managed to escape within 2 minutes of being in the pen. I did manage to rig it so they cannot escape by zip-tying linoleum to the top portion of the pen instead of returning it. With the adjustments I made, it was still cheaper than most rat play pens for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm buying it again, finally.","review":"I bought this album when it first came out, and I'm buying it again.

If you're a Johnny Winter or blues/rock fan this is a MUST album for your collection. I've had to convert my original vinyl album to cd so I can listen to it over and over.

After reading some of the reviews I became interested and decided to check him out. I have listened to the whole anthology several times and have come to the conclusion that I just don't care for his voice. I like the music, I like his piano playing to an extent but his voice and vocal delivery just don't do it for me. Just a personal preference thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"soft plastic junk","review":"I suppose the rolling bucket is fine for moving water around but the wringer is junk - mine broke after maybe 15 minutes of use. the metal handle goes through a shaped hole in the 1st side, but then engages a wimpy all plastic (not even solid) seat on the far side which just deforms and then completely fails (rips off).. so you get this asymmetrical squeezing action that is just sad. Also, my standard cotton mop wouldn't even really fit all the way in because the space is very small.Terrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic bends when wringing","review":"I bought this about a year ago from Home Despot. It's a fine bucket, but the wringer is crap: when you try to use it, the entire mechanism bends, and if you put enough pressure into it to actually wring out your mop the wringer slips off the edge of the bucket which is not terribly helpful. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bucket","review":"We bought this bucket since the traditional yellow ones look too commercial and are so much more expensive.

This thing is so cheap & flimsy. 1st, the handle is slid into place when assembling which makes it flimsy & definitely is not strong enough for a good wringing. 2nd, the 2 brackets that hold up the wringer will easily slide out of place. The first time this happened, I was deep in wringing mode when the brackets gave out.i almost broke my arm & had a faceful of nasty mop water. Comical now but @ the time I was pissed. 3rd, the handle is awkward, like not quite big enough for the bucket size. Makes it hard to pull around. Took me forever to mop the floor & ended up with a more wet than a normal last good wringing sweep of the floor should be account not taking anymore chances to bite the bucket. This \\"cheap\\" bucket was not so cheap in price. Spend a little more money & get the tried & true yellow industrial one.
