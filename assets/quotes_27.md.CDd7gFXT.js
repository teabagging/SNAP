So much of the British actors' talents are seen in the little things; the look Uncas gives Cora when she thanks him for her meal, Major Heywards' declaration of love for Alice, Hawkeyes' constant loyalty to his Mohican friends.If you want romantic eye-candy, get the 1992 version with Daniel Day-Lewis.

We just got it and it is not. The sets are horrible. It must have been filmed with a budget of about $1,000 or less! The camera quality is horrible and the actors are pretty bad except for Hawkeye, Cora and Alice. The Indians are terrible. Uncas is a little nerd with an English aristocratic accent and Magua is pretty dumb too. All in all it is pretty bad. The Massacre at Fort William Henry consists of about 5 women!

It lacked the quality of other movies of the same name and gave poor examples of the Native Americans. Example; Native Americans did not scalp to release the spirit of their enemy. Also some of the dancing and drum beats were not authentic and made the Native Americans look very barbaric. The acting was dull and boring as well and without a musical score only added to the dullness. I would not recommend this movie for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could only watch 20 minutes of it.","review":"I cannot believe that I paid so much for such a horrible movie.

For one, the cover had Hugh Jackman on it. Not that he's not a good actor, I just feel like they could have made a better casting... beside that... the game was great. It has a plot, cool special attacks, and it's not one of the games that you breeze right through on the first shot. The stealth mode is the most interesting part of the game. Variance could be added to Wolverine's attacks but for what its worth, the attacks in the game are graphically pleasing to watch. It's a little annoying that Wolverine has short range attacks while all his enemies seem to carry some sort of rifle or gun, but that's what makes the game so difficult. The game also has a great replay value, because there is no way that you got everything in the game on the first shot, unless you cheated or used a game guide. Definitely a game worth the buy.

And that was if you did not switch songs, but just let it play. I ended up buying the Kensington one which works so much better.

ITS AWESOME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked nicely for a couplel months, now not at all","review":"This is no inexpensive piece of kit for what it does, and what it does after about 3 months of regular use is nothing at all. It sticks on one channel, which, of course, you better hope that there isn't a local station that uses whatever it happens to get stuck on.

This refurbished gadget saved me big bucks. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this.","review":"I have had so many problems with this item.The static is extremely annoying. I could have dealt with it had I not experienced the other problems.The most irritating about it is how it turns off randomly and stops transmitting a signal, and you get the incredibly loud static on your radio. To get the signal back from the iTrip, you need to pause your iPod and press play again.There are times where I've had to plug it into my iPod and unplug it various times before it turns itself on at all.Worst part is, now when I hook it up without another charger attached to it, it will drain my iPod battery in a matter of minutes. I am pretty sure it caused permanent damage to my iPod. Without it, my iPod will last only a couple hours now (and I have recently replaced the battery).Do not buy this product. There are much better ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contact problem Dock Connector for iPod","review":"I usually have problem when I try to turn on the dock connector for iPod.

It works great!! I love the LCD screen. It's much easier to set the station and turn on. No need to load all the frequencies on your iPod and create a separate playlist to play without the \\"beeps\\" of the other frequencies.Sound quality seems to be much better, I think, because of the antennae being exposed on this model.The only catch, there's not enough room between the iPod and the iTrip for my iSkin cover. Since the old one connected on the top of the iPod, the iSkin is a little thinner there, so it worked great. This one can't connect to my iPod when the iSkin is on. I like to keep my iSkin on to protect from scratches, so I have to take it off when I'm in the car and put it on when I leave the car to go to work. Kind of a hassle. Other than that, it works great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It simply works","review":"I bought it for my son's iPod. I'm living in metro Atlanta where there are a lot of radio stations.

It is expensive for its simple purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but","review":"When the empty FM station is truly empty, the unit works okay. But when it isn't, it doesn't.

This has to be the worst accessory ever made for the ipod. DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK LIKE THE 5G iTrip--It won't. The positive \\"featured review\\" is a lie.

It would be nice if it would go down to the lowest station available, 87.5, where there usually isn't a station. It goes down to 88.1.

I followed all the advice, 50-70% volume, DX vs LX, International at 87.9 FM and it's still so staticy that I can barely hear the music. Not really worth it. I've tried this in a couple of cars with the same results.

Perhaps in an older car that does not have any other signals it may work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Griffin Tech iTrip Transmitter","review":"Good thing this product is cheap, because this product is not that great.Most of the time when you use it, you have to \\"re-boot\\" your ipod.Also, while it has a wide range of frequencies to choose from, it doesn't seem to be able to tune low enough on the dial to find a truly unused frequency."},{"rating":"1","title":"iTrip doesn't work","review":"I read the manual twice before trying the device, and the device didn't work - the car radio either didn't pick up the signal, or there was no signal output.

It's easy to use and works with my video iPod and my husband's iPhone. I use it with our home stereo, and the sound quality is great. The only small complaint I have is that it's not great for listening to podcasts (as opposed to music) in the car. I can't seem to get it loud enough to hear well over normal driving sounds. Music is fine, though, so it's a start. I'd recommend it to most people, as long as they aren't talk-junkies like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars","review":"Bad audio quality.

The itrip will voraciously eat your ipods battery power, so I reccomend a car charge kit along with the itrip.Another problem you may encounter is that there is a loud popping noise between songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great form factor - reliable performer (so far...)","review":"Got the device to use in the crowded radio spectrum of Washington DC. Even channels with known broadcasts worked well in two different cars. Location and orientation within the car can make a difference - as do car antenna type - my experience is that cars with mast antennas seems to work more reliably than cars with in-window antennas - though I can't explain why. May just be a radio sensitivity issue. Wish the frequency band went lower than 88.1 Mhz, as the spectrum is usually less crowded in the lower frequencies. Audio level output adjustment is missing. Display, though small, is usable.Form fits well with my Nano - looks okay and is unobtrusive. Controls and connectors function well and are intuitive. I've had limited time (<30 days) of use so long term reliability remains open. Overall, a recommended product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect form, failed function","review":"I got this the same day I got a new 60GB Ipod. When trying to use it, as with other reviewers, I had an effective one foot range with _spotty_ reception. Though FM-quality was expected, static interfered with all tests. Any further than one foot had no reception at all.Whatmore, the hardware interface is poor. Through gentle handling, the iTrip continually lost power, resetting itself to the default channel. The lightest jostling of the iTrip caused it to fail and reset.Even with reasonable expectations of performance, this device underperformed. I returned the device soon after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Ugh. I hoped this would help my hour-long commute each way, but after three tries I've chalked it up to a waste of money. Part of the fault could be in that I live in a major metropolitan area, so it's hard to find a radio frequency with absolutely nothing bleeding through. But even when I did find one, this transmitter made my iPod sound like weak AM radio. The only time I could get something resembling clear sound was when I physically held the iPod so the iTrip TOUCHED my car stereo. I'm not driving down the Turnpike like that! Bought the Monster iCarPlay Wireless ([...]) today and it works great. Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"rwk had some interesting advice (first page of reviews?) and i'd try it if i could find my itrip.like a lot of people, i had the older one for my 3g ipod which worked great but this one doesn't tune down to the magical station (87.9) and doesn't lock securely to the bottom of the ipod.for what it's worth, it seems to work better with a stereo in the house than in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have come to expect so much more Griffin","review":"Had a Griffin itrip for my 3rd generation iPod and loved it. The 5th generation unit looks really nice but is a very poor performer. Low audio drive, noisy, the connector constantly falls out. The transcient that comes out through your car stereo if you tap the back of the unit is quite alarming. I find that I am constantly repositioning the unit to optimize against interference. I replaced the unit with a Griffin RoadTrip (yes, I gave Griffin another chance). What a difference! The roadtrip performace is solid as a rock and the sound is crystal clear. Roadtrip must put out more power because I get no interference at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing","review":"OK, I should have read ALL the other reviews first but I had the itrip mini which was fine so bought this on the strength of that.. Big mistake, just couldnt agree more with everyone else. It falls out the bottom of the ipod, it stops transmitting if you handle it, and the sound quality is very poor. Oh, and I also couldnt get it to work unless I laid it down a couple of inches from the car stereo. I hate using it cos I love the ipod video 30gb that i have and this just makes that seem REALLY tacky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but has low volume","review":"I paid $50 for the iTrip with the docking connector and using it with the 30GB iPod video. It works and the sound is clear but the volume is really low compared to CDs or even other stations. I've tried various stations from lower frequencies where there are no neighboring signals coming in to higher frequencies where it's harder to find something with nothing coming in on a neighboring frequency. All in all, I'm pretty disappointed in this for the 50 bucks - it's going back to the store today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Signal - Useless","review":"I have a new 30Gb Video ipod.

It's a stereo cable so that shouldn't be. I jiggled it around some and upon pulling it out of the jack just a little bit it then came through at the correct volume and through both channels. Problem then is that it's not plugged in all the way so if it gets tapped slightly it cuts out again. It's not a problem with my laptop input or the mixer seeing as other cables work just fine. Maybe I just got a dud cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cables...","review":"I use this for connecting my laptop to a sound system to play music through it and it seems to work well.

I think that the widespread incidence of child abuse can show up much later in life and leave us with adults with extensively damaged psyche. I alternatively feel sorry for this damaged little girl in a woman's body and outraged that she would lease her blackness to those who would publish a peice of ethnic slander like \\"The End of Blackness.\\" I regard Ms. Dickerson to be somewhat schizophrenic...but I doubt that it is her fault.

Ms. Dickerson did not live in a vacuum; she did not get to the Harvard Law School entirely on her own, as she seems to believe. More than anything, her message reflects either a brazen dishonesty or a transcendent ignorance of the historic, economic, political and social forces that shaped this country and the destiny of black Americans.

DuBois, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglas, sociologist William Julius Wilson, and activist Angela Y. Davis, I started from a perspective that Dickerson's work would be at the level of these noted authors. After getting through the introduction, however, I realized my mistake. The work is not a scholarly compilation of syllogistic conclusions. Rather, it is a work that Ms. Dickerson can confidently claim as her own. Assumptions are based upon false premises that lead readers to conclusive arguments derived from erroneous logic. The thickness in verbage that includes slangy tone is rather demeaning as one sloughs over Ms. Dickerson's opinions that come off first as xenocentric but later are diffused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Legitimize Stereotypes by Publishing Email Jokes?","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The author's previous tome was inspiring because she refused to be put in the box that society had prescribed for her.

I bought 2 of these chairs, one for my house and one for grandma's. They both leak. We are just about finished training, otherwise, I would spend the money on a different potty chair.

As a step stool it gets 5 stars!Now, I have a boy...this seat was definitely not designed by anyone who has a boy or who has tried to potty train a boy. The lack of a pee guard is so impractical!

The bowl is way too small so repositioning did not help much either. Using it as a step stool is no fun either, it is too heavy for a little one to carry around. Not a very good design at all I agree with all the other * reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design never tested with a real boy?","review":"Sure the thing is cute and sturdy but is as messy as it can be. I should have listened to my husband who suggested we added some weight to our 99 cents potty.To make the story short, the urine only stays in the small removable pot when your kid has perfect aim (not often at the beginning). If he misses only a little bit, the urine ends up between the white ring and the actual body of the potty or inside the body. As a result you end up dismantling and washing all the parts of the artifact EVERY SINGLE TIME. The main problem with this is not that you waste a lot of time, but that your little one gets the idea that going to the bathroom is cumbersome, complicated and frustrating. Next time you tell him: ?go pee in the potty? he will say ?no? with a good reason.Do people who design this things test them in the field? Not this one for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, messy, messy","review":"After my 2.5 year old uses this, there is pee not only inside the potty, but under the ring, inside the potty under the holder, and ON THE FLOOR of my bathroom.

Now that it is in use alot more, I am frustrated to have to clean the thing out all the time. I go to take the basin out to dump his acheivement into the toilet, and notice a happy little trail of it leaking out of the rest of the toilet. I even tried to put a home-made barrier in it to block pee from going below, no use. No wonder its one of the cheaper potties I have seen on the market. He might as well still go on the floor. Plus, if they have a hard time getting onto it, the door closes on their little back. Sure the little reward stickers are cute. But I am forced to go back to the store to purchase a new potty that actually keeps the pee pee in the bowl and ONLY in the bowl"},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks alot","review":"I bought this potty chair because it seemed simple. however, every time my daughter uses it it leaks on the floor and under the bowl, so theres always alot of clean up. the flushing handle falls off all the time and is hard for my daughter to use. wished i'd spent a little more and got quality instead i got crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, messy, messy!!","review":"I think this potty would be okay for girls, but not for boys. When boys use it, the pee goes under the rim, between the removeable pot, and spills out on the floor. I have to take it apart and wash it every time.

Now I'm going to have to buy another potty because he insists on using the \\"little potty.\\" I'll probably buy a one piece from baby bjorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR BOYS","review":"I got this for my 20 month old son.

I started with this potty, the guard is nothing spectacular, I couldn't tell you how many times he has sprayed me. And then it leaked between the bowl and the hole. I had to hold it down for him too. After the first day I went to get another potty seat that is much better. The guard is high and the seat is cushioned. I mean the potty was cute, but just not practical enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cables for stereo sound from your computer","review":"I bought these cables to hook up my AudioEngine 2 speakers to my computer (the standard cable they had come with was surprisingly cheap and the connection poor, making for hum unless you got it just so). Was I ever happy! These cables are slightly thicker than they appear in the picture, not enough to be stiff or unmanageable (anyone who has ever used a Monster Cable will know what I mean) and with connections that fit snug and secure without taking up unnecessary space. The sound from them is excellent, and the cable length handy.

The scene takes place towards the end of the movie when Wendy goes on a date with the county commissioner. The writing in this scene is brilliant and flawless. It reminded me of a clip from the Little Rascals with the background music and the \\"extras\\" like the restaurant manager, the waiters, and the other patrons. The extras are just as important to the scene as Wendy and the commissioner. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY OR AT LEAST RENT THIS DVD TO SEE THIS SCENE. I crack up every time that I see it. I wish that they would make more scenes like this in the movies of today.

Most codes on here seem to just be for people who want to make a game really easy. If that's what you're going for, go for it.

They say that this is the ONLY way to get the upgraded disc. My concern was that it didn't work once, and by the time a replacement would get to me I'd be out of time for a return if it didn't work again. I emailed them again (the way they instruct you to) voicing this concern and they did not email me back (it's been a week).

It is fun when it works. It is extremely painful to enter a new code. The on-screen keyboard is ill-designed. I think they just want to sell their keyboard to you. When you type something wrong, you may end up to re-type the entire multi-line codes again. It is easy to spend one hour to enter the codes for one game. Furthermore, it is not reliable. It crashes often and all the codes you entered for hours are lost forever. And sometimes the machine cannot start with the dongle inserted. My friend told me that it may erase saved game when it is in malfunction. I do not know if this is true. The reliability of the device is very low. Be aware that you cannot create your own code.

Its not that great either. The surface gets slippery from hand and feet sweat (gross but can't be helped, especially with Bikram yoga), and the padding wasn't thick enough to get me through a pilates class.

Her poor Dad was hauling over all kinds of stuff that babies use, (and make life easier on adults). Very comfortable for baby, convenient for feeding, and folds away for tidy storage. We do not have a space problem, but if space or clutter is an issue, this little booster seat would be an alternative to a large high chair. Great price, pretty blue for girls or boys. This little chair is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"We are satisfied with this purchase! It is so nice to be able to stick everything in the dishwasher, and the base is quick and easy to clean. We couldn't be happier. If you are deciding to go with this or a more expensive high chair, try this and you will likely be happy you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product!!","review":"Ordered this chair in lieu of high chair for 8 mo old...Love it!! I think she could have used this even as six month old but we already had another \\"chair\\" we used for a limited time but she outgrew this. Great price. Only negative is she can pull off the white feeding tray herself...should have additional fasteners to prevent this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the color and size","review":"Great product and price! I looked extensively because I'm so picky about style and color. This blends well with our decor. Sturdy too. Will highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little seat!","review":"Functional, portable, easy to wipe or wash clean, adjustable, nice neutral cream & dark red color scheme. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We have two of these (one for our house and one for the in-laws house) and LOVE them. Both have been used for over a year. They are GREAT for travel and super easy to clean. They both still look brand new and will be used by us and our family for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great as long as your kid is on the small or slim side","review":"I loved this chair it was great. Easy to clean, easy to take with us wherever we went. The only problem I had was that my son outgrew it very quickly... He had very chubby legs and one day he complained then I put him in it. I took the tray off and noticed that it was marking his little legs. He wasn't even 8 months yet. I hung on to it and will use it with our second son, we will see how long we can use it with him. Both my boys are on the big side so if your child is smaller and thinner you may be able to use it longer. My first son was off the charts in weight and length since he was very young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice booster seat","review":"We are very pleased with this product. We purchased this chair for our 14 month old baby boy and he loves it. We don't need to even use the tray. We push him under the table and put his food on his plate and he is so comfortable in it. We have actually taken it out a few times when we have gone to friend's houses and it is easy to transport. Great product and easy to clean. He has plenty of room to grow in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for traveling!","review":"We needed something that would work for a long visit out of town for our 10 month old baby girl. We were going to be traveling between multiple houses and didn't want to have to drag a large high chair around with us. We got this booster and it was awesome. Exactly what we needed. It worked with multiple types of chairs and we were able to adjust the straps to tighten the base against the back of the chair. Awesome for short term use while traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up","review":"My son started using this seat when he was one and loves that he can sit at the table with us. It's also easy to clean and take with us on vacations or to friends and relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great booster seat with a few drawbacks","review":"I really love this booster seat but I was excited about the 2 trays and cover which turned out to be a bust. My son quickly learned how to pop off the insert tray and wouldn't leave it alone during meal times. So the cover and tray sit in a closet taking up space. Maybe when he's older it will be more useful but for a 6 mos to 1 yr old the tray is overated. The rest of the seat and regular tray are great and easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the one I had","review":"This little seat is great. It fits nicely into the kitchen chair and he seems comfortable in it. I only have two complaints, the tray is easily removed and contents flipped out by the baby, and he turns and sticks his arm throught the hole in the back and gets his arm stuck. Otherwise, it is the best chair of the three that I have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic nuisance","review":"The booster seat is minimally adjustable; fits on a level chair seat; held by adjustable straps. Child is secured by a three-belt harness, plus the removable tray. However, the tray is secured by a three-position plastic lock that depends upon the flexibility of the plastic material for removal. Tray removal, which is performed every time a child is taken out of the seat, can be easy or quite difficult, depending on the accuracy of manufacture and the temperature of the plastic tray. This can be a very annoying operation with an impatient child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"I have been using this booster for almost 8 months and absolutely love it. The straps hold it securely to our dining room chairs. Its dual trays are super easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I have found that not even marinara sauce stains the tray or seating surface.The adjustable height on the base is easy to use.I would recommend this booster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Product Ever!","review":"This is actually the 2nd chair we've bought because we somehow lost the first one and can't live without it. We take it everywhere we eat out and our daughter loves it. The best part is that she can't climb out of it or tip it over like a highchair, there's no battling while eating. Plus she has her own tray so she doesn't have to be at the right height for the table. The chair fits her body well, she started at 11 months and is now 21 months and we see a long future still ahead for her and this chair. The removable tray is nice so we can pop it out, wash it and she is still locked in with the main tray. We bought this thinking we would use it minimally but it has become a staple in our family! I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deluxe Booster Seat","review":"Great Seat and Great Price and Quick service. I would recommend this seat to anyone and the fact it has two trays and a cover is really a nice also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product ok","review":"Product looks great, but my 9mos old grandson can pull the tray off by himself. The seat is very sturdy and straps down securely, but the tray, insert & cover were made improperly or should have been better thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"exactly what I needed! I don't have space for a full size high chair, this works, plus I can take it with me when we visit family"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but nice","review":"Great booster seat. I got it for grandma's house and it's perfect. It's convenient as a stand alone seat for my 9 month old and as a seat at the table for my 2 year old. I like that you can adjust the height and although I have not needed to transport it, iit seems to be easily portable. The only thing I don't like is the way the tray snaps onto the seat. Overall, though, I like this booster seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for us!","review":"After much debate as to if we should get high chairs or these, I reluctanly went with these. I am so glad I did! They take up little space, there is no place for crumbs to hide - you can clean every inch of these, they are light weight and completely portable. If we go out to eat we take the seats with us. They collapse and you use the straps that attach them to the chair to throw over your shoulder and carry then that way. We like them so much my parents bought a set for the girls to use when they are at their house. I have seen reviews were some have said their child couldn't lean back to take their bottle while in the seat. Just my opinion but they are in the seat to eat, not take a bottle and the seats do exactly what they are meant to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish i purchased this from the start instead of a high chair!","review":"this is the perfect little seat. very compact and portable. clips onto chairs with two easy clicks. it slides right under the table like the rest of the chairs if the tray is removed. my only small complaint is the white tray comes off so easily, my daughter takes it off when she's done eating and throws it on the floor. i've stopped using it altogether until she gets a little older. i just put her food on the blue part so there's no mess on the floor to clean up when she's done! there are a few scratches left on the white part from cutting her food on it so i would advise against that. but all in all this was a great purchase and i highly recommend it! it's so much easier to clean than the high chair. just a quick rinse off and wipe down when she's done and we're good to go. even took it with us today to get her hair cut. it was a perfect booster and so easy to grab it and go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great booster seat","review":"I like this seat because it's really compact, lightweight, truly portable, and most important, there aren't a million crevices and holes for food pieces to fall into, never to be recovered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to buy a high chair...","review":"I own two of these seats and highly recommend them to any other parents. We use one with our two-year-old without the tray - just pulled up to our table. The other we use with our 7-month old. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the chair doesn't recline - so your baby needs to be able to sit up in the chair to use - which was around 6 months with my son. I still often roll a small burp cloth behind him to cushion him.With our first child, I made the mistake of buying a high chair. BIG mistake! It took up so much space and was such a pain to clean. With our second, I used a bouncer or our BUMBO chair to feed him for that short period of time before he was ready to sit in the Healthy Care seat.***WARNING - The orange/yellow version of this chair is NOT height adjustable like the blue/green one. (That's why it's cheaper.) The NON-adjustable seat was too high and didn't fit under our table."},{"rating":"2","title":"I made the right choice!","review":"After exploring the internet for booster seats I decided on the Healthy Care by Fisher-Price. My 16 month old had decided that she didn't like her highchair any longer and I was skeptical that I was going to find ANY chair that she would like. Her grandma had bought the On the Go Fold Up and she wouldn't even sit in it. She seems to love being a \\"big girl\\" in her FP one. I love that it comes with a cover for the tray as we have two dogs and all highchair trays seem to attract dog hair (static). It really attaches snuggly to our chairs and is easy to clean. The only thing that I am disappointed in is the size of the tray-it is a bit small. Overall though I am very happy with this chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great booster!","review":"My mom bought me this booster for my 18 month old son. He's 31\\" and 31 lbs. and he fits in the booster comfortably with the tray on. Other booster did not fit his belly, but he has a couple inches to spare. Like the healthy care high chair, he whips off the tray insert, but no big deal. The seat is super easy to clean, too. Don't hesitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome booster seat!","review":"I bought this booster chair instead of a highchair to save on space, and it has worked out great! She can use this for years, and the trays wash in the dishwasher, and it was alot less money than a highchair would cost. I have since bought three more-- one we keep in the car for when we go out to eat, and one for each of the grandparents houses. It's a big help when eating out, as she can sit in it securely, and can play with toys or eat cheerios off of the tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Care Booster Seat","review":"I was a bit skeptical because of the number of choices but bought this one because it adjusted. We are very happy with it because it allows our granddaughter to sit at the table with us, at the right height and to be safely buckled without having to store a high chair or other large piece when she is not here. It is easy to clean and transport. I would buy it again and do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"I went out and bought this booster seat for my 21 month old daughter. My 3 year old son has a booster seat as well which is a cheaper model (still being sold), and other than being a crumb trap which has to be taken apart to be cleaned it is very useful, it gets him up high so he can sit at the table with us and it allows me to strap him in so he can not get out during meal time. However this Healthy Care Booster Seat is almost worthless. It does not elevate my daughter up high enough to eat at the table (her height is in the 90%), so I have to use the tray. But unfortunately the tray is so small, I can not fit any of my daughters child size plastic plates on it, so I have to put her food on the tray provided, which she can take apart and throw. This chair is easier to clean, but not giving me anything I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"No crevices! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!","review":"My big, expensive high chair has teeeeeny little cracks and crevices that get jammed up with food and mold and YUCKIES that are impossible to clean without getting in there with a toothpick or a butter knife and a lot of frustration. This booster comes in solid plastic pieces--no cracks, no crevices, no yuckies. The tray actually fits in the dishwasher, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOSTER","review":"most booster chairs do not have adjustable tray levels around the baby's waist. this one does. good product. i have 3 of them. they used to make an electronic play board with this before which they have discontinued [wish they hadn't]. beats having a bulky high chair with an enormous base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think we'll need a high chair. Ever. Be careful though when putting the trays together.","review":"We have been using this for our 6th month old at home and at restaurants. He sits in it just fine and it is super easy to use and clean. One of his favorite activities is when I put baby puffs on the tray and he will grab them and try to feed himself. Due to the tray *most* of the puffs will stay on the tray and not end up on the ground.One word of warning though, be careful while putting the upper tray on if your child is already seated with the lower tray in place. I accidentally snapped the white upper tray onto the lower blue tray when my son's fingers were resting on the lower tray because he was already seated. He cried but thankfully it wasn't more than that. In the future I will snap the two trays together FIRST before attaching it to the booster."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far Good","review":"I've been using the seat for my 7-month-old baby for 1 month, and I'm very happy with it. I love the colors. It's nice see colors rather than pink and blue for a baby product. It's easy to clean. Everything works well. So I give 5 stars for design and construction. I have to take 1 star because 1)I haven't used it long enough and 2)it's different from the picture on Amazon - the lumbar part of the seat doesn't have a hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect booster seat","review":"I wouldn't buy a high chair after having this item. It is portable, easy to clean, and sits right on a regular seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for a baby","review":"I bought this as a gift because I love mine so much!

It is very easy to set up and collapse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"We bought this seat for our 2 years old and he loves it. We ve taken it while traveling. It folds so easily and helped us so much to feed him while not at home. Higly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little on the small side","review":"I purchased this for my grandson to use when he visits. It's okay when using it for a small child, but as he has grown, we find that it is a little snug and he is small for his age at 2 1/2. The concept is great and stores compactly. I think it would be great when travelling or when going out to eat. It's certainly more sanitary to place your child in this seat and use the attachable tray, rather than placing him in a restaurant supplied highchair or booster seat and using the common table. Even with the chair being a little on the small side, I would definitely advise purchasing this chair for the occasional use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"What a great little chair for our one year old grandchild. Our children have this chair in their home and we bought one before an upcoming visit from grandbaby. It's easy to use and so easy to clean. Our old wooden high chair didn't have a safety strap as good as this and it was a pain to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counldn't do without it","review":"We LOVE this booster seat. It doesn't take up a lot of space and is easy to setup and take down. We take it wherever we think we might need a highchair for our little one. It is super easy to clean (no cracks or crevices) the plastic comes all in one piece. There are two trays which snap together fabulously and a top cover tray so you could even cover left over food and stick it in the fridge for the next meal. This is a GREAT product and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my fave","review":"this is one of my favorite....i love it coz its easy to clean...the tray is dishwasher safe...my 4 month old loves sitting in it....i recently took it with us to my in-laws and it attaches to any chair....i love the idea of taking this with me to restaurants instead of using their high-chairs (germs)...:) i would definitely recommend this product to my friends...and this is a must have...its cheap, saves space, easy to clean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome seat, the best.","review":"After my son turned about 18 months, we knew he no longer needed a high chair but he still needed a boost up at the table. This seat is great. It has three levels so it will fit at any table if you want to scoot the kid right up to the table, but it also has its own tray. We really never bother with the tray cover, but the tray itself is pretty handy. The chair folds up so you can take it with you to restaurants or someone's house. We bought the red and tan chair and I love that it is not pink or blue but a nice color! It takes up very little space, and I highly recommend this chair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great high chair alternative.","review":"I didn't want a high chair to take up space in my small dining area, this booster seat really fit in well. The bottom and back buckle were easily adjusted to secure itself to one of my regular dining chairs and my 5 month old (~19 lbs) has no problem fitting in it. (Albeit he is a big for his age, and he doesn't fit in the smallest setting of the tray.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we hoped for","review":"We've only had this 24 hours, but so far it seems great. Some reviewers mentioned getting sent the wrong color or model, but ours was exactly as advertised. Our baby is a little young for it (5 months) so he sometimes flops to the side a little and needs a receiving blanket tucked in there, but he seems to love being in the chair. He loves sitting up instead of leaning back like the baby chairs do, and he always wants to be up at our eye level. This lets him do both. I'm also very satisfied with the construction - everything works intuitively and there are no crevices to collect icky stuff like most highchairs. Also, the tray is low enough to push the chair in at the table when we're not using it. For such a great price, we're more than satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product ever!","review":"Of all the baby stuff I bought/registered for, this was the best. I have a high chair that I used for about a week and put it away and have only used this. It fits a small baby well but it works well for the kids as they grow too. My 27 lb 1 1/2 yr old fits well. I LOVE that I can throw the tray in the dishwasher. We take it to restaurants so that I don't have to put him in some gross high chair that may or may not have been cleaned. It is light and I don't have to have another chair cluttering up the kitchen. It fits nicely on our regular chairs and they fit under the table without having to remove the baby chair. I love that it grows with the child into a booster seat as they get older. Excellent product and I would highly recommend it instead of a traditional high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some re-assembly required...","review":"purchased 5 for our church and we like the features. one problem was that 3 of them had the straps assembled incorrectly - attached to the wrong place or threaded through the buckle incorrectly so it was difficult to adjust.

I fits perfectly on my dining chair and allows my grand daughter to eat at the table with us. This chair is very secure with no chance of wiggling out.

It would have just been in the way anyway. This chair is perfect for my little one and she will get years more use out of it!It is true, like others have said that the white tray is very easy for your toddler to learn how to remove. Now my baby tries to remove it and dump her food all the time. I wish it clicked in better or had a latch of some sort.

Well worth the higher price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat!","review":"I read reviews about several booster seats and wasn't enthused about any of them so I take a gamble on this new one from Fisher Price. We used the Healthy Care highchair up until now and have been pleased with it so I felt safe trying the booster seat.It is a great booster seat! Lots of nice features I didn't see on other ones. My favorite feature is the smooth seat that cleans up easily and doesn't trap crumbs.My only complaint with the seat is that my son takes the top tray off and plays with it so we just use the bottom tray with him. It doesn't go in the dishwasher as easily as the top one. But this is not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome booster!","review":"We bought this booster seat when our daughter was around 7 months old. I love it and she does too! It's a great travel booster, and I even use it at home instead of our bulky highchair! My daughter is now 14 months, and at a whopping 26 lbs she still fits in it nicely with the tray attached. When she's older, we'll use it as a booster alone. It attaches securely to chairs, fits in restaurant booths, cleans up in a snap...I couldn't ask for more! And the price is unbeatable! I highly recommend this chair (I just bought another for my nephew!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give this 25 stars instead of 5!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"OMG. I never thought my seven-month-old would ever sit still for a second until I tried the Healthy Care Booster Seat. OMG. My husband and I had not left the house to go out to eat in seven months until we were able to sit our daughter in this amazing seat!!!!! For the first time in her young life, she sat still and played for two straight hours while we ate a luxurious meal in peace. We decided to use it at home all the time. Sometimes, I just sit her in it even when she's not eating. That's how amazing this product is. This booster seat is a MUST HAVE for all babies. Don't even consider buying anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great high-chair","review":"Bought this for my 7 month old grandson who visits us periodically.

I love this booster seat, it looks like everyone else does too!I also just noticed that the age on this supposedly only goes to age 3, but my son is a 3 year old that has always been in the 75th percentile for height and weight. He still uses it daily for meals (we pull it to the table, we only use the tray for travel). We got it when he was 1, and we quickly ditched our high chair. This booster is too easy to use and clean to mess around with a high chair.My neice and nephew also use this booster. My neice used hers until she was 3 and a half, and only stopped then because she wanted to be like Mommy, and sit in a regular chair, not a booster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby pulls the tray right off","review":"I'm not going to write a very long review because there are already over 700 hundred reviews for this product. Based on those reviews I bought this chair. My 11 month old daughter was in it for less than 5 minutes when she pulled the top tray right off, spilling the food onto the floor. I replaced it and she promptly did it again. I would suggest holding on to your receipt, if your child figures out the tray trick then return the chair, if not-- enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably contains BPA and FP refused to tell me what it was made of","review":"I am horribly disappointed. I just got off the phone with Fisher Price, and they cannot tell me whether this chair or the tray contain BPA, or even what it is made of. I was told 'it meets USA requirements' and unfortunately I know that the USA is far behind banning this harmful junk from our babies. It is especially disheartening because the design is working spectacular for my 8 month old, simple clean up and easy to use. I was told there is absolutely no one to contact and no way to find out what this chair is made of. I won't be purchasing Fisher Price again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money Well Spent","review":"I bought this about a year ago for my son. This is the greatest piece of baby gear I have ever purchased. It fits just about every dining chair I'v ever tried. I love how easy it is use. It's super easy to adjust the straps and the height of the legs, as well as attach/detach from the chair. You can use it with or with out the tray, so you can push baby all the way up to the table and eat together as a family. It's portable, and 'folds' into a compact size, the back of the seat folds down (and is also removable) and the tray snaps on the seat. You use one of the straps to carry it. I use this every day. I even take it with me when we go out to eat.Its easy, functional, and grows with your baby/toddler/child. I highly recommend this product, and I'm VERY particular about baby gear. Forget 5 stars, I give it 10. NO COMPLAINTS for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this terrible seat","review":"We purchased this seat for our daughter when she turned one. Seemed like a great option and was inexpensive. After a while, the back of the seat continued to pop off. That was so annoying. We began noticing a bruise along my daughter's lower back at her spine. It would slightly fade and then come back. I became so worried that it might be cancer until I read online that it might be the hard plastic seat pressing on her lower back. As soon as we replaced the seat with the Prince Lionheart Booster Pod the bruising went away. I highly recommend the Booster Pod in place of this terrible seat. The Healthy Care booster seat is so hard and uncomfortable and not safe for their lower backs. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"************ BE AWARE OF THIS SELLER ************","review":"This product itself is a great product.

This happened several times within a 2 week period. I actually bought 2 of these for my two daughters. The second booster had the same problem. I need a booster seat that will last for a long time. If you have kids who like to push back or stretch out in their booster seat I would recommend a booster seat with a thicker backrest. Also the attachable tray with cup holder is so easy to remove that my 3 year old removes it while she is eating, thus causing her food to fall on the floor, making a very big mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for a toddler","review":"I purchased this for my almost 2 year old granddaughter's visit, and immediately sent it back. The tray was too small even for her child size plate, and the item overall was undersized -- maybe good for a child much much younger. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks are deceiving","review":"I had bought this for my son at 6 months old for visiting graqndparents. I really liked the features, but didn't like it once i put my son in it. I loved the idea that it folded up, had a carrying strap, could come apart easily to clean, and the different trays. I thought that the back could be a little higher, he still needed some support, and couldn't sit straight up. Also he is an average size baby, and when i put him in the seat he had just fit, and the seat looked really small with him in it. I returned and bought him a reclining seat with a higher back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be lost without it!","review":"This chair is the best thing I have bought as a new mother! We just gave it for a gift last week. It is so convenient to take to restaurants and to clean after each use at home. We did give up on the white insert tray after John figured out how to pop it off. And we put the blue base tray in the dishwasher occasionally even though it isn't considered dishwasher safe. I love this chair!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"This is great!

Very handy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat, worth every penny","review":"My daughter loves this seat. We have tried all others but they simply don't measure up.

It keeps his hands away from questionably-clean tables and from our plates and cutlery. It is a thousand times more stable than their booster seats OR their high chairs, and we have yet to find a chair we couldn't secure it to. It packs and unpacks quickly, is convenient to carry (although I wish it could fit in the space beneath our stroller - it doesn't), and the trays wipe down while you're out, and go in the dishwasher when you get home. We love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat","review":"I really don't have any complaints about this booster.

It adjusts so the child can be closer to the table when they are smaller. The back folds down and the chair can move in under the table so no one even knows it is there until you pull the chair back out. Very sturdy. Straps on easily. My grandson and his mommy and daddy love it! And it will be around when his little sister is ready for it. You can't go wrong with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat","review":"We are very pleased with this seat. I love that it has 3 height adjustments.

He was 6 months old when we had to use it and I am thinking about getting rid of my highchair at home because this takes up absolutely no space. I would recommend to anyone!

We love it for several reasons. It's a smaller version of a high chair that can be secured onto any chair/stool with a back. It has a cover that keeps the tray nice, clean and ready for use. And it is very portable! I take it with me when I am planning on going out to eat. My son loves it because it's his own chair that he's used to-and I love that it's clean and he doesn't have to sit in the nasty restaurant chair. I have one of the covers that goes in shopping carts/restaurant high chairs, but it doesn't work as well as this & he's not as comfortable with it. I can put whatever I bring for my son to eat on the tray underneath the cover and it's all ready for use when we get to the restaurant. I don't have to worry if they'll have enough high chairs available-we have our own. I recommend this booster seat to all mothers I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite piece of \\"baby apparatus\\"","review":"I only wish we had registered for this item instead of some of the useless things we picked out!

Some of the many advantages include having our own sanitary eating surface no matter where we are (which easily packs away for cleaning back at home), not having to rely on a stable table like the table-mount options, and never being without a highchair.

It was fantastic. It is so easy to carry and fits to any kind of chair (we ate at several different locations and didn't have a problem attaching this seat to any of those chairs). My son loved having his own little tray and I loved that I could just detach the entire tray and wash it off.FYI, the back of the chair is removable so that this will eventually just be a booster seat for an older child. I did not realize that when I bought it, so it was an added bonus when I read that in the manual.I am very happy with this purchase and will recommend it to all of my mommy friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think, JUST BUY IT!!!! It's AWESOME","review":"My 6 month old baby would'nt sit in one position, if on the chair, she will try to turn. It was a major prob for me to feed her anythin bcoz of no stable position in any of the things i used to place her on. I went by the revies of this booster and bought it. It's simply great, it has become my live saver as I can place her on this chair and forget about her safety. She is nicely buckled up, has things to play with on her tray...so now i can take a breather and do my chores.I got the red n white seat as itwas for just $23 also something diff. I love the colour too. Best part is that U can take it around, where ever u want...Earlier, we were considering a high chair, but this is soo much better. I prefer this to a high chair. I can sit comfortably and feed her. We also place her booster seat on our chairs and take it outside. She enjoys it.I love it.I love it..and I simply love it.Go for it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip The Big Highchair","review":"This may be one of the greatest baby product inventions ever.

No cloth to clean in the wash or plastic cushion to get gross.

From what my daughter says I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"We just received this booster and love it! We were originally looking at other chairs with fabric covers and other options but this chair has just what we need for our little girl.

I know some other parents said that their kids were too big for it. I'm not so sure he'll fit up to the max weight, but hopefully he can use this for at least the next year.I really like this booster seat. I'm feeling like we wasted our money buying a regular size one that just crowds up our small kitchen. It attaches and adjusts quickly. It's easy to clean, there's no cervices that trap food.

I didn't want to buy a high chair to keep at her house because of the cost and it would just take up too much space so I did some research and came across this and decided to try it out. I am absolutely pleased with this seat, it's very easy to keep clean, affordable, fits to all different types of chairs, and comfortable.We keep this at granny's house and it's very easy for her to store and it's so light that she can handle it well.This is a wonderful product and I don't know what we would have done without it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great product. Use it for my 6month old. Also worked great for her 3 yr old cousin as a booster seat! Great product and even better price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair!","review":"So we originally bought the typical large high chair that takes up a ton of room at the table. After three frustrating months, I decided to give this a try and I was immediately totally sold!! That was four months ago and I am loving this chair. Baby is able to sit at the table like a real person. It is compact and nonobtrusive. Baby likes this chair (she isn't swallowed by it like the other chair), The absolute best part of this chair though is the ability to clean it. Truly no crevices, just wipe it down after the meal. Baby loves blueberries and tomato sauce and sometimes we don't clean it right after the meal (yeah, sorry not cleaner of the year here!) but suprisingly, no stains on the white. We are going to travel with it this week whiich I am excited about. Simple, cute, clean, and versatile. A truly excellent chair. My only caveat is that your child really must be able to sit well without needing much support as there are no comfy cushions to slouch against."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot live without!!","review":"My son loves to eat using his hands, so this works great compared to a high chair at a restaurant.Only thing is that the white tray comes off so easily.Since that will be the first thing for him to do if I keep it on, I don't usually use the white tray and the green lid won't be attached to the blue table.Maybe when he gets a little older, we can use it.. I hope.We cannot live without this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect minimalist high chair","review":"LOVE this! I have purchased 4 others that took up too much space or sat too high on a chair and this one is perfect (bought two of them).

Best purchase in a while (and you cant beat the cheap price!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"My son loves, loves, loves this booster seat.

He is 14months old now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a great little seat","review":"This is a great seat for small spaces and it's very portable. My 9 month old son seems comfortable in it too. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the removable tray is ridiculous. I 'snapped' it into place and my son immediately got his little fingers underneath the tray and popped it off. It doesn't latch into place on the front (only on the sides and back) so it is very easy for little fingers to remove. I like the idea of the removable tray a lot, but unfortunately this one doesn't work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher-Price Booster Seat","review":"My Mother-in-law sent me the link to this booster seat.

I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and durable","review":"This is one of our favorite baby products we purchased. It's completely functional. We used it at home and took it with us everywhere. It's small but still comfortable for our son who was a large baby (too large to sit in the bumbo chairs). He loved sitting in it.

It's very durable so we'll definitely be able to use it for our other kids too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher-Price Healthy Care","review":"I liked the item because it helped in feeding my baby and I can set it on top of a chair or on the floor.The only problem with this item is with the feeding dish where in the baby can take off the cover by himself in addition to taking off the white feed plate placed inside.

We leave it in the car and take it with us when we go out to eat. It was a lifesaver during the holidays when we went to visit friends and relatives who did not have high chairs. It's not compact so if you want something small this isn't for you. But I did research and ultimately decided that this one best fit our needs. When you turn the straps into a handle, it's easy to throw over your shoulder and bring with you. I also love how it can adjust for different table heights.

Great to take along whenever we're going out to eat anywhere, or even to a friend or family's house. The one thing I don't like is how when it's not in use and you are transporting it, the straps flail around.

I like that the seat is easily portable and has an adjustment height. I'm a little baffled about what to do with the trays because they seem redundant. The reason I want to use a booster is so that he can eat at the table, not out of a tray. Regardless, my son likes the trays sometimes and he prefers the booster over the high chair. Mostly because I think he likes to be part of the table and eat like adults. Unlike high chairs though, food often ends up in his lap when you don't use the tray because there's still a gap between him and the table. Overall I think this is a great booster and could even be an alternative to high chairs if you want to save space in your dining area."},{"rating":"2","title":"$25 alternative to a high chair! Plus it's portable! Works for me :)","review":"We didn't even own a high chair for our baby, and I see no reason to spend the big bucks or give up the space required for high chairs. Plus, high chairs usually have cloth cushions which I do NOT understand one bit! We were happy using this instead. I love that every bit of it is easy to clean (the only non-plastic part is the buckle straps, which yes those get messy too sometimes). And I love that the white tray is removable and dish washer safe. I wish it had multiple white trays to switch out while the other is in the wash, but oh well. Some seats are hard to snap the tray part on and off... we were going to buy a different seat but pulled it out of the box at the store to try the tray and it was SO hard to get on and off. We tried this one and it was easy, so we ended up getting this seat instead and I'm glad we did. We also tossed this chair in the car to take along if we were going to someone's house- it was very handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"We have 2 of these!!","review":"This worked so well for us at home that we purchased one for my Mom & Dad's house for my son to use.

I was using the highchair in the kitchen and this booster chair in the dining room. But it was working so well that the highchairs had to go!!

My 19 month old is 36 inches tall and 40 pounds and fits just fine in the seat. Although, I cannot use the tray because it won't fit over his legs, but I had not intended on using it anyway. I want him to sit at the table with the rest of the family. There are plenty of secure straps so the booster seat stays very stable and secure in the chair. Clean up is very easy and fits very nicely in the dishwasher. I love it and was able to get rid of my bulky high chair to have more room in the kitchen. It's a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who needs a highchair!!","review":"I knew from the beginning, that I did not want a highchair............I always found them to look awkward in a kitchen, and the way they attract food into every corner...just gross.

We switched to using it every day and never looked back. It is easier to clean and portable. The only small complaint I have is that at about 7 months old he figured out how to pull off the white tray that snaps on to the main blue tray by himself. It's not really a problem as I just use the blue tray now, it is very easy to clean with a little rinse in the sink. Overall I would recommend this chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"my nephew loved this seat. we got it when my sister came to visit and we did not have a high chair for him. it fits on most chairs and my sister will even take it to a restaurant with her if she thinks that they may not have a highchair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toddlers, but ...","review":"We love this booster seat for our 14 month old son. It is snug fitting to our chairs and easy to clean. My only compliant is the removable dishwasher safe tray. It is too easy to remove, and my son after one day of use, figured out how to remove it and throw his meal all over the floor. We just put that piece away, and use the regular tray all the time. I think that if we have another baby, I would skip the high chair all together and use this from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good booster seat","review":"This booster is the perfect size for our 13 month old. She seems to like it and feel comfortable in it. We replaced our old booster seat with this one because she could pull the tray off easily. The lower tray on this booster seems to stay in place, so it's an improvement. However, she has figured out how to pull off the top tray, so we can't use it right now. That was one of the features we liked about this booster because you could be washing one and have a \\"back up\\". We can't really take advantage of that feature, but the rest is fine. It fits easily to our kitchen chair and the buckles are easy to figure out. It's also small enough to travel easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this seat. If I had it to do over, I would have purchased this alone and no high chair! The seat is portable, easy to clean (love the ability to put trays in the dishwasher), and sturdy. We've used the seat on all kinds of chairs- restaurant, kitchen, dining room, outdoor. My daughter loved the seat so much if we left it on the floor, she used to sit in it, close the straps and sit (and then ask to get out and then climb back in). She now sits in it at the table without the tray to eat meals. I've compared this seat to other similar types of portable seats - I like this one the best for ease of portability, size (it's compact, but comfortable for a toddler), and cleanliness. The tray with insert is a little small, but not really a major drawback. It's also a good option for keeping at Grandma and Grandpa's house for visits (and can be easily tucked away when not in use)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a feeding chair that's not a mess!","review":"100% Easy to clean up, probably easier to keep clean than any other chair. All the features you want in a chair, plus very easy to take with you to other people's houses - really. Only drawback, size. Highchairs wrap around the sides of the baby to prevent food dropping on the floor, the tray is small on this one and is only in front of the child. (My child's messy.) However, the small size makes it easy to fit in the sink and wash, which you may have to do 3-4 times per day. Easy to fit into dishwasher, too. Even with the small size, I highly recommend this chair. Good for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This seat is excellent","review":"It doesn't get any better than this.

Although I didn't even register for it at first, a friend said it was a \\"must-have\\", and boy, was she right! This sturdy little booster is a workhorse, putting up with curious, sticky fingers meal-after-meal. My son fits in it comforably and I love the convenience of the 3 levels, tray cover and lightweight portability. I've taken this booster seat everyone - friends' houses, restaurants, vacations, and everywhere we go, we get compliments on it. It's a great item for grandma to pick up for those special visits to her house - forget the high chair!My son has used his booster exclusively since he was able to sit up comfortably. I highly recommend this wonderful booster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Grandma's house!","review":"This little high chair works great at our home, plus it's so easy to take it with us. I would recommend this to anyone that needs something and doesn't have a lot of room to store a bigger one. It actually could even take the place of a big one. Very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"great booster seat/high chair","review":"I love this booster seat! It works for baby's first high chair, and is adaptable for as long as kids need a taller seat at the table. Already had one I use for my 3 yr old, and purchased this one for my 6 month old - and plan to use them until they grow out of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER!","review":"I bought this for my 11 month old. I chose this one because it can travel and also for the cover on the feeding tray! My hubby is a germafobe and the cover on the tray is just a great idea. It's easy to open and fold up. Now my child can sit closer to us when we eat out and have her own table to slap happy hands on. The only down side is no cushions, but then it wouldn't travel well. I also will use this to go to friends, perfect for holiday get togethers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Minor Issues But It Works!","review":"Our booster seat's white tray has light streaks of red coloring on it. The white tray doesn't fasten onto the blue tray very tightly but aside from those two issues it works as it is suppose to. We mainly leave it in the car for going out and having a tray cover is a good way to keep the tray clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Chair","review":"I'm happy, baby's happy. Fits in seat, is great to be so easily portable from kitchen to dining room. Have even brought it out on the deck as a little seat for baby since he doesn't entirely sit up on his own and isn't a bumbo fan! Well made, would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portable booster seat","review":"We bought this for my niece (24 lbs, 23 months old -- yes, she's tiny) who was visiting us for a few days. It strapped easily to a normal chair. It was easy to assemble and use. The trays fit nicely in the dishwasher (bottom rack, which had the hotter heating element and did not warp during 4 runnings of the dishwaher)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What We Needed","review":"I really enjoy this product. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the insert & cover fall off fairly easy, so for traveling it is best to leave the tray off. I was interested in the actual tray being covered for sanitary reasons, but overall it is exactly as I had expected!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"super compact, easy to clean, and straps well to any chair. Love this product, you can't beat the price either. So much better than a high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, adjustable and easy to clean!","review":"We are very pleased with the Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat. It's sturdy, compact, adjustable, easy to clean and much more versatile than a bulky high chair. We use it as both a high chair and a booster seat when our grandchildren visit. When not in use, it stores easily in a guest room closet. One caveat--it doesn't attach well to plush dining chairs with heavily padded seats or backs. We attach it to a sturdy, metal folding chair, but any sturdy chair that's not too padded should work well. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the snap on tray lid is too easy for our 1-year old grandaughter to pry loose and we don't use it. Other than that, it's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this booster!","review":"We were using a full-sized highchair for our 6 month old, but it was huge and took way too much space up in our kitchen. Also, the tray was too high for her. So, we purchased this booster and we all love it. She is able to reach her tray easily and can pick food up from it. I debated between getting this one and one of the space saver highchairs and I'm very glad we got this one. So easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"booster seat was great","review":"great. quick. my daughter loves it! new as said. love the two trays... my daughter is off the charts so no point in low weight high chair. this works just as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good seat.","review":"This seat is pretty good for a booster seat. My only real complaint is no harness so it's a little too easy for my wriggling 10 month old to move around. I also don't see it lasting too much longer for her because at the biggest opening its already pretty tight, but she is a big girl for her age (95% for height, 75% for weight). The removable tray is easy to clean though. We got this one for Grandma's house and its great for that. The other one we have is the Safety 1st version [...] and is not as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what we needed.","review":"This booster is just what we needed.It was inexpensive at around 30 dollars each (twins) and it is comfortable and portable.It folds up and the straps that hold it to a chair can function as a carry strap.It is all hard plastic, and easy to clean. The trays are removable and fit in the dishwasher.It makes it possible to carry a diaper bag, a messenger bag, and two booster seats, and a child, in a pinch.It is nice to have them in the car so we are not depending on a restaurant having a booster seat or a high chair.This product would work for a child of any age that can sit in a high chair and hold its head up.I would recommend this for a portable seat, and/or for a permanent solution for home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair... colors not accurate, but better!","review":"I love this chair. It fits well at my table. The buckle stays tight no matter how much my guy wiggles. I have the \\"red/white\\" chair, and much to my delight, it is actually beige and scarlet (or dark red). The darker shades make it easier to keep clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful booster!","review":"If this was made in the USA instead of Mexico, I would have given it 5 stars.Didn't want to spend a lot of money since we only watch our grandson once a week, however, we wanted something functional and nice and this is it. We didn't want a large bulky highchair that would take up a lot of room mostly sitting in the corner of our kitchen. This booster with tray is exactly right for our needs. We can use the tray or take the tray off and push him up to our table. It is portable, which is great when we are on the go since we don't like using public highchairs and boosters due to all the germs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We had a big high chair which was great, but we were finding bubby getting too hot sitting in there. We went on holiday and hired one of these booster seats and were amazed at how easy and practical they were. Very easy to clean. Now we have one the old high chair sits in the corner. Our bubby loves being able to sit closer to the table and it will be perfect as he grows. It's very portable so great to take away with us on holiday next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great- Don't need a highchair","review":"We chose this seat because my husband did not want two bulky highchairs (for twins). So far so good with these seats. Our babies are 4 1/2 months old and they are doing great in them. A baby will need pretty good trunk control before using though since this chair does not recline. It is so pratical for feeding and travel. Easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money, hands down!","review":"This seat is just what everyone says it is! I was skeptical at first because it's so small and uncomplicated, but those are actually the benefits in this seat. It's really nice to be able to strap it to most chairs, fold it down and stick it in a bag to take places, and it's easy to clean/use/maintain as well. Plus it has bright neutral colors that work well in any kitchen. It's lightweight, doesn't have anything on it that can pinch a child and is SO EASY TO USE! Great job Fisher-Price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Booster Seat","review":"I highly recommend this booster seat. It is very light weight so you can bring it everywhere with you including the park, restaurants and play dates. It's also great to just have at the house so when you have any other kids over they have a place to sit as well. You can aslo use th tray which is dishwasher safe or you can just push the chair up to the table and not use the tray for when they get older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Expensive Full-Size High Chairs!","review":"I received this as a shower gift for my first daughter and absolutely LOVE it! I also received a second-hand high chair and I like this booster much better. As a matter of fact - I returned the high chair to its owner. High chairs are so big (and expensive) while this booster fits nicely on your kitchen chair and slides under the table. I purchased another one for my second daughter and an extra one for Grandma's house! Skip the expense of a high chair and get this instead.I used the bouncer seat for my girls as infants and when they could sit up they used this booster. My older daughter is now two and just uses the booster chair to reach the table. The other plus - the tray is dishwasher safe and the whole set is easier to clean than those cloth covers! I know from experience the messes little eaters make and this chair just wipes down - no machine washing a cover after each use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical, no problems","review":"I am so glad I got this booster chair instead of a high chair. It takes very little space and we always take it with us to my in-laws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it but no match for a flip book loving baby","review":"I was so excited about this high chair. I loved the snap out 'plate' as a full tray is bulky to wash. After a week of using it full time, my 9-month old discovered that the tray snaps out like her flip/peek-a-boo books. She pulled it back and sent all of her food trying. We'll continue to use it, but without the tray. The other downside is that the back strap is not long enough to go around our wide dining room chairs. Other than those two items, it works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Booster Seat!","review":"This booster seat is great! Our 4 month old can use it, even though he can't sit up on his own. It fits into a small carry-on suitcase and travels easily to restaurants with the carry strap. I love the tray cover and removable divided plate tray. Everything is washable and the trays snap off and go in the dishwasher. This booster seat also has different heights to fit different tables! This was a fantastic purchase that we'll use for many months to come!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would never have bought a High Chair if I knew how Great this was.","review":"Had I known that this booster seat was this easy I would never have registered for a high chair. Not only is it great for a family on the go, I use it at home as my primary so that our 7 month old can sit at the table with us for meal times, I can only imagine that it will help him have better table manners when he is older.I am going to buy another one so that grammy can have one at her house for all of the grandchildren when they visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my \\"can't-live-without\\" baby items","review":"I love this thing.It's so easy to take with you wherever you go. I've found that most baby items seem to be a pain in the you-know-where when it comes to putting them together, installing them, or moving them. This booster seat attaches to any chair with two clicks and is removed just as easily.Its removable tray has a cover so even if my dear baby makes a holy mess in a restaurant, I don't have to bother cleaning up - I just snap the lid on and off we go.It's easy to carry because the straps that connect it to the chair can be used as a carrying strap. Or I usually hold it by the handle of the chair back.Plus, while at home, we leave it strapped onto one of the dining room table chairs - we don't use a high chair at all. This takes up so much less space. It's wonderful.In a world where so many things are so unnecessarily complicated, it's nice to have something so easy and reliable to use as this booster seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I like it especially because it is portable, we can even carry it while traveling and also to the restaurants so we can use our own chair and avoid germs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good","review":"Really like this product - very convenient and easy-to-use. Great for going out to eat. My only complaint is that my almost one-year-old can remove the food tray herself. It doesn't attach firmly enough, so we just end up using the bottom tray itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great travel chair","review":"This is a great travel highchair. Folds up easily, is light weight and has a protector over the tray so it stays clean riding around in the car. However I did try to use it briefly as a highchair at home and found that with daily use there were an aweful lot of cracks and crevices to clean crud out of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat after a highchair","review":"My son really needed to be transitioned to a seat were he can sit properly at a table ( with out kneeling in the chair) This seat is great. I am sure I will use the tray when we travel but we are trying to get away from the tray thing all together. My son is 19 mo old and he did great in the fp space saver high chair till this point. I am not sure why people are commenting on this booster not tilting properly -- I didn't think it was designed for an infant to start feeding. We should have got it a few months ago when he started climbing on his own into the highchair. Straps securely to out wooden kitchen chairs. easy to wipe down or vacuum out. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this booster!","review":"We have gotten lots of use out of our Fisher Price booster seat. We purchased this about 3 years ago and used it every day for our son. We now use it for our daughter. The adjustable height makes it fit any table, or you can use the very convenient dishwasher safe tray. I love how easy it is to strap onto any chair - the adjustable velcro straps make it a snap. The seat is also easy to wipe clean.The booster folds nicely to make it easily transportable. We take this with us on vacation a few times a year to make meal-time more enjoyable for everyone. It doesn't take up much room once folded and the velcro strap makes for a nice carry handle when your hands are full with all the other kidstuff that gets lugged on vacation.Definitely recommend as an every-day seat or as a travel seat to take to grandma's, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"On our second one... That's good!","review":"Well we bought one of these about 8 months ago and LOVED IT! We decided to take it over to the grand parents and there it stayed! lol We've bought another one for our home because we liked it so much. We don't even use the strap to hold him in unless the front tray is removed. Our son is pretty laid back though and not much of a squirmer. lolOne word of warning... The off white removable tray WILL stain with red sauces like spaghetti sauce, so I recommend removing it and using the brown main tray if that's an issue for you. It will stain the brown as well, but it's not as noticeable. Both will become more and more faint over time if you don't reintroduce more red sauces. Honestly, it's not an issue to worry about IMO.Well made, safe and looks good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for tall dining chairs!","review":"Our dining table is custom built at a height between standard and bar table height, which made choosing a traditional high chair difficult. This Fisher-Price chair was a fantastic compromise. It sits at whatever height your dining chair is and, what's even better, it doesn't take up extra dining room space as a stand alone traditional chair. My daughter loves it and it growing in to it with ease!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a high chair!","review":"The only reason I didn't give this product five star's was because the tray gives me trouble taking it off. I have to pull hard on the sides to take the whole tray off the seat. I think the plastic around the grooves that snap in wasn't shaped correctly,so it makes it a little difficult to come off. Other than that its awesome!The color red is not as dark as the picture shows, but its nice. Doesn't take up much room,easy to clean, and portable (going to try to the portable feature out this weekend). I got this for my daughter when she turned 6 months and she loves sitting in it. I highly recommend getting this booster seat over the others I've seen on here, and believe me, I did a lot of research and comparing. I'm very happy with this purchase, was well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, easy to clean","review":"We purchased this for a special baby who visits us a few times a week. This chair folds up small enough to store on a shelf where I keep large pots and is easy to strap to a chair for a quick meal of strained whatever. Said special baby loves to sit at the table with everyone, something a stand-alone highchair might not allow so easily. Clean-up from our special, but messy, baby guest is a breeze. I just take the chair and tray to the sink for a quick wipe/spray, although I could put the tray into the dishwasher. Five stars for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Booster Seat","review":"I bought this seat for a friend and they have absolutely loved it! It goes everywhere and is highly adaptable to restaurant seats, various kitchen chairs as well as tailgating (chair-in-a-bag). It folds up nicely and is not a space hog. Being dishwasher safe has also been a plus I'm told!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I wish we would have purchased one of these a little sooner. It's so handy to take to the family's home and to a restaurant with easy cleaning and a great price.We also use it at home and our son of one year old at the time really felt like a big boy sitting at the table with Mom and Dad as opposed to the highchair.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini-version of healthy high chair","review":"I like the fisher price full size version of this high chair. I actually returned our first one and went back and bought the fisher price healthy care highchair. I bought this and I love it. It had a removable tray that's great to put in the dishwasher and I also like the cover that goes on the tray to keep it clean. It has 3 height adjustments so it fits any table and has a 5 point restraint. The only thing I would like to see is a carrying strap because when you're trying to carry baby, diaper bag,and this chair...it gets tricky. I would still recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Won't be able to add a whole lot that hasn't been said already, but I got to use this when I was babysitting my niece for the weekend and now I'm looking to get one for my 18 year old. Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so handy for my grandson","review":"This is so much easier than a high chair and you can take it along anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for dining out with little ones","review":"The Fisher Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat is a great purchase. I have the Fisher Price Space Saver high chair at home. I needed a portable chair for dining out and visits with family/friends. I used it twice during the Thanksgiving holiday and was very pleased. The chair is very portable. The seat back folds down, the legs are adjustable and the tray tables snap on for easy transport. The tray table cover is a great idea to keep the actual tray table clean. One of the safety straps doubles as a carrying strap which was helpful. The only drawback is the seat back is a bit on the short side. Otherwise, it does the job for a travel booster seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"I bought this recently for my 20 month-old daughter who showed signs that she was ready to sit at the 'big' table with us. She absolutely loves sitting in this seat! I use it with the tray and sometimes I remove the tray and pull it up to the table. I like the fact that the height can be adjusted as the baby grows. It's also very easy to clean after meals. We plan to take it with us to restaurants (when we start eating out again :)! I wish we had bought this from the beginning instead of buying a high-chair..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this chair","review":"I purchased this chair when my big 18 month old grandson didn't fit it an old high chair. He loves it! It allows him to sit higher while also giving him room on the sides, which is more like what the big people have. He takes the covers off himself until he gets to the blue tray. I leave the chair set up on a chair for his visits, but I'm sure it would be easy to take elsewhere and set up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect.","review":"My only complaint about this seat is that the tray cover only connects in one spot, which is right where the baby sits. This means that the baby can put her hands at the front of the tray and lift up the cover. This is the white cover, not the pink tray itself. But it sometimes means food gets dumped. I think it would work better if there were a couple more notches where the cover snapped onto the tray.Otherwise, I do like this seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"Our kitchen doesn't have a ton of extra space so we decided on a booster seat as opposed to a traditional high chair. I'm so glad we did! Our son loves sitting at the table with us at dinner time. He enjoys it so much that my husband and I can BOTH actually make it through our meal without having to pick him up. It attaches very securely to the chair so it's safe but it's also lightweight and easy to move. The entire thing is plastic so it takes no time at all to clean. I would definitely purchase this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR GRANDMA'S HOUSE TOO!!","review":"Can't say enough good things about this booster. We have had many in our family. Blue & White one for Nieces & Nephews- handed them down to the next babies. Bought the Jungle one for my grandson, now the Red/White one for my house so my grandson has one here too.Easy to clean, Babies to little ones love it! Very easy to travel with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This a very sturdy, portable and well-conceived product. We have used this over past 5 years and have recommended to numerous friends. My kids automatically look for this high chair when its time to eat.This high-chair helped instill some discipline in eating habits of my kids. The chair is extremely portable and easy to use. We have taken it both on vacations in USA and for longer international trips.Simply one of the best investments ever made in baby gear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Grandma's","review":"I initially bought this chair to take on vacation and it was perfect. Compact and light. Now we keep it at Grandma's house so the kids always have somewhere to sit without having to get out Grandma's big bulky highchair. The height of the chair can be adjusted which is great and I love that it has two seperate trays - the only thing that would make it perfect is if the white top tray had grips on the front as well as the back. My 15 month old has figured out how to take the white top tray off while he is eating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable high chair works well!","review":"This portable high chair really works well for when my grandson visits! It's collapses small enough to store in little space as well.I love the fact the food tray is dishwasher safe. Makes cleanup a breeze.My one wish would be for the ability to tilt the front legs up a tiny bit higher than the back since, when strapped to a dining chair with a cushion, the front can lean forward a little, though this is easily offset by just placing a folded towel under the front of the high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!! For home use and going out.","review":"Great purchase...light, compact and easy to carry. We bought it when we went to a restaurant and they ran out of high chairs. We never have to worry about that again. Also, we know where it has been and how clean (or dirty it is). Definitely a must buy..you really do not need a high chair at home if you get this and it is very inexpensive, especially for the amount of use it will get."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS EXCELLENT","review":"My baby loves it. It is confortable, easy to clean, easy to carry and fit to almost any chair. We use it even to put the books and all the toys that our son like and he feels very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good option if you don't want a large highchair","review":"Bought this for my nephew's visits and it works fine. He seems comfortable and I feel confident in the attachment to my dining chair. This may not be a long-term option because at 22-25 lbs he fits fine. The tray is adjustable laterally but not vertically so I suppose he may grow out of it shortly. Nice that it can be used as a regular booster at the table as well. Great for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple design and easy to clean","review":"Have been using this chair for three weeks now and love it. My son is 10 months old and fits great in this chair. It also works great to place him in while I cook, he can watch whats going on. Its really easy to use and clean. The belts come off the chair to wash and the trays fit easily in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat, easy to use, very attractive!","review":"I really loved this seat, it looks great and stayed put. It was very easy to clean and easy to transport. Unfortunately, I did not make it a must all the time and he stopped using it alltogether. Make them stay in if at all possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I was looking for something for my mother-in-law to use when watching my little one. I didn't want the expense of a high chair, and this was the perfect compromise. It is easy to clean, and I love the simple design and colors. The tray table is adjustable, which is nice, because my little girl's belly seems to be growing fast! Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep an extra one in the car trunk","review":"We have one for our toddler to use instead of a high chair at home and we keep an extra one in the car for whenever we eat out. It makes it so we don't have to worry about his food getting everywhere, and he eats right off his tray so we don't worry about whether the table is sanitary or not. For some reason our hyper-active toddler ( usually wont sit in our laps or on a seat next to us for longer than a couple minutes) when sitting in this seat will miraculously calm down and is satisfied the whole extent of our meal. We don't ever feel rushed, which is truly a miracle. We even set it out when on a picnic or camping. Love this chair!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"we have a pub table so I wanted my son up close to us. this works great. cleans up easy and I can pst him right up to the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the job","review":"Needed a seat to travel with and fold down. This one did a great job at that. Study and Very affordable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger of baby getting hurt","review":"The top tray fastens to the product on the inside towards the baby. If you try to remove tray when baby is in seat it will hit baby in the face when it snaps off! I tried to remove the tray to clean the surface and was extra careful not to let the tray hit my baby's face but it did anyway.Also the bottom tray that fastens on the sides does not come off easily. If you encounter a choking situation it is not easy to remove baby from seat quickly. I will be returning product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great alternative to a high chair","review":"I really didn't want a big, ugly high chair to deal with, especially after so many people lamented the clean up. This booster seat is a great value and it totally comes apart for easy cleanup. I am so glad because I mystified by how the food ends up where it does. I haven't taken this to use at a restaurant yet so can't speak to portabilty, etc. But it is pretty compact and easy to use so I can't imagine it would be too difficult. And my 6-month loves sitting up in it and banging on the table tray - yay! It appears to be safe and sturdy, even when he lunges to one side, it stays put (he's 20 lbs.). All in, a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this seat. Very practical!","review":"It's very well priced and very practical.

I had to redo the strap & secure it.Poor quality to have it break 5 mins out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it, my babys not to sure","review":"I thought this was a great idea and it would replace a big ugly high chair. In theory I am correct, but Im not sure how my baby feels about it. I put her in it and she is ok for about 5 min after that she wails! In all fairness she cannot sit up on her own yet so we feed her in her swing until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall risk","review":"I had the same problem as another reviewer with my 16mo old daughter pushing her feet against the table and tipping back her chair. This incident occurred on the first day of use, so it was not just a fluke among many sittings. Our chairs are solid wood and not flimsy. Fortunately, I was quick enough to catch her. Otherwise, she would have hit the floor backward. I imagine this issue is common to many boosters and not just this one.If you were willing to place the chair on the floor, it would be a nice seat for a younger baby. Unfortunately, the tray is already too tight to fit over our daughter's legs, despite the fact that she is slim for her age."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short","review":"too short and doesn't really boost...if you use it just as a chair with the tray it's fine, but your table better be tall or else it won't push in under the table with this seat attached"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher Price Booster Seat","review":"This seat is awesome...

It's stiff and provides nowhere for my baby to rest his head. I like the idea that it's compact but it's not ideal if you want your baby to sit at the dinner table for 20 minutes or more for family dinner. I ended up buying a regular graco highchair instead. He can lean back his head in it and is so comfortable-- he actually will sit in it and play while I cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not brand new. DIrty, scratched used product","review":"This is the second fisher-price product I have bought on amazon that arrived in bad condition. I am so very disappointed because I was getting everything together for my child's first solid meal and opened up the box to clean it. Once I took off the plastic wrap I could tell right away this was a used product. its scratched up pretty bad and there is dirt in the scratches. At first I thought it was just minor dirt from the factory but then I turned it upside down and the little feet underneath it are filthy and show clear signs of being worn down. I guess when someone uses it and decides to return it, amazon just repackages it and sends it to another unsuspecting person.

He's now 18 months old and we still use it every day. He likes it, too. We don't use the detachable tray and cover anymore, since our son likes to take it off. The blue tray prevents him from standing up, unlike when we use the regular high chairs found in restaurants. My husband and I insist this is the best thing we've ever gotten for our son. We use it everywhere...restaurants, visiting family and friends, picnics. We only wish we bought this before we registered for a high chair. I recommend this chair to all my friends who are having babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"I bought this chair because we travel alot with our 14 month old son. It does great. It's easy to attach and easy to carry. The only problem is that there isn't a lot of room in the chair. My son bearly fit! I don't think we'll be able to use it for very long.

Don't get me wrong those big cushy highchairs are super plush and we love them, but this little seat has a lot going for it and is a great alternative to the traditional chairs. It's portable, so when going to a friend's house or relative's for dinner you don't have to worry about where your infant will sit. It straps onto just about any dining chair you have in your house so you don't have to take up extra room in your house with yet another baby item. It's dirt cheap compared to the nice, but big, typical highchairs. So far this little seat has been a great buy for us and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I ordered 2 of these and both of the 1/4\\" ends feel a little loose.

They are suddenly surprised when one of them is confronted with the children from a one-night stand. This throws their life and plans into chaos as promises are made and broken, hearts are broken and mended, and everything ends up alright in the end. Falling into the comedy genre and starring Robin Williams, I was expecting more laughs than what the movie provided. And the few laughs that were given seem too scripted; especially in the scenes with the children. Robin Williams is known for his spontaneity, and there was very little of it in this film. John Travolta seems out of place in this comedy also.

This time he is paired with John Travolta. Together they play best friends from school who run a business together out of New York City. Life is going normally when William's character discovers he had two children from a one-night stand over a decade ago. The movie then becomes a family comedy about one man's evolution from single man to father. There are some funny scenes, such as when the kids mix up the prescription pills of their father. But there are some really stupid scenes also, such as the one featuring the gorilla shown on the DVD case. The characters themselves are believable, but much of the story is somewhat ludicrous. A good example is how the main characters seal a business deal with a Japanese company with unintended actions. Overall, a below-average comedy for 2009.

This movie was so dull and silly and the jokes seemed to be forced on us. I think Travolta should stick to serious roles and Robin Williams should choose the script better next time. I couldn't watch more than 45 minutes of this movie and had to stop it immediately afterwards.I totally regret renting this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Very good movie and a great price.

It featured charactes about whom we had no reason to care. They talked a lot. We fidgeted."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Disney's worst live action films!","review":"I heard that Disney films would no longer show people smoking cigarettes in any of their films. I guess, they don't have a problem with scenes that involve showing a 7 yr old go number 2 on the toilet or Seth Green getting nailed in the nuts with a golf ball.I also find it funny that they have a problem with smoking, yet no problem with Travolta and Williams drinking huge margaritas and getting smashed in a family film. The movie just feels like a movie that was originally meant for adults but toned down to be a family film.John Travolta and Robin Williams have made bad movies in the past, but Old Dogs makes Wild Hogs and Father's Day look good. I didn't laugh that much at all and talented people like Seth Green, Matt Dillion, Justin Long and the late Bernie Mac are all wasted in supporting roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retread at Best - Stolen Ideas at Worst","review":"Nothing creative;nothing new;all retreaded;totally used.To borrow ideas;is one thing;to steal ideas;is everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cast, it tries hard, but.....","review":"Well, we were 0-2 for movies this weekend. We got The Princess and The Frog which stunk, so we put in Old Dogs. With this cast, we thought - good, a funny movie. Well, it tries real hard. However, it just doesn't pack the humor that it attempts to deliver. We turned it off about 45 minutes into the movie and returned it to Red Box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Williams can do better","review":"This movie is not a good reflection on Robin Williams's comedy. In my opinion \\"Mrs.Doutfire\\" was 10 times better then this. As for John Travolta, I've never really considered him to be that funny.Whenever I watch a movie with Robin Williams in it, I usually have high expectations, lets just say these expectations were let down when the credits rolled.Overall, other then a few funny parts \\"Old Dogs\\" is a boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk book for a good library","review":"clearly these guys do NOT know how to write a book, or they do not have the time to do it. this can not be called a book, only some printed pages filled with cryptic information that you can pull off the boost web sites for free.to be fair, c++ code that uses a library with generic programming and excessive type synthesis can be ugly and hard to explain. but hey, if you are given a few hundred pages to explain what going on in ONE library, you should be able to start from the basic and gradually get into the involved details. apparently this is not the case here, everything is thrown at the reader without much explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE BIZARRE SUCKAGE","review":"THIS BOOK MAKES CONSTANT REFERENCE TO THE NOW NONEXISTENT CD-ROM CONTENT.

I was fortunate to find it so many years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little book.","review":"If ever a pagan needed a devotional book like the christians use the bible, then this little book is the one. Ever since I received it, I havent put it down. The prayers for different times of day, problems and seasons seem to fit everywhere. Great Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless","review":"This book is excellent, and a God/dess-send to the Pagan community. First off, I love how Serith goes into the why and how of prayers, offerings, etc. prior to actually giving some of his own work. I definitely felt when I picked up this book around 2002, 2003, that this was deeply important, as I hadn't found much digging into the subject in the community till I ran across this book. Since then I've used it when I've ministered to people in hospitals, for celebrations, and personal prayers as well. A priceless, indispensable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable resource","review":"I find this book an indispensible resource for my morning devotional prayers & for whatever comes up in-between, be it just a crummy day, knowing there'll be agressive traffic on the way home, or looking for another phrase to praise the Lady & Lord at the end of my day.

It was given to me by an acquaintance who had found Jesus (it is funny my spell check doesn't know the word \\"Jesus\\"?) after 10 years of Wicca. She didn't want to burn her books, but she couldn't keep them. So this little green book has sat unread and unappreciated on my shelf for a long time.The author has actually thought about and dissected the very idea of prayer from a pagan perspective. Everything from the spoken word tot he posture to the idea of the offering and all of the whys - not just the words and the hows are addressed and discussed. i don't like all of the prayers presented - some of them are completely not my style, and yet, the thought and effort that goes into each one of them, and the explanation given for every section, definitely makes this book a worthwhile purchase, and beyond a doubt a valuable and thought-provoking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pagan Prayer","review":"This is a wonderful book! It's full of information for praying to the Gods and Goddesses, Spiritual Entities and Deities. It also introduces you to some that you may have never encountered.

But for Wiccan's.","review":"I bought this book looking for \\"Pagan Prayers\\" but, like so many other books out there at this time it is aimed at Wiccans and their strict rules on how thing should be done and not on the less more traditional and looser Pagan. Then on top of that the first 68 pages are spent telling me why I bought the book in the first place things like \\"why we pray\\" and \\" composing prayers\\". Well I bought this book knowing why we pray and wishing to do just that. Next I wanted a book of prayer not a self how to book.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS BOOK if I had it to do over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Heavy MFing Fusion Jam Session","review":"It started as an imprompto jam waiting for Miles and pueblo they hit a groove. Rock, blues, punk, ambient, jazzes ... its all there. Nothing before or after like it. The concept of a Big MFer like Jack Johnson bounding around the ring and punching the [heck] out of his opponents really drives the music at first but then you are blind-sided when it suddenly spaces out with a beautiful Silent Way passage that puts you in another, completely different, incredible groove. Then the fusion jam re-emerges to punch you out again!Miles very sweet and bold. Sonny Sharrock rocks! Herbie mines funk from the organ. Cobham kicks!I never tire of listening to this. Like On The Corner it always amazes and you learn something new after listening to \\"new\\" music, eg rap, avant guarde classical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles Davis is in top form here, radiating musical power.","review":"I go back to this recording over and over again. Jack Johnson was a real hip dude, first black man to secure the heavyweight title. He loved women, cigars, big cars and the fast life. His intense life is here represented with some intense music by the best in the business. McLaughlin's bizarre chord progressions, coupled with Henderson's rich bass playing is almost too much for me to handle when I play this recording. Who needs drugs when you can listen to this lineup of players. Just buy the CD. You can't go wrong with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Out","review":"This album really cooks. The best Davis album from the seventies and a little known gem waiting to be discovered by all those put off by the more inaccessable albums of this period.

A peerless melee of Rock, Jazz and Blues"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lesson In Musical Hipness","review":"WOOOOWWWW! Did this album turn my head around when I first heard it 20+ years ago! Polyrhythms, Polychords, E Super Locrian scale over E7#9 with an \\"A\\" bass. Miles the master displays incredible ability to orchestrate an impromptu session into an inventive artistic statement. Sure he was pissed off at the world, (read the liner notes), but that anger was recycled into the enigmatic, and charismatic jam displayed in \\"Right Off\\". His playing becomes more angry and dissonant as the track progresses. John Mclaughlin is playing power chords reminiscent of Pete Townsend, and Herbie Hancock is playing some horrible K-Mart brand organ, cranking it up to the threshold and sounding great!A great revolutionary Miles album that will go down as one of the premiere Jazz/Rock Fusion statements.Also recommended: \\"Miles Davis: Live-Evil\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"KNOCKOUT PUNCH!!! a recommendation without reservation","review":"Though Miles says this album was the perfrect soundtrack...The first track is one of the funkiest/ most rockin' I've ever heard--the groove is established from the outset, and just picks up. And though this is Miles' album, John Mcglaughlin simply takes over the first track...the heavy distortion makes it hard to recognize him, but his presence dominates the first track.The second track is a bit tamer, but good nevertheless. as on the first track, miles' playing is concise and intense. it really creates a funky atmosphere. and the surprise at the end of the second track is a bit unsettling at first, but it reminds you that the album is indeed a soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you cook using cans of soup","review":"This is a vastly overrated book.

And so we are delivered yet another Kennedyana kernel, this one by \\"New York Times\\" reporter Adam Clymer. The book fails to capture the spirit and humanity of the man; the insights are surprisingly shallow for such a respected journalist.

I've followed Graham for 30 years now and there hasn't been a song or album I could honestly say I didn't like. You can't say that about too many others, even the Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan. But for a Compilation of Graham's first half of his career this is an excellent little set. I don't like the term anthology because that should be reserved for when your done recording or dead, and it's obvious that Graham has a whole lot more to say. I love the fact that he's still out there putting out great records and his final real anthology will have to be at least 10 disks just to get the really good songs in.

It features a nice little song, \\"I dig dirt\\" sung to the tune of \\"Frere Jacques\\" which is very cute, especially if your toddler starts singing it. I really like that there are both boys and girls (and men and women equipment drivers) in the video, while most other construction videos tend to only show men and boys. My 2-year-old (boy) likes it a lot. However, he more often asks for \\"Road Construction Ahead\\" which is a video about how roads are built and has a wider variety of construction equipment (diggers, rollers, graders, etc.). And he even more asks for \\"Farm Country Ahead\\" which he calls \\"the tractor movie\\" and is in a series with the \\"Road Construction Ahead\\" video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"My 3 year old son loves this DVD!

It has a great theme song that my son (almost 3) loves to sing- everywhere, and it is played periodically throughout the video. The video is great for toddlers to young child (full of interesting facts and trivia), and is full of live action clips of different trucks, including the largest dump trucks used at mines, and has short informative interviews (these are very short, and are while the person is doing something, like driving a truck. There is actually a nice little interview with a female driver who comments on people being surprised women can drive the trucks).

This is more like a cassette emulator for the iPod, so you can get back all the winding, lag, and waiting you had with the real cassette deck controls.The whole arrangement of using the deck controls to run the iPod probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but in practice it's a slow, kludgy gimmick.You can still use the iPod controls, but even then, the sound quality was notably bad, too.

The deck would fast forward it, presumably because it thought it was on a blank section of tape? Not sure. Never could get it to work at all, no matter what I tried.Don't waste your money.

Their radio adaptors for the iPod are the best around. This product, on the other hand, is complete junk. From the moment you open the package, you can feel the flimsiness of the product. After inserting it into my tape deck, it sounded as if the tape was constantly being fast forwarded. The sound was absolutely horrible. I have been using a tape adaptor from the early nineties that sounded much better (made by sony.) The sound was completely distorted. No controls worked to do anything to the music (FF / RW) I feel that this product has tarnished Griffin's reputation in my eyes, and I am not sure if I will purchase a product from them again.

But that was the only thing that worked. I was unable to control my iPod using the buttons on my cassette deck (as advertised). When I pressed Fast-Forward (which is supposed to move to the next song) or Rewind (go back one song) the iPod did not respond. Sometimes, if I pressed the button really fast, it would move up a few songs, but that only worked 1 out of every 5 attempts. After fooling around with this piece of junk for an hour, I finally gave up. I also tested this on my friend's car and his cassette deck just spit out the SmartDeck every time. I would strongly recommend avoiding this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively HORRIBLE; don't waste your funds","review":"To say that I've wanted to throw this *smartdeck* out of my car window countless times may be a strong indication of how poorly it works.Never have I encountered a product that works so poorly.

However, what I received this time is the green magma that's made in the US and comes in a plastic container.The original from Japan is much better; it dissolves better in water and is a darker green.

Well, it looked great BUT when we tried to place it on our kitchen chair, the base was bigger than our chair (the instructions say that the base must be completely on the chair's seat). We tried it on FOUR different chairs and it didn't fit on any of them! Apparently you must need an XLarge kitchen chair with a wide seat?

Two other people tried as well including my husband. It required 2 people. Finally my mother tried squating behind thechair and got it to recline that way, but still couldnt get it upright. One person has to hold the buttons in and another has to push the chair upright.

I used it in the reclined position to start with since he couldn't sit on his own. Now he sits all the way up and eats from it three times a day. It is very easy to \\"operate\\", easy to clean, and the back pad comes off easily to wash. I even take it to Grandma's house!

And she's eye level with us when we sit down facing her.I like the removable tray and padding - very easy to wash! I also like the three different reclining positions. She's just now comfortable with sitting up on her own, so we've finally \\"graduated\\" to the upright position.

At 6months she sits in the upright position of this chair and loves it. She never complains when I put her in it. It is VERY easy to wipe clean with damp cloth or sponge.

It is also inexpensive, so we were able to get the same one for our parents' houses.We have never used the reclining feature, so we can't comment on that.

The tray is dishwasher safe, and the chair pad is machine washable (and doesn't bleed if washed in cold water). The only draw back is that it is often difficult to get the strap that fastens around the bottom to keep from moving.

Less than 5 years after achieving such creative peaks, Mingus died as a result of ALS (nicknamed \\"Lou Gehrig Disease\\") in 1979; it's a shame, in the sense that his profile was finally elevating to the place it had always belonged in 20th Century American music.

The binding is on the right instead of the left. The name of the book is on the back cover and the beginning of the book starts at the back of the book. The copyright information, the contents, and the preface starts at the back of the book. It is a little disconcerting when reading this book as I must always remember that I am moving from right to left instead of the normal movement from left to right. I don't know why I was sent a copy in this condition.

This album has a very soul/r&b-based sound which is played with great fire and emotion. The first half is stellar, but the second half has a few really bad songs which dampens my enthusiasm.Rahsaan sounds amazing at one point in 'Old Rugged Cross' where he's playing two or three horns at the time without any pauses. It's the only instance of I've ever heard of; definitely a unique person.Overall very good and recommended for your more R&B funk jazz fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"This is the poorest quality, poorest designed model I have ever seen from Revell, and I have seen a few. I have bought 2 of these kits, and they are going into the garbage. The plastic is inconsistently thin, too flexible, and the parts fit so poorly it can't be assembled.

Not just that but the delivery job was horrible to. When I received it in the mail the box was all beat up and dented and when I opened it some of the pieces were already broken.

I recommend you don't waste the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Testors SBD Dauntless Dive Bomber in 1/72 Scale: Disappointing overall quality","review":"I had to spend several additional hours more than I am used to to assemble this kit. That's because I had to modify the kit parts to make them fit properly, as they should have in the first place! Also, there was excessive mold-flashing on most of the parts. Prepare for lots of seam-scraping, my friends. You WILL need to buy some seam putty as well, which is NOT mentioned in the poor instructions. Also, the canopy is much too small for the aircraft. Beware! Don't let a low-dollar kit price suck you in! It is MUCH more enjoyable building a model that is precision-manufactured. Mine had low-tolerance molding and was also was sorely lacking in attention to detail! There are other better-quality brands available, such as Hasegawa, Airfix, Tamiya, as well as others. Next time I will pay a few dollars more for a much higher quality product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This model is too simple for words.","review":"Although I knew this model wasn't rated high on difficulty, I wasn't prepared for how much detail was missing, how low the tolerances were or how non-instructive the instructions were.

I am allergic to most topical acne treatments so I figured I would give this a try. It worked GREAT for about 6 months- and then my skin got worse! I ended up with painful, cystic like acne near my jawline and chin and I had NEVER had acne there before.

I tried every product you can imagine including proactive & antibiotic prescription pills but nothing worked. I went to a dermatologist & the topical RX products they prescribed didn't work either. This product didn't cure my acne but reduced break-outs by about 50%. I only take 1-2 tablets daily instead of the recommended 4 daily. I also do regular 20% Salicylic Acid Peels on myself (every 3 weeks) . Murad combined with the peels have completely transformed my skin. Someone even accused me of having a face lift because my skin looked so much younger! I also noticed after about 3 weeks of taking the pills my energy levels increased. After doing research on the herbs contained in these pills, a lot of them help the liver clean the blood which explains why it would help with acne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work At All","review":"I bought this product for my 18 year old son and it did NOTHING for him.

Very upset that it cost me so much and got nothing in return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be!","review":"Product very expensive and you have to take it three times a day ~ so you need at least two bottles for an entire month.

After reading a review that sugguested taking two tabs twice a day. It works on clearing up skin. From inside out, with stress and the not so good food out there tempting us, give you a little extra help. It works wonders when used with the acne complex kit, on a daily basis.It does cost, but your face is the first thing people see. It is great to get away from the embarrassment of breakouts. Great to figuratively shine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter ...","review":"I only spent [money] on this one and it wasn't even worth that much.

At least that one is free."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the American Revolution has changed the world","review":"This charming little book helps remind us just how revolutionary the American idea of liberty and government by the people was when first proposed in the Eighteenth century... and how revolutionary it continues to be in certain parts of the world even today. Reading these excerpts, the one feels as if each of the witnesses called upon to testify spoke to the reader directly from his or her portrait on the opposite page. My favorite passage is from Thomas Paine: \\"From a small spark kindled in America a flame has arisen not to be extinguished. Man finds himself transformed, he scarcely perceives how.\\" The American idea has truly transformed the world more than we often realize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The quality of the materials is very good.

I remember in my teens readingthat masturbation was a sin but they didn't give one singleverse from the Bible that said so.

It was many manymore years before I could tell someone else that masturbationwasn't a sin. This book will help you be brave to says whatthe Bible says.

I am a firm believer that you do not need church or the lies they tell in order to have a relationship with your creator. I believe that this should be standard reading in high school level kids. The damage done to people in the name of religious law is just unbelievable!

He is so charming and handsome in this role. Both leads have wonderful chemistry.

It really holds a lot and has simplified my earring selection process greatly. I had my earrings before in a standard jewelry box, but they kept getting tangled, tarnished, and broken.

Also, this beast has a propensity to fall over, which can create a mess of earrings that takes awhile to set back up.It also came with a very strange religious insert when it arrived that really kind of freaked me out (and what religion has to do with earring racks, I don't know).

It is fine if your earrings are on posts, but if you have many which are on the u-shaped hook, they are very difficult to mount on the display. Between the small hole and the distance between the hole and the outside edge of the acrylic the U hook on many of my earrings could not be threaded through the hole.

But I am using them by 2's, not all 4 open. What is nice is that you can fold up and stick in jewlery box.

I have Sweet Romance Jewlrey and I put all the earrings on one and use the other for non matching sets (with necklaces)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken and Disappointed","review":"The earring rack was so poorly packaged that it was broken into several pieces by the time it arrived.

My choices then were to either: 1) ask for a replacement item and hope it also wasn't broken, or 2) eat the cost of the shipping (x 2, as I had to pay the original shipping and then pay to return it).

I used to use drawstring bags for my earrings which worked for a while. As my collection grew, the drawstring bags didn't cut it anymore. The folding holder fits around 180 pairs of pierced earrings and is easy to fold up and carry without dropping any earrings off. It does not work well for holding post type earrings if you use the small metal type clasps on the back. But if you get those ones with the plastic ring, it works fine and the plastic ring type also helps flabby earlobes hold the posts better :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most earrings don't fit on this screen","review":"This is the most ridiculous earring holder on the market. I bought a two-screen holder many years ago and love it, but I've since acquired many more pairs of earrings and need more storage space. I looked on the internet and in stores for months before buying this product. But what a disappointment! The bottom set of holes on each row is too high to accommodate any earrings except posts. Notice in the photo that even the earrings shown don't seem to fit right.So just when I was about to toss the thing, my engineer husband asked what would be needed to make the product work best. I said that the holes needed to be placed on the lower edge of the row so all earring could dangle. So he drilled new holes! Now the product is perfect.If you don't have a drill or a handy friend, don't buy this poorly designed product. Keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy and lightweight..","review":"I was very disappointed by this item. Yes, it folds and appears to be sturdy, but in reality, it also unfolds and collapses quite easily. There's something about plastic holding up over 120 pairs of earrings that now makes me nervous because you'd be surprised how much 120 pairs of earrings actually weighs. When this unfolds and falls, earrings break. Also, the holes are drilled very close together which makes taking off post earrings difficult because not only are you trying to balance the holder, you also have to pull off earring backs in too small a space. This was what I was doing when my display unfolded and fell flat on my dresser, cracking one of my crystal earrings and dislodging a stone from another. I now use this display only for wired earrings and purchased one of the metal harp displays to hold my post earrings. The metal displays were so much more stable and cost only a few bucks more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution","review":"I loved the idea that this earring tree folded. All the decorative ones take up so much space. But as other reviewers have noted, the constuction is shoddy and the design is poor. The holes are too small so it is a struggle to get earrings on and off of it. If I can't get a pair of earrings in a moment, then why not just keep them in an old fashioned jewelry box? But worst of all, the thing tips over very easily and the first time it did, it broke. Taking my earrings off to return it, it tipped again and broke in another place. Waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat design idea that works well for most earrings.","review":"I really loved this item when I got it.

I don't know why there have been complaints of not being able to hang earrings with french hooks. Mine fit perfectly.

Previously I have been using a jewelry box with small dividers but it takes too much space and very cumbersome to take the jewelry box out. So, my goal is to look for something compact and easy to work with.Pros:- holds lots of earrings- Easy to browse through your collection- Easy to try different pairs and put it back to the rack.- Space saver- holds earrings well. I move the organizer in and out of a small cabinet and nothing ever falls out.Cons:- it's a bit tacky, but it's not as tacky as I thought it would be. I keep it in a cabinet out of sight.Granted, it's not the velvet luxury jewelery organizer that makes each pair of earrings look dazzling, but it's very practical, takes very small space, and it's only $15. For the price and utility, I give it a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective","review":"Easy to use, effect. Even my biggest dangling and hoop earrings fit and I can't still fold it closed.

My friend says that his Ruby is \\"addicted\\" to the twelve codes he put on it. If he starts it up without those twelve codes, it starts malfunctioning.

Remember, there is no way to download codes directly back into the unit. Once deleted, it's gone.My son has been using the action replay for GBA for several months now without a problem. All of a sudden today, he turns it on and all the games and codes are deleted. Why did this happen? You cannot delete all the games at once, only one game at a time.

Then all in the same sitting it stopped recognizing Fire Red and emptied all data. It had no more games and cheats saved. He was beside himself. You cannot get your money back for opened electronics so we're going to have to bite the bullet on this one. Very frustrating.

My daughter is 6 years old and spells at a 5th grade level. I'm not sure that this toy contributed to her spelling ability but it could have only been beneficial. The only negative that I have for this toy is that it takes 3 cell batteries and if your child plays with it as much as mine does this toy can become very expensive very fast. I am now considering the Expert Turbo Twister which takes AA batteries since I really don't want to spend another $10.00 to make the Mindmania operational again.

The book is very well written and the authors obviously know their field. However, so far the book feels hurried. The authors only touch on complex ideals without explaining them.

Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over engineered model","review":"Revell attempts to make this 1/48 scale model as precise as the real P38J Lightning. This creates big problems because the parts must be absolutely correct in size,shape to fit together exactly. That often didn't happen resulting in subsequent pieces not connecting,leaving gaps on the fuselage and engines. Additionally,gluing the landing gear doors was nearly impossible since the surfaces are razor thin. Many of the parts were so tiny tweezers were needed to put them in place which only worked sometimes.Assembling the nose cannons was a joke, too many large parts in too small a space. The decals were the worse I have ever experienced even though the directions were followed closely. The color directions for the Bong version were completely different than the color artwork of his plane on the box cover. I'll never buy another Revell model."},{"rating":"1","title":"So cheap product.","review":"This is the worst plastic model I ever experience in my life. The plastic is so cheap, the details are not organized as it should be, NO map to parts and I think the greedy production company chose the cheapest Chinese manufacturing company to produce this this models. I am NOT recommending this company products at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightning","review":"This was a very fun model to build. I usually have a lot of trouble with making Revell models on account of fitting issues. This kit however was very fun to build. Parts fit well with little putty needed. If you are a halfway decent builder you can make this kit look awesome.The only tricky part i found was fitting the nose and guns through the holes.I chose to build the Marge version of this kit. I might buy another to build the Night version of this,which is Gloss black with night spying equipment.On a side note ,i did not go with the specified paint scheme of the superchargers. I painted them olive drab,copper fins,aluminum rings and flat black wires. Its a little more detailed but it really stands out and looks nice against the aluminum paint.For the body color i used Tamiyas bare aluminum spray."},{"rating":"2","title":"best plane ever","review":"this plane is extremely fun model to build you can build 3 different versions the night fighter the fighter bomber and the path finder all them look really good and detailed once you finish it so buy it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific model","review":"Excellent model for the price with decent detail.

I need a lot of the smaller shrinks to work on internal computer wiring/customization and this kit includes a nice quantity as well as varieties the those smaller tube diameters. So sure, twenty bucks is a bit steep for shrink tubes, but when you go to use them that sting will disappear quickly as you have everything you need to do the job at your reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"2:1 shrink as it is","review":"Bought 3M brand shrinking tubes set at Walmart which is much more expensive than this one. However the expensive shrinking tube does have higher shrinking ratio. As it is stated 2:1 ratio in this product, i guess it did 2:1 shrinking well. No more i had wished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hobby package","review":"This kit has a variety of sizes and colors and a nice study plastic case that fits in my hobby bag nicely.

I will buy it for friends and definitely check out more Wiesner books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for Grandparents and Grandchildren","review":"Flotsam is my favorite gift for new grandparents. The colorful pictures of this wordless book appeal to children who are working to develop language. Older children fill in the story line. Grandparents, too, are drawn in by the detailed illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book with no Words","review":"I bought this book for a 4 year old niece who loves to tell the story of a book, even if the book comes with a written story. She loves the ocean so this fits into her life experience just perfectly. Wonderful pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPEECHLESS!!","review":"When I first saw this book, I was blown away by its ambitious art. From the opening of the page, the readers are treated with beautiful illustration of all the things you might find at the beach.Every brush stroke was ever so carefully applied even to the minute detail as if Mr. Wiesner wanted to create a masterpiece. I'm glad there is no text because that might be a distraction from his every so fine-tuned illustrations; picture does speak for it self.I've read his other book, \`The Three Pigs', this book raises the level of illustrations by a couple (which is an understatement) notch, and that book was something to behold.This book truly is an achievement; a well deserved Caldecott Medal winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun! invites deeper thinking. Pictures only","review":"This book was interesting, somewhat surprisingly I guess, as it tells a story so well, despite not having any words. It definitely invites further, deeper thought. It starts with a boy who has a camera. He develops the pictures, and sees fun pictures of possible life under the sea, and then a picture of a child holding the camera, and other pics. When he looks at this closer, he realizes one of the pictures the child holds is of another child holding a bunch of pics, and so on....My kids liked it, but I think that I maybe liked it even more, just because it was such a cool idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flotsam","review":"Even though this is a picture book without any words, it takes some sophistication to get the meaning of the story, I would say it's for older children and not the pre-K set"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The pictures are worth 1,000 words and then some. A wonderful gift for a child, of any age, especially someone who loves the beach. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops my list of children's gifts to give","review":"What can be said about a book that speaks volumes, yet includes no printed words?This stunningly illustrated, inspiring story of a boy who finds a magic camera at the seashore and becomes part of a unique chain of story tellers is an enveloping odyssey through time, seasons and truly magical destinations. Wiesner's illustrations are so whimsical they are transcendental, carrying even the most guarded reader into a beautiful world where one is willing to believe that giant starfish islands and underwater street scenes really do exist, simply because Wiesner was clever enough to imagine them. I'm not sure if this book is for children or adults, but both will delight in becoming a part of the author's serene, watery world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story - no words","review":"This book does a remarkable job telling a story without using any words. The images and ideas caught my sons attention and sparked his imagination. I'm happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative. Brilliant. Fun.","review":"David Wiesner makes amazing children's books, and this story/art-series is my favorite! Flotsam takes the reader on the most incredible voyage, with different story-lines that will hold the interest of readers of all ages. There are no words, but the detailed pictures tell stories within stories. It starts with an inquisitive boy at the beach, and the most shocking part of the book, is that the young scientist brought his microscope with him! He builds a sand castle then a wave washes it away. But the tide leaves an old camera... and the adventure begins. The camera captures images of the inner workings of sea animals and the interesting side of ocean life that is hidden from human eyes. This book is creative, fantastical, and beautifully illustrated. If you don't love it, you might want to see a therapist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture-perfect","review":"Hooray for David Weisner! Just when you think he's done it all, he comes up with another clever story - told through the brightly-colored masterpieces of each page. Wordless books are wonderful springboards for children to tell their own stories and Wiesner provides many opportunities for that. I especially appreciate his attention to detail in all of the photos of children, past and present.

It is great for family time and is the one book that there are no fights over my lap with. Warning: You must tell your preschoolers that the camera in the book is special and that the cameras we have at home will break. We found that out the hard way.

This is just another in a long line of disappointments. I have never found a Marvel game worth the $ you shell out for it. If you really must have this, wait a few months or find it used.

Now Wolverine has to go back to Canada and start his quest to find his creators and the antidote to the virus. Beast and Professor Xavier help Wolverine as he finds clues to his creators and the antidote. In this game you fight old and new enemies like Magneto,Sabertooth,Wendigo,and Juggernaut as you go deeper and deeper into Wolverine's past.This game is avaliable in all three consoles Playstation 2,Gamecube,and Xbox.

So many Levels of the game kept me from having fun, so I was able to beat the game rather quickly, so many bosses were difficult to fight and figure out how to defeat. I will be able to return the game before my 7 days are up and return it for a full-refund/or exchange with a game of equal value. Not a fan of this game at all, had so much potential but alas its not all that great of a game and yes Im a fan of all X-men/Wolverine related stuff but not a fan of lying."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't fight Omega Red even though he is released","review":"This game was pretty cool. Mark Hamill does the voice of Wolverine. Only a few other X-Men, Colosiss, Rouge, Professor X and Cyclopes. When you face Magneto he repeats the same lines over and over,also he is hard to find. Magneto and Omega Red have been released from a maximum security prison, and you as Wolverine must find and fight them. My only complaint is that Omega Red is not in the game other than being released. So they will make another one that will have Omega to fight. The graphics are cool and the game play is good. There are extra movies that are cool. I recomend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Game","review":"If you are a fan of the comic book Wolverine (forget the X2 crap), then this is the game for you...With action from the Weapon X days to current, this game plays just like a great story from the comics...Long time Wolverine writer Larry Hama put together a solid story with great action, challenge and innovative gameplay....A bit violent for younger gamers due to the animations of his stealth claw attacks, but for those who have \\"The Uncanny X-men\\" # 133 will love to play this game!!! The \\"berserker rage\\" is right on the money!!I highly recommend this game if this is your genre (action & adventure) and you love the classic Wolverine (cockrum, byrne, smith, lee) (I stopped collecting around 350)...A great Marvel game like this is long overdue!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished","review":"Wolverine's Revenge is a game in which you get to fight bad guys, activate switches, fight bosses, and, oh, fight more guys. The creators of WR were probably in a hurry to finish the game before X2 came out, and it seams somewhat unfinished.The fighting in WR is repetetive and will get boring after a couple of hours. Once you hit someone, or someone hits you, you are locked in fighting mode until you can get out. It sometimes can be hard to do, and it gets very frustrating.Perhaps the worst thing about this game is that is way to easy. Just fight some guys, find a corner to heal, and go on to the next bunch. I don't recomend this game, unless you are a huge Wolverine fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointing Game","review":"I played this game, and soon I had concluded that this game was purely horrible. It seems like a game to look forward to when Spider-Man came out and it seemed fairly well. But Wolverine's Revenge is nothing like it, and is purely a dissapointing game. The gameplay is ok, but otherwise it seems like a really bad game. The graphics make the characters look horrible. Patrick Stewart is at least voicing Professer X's voice, which makes the sound pretty decent and the music is pretty good, but otherwise this game was one of the most dissapointing. The fighting isn't very good either, and the first boss battle against Sabretooth gets boring soon, because the battle is purely made out of jumping behind Sabretooth and grabbing him and throwing him into objects."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love The X-men","review":"I have seen a first hand look at this game and it looks good.

They have no real value to a girl. They are uneducational and not very sturdy at all. What's worst is the fact that girls as young as 6 years old are playing with Bratz! I hope they get out of style as soon as possible.Also, another important concept, is that beauty isn't everything. Bratz can encourage girls to want to be beautiful, flashy, and model like. I know this for fact with my niece. Even if these dolls are pretty, which I don't think so myself, it doesn't have anything to do with their value of education.

I bought this DVD based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video. If you want a DVD that shows airplanes/jets flying, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The name of the video should be, \\"Watch the Blue Angles Get Ready to Fly,\\" because that is what this video is. In the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying. Then the next 25 minutes is NO FLYING just talking and showing the Blue Angles getting ready for their show. In the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show. My son has never made it to that point.

I can honestly say that this one, which brings the War of the Lance and the stories of the Heroes of the Lance (the main surviving ones: Tanis, Caramon, Raistlin, and Tasslehoff) to a final conclusion, is definately one of my favorites. Thrilling plot and good characterization."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it!","review":"Hey, not bad. This is the only book in the Legends I enjoyed. Great battles, great plot. I recomend this book to any fantasy fan around. It is enjoyable and a great book, buy it, read it, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still not disappoinated.","review":"Test of the Twins, was another terrific book written by two of the greatest authors I have ever read. I was first introduce to these authors by the first book in The Chronicles series, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, and I thought there could never be another series to match that one. I was wrong, the Legends trilogy, dare I say, surppassed the Chronicles. Here you are in another adventage with the twins, Carmon and Raistlin, and the irrepressable kender, Tasslehoff. Now, in this book it's the last and finale showdown between the twins. This book has everything a good book should have drama, comedy, terror, and ... love? This is a wonderful book in a long line of great books. In closeing all I have to say is Weis and Hichman, keep it going."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great end to a great series","review":"Weis and Hickman do it again. The end of this series will not disappoint Dragon Lance fans. The time traveling in this book explains much of what happens in the other 2 legends books and the chronicles books. I am already past the second part of Dragons of Summer Flame and must say that this book is not a disappointment at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"From Raistlin's visions of his childhoods while in the Abyss to Caramon's final view of his brother through the portal, Test of the Twin is dripping with the best and most moving writing there is. With Raistlin's ambition, Caramon's love, Crysiana's faith, Tanis's good natured frustration with Tasslehoff and Lord Soth's lust for Kitiara's soul, this book has the best characters I have ever had the honor of reading about. This book moves me so much, that when Raistlin fell asleep, hearing Caramon say \\"Look Raist, bunnies\\" I put the book down and cried out of joy and sadness... a must read book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 3 In One Of My Favorite Trilogies","review":"Everything Raistlin has been working for plays out in this book. Sacrifices are made and personalities are revealed as truly multidimensional.Tas, enveloped in an adventure he doesn't quite understand, continues to make an outstanding companion. Though a Kender, the threats faced to his friends evoke almost human emotions in him.Every Dragonlance book I have read is a page turner. The ending to this book was both sad and uplifting. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A god in the making!","review":"Well if you enjoy dark wizardy and battles this is one for you. What makes this final book so good is the time you've invested till now in the character named Raistlin. He has got to be one of the best and most beloved characters in fantasy...kind of sick when you consider how mysteriously good and insanely wicked he really is. Perhaps we love him so much because theres a little bit of Raislin in all of us. BUY THE TRILOGY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two of my favorites","review":"This is the first time two of my very favorite Star Trek episodes have landed on the same DVD. The lack of a set in The Empath is a big part of why I like the episode so much. The completely black background gives the story a spooky, nightmarish quality. Also, the alien makeup in this episode is as good as you'll see during the original series. The Tholian Web is a classic worth the price of this DVD all by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Bedfellows","review":"Two completely different episodes. The Empath is a strong lesson in morality played out on the worst production set of any TOS episode - basically an \\"empty set\\" with blackness all around. They probably saved money but the good story line was weakened by expecting the audience to stretch to accept no set, no props, no lighting, etc. The Tholian Web alone is worth the price. It won a Sci-Fi award (sorry - the name escapes me) and is a textbook action Trek episode. One of their all-time best, especially how Spock & McCoy acquiesce to work together in the most dire, nail-biting situation. A must have for TOS fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, not as pictured...","review":"I ordered this because it A) came up in a search for \\"cage nuts\\" and B) because the picture shows a set of cage nuts, washers and screws.This product is just the screws.

With Rahsaan, you don't want to be missing anything. My preference for Rahsaan is actually for box sets that are entire albums like Aces Back to Back, or Dog Years in the Fourth Ring, etc. Don't avoid buying this box if you just want a little, but get hip to rahsaan and accept the fact that you can't eat just one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice intro to an eccentric genius","review":"Kirk was one of the most unique and talented jazz musicians of the 60s and 70s, a real innovator who is sometimes unjustly passed off as a novelty act because he would play two or three instruments at once. This compilation serves as a great introduction for those who don't know his music. Although the selections are not chronological, the set does hold together very well and does a great job demonstrating the breadth of his talent and his ability to incorporate a number of different styles into his music. I would still recommend picking up the full albums (start with \\"We Free Kings\\"), but those who are looking for a nice compilation to sum up the man's prime years should give this a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"one small error","review":"I read this book a few years ago and have recently had the opportutnity to perue through it once again. It is a well written and cogent piece of scholarship. It is however a little lacking in it's treatment of the very vocal right wing of Orthodox Jewry during the relevant period, and is thus not a comprehensive study. There is also one factual error which I wish to point out and correct. In chapter one of the book the author states that Cantor Zawel Kwartin was cantor in Temple Beth El in Borough Park, Brooklyn. Kwartin was not the cantor in Beth El, an Orthodox synagogue, but was the cantor on Comgregation Emauel, a conservative temple in the same neighborhood. The chazanim at Beth El were: Jacob Rappaport, Mordechai Hershman, Berele Chagy, Moshe Kousevitsky, Sol Zim, Moshe Stern, Rueven Blum, and curently, Ben-Zion Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"If you like Porcupine Tree, OSI, Rush, Riverside, Dream Theater or other such musical greats then you will love Abigail's Ghost. What a great debut! AG are true musicians and display their talents well, there are plenty of examples throughout the cd. You will hear a range of musical styles from heavy metal prog to acoustic ballads including phenomenal atmospheric layers. There is a lot going on in each song...My only wish is that there was a little more clarity of instruments, especially voice and keyboard. In places they seem to be muddled in the extreme background. Some guitar solos were also not well defined.Overall a great release, definately one of my new favortie bands! I look forward to AG's next release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of prgressive rock","review":"This is simply one of the best albums I have heard recently. Sure it sounds like Porcupine Tree/Steve Wilson projects as others have alluded to; so what. In my mind there is a distinct difference between a band that copies another and so sounds like it is a copy as opposed a band who are their own sound but that sound just happens to sound like someone else. Make sense??To make a debut album of this quality demands great talent and these guys have it. When I read they are an American band I was floored. In my opinion the USA does not do original prog rock well and nowhere as good as the Brits. Give these guys every encouragement, we need more bands like this.Summary: You will not stop playing this album. Its simply that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better books available","review":"I started using this book to study for the CompTIA Security exam, and it seemed to cover the topics necessary to pass. However, most parts only gloss over the details, and there are some rather poor examples that complicate rather than help explain some topics.

What a great way to ensure your company gets a reputation for putting out crappy products. After I installed the gate, I was counting the days the plastic components would start breaking. Sure enough, it took 11 days of light use and the plastic hinge cracked and flew in all directions. Employing plastic hinges for heavy metal gate runs contrary to most manufacturers' intuition, but not this one. Until they start using better materials, my strict recommendation on this product would be to take a pass. If this on-line rating system allowed a score less than \\"1\\", I would give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a while...","review":"The gate worked well for about 3 months. Soon after we installed the gate, we noticed that the gate began to sag due to its own weight. We were unable to close the gate by swinging it shut. Instead, we had to lift it into the lock mechanism because it was sagging. Even after some adjustments, the gate would continue to sag. Finally, the weight of the metal gate finally got to the plastic hardware and the plastic hardware snapped off the wall (with metal screws still in the wall). Maybe it would have lasted longer if we did not put it in a high traffic area? Now we are looking for a shorter swinging gate with add on panels that remain stationary, with metal (rather than plastic) hardware. Hopefully, the weight of the shorter gate will keep it standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"This gate could have been a great product. But for some reason, probably money the manufacturer made a nice STEEL gate with PLASTIC hinges. We counted the days it took for the hinges to break. Well 2 1/2 weeks later it broke and ruined my wall with holes and a big mark from the fallen gate. The gate then fell on my son. This is a nice-looking gate with shoddy hinges. If only the hinges were metal. This product was not cheap and the manufacturer should have went the extra mile and used the right materials. Instead we have chairs holding the gate up as we wait for new hinges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth one star!","review":"This is the worst gate out there!

The second time, he had a gash in his upper gums and was bleeding profusely! There is a serious flaw in the hinges of this gate. After the first time, I contacted their customer service through email. A CS rep emailed me back a few times (Maddy Stephens) but when it came to getting replacement hardware the emails stopped. (By the way, this gate came with the NEW metal hardware they made to replace the \\"defective\\" plastic ones they used to use!) The second time my child was injured, I called. I was on the phone for appr. 10 minutes before the CSR offered an apology. She did, however, offer to send a new gate \\"as soon as possible!\\" 6 days later..I dont have a replacement gate and it just fell on my other twin.

We are using the gate to block off a 60\\" space, between the dining room and the kitchen, so it gets fairly frequent use. We are also using all 3 panels.

Boy, was I wrong! I had a friend install it for me. He is very handy and it took him about an hour. This metal gate is very heavy and some genius over at Summer Infant created plastic hinges for this heavy, metal gate. After 2 weeks of use, the top hinge came out of the wall (screws, anchors and all) We had to reinstall the hinge with longer screws and bigger anchors and the gate was never the same. It sagged and a few days later, the top hinge actually cracked in half! I called Summer Infant. They are out of stock on this hinge because they have had so many calls and complaints and they ran out! According to Summer Infant, they redesigned a new, sturdy, metal hinge. I ordered a new hinge 2 weeks ago and it is still on back order. Summer Infant claims that I will receive my new hinge the end of next week. We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLASTIC HINGES PIECE OF JUNK","review":"It took two weeks of lite use for the plastic hinge to crack and let the gate fall and put a huge scatch on my wall.

We knew it wasn't the best, but there are VERY few gates to cover 70 in. The anchors it came with were plastic, so my husband used anchors rated for over 100 pounds so the weight of the gate wouldn't pull out of the wall. That wasn't what broke. The chinsy little plastic mechanism it swings on is what broke. Also, the gate does not contract within itself when you open it, so it takes alot of space to clear in the room. The closing latch starting sticking several months ago. We put off replacing the gate because there are so few options for that large of a doorway."},{"rating":"1","title":"METAL GATE with PLASTIC HINGES","review":"I did not realize so many bad reviews before i bought it.

It is so heavy that after having it installed for less than 12 hours it pulled out of the wall. We used anchors and it just ripped right out. It is also very hard to open and close.

I wish it were a little deeper allowing more filling (it holds about 2 cups of filling) but it gives a boring bunt cake some pizzaz. Here are some tips. Only fill the bundt pan until it barely will touch the bottom of the tunnel of bundt pan. I have a ten inch cathedral bundt and I used a 9 cup recipe and had about a 1/2 cup left over. If you are using a 10 cup bundt pan do not use a recipe for a 10 inch bundt pan - a 10 inch bundt pan yeilds 12 cups of batter. If you pour the batter to where the tunnel of bundt is submerged in it will overflow into the tunnel of bundt and you will have to cut it out - no fun ( at least that is what I heard...mine worked fine the first time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was very excited to add this device to my collection, as I have several lovely bundt pans and do a lot of baking. However, the \\"tunnel of bundt\\" is awkward to use, and even with the pan filled just halfway with batter the baking cake overflowed INTO the device and I ended up having to cut the batter out of it when it was finished baking.It would be much easier to simply cut a tunnel out of the baked cake and not trouble with this cumbersome thing.

At typical bit rates it would run 5 minutes or so before messing up. I had no luck whatsoever with FLAC. It cannot do what a cheap portable MP3 player can do.Some on the Neuros Inc Forum have suggested that the problem is that the developers took a big leap in a recent firmware upgrade and that the result was not successful.

Everything *almost* works, nothing actually works. I tried SD cards, CF cards USB memory sticks, NOTHING worked all the way through. Some times the system will crash when you plug in a card, sometimes it (says) it records for two hours but then hangs \\"closing\\" the file, mostly it just says there is not enough space on an empty 2GB card to start recording a 5 min video. After several hours trying I never did get a single video to record and work. TRASH, I usually just put up with bad design, or leave it to rot in the basement, this one is going back.

There are definite limitations to doing anything beyond that. If you are looking to stream video from other sources (like your computer), look at other options like some of the Media Extenders that are out there. For basic recording, a Tivo may be a better option than the OSD. Redeeming qualities - it should get better, given the open source nature of the project. Do your research and think about why you want one of these before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapponted!","review":"I purchased the OSD after my Neuros Recorder 2 stopped working. I had the same problems with both OSDs. I'm getting ready to send back the 2nd one soon. There was a vertical line going from the top of the picture to the bottom that ran across the screen from left to right. It that shows on the recording. My Recorder 2 had this problem too, but you could tweak the input cable to get the line to disappear. No such luck with the OSD. I tried to play an MPEG on the OSD from both an SD card and a USB thumb drive. On both OSDs I got sound, but a black screen on play back.I had high hopes for the OSD. I was very excited about the ability to play back MPEGs! The Recorder 2 can not do that. Alas, it seems I have to wait until the product matures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor network performance","review":"I wanted to love this device. It's open-source, it plays everything, and it even sports some sharp design. Under the hood, however, it's simply not that powerful.Although the unit detected and connected itself to the network easily, streaming playback was simply unacceptable. The video never stuttered, but that apparently came at the expense of keeping the audio in sync.Standard-def AVIs would go in and out of sync at random. HDTV-quality recordings would get progressively worse, until the audio was de-synced by several full seconds. Testing the network connection with a laptop showed no problems - full 100Mbps speed. Upgrading the OSD firmware - a pleasantly simple task - made no difference.Streaming content from your home network is one of the advertised features of the OSD, so I don't feel I was asking anything above and beyond. I wanted a small, effective set-top box to stream media, but the OSD simply didn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"too bad nice idea but not thought out very well clumbsy not high def video, i'm not very happy with it, not the quality it was advertised as.look at this closely before you buy i didn't i got burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neuros has dropped this ball","review":"I think this DVR might have potential, but the manufacturer has pretty much stopped supporting it. I bought it based on the idea that the open source software could be upgraded and was hoping to download and use software that other people wrote. Instead, it seems like everyone at Neuros is focused on their other product, the Link. Either that or they are just out to lunch completely.The remote is clumsy to use, the buttons are hard to push and it makes navigating the menus an exercise in frustration. Also, my IR blaster (the little plastic component that changes the channel on the cable box for scheduled recordings) has failed. Not a huge deal, except that it is pretty much impossible to get a hold of someone at the company and buy a new one. Their phone number goes straight to voicemail, and all email to their support just falls into a black hole.

This is NOT a great book; it's OK--it's actually a bit strange in places (so fictionalized as to be unrecognizable). The idea is a clever one: create 4 non-historical characters who knew Richard and present their point of view of him, but so much other \\"stuff\\" about these 4 unbelievable non-historical characters intrudes that you feel bereft: Richard is almost always in the background, filtered through the stories of people you'll find it hard to care about. The style is flamboyant and cloying at times (and \\"feels\\" old-fashioned). It's also not terribly accurate historically (although it never claims to be anything but fiction--yet one yearns for a bit more reality and a bit less fiction!).

It begins with a dramatic description of a young woman's escape from Tiananmen Square on June 4th, which is dramatic, but then it degenerates into a (tedious) meditation on women and sex. If there was some kind of parallel drawn between the momentous political events and this woman's personal protest against repression, it would be better.

The writing is disjoined. The focus of the story seems mis-placed with emphasis on portions of this characters experience that detract from readers ability to find the main character compelling. While the book has a strong beginning - it quickly loses itself in over-blown descriptions of situations and characters that are unimportant to the development of the main character. I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A generic book","review":"This book does not focus on the June 4th incident, but rather a woman's jouney through the Chinese underground. In both respects, it fails miserably. Chinese writers should not try to emulate an established American form (the novel is a mixture of harlequin romance and feminist melodrama), but instead venture to new territories. This book is both pretentious and treacerously unoriginal. If you're looking for a good Chinese fiction, skip performance artists like Amy Tan and Hong Ying, and read the short stories of Ha Jin or the novels of Gish Jen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for intelligent readers","review":"How do I describe this book? Let me try. First of all: it's bad. The style is rudimentary and unaccomplished. Second, it's shallow. Makes a very very very great effort to tell us how BAD it is to live in an awful country where you just can't be a poet or express who you are - but don't worry, an orgy on the floor of an enlightened youth's house will give the poor confused heroine the freedom she was so desperately looking for. Doesn't look exactly like freedom of the mind, though. The problem with this sort of cheap political pamphleteering unsuccessfully disguised as a novel, is that for some reason it gets lots of undeserved praise (one suspects that some readers and critics are more interested in thrashing a political regime they don't agree with, than in judging whether the book is good or bad), thus obscuring other books which are much better written but, alas, much less sensationalist. My advice? DON'T BUY IT, UNLESS FOR AN ENEMY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downright bad","review":"I found this book to be pretentious and badly written. The author sure tries hard to make some sort of (political) statement throughout the novel, but the formula she employs (good, smart young girl trying to be a writer in a nasty Communist country) is nauseating besides hackneyed.

I don't normally enjoy health and self-help books but this one was so easy to read and so relevant to me ( I was thirty last year) Hitting 30 is a huge milestone and it was reassuring to read a book that seemed to understand exactly how I was feeling. Sure 30 is young in the eyes of a 70 year old but leaving your twenties behind can be daunting. There's a lot of change going on physically and emotionally and in Cheung's book she pretty much covers everything from top to toe. My sister is 30 next month and she has started reading it too and is equally engrossed. This is an interesting and informative read for any woman approaching 30 or in her thirties and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"Considering these are made out to be the best wipers available, they are absolutely useless when you purchase the larger versions of these wipers. My Honda Accord requires one 26\\" blade and it leaves a giant spot where it never touches the glass in the middle of my view. The smaller wipers don't seem to have as much of a problem. Bosche has no form of contact other than calling and waiting on hold so I never bothered to deal with it and just ate the $20 a blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy The ICON If You Have A Honda Accord","review":"I installed this blade on my 2006 Accord. The driver's side blade left a large swath in the lower middle of the windshield untouched! I've read that I need to remove the plastic blade guide from the control arm. The problem with that is the small screw holding it in was so tight that I could not turn it, and I was starting to damage the screw head. This blade is not worth the effort. It worked great for my RAV4 but was a total disaster on my Accord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as last year. Bad batch of new wipers [possibly]....","review":"Not as good as last year.

The driver's side blade (26\\") does not flex properly to the contour of the windshield. The outer edges are in proper contact with the glass but the center is not being pressed firmly enough.

Replaced my OEM wiper blade assembly with the Bosch ICONs based on reviews on Amazon. Big mistake. My OEM blades lasted for 5 years before chattering. These ICONs are a piece of junk in less than 1 year. Right at the center of the drivers field of view the wiper does not seem to make contact with the windshield at all. Which means during snowy days there is always a patch of dirt right in the center. Seems like the wipers do not exert a force on the windshield right where it attaches to the arms. The rest of the rubber blade is also not great with streaking all over. It has a silent operation, though, but it is no good if it doesn't wipe cleanly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!","review":"I bought these wipers to replace my Rain-X Latitudes and it was a mistake.

I only paid 11 bucks for it and that was too much.I have 5 children under the age of 5 at my day care and a 10 and 12 year old child and let me tell you there is a lot better games out there.

I had to call my neighbor over to help because it was like a vice and got tighter the more I moved. He was able to unscrew the mouth off and get me out, my toe was completely twisted.

With the original Dumas novel in the public domain, no one could stop them. The presence of Edward Albert, a perfectly good character actor, in the film defies all explanation. This limping production lacks everything: good acting, sweeping cinematic vistas, dramatic sword fights, snappy dialog, interesting characters.

Van Damme, playing a fashion tycoon's right hand man, helps the CIA track Russian terrorists who are using counterfiet goods to smuggle explosives(nano-bombs according to the script) to the US to cause a massive terrorist bomb plot. And the action comes thick and fast, including a rickshaw race, a van demolishing a supermarket and a great fight scene in a cargo ship.

You can know all biblical principles about prosperity and even be a bible student/scholar, but if you don't have a personal revelation of God's love for you and you don't have God's love in you, principles won't work.

I bought this album without even previewing most of the tracks, and now that I have heard the entire album, I'm sorry I purchased it. I'm not sure how to describe this music; sweet, ethereal? To me it is too contemporary, tuneless, repetitive in spots. I realize this is a matter of taste, and I think the talent and production values are top notch here. I would caution you though to preview the tracks before you buy, and make certain this is what you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK CD, nice voice","review":"I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music.

It does an excellent job digitizing the output from my direct drive turntable, which is 32 years old. It was very easy to set up on my MAC. I was up and running in just a few minutes. The cost was very reasonable in comparison to USB turntables. Construction is solid. There aren't too many items nowadays that are made out of metal but the enclosure and gain trim knob for this device are!For those who already have a turntable, this device is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Solution to Digitizing","review":"I've tried digitizing LP's using Sound Cards, external sound cards, and this. No question, this thing produces the most warm, natural, noise-free sound - and it's rediculously easy to use. The gain control is a big benefit - better than any control on any sound card I've tried - but it's the warm, full, natural sound that sold me on this thing.Important to note that ART now sells USB Phone Plus v2 (V2 adds one very important feature - volume control for your headphone monitor), and that is what was delivered to me when I ordered from the vendor listed here (Shoreline Music) even though what is pictured here is not the V2 product The differences are small - basically it's the same housing, just an additional switch and volume control for your headphones - but you'll want to be sure you're getting the latest product."},{"rating":"1","title":"ART USB Phono Plus incompatible with my iMac (Aluminum)","review":"I tried using the ART USB Phono Plus with a new iMac (Aluminum case), but was unsuccessful. Roughly a third of the way into recording an LP and a terrible hum would develop. It would then be necessary to shut down the iMac in order to get rid of the hum. ART shipped me another unit under warranty, but I continued to have the same problem. I tried various cables, each of the three USB ports on the back of the computer, etc. No luck. I've since purchased the (much higher priced) RME Fireface 400 and have been extremely satisfied by the quality 96kHz/24bit recordings I've made of my better LPs. I've been using Amadeus Pro on the Mac as recording software after finding Audio Hijack Pro extremely buggy at higher sampling rates. For me the Audacity software had a rather cumbersome interface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding quality - Great price","review":"I am using a Thorens TD280 MKIV turntable and this terrific interface. I got rid of my receiver (which did have a phono input) and all the wiring and substituted this diminutive piece of electronics. With it's adjustable gain control, I matched the output of the interface into my Apple Mac perfectly. I am using Amadeus Pro to record my vinyl albums, splitting the tracks and saving each as an MP3.I don't think you can find a higher quality vinyl to MP3 translation system than the $39 DJ PreII and the $40 AmadeusPro software.The quality of the output was better than on my aged Sony receiver and noticeable on my Mac.The unit does not have an On/Off switch. It isn't needed because neither does my turntable. Rather than waste parasitic power loss due to the wall warts, I just mounted both turntable and PreII power supplies to a power strip and turn them off there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"First - the only negative is that it doesn't have a digital out except USB. I have a purely digital preamp and can't use this with that.Other than that it is fantastic. I am using this purely as a phono preamp to my stereo. The only way I can describe this is to say that my records sound vibrant and alive. Of course, the turntable and cartridge have a play in this too, but this is definitely not a weak point. This is putting my digital source to shame.The only other thing I can say is that the lights are almost blindingly bright. I'll have to put it in a box or wear sun glasses. Also this doesn't come with a power supply. It's odd the previous model does.Now if only they would make it with a 24/96 coax output, I would be in audio heaven.Addendum: I tried the USB out to the computer and it was okay, but in the end I just connected the analog out to the computer so I could record at 24/192. Works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused non-techie","review":"I just received this preamp and have no idea how to connect it to my laptop.

I will be using this on many trips in the future. It should be sufficient for things like a laptop, small refrigerator, portable DVD player, etc. A few notes though:1. Even though it says that it is a 200 Watt power inverter, according to its manual you will need to connect it directly to the vehicle battery to get anything over 80 Watts out of it (although I believe this is a function of the vehicle wiring and should be true of any power inverter).2. The cable going to the cigarette lighter seems to be on the short side, but it was still long enough for me to put the inverter on the floor.3. It produces a modified sine wave, not a true sine wave, so it may not be ideal for very sensitive electronic equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"As a good appliance this inverter works very well.

I've owned a generic brand before buying the Black & Decker version and lasted a few months before burning out on me. This inverter has been a life-saver for me on more occasions than one. I can take my regular household chargers and use it on the go. No more ridiculous spending buying myriads of car-chargers for every gadget I own. It even has a pass-through car-charger slot so you don't need to switch plugs around. I'd probably get something in the range of 400W and dual sockets if this one ever dies.Pluses:Comes with an exhaust fan so unit does not overheat.Can plug in almost any appliance that satisfies your travel needs (no, it cannot run your Dyson/Hoover)Cons:The \\"on/off\\" switch is built too close to the plug; it can get a tad tricky to operate the switch if the adapter \\"bricks\\" you use are over-sized.

So I bought the same one from Wal-Mart. I blew the fuse on it (my fault) because I plugged in an air compressor that was too strong for it. So I bought the 400-W model, which easily cleared the limits for watts and amps as stated on the machine itself, but it also blew the fuse! I got another fuse and ran a laptop off of the 400, but wouldn't try the air pump again.

Why not use an intermittent beep that occasionally tells you that you are running down the battery. Sometimes - especially with an auxiliary battery you don't care if you are running the battery down - that is the expectation of using an auxiliary battery but you can't work with that horrible alarm sounding. At least this one doesn't immediately shriek and shut off like the one we used to use as soon as you turned off the engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Lumix FZ35","review":"I was looking for a snug protective cover for the Panasonic Lumix FZ35, and this fits well. There is room for the lens hood, with the adapter threaded on the camera--the lens cap fits on the adapter--and the hood removed and reversed in the nose of the bag (I use a soft cloth over the hood.) Without the hood the stretch material is still snug enough to fit over the front of the camera. Lightweight, it hangs out of the way from the strap when the camera is in use.

Fortunately we usually sleep in our SUV so we have access to a DC power outlet. This player does come with a cord that plugs into a cigarette lighter outlet. Otherwise it would be totally useless because the fully charged battery only lasts about 45 minutes. The picture is ok but colors are not at all bright or vibrant. The sound is barely loud enough even when you're sitting two feet from the unit. I've only watched two movies on it so far and it froze up once requiring a restart from the beggining of the movie but it does have a scene skip that allowed us to get back to where we left off pretty quickly.

Excellent sound with easy squad control.Cons: Repetitive missions, dumbed down vehicle interface, can't get the good weapons and keep them throughout the game.Overall: 3/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money, worthless","review":"This review is for Brothers in Arms - Hell's Highway for PC.The graphics look great, unfortunately the controls are preset and can't be customized.

This game, however, suffers because of it's arcade style conversion from the X-box to the PC. The interaction controls are clunky and the graphics look fairly poor, even though i have fairly advanced PC parts. The only good part of this game is the cartoon trailers at the beginning of each section. I just don't understand why game developers waste their time on making DVD's like this- they have ALL seen what companies like Bethesda Softworks can make. The sad thing here is that the story line was above average, but the game programming itself was terrible- behind-the-times & a waste-of-time.

I also now have a clogged duct because my milk is not being completely expressed. Also my daughter is only 16 days old and one of the pumps has already broken. When I went to use it one day, it had barely enough suction to express the milk from my breasts. I called the WIC breastfeeding help line and they also told me that they have had many people have trouble with this pump.

As a precaution, we bought a \\"slightly used\\" Medela Swing pump on ebay for $58.00 and spent an additional $13.00 for a new membrane and shield and it works flawlessly, even 2 months later!

Well, I used it for the first time it seemed pretty easy to put together. However, the batteries don't work in the pump so I used the adaptor. The directions tell you to set it at min and work your way up; the suction at min sucks but not in a good way.. it was just the drips of let down, so I turned it up.

The valve on the second pump (the one that is not attached to the motor) would get stuck after a minute and i would have to stop pumping and dry it out. As all you mothers that pump would know, it sucks to interupt the pump when your milk is flowing smoothly. I paid $50 for this worthless piece of junk. They should discontinue this product. I had to end up spending $250 for the Medela Pump in Style pump. I should have bought that from the start. It is soo much better than this pump. Also the description said it was a quiet pump. NOT! It was so loud (sounded like a lawn-mower) that i would have to pump in another room. I would recommend every one to not purchase any Evenflo products.

It fills up the chamber and I have to break the suction from my breast and let it run for a while in order for it to drain. Sometimes I even have to stop the pump, completely take it apart and break the valve open for it to drain. I wash/sterilize it as directed and I've tried replacing the valves as well, with the ones provided as extras. I should have saved my $$$ for a Medela pump.

My advice, save up and get the better pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst pump I've ever used!!","review":"This pump is junk! I'm always getting milk on my leg because the milk backs up and the only way to get it to go into the bottle is to tap it hard on the counter. It's completely ridiculous! Also, the pump with the \\"on/off\\" switch sucks harder than the other one, even when I have the other one on maximum.

However, the motor seems to be going out and it seems it may be time for a replacement (breast pump motors don't last forever). Nevertheless, I've used this pump 2-3 times a day upon my return to work and have no real issues with it. I see a lot of complaints from others users, so I guess finding a pump that is right for you will have to be trial and error. But really, this pump is a winner. I plan to buy another soon before the motor dies out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well!","review":"I haven't had as much problems with this pump as discussed in the other reviews here. I'll admit, I've only had the product for a month. The suction is a little on the 'wussy' side, but I can finish in about 15 minutes, so it must be doing it's job! Besides, I think anything harder would be painful. The 2nd pump is less effective, but as another reviewer said, just switch sides 1/2 way through. I have not used the pump with batteries, so I cannot comment on it's portability. It is on the loud side, so I'd feel uncomfortable using it in public or at work. If it weren't for these two negatives I would give the product 5 stars!OVERALL-Pros: Cheaper, DUAL pump saves time, carry case w/ ice pack, comfortableCons: LOUD, soft pump action on 2nd side"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This pump never worked, not once. I pumped for 6hours - and I am not overestimating - and got less than 2oz!

I called customer service and they sent a new one out right away, but other things began to fail. The milk backs up in the valves and I have to bang the unit on the sink to get the milk to fall through to the bottle. If you don't, the milk backs up into the unit and leaks out where the a/c adapter connects, potentially causing other seious problems. Please do not buy this pump!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"The old saying \\"you get what you pay for\\" really applies to this pump. It was painful to use and didn't express adequate milk. If you only want a pump to use now and then and don't want to spend the money on a Medela, this one will work just fine.

It is so reliant on culture that at times it appears to make the scriptures into a subjective text. It even goes as far as referring to Christ's teaching in the Gospels as \\"hyperbole\\". However the conclusions are that divorces are to be made official, that the innocent victims should be treated as other singles and that the guilty should be encouraged to repent and then to make reconciliation if possible, so it captures some of the emphasis of Christian teaching, if not all its detail. The book has a tremendous amount of notes, as any cultural/historical work must, but there is a danger of pushing people towards the line that they can only understand the bible on divorce if they understand all the history and extra-biblical sources - which is a way of restricting the truth to academics and priests."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Your Looking For Something To Sooth Your Conscience...","review":"Here it is!

The wheel isn't precisely true in every tiny detail, but it is pretty good, especially for the price. I'm using it for my trainer.

The gate comes with 2 extensions (5\\" & 10\\"), the 5\\" is too small and the 10\\" is not big enough and using both of them is too much!!

Based on our great experience with the first, we just purchased the second. We actually don't have kids yet, but we use these gates to keep our three dogs away from our cat (and out of the kitchen)! This gate is easy to install and very sturdy once it is installed properly. We love the height of this gate, as it is taller than many other options out there. We have moved our first gate many times, within our house and from state to state with two relocations. It still works great, despite having considerable wear and tear.

I wanted Mini-Me to be able to open this without issue and after a few minutes of showing her and practice she mastered it.Less than two weeks later we were having issues.

It was relatively easy to install (You want to make sure you tighten both sides evenly) and did a good job. My only complaints are that over time the closer spring became sprung and would not close the gate and eventually the the plastic stop that is supposed to keep the gate from swinging past the closed position eventually broke.

I uninstalled it, reinstalled it but nothing worked. This morning my 17 month old actually was able to push it open! (I had locked it and checked to be sure both top and bottom locks were locked and they were but she still pushed it open!) Its a good thing the top opened or my daughter's head would have been stuck in the gate!! I do not feel safe with this gate...I have three other kidco gates in my home of which one is 7years old and never had any problems with them!I would recommend a kidco gate for every home.

I thought this would be an easy piece to replace as it only has two screws on it to remove in order to take it off and could be easily switched out; however, summer infant does not sell a replacement part for this item. They want you to buy the whole gate in order to replace a small piece of plastic. Unfortunately, I tried a few other gates at the top of my stairs and this was the only one that fit. Please keep this in mind before purchasing this gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and useful","review":"I bought this gate because I needed one that was long enough for our entryway. It wasn't unfortunately long enough, but we needed a second one anyway so we bought two and just used one of the extension pieces from the second one. It is easy to install and doesn't put any marks on the wall. The only negative I have is that the gate doesn't always automatically close, but it is easy to just shut the gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the gate for us","review":"This gate just does not do it for us. It needs constant tweaking to ensure that both the bottom and top locking apparatus are capable of being engaged. You can't just swing it shut to lock either. It is a very frustrating gate and we will be replacing it shortly. We do, however, like the wall caps that it came with to put the pressure mounted rubber stops in, we feel it adds security that our big little boy can't just fall into it and knock it down. I wish they sold these separately but they don't unless you buy a twenty dollar parts replacement kit..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealible, easily broke, hard to install","review":"I do not understand why people like this gate. I found it incredibly hard to install because everything had to be just right to enable it to auto close. I had to use two different levels and even with that it broke after about one week and failed to auto close. Even when it did work however I found it to be rather loud and cumbersome. Plus, there is too large of a gap between this gate and the wall and before you say use the extensions, I did use the maximum amount of extensions I could fit but my baby can fit her head though the gap! overall with all the problems I'd say this is the worst gate ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I set this gate up at the bottom of the stairs in my house, but from the start, it didn't feel very sturdy. The metal parts are nice, but the locking mechanism is mostly plastic, and made very poorly. I have needed to tighten the gate at least once each day during the four days it has been installed. If it is a little loose, it pops open with a little shaking, which my 18 month old has already done. We are shopping for a new gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, while it lasted","review":"We bought this gate and used it for about 4 months; my son was an early walker with a fascination for our stairs. After 4 months of use needless to say it's now sitting out in our garage. Main complaints -1. Gate hinge is REALLY noisy, which is okay I guess because you could always tell when someone was using it - LOL! Not so good when you have a sleeping infant & you're trying to sneak out of the room.2. The 'auto close' wore out after a month so you had to constantly make sure it was secure.3. The latch is the hokey-ist thing I have ever seen! My 13mo old figured it out in .2 seconds, seriously a slide tab? There are toddler toys with better latches!So we're off to shop for yet another baby gate, another $60-80 down the drain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase - love this gate!","review":"We bought this gate a couple of days ago. Our 9 month old daughter has discovered the stairs. It fits perfectly at the bottom of the stairs. The extra tall height is a bonus. It was easy to install. My husband had it up in less than 10 minutes. Easy to open with one hand and the gate doesn't slam shut. Great purchase! Recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this baby gate.","review":"I thought this gate would be perfect for us. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. The cup mounts (so that it could be screwed into the wall) were not included. It can't be used in a doorway that has moulding along the bottom. It is extremely difficult to install correctly, and equally difficult to open and close when it is correctly installed. I certainly can't open it one handed, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone with kids of varying ages. It might be fine if you have a dog, as long as it isn't a big heavy dog that likes to jump up. It might also work if you need it in a low traffic location. However, for us, it was a complete bust! Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The GATE for Mom's who don't have enough hands.","review":"I love this gate one because of the height. It is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble. I also like that I can operate the Gate with only one hand.

It is tall, attractive and very secure. Installation was moderately easy. We attached a mini bungie cord to keep it open when the baby is asleep. It really does latch behind you.

In the mounted position, the gate is so wobbly that even the slightest touch by our daughter will cause the side bolts holding in place to cave in and fall down the steps, rendering the gate useless. The latch mechanism also stopped working after just a few days. I admit that the opening we have is an unusual size (slightly wider than a standard door opening, but not big enough for the extension provided), but clearly falls within the advertised range. Unless you are using this with a standard door opening or one with the precise dimension of the extension, not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product","review":"This was a nice gate but when I recieved it, it was rusty.

I'm also surprised to see no reviewers happened to mention the height.Can anyone help me out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pets","review":"I bought this to keep a medium sized dog in a room without having to shut the door. It's strong enough to hold his 60 pounds when he stands on it to see what's going on in the other room, and the gravity powered auto-shutting gate works flawlessly. The only issue that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it's secured to the wall with adjustable legs (padded, so they do not leave a mark on the wall), but because of the gate opening, the legs can't be adjusted tight enough to make the gate 100% unmoveable. It's almost 100% secure, but tightening the legs too much prevents the gate from shutting. I would not use it for a child near stairs, but as I said, it holds up under the weight of a 60 pound dog so it works for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gate for a dog!","review":"I got this gate for my puppy who figured out how to climb over a shorter gate. It is awesome. He hasn't been able to escape, and the door makes it easy for me to get in and out without having to take down the whole gate or climb over it. It was easy to set up. I'm not sure how it would be for kids, but I know my dog can't get out and get into things he's not supposed while I'm gone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Puppy gate","review":"We purchased this as a puppy gate.

We needed one that was tall enough to go above the mouldings in our hallway, and this was the only one I could fine that was this tall and pressure mounted.

It is also great that the extensions come with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It breaks!","review":"This gate WAS great for about a month and then both of our gates completely broke. The joints that held the door together completely cracked. There was no trauma to the gate, just normal everyday use. I cannot believe that this happened in only a few months. The scariest part is when it completely popped off when my daughter was holding onto the door. Thank God she wasnt standing at the gate on TOP of the stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable, wrecked after 6 months","review":"I have a wide entry into my kitchen so it's difficult to find a walk-through gate to fit. I bought this one in 2009 and it lasted 3 years. It broke slowly. First, it wouldn't self-close and then the plastic around the hinge cracked. In August, 2012, I bought the same gate because I could use the old mounts on the wall, because I'm so limited on my selection and because 3 years of heavy use seemed okay. I think they have since cheapened the product. The self-closing feature broke within the month, one of the parts to help it stay closed broke within 3 months so any toddler can pop it open and, after, 6 months, the plastic around the top hinge cracked causing the door to fall away at the top. (I duct taped it for now.) I plan on contacting the manufacturer but I am torn. Even if they replaced my gate, I don't think it will be any better than this one. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Secure Gate and Excellent Customer Service","review":"We bought this gate from Babies R' US a few years ago and loved how sturdy and effective it was. With another baby in the family, I decided I would pull out the gate from my garage to prevent accidents (the gate is still as good as new even though we used it for three kids for two years in a heavily trafficked area, that is the kitchen entryway). Since we are a military family, we must move frequently and unfortunately in one of our moves two bolts were lost from my gate. I wrote an email to the company and explained our situation. I received a prompt reply from a customer service representative telling me that my problem had been resolved. He had already mailed me two bolts at the company's expense (i.e. gratis) and was sending me a message to let me know. I was already happy with my gate and now I am an even more satisfied customer, having received excellent customer service. Thank you Summer Infant. I like your products and appreciate your assistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never stayed latched. Not save!","review":"This gate worked for about a week. And then the latch started to loosen up. Now it never looks. Threw it out after about 2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Auto Close","review":"This gate is difficult for one person to install. And no matter what I do. I can't get it to close automatically. Not a problem for me - I have gotten into the habit of latching it when I go through it, but my wife can't seem to develop the habit, and so, it is left open half the time. We use it to keep our dog in one room, so it's not a safety issue. But whenever my wife goes out of the room, the dog gets out because she leaves it open. On the plus side, it opens in both directions. I just wish I could find a gate that really closes automatically AND opens in both directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"We bought this gate at Lowe's because it was the only walk-through gate they had. We just bought a new house and needed an extra gate. It is not self-closing, as it claims. When my huband first installed it, it would not self-close at the top or the bottom. When it swings to close, the bottom part of the gate hits the bar and bounces back. My husband fiddled with it, and now the top part will close on its own, but the problem with the bottom latch remains. It has to be pulled closed. I gave it two stars because it does seem to be secure once you manually close it. My 20-month old daughter has shaken it, and it has not come loose. We haven't had any problems with it being hard to open for us, as some have, or with our daughter being able to open it because it's too loose. I recommend the North States self-closing gate. It is more expensive, but it is a much better product. You may have to buy additional extensions to get it to fit your opening, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate","review":"The summer infant sure/secure extra tall gate was easy to install and I guess the only thing that I don't like about it is that it is a little difficult to open. The gate itself is self closing and works great on keeping the little one off the stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great gate.","review":"I bought this gate for my medium sized dog with a propensity to jump over all the lower gates. It worked great for awhile, but as my dog would jump and put his paws on the gate, it would move. I had to tighten the gate every other day just so it wouldn't fall down (which it would sometimes when I didn't). If it wasn't just right, it wouldn't close by itself, which meant my dog would get through. Also after awhile of it moving bit by bit, it put small holes in both sides of the wall. After awhile one of the sodered points just broke. I fixed it with mighty putty for awhile, but eventually it went into the trash. Not worth the money it cost. Would never consider it safe for the top of the stairs. Wouldn't even use it around my baby boy now that we're babyproofing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gates Gates Gates","review":"These work nicely when you want to gate off between two solid walls. Not so good if you're wanting to press against say a railing. Once in place. This extra tall works just like the shorter rails. It's more natural for taller people like me. The only drawback is that it opens only one direction (as opposed to bi-directional opening on the shorter gates).I've got 4 of them in the house now. The lift and release function works great. It's nice that the gate sort of closes itself to a latched state.Features I'd wish they think about.... My boys (twins) like to stand on the gate. So if it's propped open, there's a lot of leverage applied to the main gate such that it will move in position unless tightly fastened.It's a good product... durable, easy to use.

Unfortunately, the remote control organizer is not worth the hot glue it took to put it together. The \\"organizer\\" holds 4 remotes on two shelves. But don't try to remove one remote control from the box because the other 3 go falling all over the place. The two shelves are way too shallow, covering less than half of the remote control devices and so don't hold them in place. The organizer also needs an additional internal divider so that each remote has its own spot and does not fall over when another is removed.

Some people know how to influence people naturally, but others (like myself) have to work at it and this book has helped me create a structure to be able to become a more influential person.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I felt that some of the topics did become redundant and the authors could have done a better job at making this book a bit more concise.

If you're reading this and you're looking for your first DAVID GRISMAN/ DAVID GRISMAN QUINTET album, I would purchase this one if I were you.Every song on this album is creatively composed, well played, and just out-and-out great to listen to! While 16-16 is one of my least favorite Grisman compositions, this is my very favorite version of it of all the versions that have been released through the years. E.M.D., BLUE MIDNITE, PNEUMONIA, FISH SCALE, and DAWG'S RAG are some of the best music the men on this album have ever played, whether collectively or out on their own.This is one of my favorite debut albums for any band, and it's one of the best DGQ albums thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Landmark Album for American Acoustic Jazz","review":"I could not agree more with the first review of this work by Mr. Sutherland, except to mention that the brilliant Mike Marshall does not appear on this work. Rather, the unparalled acoustic guitarist Tony Rice warps the flat-top from his pre-war D-28, with Grisman and Todd Phillips on Mandolins, Anger, etc. Music like this had not been heard at this time. Grisman joined the precision and spontaneity of the best jazz with the hard drive of Bluegrass, and this music mooooves.... Grisman, Rice, Anger, etc have recorded MANY fine albums since (I highly recommend \\"Mondo Mando\\", \\"Quintet '80\\", \\"Grisman and Grappelli\\" and \\"Dawg Jazz/Dawg Grass\\") but THIS is the landmark album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give this 5 stars, if I hadn't seen the group live","review":"This is a great album. Seeing the band live is even better, however. I searched out an album by the David Grisman Quintet after they performed a concert at the university at which I teach. This album will get your heart pumping, your head bopping, your feet stomping, your fingers snapping, etc., but if you ever get the chance to see this group perform live, especially in front of a college-aged audience, DON'T MISS IT. As good as the album is, the live performance is even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By Definition, A Classic Album","review":"The definition of \\"classic\\" in Webster's on-line dictionary is, \\"serving as a standard of excellence\\". To say simply that this is a great album, or a great bluegrass album, almost misses the point. It is a node in the History of Music that changed the way other influential musicians thought, composed and played. Not that the effects were immediately felt. It could be argued that the influence of this album is more profound today, over 30 years later, than it was on the music made immediately after it. That's how far ahead of its time it was. It is the point of impact made by a visionary musician and composer, David Griman, on generations of musicians to follow him and musicians yet to be. That doesn't mean you'll like it. It is challenging, sometimes pretty, but always dynamic and striving. However, if you care about acoustic music, whether it's folk, bluegrass, classical or jazz, and you are looking for a challenge, it is required listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST-HAVE!","review":"I hadn't listened to this album in years, and was delighted to finally get a CD copy.

Literary discussions and shoulder rubbing make up a large part of the film. Secondary (or buried primary) is each character's hunger for love and passion.Different relationships are explored through non-verbal, verbal and passive avenues including a May-December dalliance and father-daughter angst. Each relationship is colored with its own unique twist of dysfunction.The characters are complex and the plot requires the attention of the viewer. Much of the film is dialogue. The actors bring the characters to life.There are several short sex scenes, some more embarrassing than others and explicit male nudity in the final third of the movie. Otherwise, a few raw words and comments pepper the dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet and different film","review":"If you're only into special effects, forget about this quiet, thoughtful movie about an older writer, a younger fan and student and the dance theyembark on.

Sony Pictures have done an excellent restoration. If Criterion isn't ever going to release aMoLaD this is the next best thing.

This remastering is absolutely fantastic: really crisp throughout and the colors are beautifully over-saturated as Powell intended (to the distress of the original Technicolor technicians!) Great job. A classic clearly treated with real love by the restorers.Also nice to see Age of Consent since it's never been released on DVD before. Nice film with a lot of connection to Powell's view of life and art. The art is almost as much of a pleasure to look at as Mirren."},{"rating":"2","title":"the master powell","review":"Both films are shown in gorgeous transfers.My review is really for STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.AGE OF CONSENT is a wonderful story which is filmed in a beautiful Australian setting but it is definitely a minor film from Powell albeit very entertaining.Now his 1946 masterpiece STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN a.k.a A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, is one of the most sentimental films I've seen and I loved it for its obvious sentimentality! It is a visual and literary poem. Powell examines the effects of war on a dying soldier with romantic and fantastical elements in the process. There is love, philosophy and political convictions in the script. This film has definitely been a strong influence in various degrees of cinema. It captures the best of the lost silent film era visuals with the best of the written word. It is a testament to film art and in a way an adult fantasy in the likes of the imagination and whimsy of Wizard of Oz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AGE OF CONSENT and STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN","review":"There are no details here but it looks like the one film fans of great fantasy have been asking for on DVD is finally going to happen-STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.

But I don't have \\"Age of Consent.\\" And \\"Age of Consent\\" has not existed on video before.

I really love you, Sony. You are the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull pair","review":"The Age of Consent is something of a nudie flick, pointless, and dull.

Please, spare yourself the expense and boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Literary Analysis","review":"Sarah Elbert does an excellent job charting a cursory but thorough biography of Louisa May Alcott and her parents. Tying the development of philosophical beliefs and life events to her literature, Elbert demonstrates the role of Alcott's intense committment to abolition and women's rights in her work. She conducts particular in depth analyses of several of Alcott's \\"adult\\" novels as well as the March family series (Little Women, Little Men, Jo's Boys). I was especially interested in the family conflict Alcott felt between her domestic obligations of supporting and caring for her mother and father and her dedication to her career. Things haven't changed all that much have they? I was previously unaware of Louisa's long struggle with illness brought about by the treatment for typhoid she received after being infected while working as a Civil War nurse. An excellent resource and well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toothbrush ever","review":"I switched to a Radius toothbrush a few years ago because my dentist told me you should brush your gums as well as your teeth and the Radius toothbrush has the largest head out there. I used to occasionally have bleeding or sensitive gums before I switched. After I switched 5 years ago, I have not had a single episode like that in the entire 5 years. Not only that, my dentist is amazed at how healthy my teeth and gums look and says I could dispense with the annual cleaning and come back only once every 2-3 years. No sensitive gums, no major plaque build up, my dentist even assumed I was a regular flosser though I floss pretty infrequently. Amazing. In case you're wondering, I don't work for them or get paid to push their products. Just a very happy customer. Also, I prefer the Scuba with the flexible handle over the Regular hard plastic handle as I think it makes brushing more comfortable when the handle has a little bit of give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"Very chewy and stiff.

It fits my D200 with mid-size zoom lens well. One reviewer noted that this fits the D200 with battery pack, but I don't see how. I think that user may have the DSLR Pro model. Also note that the fastener on the pouch is two snap buttons. I personally believe that Velcro would have worked better, but that would be the only con. A good alternative to the Nikon branded pouch that is more than double the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick and handy, good protection","review":"I love this pouch - it is thick and handy. I have Canon 60d DSLR with 28-135 zoom. It fits just right, but I need to stretch it alittle to fit the lense. Neaxt size is 6x6.5x8, and I think it would be too big. Overall I love it, and going to carry the camera it the backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Protection","review":"Simply put, this thing does what it says. It's made of thick, protective and well made fabric that covers your camera completely. This is perfect for me because sometimes I just want to carry my camera and not the whole shebang (aka my camera bag and other goodies). I used to just put my camera directly in my bag (most horrible idea ever) but now I have something that cushions my camera, protects it from scratches and from from liquids in my purse. It's not completely water proof, but if you have an accidental spill, it will protect your camera (thank gosh for that).It fits my Canon 30D really well, and it's large enough for a medium - larger zoom lens, which is nice too. It also has features that allow you to connect it to your camera so when you take it off it just hangs off your camera for convenience, even though I don't use this feature. Overall, good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Ship to Hawaii","review":"I searched high and low for a neoprene case to protect my Digital Canon Rebel.

This added protection to your camera is a must when putting your expensive digital camera in a backpack. I have the Canon EOS 50D with the EF 17-40mm f/4L USM lens and it fits snug inside the neoprene pouch (any longer lens will not work with this item).

I have a good size camera bag but wanted something I could use to protect the camera on hikes and on trips--when schlepping the camera bag was not an option.

Two big thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits and Protects- Just make sure you have the right product for it","review":"I purchased this pouch to protect my camera+lens from bumps and scratches when I carry it in large purses or bags. It's hard to gauge the size of the pouch, but I'll just say that it fits my Canon 30D and 50mm f/1.4 lens with a bit of room to spare in the lens area, so I keep an extra battery in the tip end of the pouch. Standard Canon zoom lenses wouldn't fit, like my chunkier 17-55 f/2.8. I don't think the kit zooms, like the 28-135 would fit either. With the stretch of the material, I think my 7D could be squeezed in there too. I don't need the ring that attaches the pouch to the camera, but it's handy to have just in case. I ordered it for cheaper from Adorama (through Amazon) and it arrived very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Product","review":"This thing is just what I was looking for! It fits snugly over my D200 with Sigma 18-50mm zoom mounted. I often carry my camera around and hate lugging a large camera bag so I've put my camera in everything from a backpack (too large/bulky) to a plastic shopping bag (way too risky). This item is the perfect alternative.Now this thing fits like a glove and actually offers some protection from bumps and scuffs. It has to plastic snaps on the bottom so it stays shut and there is enough room so that the camera strap lugs can protrude easily and allow you to use your camera strap.I'd recommend this item - I plan on getting a second - perhaps the \\"zoom version\\" for my camera and 18-200mm zoom."},{"rating":"1","title":"The other reviewer is right on the money","review":"Besides heartily seconding everything Makarov9 has said, I might also suggest \\"Colloquial Hebrew\\" as an alternative written resource (I haven't heard the accompanying audio) as it has basically everything that the Teach Yourself book is lacking, & also the Pimsleur audio-only course, which unlike other CD programs has a good balance of repetition & new material, and having finished it I found myself with quite a decent repertoire of Hebrew which has, over the past year or so, remarkably stayed with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly AWFUL introduction to Hebrew","review":"Don't waste your time with this one.

Why build around a real person, Colonel Robert Shaw, only to abuse his known character, his possible motives, and the wife, parents and friends who in reality did surround him?

After repeated blow-overs, the aluminum tubing starts to bend and twist making the net even more wobbly.

This is the one cd I take everywhere with me. My all time favorite James Taylor Song is \\"Something in the way she moves!\\" I wasn't alive during the 60's, but thank you so much for my parents for getting me into James Taylor. His band is wonderful! His songs are wonderful, and the best thing of all is his voice! If you like the voice of Bono in \\"U2\\", Michael Stipe in \\"R.E.M\\", or Frank Sinatra, then this is an album just for you. It is an album that cheers you up when you're feeling blue. Trust me I know. If you don't own this, buy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Murders his hits","review":"I have a feeling these live shows are a lot more fun live than this recording would suggest. Here, the 1993 big band sounds a little like overkill and James kind of overdoes many of his best songs, adding all kinds of new notes and swoops and hollers that are fine as part of a live show, but which you don't want to hear again and again, as here. The essence of JT is simplicity, but his treatment of his catalogue here is a little too ornate. I would stick with original albums or greatest hits if you only need a JT sampler. This souvenir is for rabid fans who already have those and who want a live recording sample."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cure For Insomnia.","review":"I bought this with high hopes, but the nauseating in between song banter had me reaching for the sick bag. i know there are only two reviewers who think this album stinks (me being one of them) but for me this album came across as the worst sort of bible belt music; a happy clappy, feel good sort of affair but totally failing to uplift. The songs are all over the place and inconsistent in quality. I found this record dull in the extreme, so tedious my eyes shut long before each side had completed. A cure for insomnia. Sorry James, I know you suffered for your art as a young man, unfortunately as an older man its me doing the suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"a top notch live performance","review":"What can I say except you must own this CD. Its just beautiful, complete, and thorough compilation of Taylor's repetoire. Some of great artists live performances do not measure well to studio recordings, but Taylor's live songs are valuable as variations of the songs we know so well (wait till you listen to his \\"Steamroller\\"). We need more James Taylors today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His best","review":"His voice remains as clear and beautiful as it did on SweetBaby James many years ago. No one can beat James Taylor in a live performance and this double CD captures all that is great about James Taylor live. He plays with unbelievable musicians and has amazing back up singers who he has worked with forever. If you have ever seen James Taylor in concert, buy this and it will bring you right back there.This is definitely in my top ten CD's of all time. Don't loan it to friends though, as I have had to replace it about 5 times because my friends want to keep it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Live Albums I've ever heard","review":"The best performances from 14 shows were chosen for this perfect,liveCD.JT sings his classic's like there brand new,and even better than the original.My favorite,\\"Your Smiling face,\\" with different key changes and music ,should have been released as a single .Its amazing,along with all the other cuts,\\"HandyMan,How Sweet It is,\\" and the song that welcomes us into the record,\\"Sweet Baby James,\\" with just James and his guitar.The sound is unreal,like the concert is playing in your living room.Your going to love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose Connectors","review":"Very disappointed with this adapter. Both ends are the wrong size. The XLRF end is too small in diameter. It is very loose when I plug it into either my mixer or any of my outboard equipment: I'm going to have to tape it.Even worse, the 1/4\\" TRS end is too deep. When I plug in a TRS cable and push it all the way in, I get no sound at all.

Giles' study of Napoleon's life from his decision to give himself up to the Royal Navy to the decsion-making and attitudes in England towards his disposition to his internment at St. Helena makes for engaging history.

You have tiles instead of cards and colors instead of suits. Its like a double deck of cards, four colors and number in each color from 1 to 13, plus two wild tiles.I'm not sure what the official rules are but we play you pick 14 tiles and you must have 25 points to lay down or meld. The object is to play all your tiles. After you have opened you may play your tiles on anyone else's tiles as long as you keep a minimum of three in each collection of numbers or straight-flush of a color. You may \\"turn the corner\\" from 13 to 1. The wild cards of course may be played as any tile but an additional rule is that you may reuse the wild card if you have the tile that the wild card is substituting for.There's more to it the way we play but that's enough to give you the idea. It's cool fun and our family has loved it for three generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking outside the box","review":"First of all, please don't confuse this with creationism or any other non-scientific theories.

I wanted a 90 degree adapter because the headphone jack on my laptop is right next to where my mouse goes. I was constantly hitting my headphone cord with my mouse. This adapter solved that issue.

I simply felt that she was working far over her head and was not familier enough with the related subjects such as magic, alchemy and history to be writing about it. The book is full of misconceptions and poor logic and is simply not appropriate for new students. If your looking for a good Jungian Tarot book, look at Lee Irwin's Gnostic Tarot. Much much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste even $1 on this book.","review":"THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE. The positive reviews all seem to come from Jungians who know little to nothing about tarot. I'm a devout Jungian and also an avid tarot reader. Sallie Nichols clearly doesn't know what she's talking about, and she hides it through dense language that I can only assume is supposed to make her appear intellectual. I tried many times to read this, hoping for some glimmer of Jung's knowledge to seep through Nichols' inanity, but just kept throwing the book back on the shelf in disgust. I really wish I hadn't wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY lame Jungian interpretation of the tarot","review":"As I read this book I find myself believing that the author and editor have conspired together for the sole purpose of making this the longest book ever on the Tarot. IMNSHO, this text is 90% author/editor interpretation of Jung and 10% Jung. I also have the following objections: 1) the author presents herself as \\"balanced\\" and even \\"feminist,\\" but the text clearly leans toward a Christian and phalocentric interpretation of the Tarot; 2) the leaps in logic are astounding, the author rambles into her own experiences for no apparent reason, often seemingly forgetting her train of thought in the process, and transitional expressions are entirely neglected between paragraphs; 3) the depth of Jungian examination in this text is comprable to a survey course in psychology. In short, I am VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jung or old stuff?","review":"I am a Tarot reader and a Tarot book author. Everyone goes on and on about Jung and Tarot - and in reality, if Jung wrote all of 12 pages about Tarot in his life - that is all there is. He was not a Tarot reader nor did he use Tarot in his analysis. Jung \\"mentions\\" Tarot.If you are expecting in-depth explanations of the Tarot translated from 'the mouth of the Master' - well, you are going to be disappointed in this book.

It found that it was very well written, and presented, and I truly had a hard time putting it down. I did have trouble however trying to figure out why Katherine Kurtz went this direction with the characters. I found all that happened very interesting and captivating, but the events seemed so out of place when compared to the path taken in earlier books. I am not dissapointed, just surprised. It felt as if the characters left their usual way of life and went on an african safari postponing everything else. Even taking all of that into consideration Ms. Kurtz has kept her amazing ability to write intact. Her characters are still believable, and her development of them and the plot are captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"For new ideas, read an old book.","review":"Originally published in 1952, this book is as up to date as tomorrow. For many years, I have observed the truth of the statement that we create God in our own image, resulting in an anemic deity no more wise or powerful than we are, and certainly incapable of creation, maintenance, or salvation.

If you want water the first day, you have to manually water first and then go back and set time for next day (or whatever period).

I'm trying to get away from using those and have for the most part switched to rechargeable ones for near everything. Product should IMO be redesigned to either use those or even better have solar cells and be able to be run off of that with a litium battery being charged during daylight hours.What I do like is the ease of use of the user interface and the fact this has two outlet controls vs. just one. Using it for a drip irrigation system for two flower/plant beds and with two fifty foot hoses it does quite well.Seems I have run out to the store and buy some throw away alkalines, it totally killed two rechargeable ones in less than a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valves don't shut completly","review":"I purchased a Vigoro two zone water timer identical in function and appearance to the Melnor and obviously manufactured by the same company.

Does the system have some kind of internal clock and you push the little black button to advance your start time in reference to that clock?? So the timer just somehow knows that the \\"real\\" time is when I put the batteries in, then I push this little black button (that's not even labeled) to advance my start time? Whatever.

I can't believe others haven't commented on this.This thing allows you to set intervals, right. 3hr, 12hr, 24hr... anyway, you get the point. SO, if you want this timer to go off at 6am, before the day heats up, every day, you have to wake up at 6am to set it. It doesn't have a clock! Only time intervals. What the heck!

The timer is connected to an automatic watering system for our hanging plants. The product was easy to program and worked well. However, the battery life is terrible! It takes two AA batteries and they must be replaced every week or even more. Before we realized this problem, we left on a 10 day vacation and returned home to several dead plants. Needless to say, my wife was very unhappy as she prides herself on the appearance of her summer flowers. I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable, leaks, stay away","review":"4-5 months after installing it, it started to leak quietly, but substantially. I noticed that leaking sound after about 2 weeks, when I suspect it started. So, it leaked enough water to double the price for it. That alone should bring them a lawsuit! I don't want to even go over its other features, as this is so serious, that you just can't trust it. Stay away from this unreliable product.

Replaced the batteries just to make sure but it was still working the same way. It turns out the other valve wasn't closing all the way and was leaking, thus the mud in the grass. The brand of mine says Vigoro but I go their website and I can't find the product and there is no way to contact them on the website. Then by chance found that the product is really from another brand - Melnor. Went and found them and their website so I should be able to get a replacement.

It is difficult to be sure of correct setup as mentioned in other reviews, but I did verify operation before leaving on vacation.

I thought it very strange that they would purposefully design a unit that has the ability to leak.But then the unthinkable happened, within 1 week two of these units popped off their spigots and flooded our entire grounds, wasting thousands of gallons in the process and destroying valuable plants! Mind you the plastic nuts did not crack or break, the threads did not strip because of too much tightening or water pressure, and no weight of any kind was supported by these plastic units, they just popped off!

I haven't seen this kind of info in this depth gathered in any other books I've read on this subject.

But along the way, Bridgeford offered so much more. After reading the book, I have a much greater sense of medieval history, including Charlemagne's role, the lives of knights, Britain and France's incestuous relationship, the origin of the Crusades, and the impact of the invading Vikings.

Unfortunately, they were recorded in 1946 and are somewhat lacking by today's standards.The instrumentation is fine but the singing will send cold chills down your spine if you are not familiar with Bob Wills' style. Just when you think to yourself that this doesn't sound so bad, a noise like a tomcat just got his genitalia caught in a bicycle sprocket wheel will emanate from the song you are listening to. This probably sounded pretty hot in 1946 but it just don't do it today (for me at least)I would stay away from these Tiffany Transcriptions and buy some newer versions of these songs by the Texas Playboys or some of the tribute CDs' by other artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real crazy about this one","review":"I picked this up in the library, just seeing the binding and thinking it was about trains.

There were a few nuggets, but this book seemed a loose gathering of various substories, mixed with gratuitious sex and violence.

The pee guard is not removable so if she sits on the potty with her pants around her ankles the pee guard cuts into her legs.

I don't think it will slide enough to ever fall in. My MAJOR problem is that the pee deflector sheild is not high enough. As soon as my son sat on it I realized I was in the shooting range!

The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside. While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic. Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting. Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.

This product helped my child feel more secure because he knew he wouldn't \\"fall in\\" and get flushed! He would even put it on the toilet himself when he had to go. Plus, it was a very easy transition when he was ready to stand up to go. He didn't get too dependent on this seat so it wasn't hard when it was time to quit using it. The only downside would be if you have an irregular-shaped toilet. I ordered one for my parent's house but it wouldn't fit because they have an oval-shaped toilet. Other than this, I would fully recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for tiny toilet seats","review":"this is a good toilet ring, but ONLY if you have the smallest, round toilet seats. the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit, but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps. my home has a mix of elongated/round seats, and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls. we use that for our elongated seats, and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway. otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T FIT SECURELY","review":"it looks cheap.

For the parent, there's a lot of nooks and crannies to clean, so I wasn't crazy about it. But it was functional.Now that I'm potty training my son...it's just AWFUL. First of all, the urine guard is too low so that it makes it worthless. So then, if you try the method where you have your son point his penis down and cross legs (or even just have his legs closer together), the urine guard hurts his legs. My son refuses to use this seat and says it hurts, hence it is now in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for my Son","review":"This potty is seat has the biggest, longest opening of all the potty seats I tried. It s the only one that could accommodate my son's bottom and his private parts.

I didn't want to put the prospects of my future grandchild in jeopardy."},{"rating":"1","title":"outch!","review":"Don't get this kind. They have fun designs but they are hard to clean. There are crevices were poo and pee can get stuck. Another main problem is the plastic molding that holds the cushion. It's sticking up a little bit in the inside circle and when the cushion gets pressed the buttocks get dented. Whenever my 2 yr old sits on this potty seat her buttocks would get red and the plastic molding would leave a mark. She would complain that it hurts to sit there for a long time. :( I just bought \\"Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat\\" It's amazing. No boo boos.

But I not giving up on her, I am going to use the toilet seat from last year and tried again in a couple of days, also I am buying another one just like the one I got last year... all your product are great except for this one...I will come back and buy more items from amazon, all the baby items I brought from amazon in 2010, 2011 & 2012 are great...tks. amazon.."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT DESIGNED FOR BOYS","review":"This thing is useless for a boy starting out and not ready for standing and aiming!

The illustrations are nice and the padding is good but it does not fit the toilet properly.

It might would work well on a flat toilet seat but most toilet seats aren't flat anymore. If I child tried to climb on this it would shift potentially causing them to fall. More of these seats need to have a little rubber ring on the bottom to prevent them from slipping or turning and be designed for the modern toilet seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"pee-collector","review":"I have mixed feelings on this product. On the one hand, my son wanted to see Dora and was motivated by this potty seat. However, now, after a couple of years of use, I find it quite disgusting. My son is now 4.5, and he still uses it on the top of the large toilet seat. The pee guard in the front is awful for boys, obviously. I only purchased this because he wanted Dora. I later replaced it with a similar seat with no pee guard and while a little better, both seats simply collect old, yucky, stinky pee inside the seat. You can't wipe it/clean it well because it gets stuck between the plastic bottom part and the top soft/squishy part of the seat. Impossible to clean. I'm now looking for a product that does not have this problem. Maybe if you have a girl, this won't be an issue for you, but I imagine even girls send a little pee into that crevice as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt fit our toilet and not good for boys!","review":"I had bought this cause I thought its cute. well its cute but it doesn't function well. My 2 1/2 year old son slides all over the place, its not secure at all. When he pees he pees over and the pee goes even in between the seat so i have to flush everything and clean the toilet. the cup holder is a joke.. it really holds nothing, so i cannot recommend this for boys at all. I am about to get another potty seat, something that will hold his pee and will fit safely in my toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable, no good for boys","review":"There are a number of potty seats listed on Amazon with identical construction but different designs. You'll find that the ones with designs more geared toward girls (Dora, etc...) have slightly higher ratings than the ones geared toward boys (Thomas the Tank Engine, etc...). There is a definite reason for this: the design is no good for boys. The pee-pee guard in front isn't high enough to provide any containment at all. It probably wouldn't be appropriate to provide pictures, but you get the idea.But the ratings for all of them are pretty low, probably because the seat isn't very stable, especially, as another reviewer mentioned, if you have even a slightly elongated toilet seat. This seat slides back and forth a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend for boys - get Disney Cars seat with bigger cover for penis","review":"I have the Diego and the Disney cars seat for my twin boys and would not recommend the diego toilet seat for boys as the cover that makes sure the penis goes into the toilet is not big enough cover. I like the cushion and handles though. I would rather recommend the Disney car toilet seat with a larger potty cover for peepee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dangerous","review":"As has been exhaustively described by reviews here, the splash cup is very poorly designed on these Ginsey potty seats.But my bigger complaint is how easily the seat moves around on the toilet. Yesterday, my three year old sat down for his nightly potty. He leaned forward, as we have taught him to do precisely to avoid peeing over the poorly designed splash guard. The seat actually flipped forward on top of the toilet-- think of a manhole cover flipping in a looney tunes cartoon, and dumped my son on the floor. He face planted head first into the ground. The whole thing happened in about 1.5 second.Luckily, we had a bathroom rug, albeit a thin one, so he got away with only a swollen upper lip (and probably the worst crying bout he has had in about a year). So yea, I wholeheartedly do NOT recommend the Ginsey potty seat, unless potty training is progressing too easily for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was just eh...","review":"My son loves spongebob so naturally I had to get this for his potty seat.

I have a standard toilet seat and this potty seat does not sit snuggly on it, and does not even come close to fitting my elongated one upstairs. Plus it has no rubber grip material as many do on the bottom to keep it in place once my little one sits down. As a result he slips every time. I suggest bypassing this one and making sure you find one that is either adjustable or comes with some secure grips underneath. Many potty seats are non returnable -- unless you can test it on your toilet first, don't risk this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potty Seat","review":"I have just started potty training my son. We started using a regular potty chair but my son would not stay sitting long enough to do anything. So I thought it would be better if he sat on the actual toilet.

I'll never forget being in a \\"music chatroom\\" several years ago and asking if anyone liked Doo Wop. One person responded, \\"Doo Wop, that was cool for my grandmother, get real.\\" The guy then went on to talk about some pointless grunge-type band that was a flavor of the month.This boxed set is a treasure chest, get it and discover the gems and jewels within.

I had an old AM radio, and I had few choices as to what type of station I could listen to. Rather than listen to talk radio or news radio, I opted to listen to the oldies station, and some of my favorite songs were doo wop songs. The music on this box set is as fresh and exciting as it was in 1984 (and i'm sure as in 1959)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near complete compilation of early doo wop releases.","review":"This set brought back tons and tons of memories; from the days on the street corners to riding around in the car and that all important first kiss.

What a great Father's Day gift for us \\"Oldies but Goodies\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doo Wop","review":"This was the best collection of music from 1948-1987. It brings back memories of the vocal groups we have maybe forgotten their names but the music we can remember. My favorite era for this music was 1955-57. All of us remember the strong emotions of some love we had at the time when we listen to Why Do Fools Fall in Love or Devil or Angel. I am so thankful that some company or group of people are preserving this music. I even listen to it with my grandchildren and they can sing some of the words a musical hertiage to pass on."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Great collection of music\\"","review":"Doo wop music was extremely popular throughout the late 50's & early 60's-In 1994,Rhino Records released this excellent retrospective-You get all the major hits such as \\"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\\",\\"A Thousand Miles Away\\",\\"Sh-Boom\\",\\"Earth Angel\\" & the granddaddy of 'em all \\"In The Still Of The Night\\"-Unfortunately,you don't hear this kind of music on the radio anymore-If you like group harmony,you owe it to yourself to purchase this compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb box set","review":"One of my favorite box sets. You'll love the hits and the gems you'd forgotten or never heard before. If the price is too high for your interest in Doo Wop, consider getting the one-CD Rhino compilation drawn entirely from this box set, \\"The Best of Doo Wop Uptempo\\" (but again, you don't need both, as all the tracks on that CD are in this set). This box set has an outstanding booklet with essays, group photos, and historical track information. Excellent remastering. Pricey, but a very good value. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible selection, sounding better than the originals","review":"There are actually two box sets. The first one goes back to the precursors of doo wop in the 1940s, and goes chronologically. Most of the greats (and near-greats, and some not-so-greats) are included, from Earth Angel to Eddie My Love all the way up to the late '50s and a few in the 60's. The second box set has more misses, but still many that you'll remember and love. I wish they weren't so expensive -- about $16 per CD even though it's a set -- but the enclosed lengthy booklets (all in English so they reall are long) are fascinating, delving into various aspects of the history of individual songs and artists in particular, and the genre in general. The re-mastering is brilliant -- eerie at first because they sound clearer and better than the originals. Purists might find that a drawback, but the rest of us will love it: clear as a (whispering) bell."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original and beautiful American art form! A Must!","review":"I grew up listening to this music. I'm 55 and was a mere child at the very beginning of rock and roll. These doo-wop records have stood the test of time because the music and intentions are Real! There is nothing contrived or phony about these songs, it's pure teenage angst, done seriously yet sometimes with humor. I received Volume I as a Christmas gift and near the end, I was in tears. I never realized this music as an art form, but it really is. Doo-Wop was a way of mimicking musical instruments with your voice, featuring a strong tenor, bass and some falsetto. The next week I had to get Volume II. Rhino sound once again is excellent quality, better than an original 45 back in '58, and of course the booklet that comes in the boxed set features dates, group members and their fate. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfied collector","review":"This four cd set is a jewel. Even though I have most of the songs on 45's, the listening quality on cd's are much better. I feel they could have left off some of the artists on the forth cd and included the Chi-lites, Stylistics, Manhattens,and Drifters. I don't see the Doo-Wop in the Regents Barbara-Ann? The story behind the songs and photos of the \\"original\\" groups was an extra bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome collection!","review":"i thought this was a great collection. had most of the songs i was looking for and a whole lot that i had forgotten about. i was not born in this era, so i dont know if it has every single jam you would be looking for, but for a old music lover, it definitely fits the bill in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life should always be this much fun","review":"When I first got this box set five years ago I listened to it non-stop for months. So much passion and soul in almost every track. Insanely tight harmonies built from years of singing on street corners bring a level of joy and togetherness that seems sadly absent from most other music. Life is a lot brighter when these songs are playing.Too many highlights to mention, but many of the all-time classics are here, and perfectly remastered; the Flamingos' I Only Have Eyes For You is still one of the very finest pieces of music my ears have ever encountered.This is easily the best doo wop collection available, a perfect intro to the genre; heavenly music predicated on the greatest instrument of all, the human voice.If your life is lacking in joy, all you need and then some is right here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the hard core collector....","review":".... I am not. Sound quality is very poor - not the mastering but much of the original recording is horrible. Probably didn't have Bruce Swedien yet. For me, a lot of the songs are sort of dopey. Oh well.

Don't get me wrong,I have no problem with violence as entertainment, but I was close to shocked at how many folks were shot and killed in this flick. Did I need to see the brain splatter and Rosie Perez empty her gun to get the premise?Granted, for the story to \\"turn out\\" given the lightweight script, a LOT of folks had to be eliminated to sew things up, but egads! If you can remain sharp during this flick, you'll also notice a couple continuity gaffs.

Then it rapidly descended into goofy violence, gunplay, fights, frantic running around, screaming, and several characters that were not necessary and which added nothing to the story or the potential comedy. Too bad, because the Rogen and Apatow team is usually far better than this. Perhaps they were going for a spoof here, but it just fell flat.If you want to see something truly hilarious from them, try The 40-year-old Virgin extended cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"For potheads only","review":"If you are a pothead, maybe you will find this pothead movie somewhat amusing.

The jokes in this movie fell flat for me. If it was somebody else paired with franco besides rogen, then perhaps this movie might have worked. Look at shows like 2 1/2 men, perhaps the premise and some of the skits are not the most exciting, but the characters really drive the show. But if you like seth rogen, then skip this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celebration of gun violence","review":"I tried this movie because I was expecting a little stoner humor. Instead I got a celebration of gun related violence; adults selling pot to kids and total disrespect for all police. Anyone who watched this movie and didn't know any better would assume that smoking pot and casually blowing someone away with a sawed off shotgun go hand-in-hand. After watching this, it only made me appreciate what a classic Cheech and Chong's \\"Up in Smoke\\" is. Will there ever be another?I was looking for a laugh or two. Instead I came away saddened that someone can think that resolving all of your problems with a gun is humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooner watch a pineapple being run over by an express train","review":"Not a single joke in this that works. It just comes across as a bad shoot-'em-blow-'em-up. The script is hideous.

The only laughs are the pratfalls and those tire after the first two.How bad is this movie? I started fast-forwarding the entire thing after about an hour of \\"the writers had to have been high to even remotely think this mess was funny\\" as I attempted to watch this dreck of a train wreck.Sorry, I don't get Seth Rogen at all.

This movie never really got to the point where I really found it funny and interesting, although there are a few midly funny moments here and there. It got so boring towards the end that I was even thinking about stopping it. Very predictable.

The only thing that made me even have a mild chuckle was when one guy tried to stick the other guy's piece of ear back on. If there was supposed to be more such physical humor, it must have not have been original enough to make us laugh.Funny is \\"Two And A Half Men\\" and \\"Big Bang Theory\\" and some parts of \\"Letterman\\".

I don't think it's even worth the DVD rental price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Drug Movie For Mindless Drug Losers!","review":"Another dumb movie that tries to pick up where Half-Baked left off. It's about some mindless guys who do nothing but smoke pot from the beginning of the movie to the end.So if you are a mindless viewer with nothing better to do with your life, you will like it. Also, if for some strange reason there is a need to see pot smoking in detailed 1080p for some reason, here you go.If you are troubled by movies like this which trivialize and downplay the big problem of drug use in our society, or agree that it makes drug use seem like a cool thing to do without regard to the life-changing consequences, you will want to pass on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even funny when your bored and no other movie left to watch!","review":"I wouldnt even give it a star at all.

I loved the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I just don't get it.","review":"Maybe I am not the target demographic here, but this just wasn't that funny. My wife and I are huge fans of everything Apatow has been involved with. We own Forgetting Sarah Marshall, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad on Blu-Ray and watch them regularly. Those movies have heart and a pretty interesting set of characters thet we cared about. A couple of idiots getting wasted, one of whom may (legally) be considered a pedophile, and then going on the run from gangsters? Not all that interesting.I've never used drugs. Maybe if I had then this would have been funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"you need pineapple express to enjoy pineapple express","review":"Wasn't particularly interested in this \\"stoner flick\\" but checked it cause I heard a Terry Gross interview with James Franco. And Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow have been churning out some pretty good comedies haven't they. Well bottom line, this movie is just not that funny.~~~This review is dedicated to American Hero Michael Phelps whose decision to smoke pot in public at a party is actually amusing.~~~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puff, Puff Your Blues Away!","review":"Maybe I've entered the dinosaur stage of my life but this ghastly entertainment, actually screened in movie theaters, was such a boring, messed-up job of people smoking weed nonstop that I thirty minutes was enough for me.Seth Rogan is now our Slacker Jerry Lewis of the 21st Century. Once was enough when he emerged with this sloppy guy who lives in greasy jeans, flannel shirts and flip-flops in \\"Knocked Up.\\" He was somebody fresh and different. He was even lovable. Since then, it's been the same sloppy, unwashed slacker guy and in this incredibly boring epic, he does nothing but smoke, smoke, smoke that strange cigarette. If you're really into weed, then you might get a couple of yuks out of this. To those of us who aren't into weed or drugs (okay, I'll confess, I'm clean) you might show this at a party for your buddies to see how stupid movies can be. i really think that everyone involved in this movie were weed lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic Pot Head Get Kicked in the Testicles","review":"If you like watching potheads acting like the morons that they are this is the movie for you.

Its Witty. and You know what you like, if you liked Superbad, The Hangover, Role Models Etc then get this movie =]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"There isn't much to say here. Pineapple Express is more of the kind of witless \\"comedies\\" being spawned for the lowest common denominator. There is no sense of timing, no jokes, no charismatic preformers, nothing. I hated everyone in this film; Seth Rogan is a terrible actor with a voice adkin to Alex Jones with a sore throat. What seems to be \\"witty\\" dialogue is just yelling your lungs out. The physical comedy has no panache. People are just beaten. How is this possibly funny ? I have enjoyed \\"stoner\\" comedy in the form of Cheech and Chong; My favorite film of theirs being Nice Dreams. Pineapple Express is just ugly. Ugly people who smash and blow each other to bits. I don't mind dark comedy either. I loved Hot Fuzz which would probably be considered alot more macabre than this film but the people behind that film were infinetly smarter."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I thought hurricane season was over!\\"","review":"I wasnt even high when I watched this movie the first time, I just about died laughin!

I do have to hand it to Craig Robinson He is funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Movie of 2008","review":"I saw this in the theatre and I wasn't high, but I did laugh all the way through, along with the rest of the audience. Probably most hilarious movie I've seen since \\"The 40-Year Old Virgin.\\" I don't understand why this got shafted by critics' end of the year Top Ten Lists. I saw Tropic Thunder on several of those lists, and in my opinion \\"Pineapple\\" was way funnier than Ben Stiller's film. A good time will be had even if you don't smoke weed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny Weed/Buddy Comedy","review":"Saw this at the show with my gf and another couple and we all laughed out-loud throughout, even the ones of us that were not high! Classic pot movie in the vein of Cheech & Chong with hilarious side characters and outragously funny situations. Must buy and watch multiple times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof that James Franco can actually act","review":"This was another in a long line of funny movies from Judd Apatow, but with a lot more action thrown in for good measure. Seth Rogen may always sound and act the same in everything he does, but that doesn't make him any less funny. James Franco is the real star of the show. I always thought he had great potential, but he just seemed so bland in the Spider-Man movies and Flyboys. This is a well acted and funny performance. I heard some people on the web talk about casting him as The Joker in the next Batman movie. Whether it happens or not, I now think he has a chance to pull it off. All the other cast members are weirdly memorable, especially the cat loving drug dealer who just won't die.Pineapple Express does get really violent and a little gory towards the end, but it is a good mix of comedy and action. It's just plain fun.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Small Toke","review":"\\"Pineapple Express\\" is a disappointment when compared to other Apatow circle comic masterworks. You can basically nutshell it as a slightly better Cheech and Chong movie with bog standard action sequences. What gives it the pass is some witty dialogue and good on-screen chemistry by two of our best young lights, Seth Rogen and James Franco. Rogen and Franco should reteam in hopefully a vehicle that maximizes their abundant talents. \\"Pineapple Express\\" is filler but not bad filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie worth checking out","review":"This movie has a few certain parts that could have been left out like the gore and stuff, but overall it is a pretty funny movie.

Bought this item hoping to be able to download the digital copy shown in customers photos. Unfortunately, iTunes gave an error message stating that this was an incorrect redemption code. I contacted Sony customer service only to find out the Digital Copy had expired. I love the film and already had it on DVD but bought this combo specifically for the Digital Copy. Still not a bad price for the Blu-Ray. Just be warned and don't expect both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious, but could have been about 30 minutes shorter","review":"Then again, my hubby disagrees with me on the length thing - he thinks the last 45 minutes were the best because there's all this action Die Hard type of stuff going on and people getting blown up and stuff. Me, I'm not so much into the blowing up of people, so I thought the beginning was better. And man, the beginning was hilarious. There were so many laugh-out-loud moments. The entire cast was fantastic, the story was just plain nuts, and the dialogue was hilarious. I particularly love the scene where the guys show up at Red's house - there are just too many funny lines. I think I'm going to be quoting lines from this movie like I do Monty Python movies for many years. Maybe they could do a sequel for the more squeamish among us that doesn't have so many people getting blown up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Apatow Joint","review":"If you love modern, smart, unpretentious, goofy funny movies with natural dialogue, sweet loving relationships between guys and a MORAL to the story, then you should love Pineapple Express, and all Judd Apatow's movies (40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad, Knocked Up). James Franco is great. In soulless Hollywood, here are these guys, writing, directing, producing, designing, and acting in movies they really care about. It's their art, and it's really, really good. A+. Can't wait to see what Team Apatow comes up with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good movie","review":"I was very disappointed, stupid me for buying the movie before watching it.

Its supposed to be for stoners with short attention span and cannot be more long and boring. The humor is very subpar and dry. Looks like they didnt know where to go with this one and wanted to cash in on the Seth Rogen moneytrain. I kept smoking thinking it was going to get good...3 bags of chips and 40 blunts later nothing but comatoast wondering why people actually like this movie. Stay away"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of an hour!","review":"My wife & I tried to watch this movie & I really wanted to like it, but try as I did we turned it off to stop the pain. It was slow and pointless and even my daughters that are in high school turned it off. I thought that was saying a lot as many of their friends thought it was funny. I guess it shows that most people have very little taste in movies. I'm glad I rented it first before adding to my 350+ Blu-ray collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't smoke this film","review":"A film about 2 dopers who bond over being chased after one of them witnesses a murder. Did not Hot Fuzz parody this type of really bad buddy flick? Yet Hollywood keeps spitting them out. This flick is painful to watch. Not funny, and nothing in the film rings true to life. Would accept as a fantasy if it had been more entertaining. Too dumb, even for most dopers. Lots of physical comedy, but we have seen all this before in better films. Stay far away from this flick. Does not matter if you are stoned or straight-it still sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively Violent","review":"My friends all either love or like this movie but I can't stand it. We saw it in the theater and then rented it and both times I have came to the same conclusion: that it is excessively violent, and not very funny.There are a tremendous amount of scenes with violence: someone's ear being shot off, someone's head going through a sink, and countless gunshots. I get that some of the scenes call for violence but when every other scene is someone getting shot I get the sense that the long fighting sequences were used as a filler for the lack of comedy in the movie.In addition, Seth Rogen seems to be reading his lines word for word from his script with no energy or enthusiasm whatsoever.If you want to see a good stoner comedy, see either Harold and Kumar or Up In Smoke. Those are classics; this movie is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Drug Movie for Mindless Drug Users","review":"Another dumb movie that tries to pick up where Half-Baked left off.

None of the humor worked, the characters were annoying, the editing was terrible, and the action scenes were bland and uninspired.And the excuse that \\"you don't smoke pot, therefore you won't get this movie\\" is absurd. I didn't have to be a hit man to love Pulp Fiction. I didn't have to be an astronaut to love The Right Stuff. So don't fall for that idiotic argument. This is just a bad movie; pure and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"Even the best soul music sounds (or any music) sounds rooted in its time - the stylistic cues of the instrumentation say \\"this is the 60's\\" or whatever.Otis is different. Nobody is recording this kind of music anymore, but it still sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday. No cheesey instumentation or vocal cues.Otis never had to call attention to himself like the warbling moaning R&B; superstars of today. He made every song his own just singing it straight. He didn't even make it to the obligatory tragically dead rock star age of 27, but he left a musical legacy that puts other artists to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"My turn!","review":"This is a four CD collection covering the career of Otis Redding. The first three discs feature the best of his studio recordings, in mono. The fourth disc includes the best version of every song that Otis recorded live, in stereo.

If you are an Otis fan, you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Divine","review":"This collection is an amazing collection of songs and photos of the late Otis Redding. It is a true treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss your Treo Bye-Bye","review":"Stay away from this product!!! The holster does not clip securely to the top of the treo, so anytime anything even as much as bumps into you, your treo falls off. I had never dropped my treo in the 3 months I had owned it, and within the first 15 minutes of having this holster, it dropped twice. I had a nextel phone with a similar type of clip and when it would lock in place, it would not fall off, ever.

Dolph limps valiantly through the storyline, trying to hold it together, with dialog revolving around eating cans of alpo and finding water. Plot threads are left hanging like tinsel.This movie would've been much better, if they had made it a straight action flick, and left out the hordes of urine drinking, heroin-shooting inmates.I give this movie 2 stars, for what it could've been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother watching","review":"I caught this one night on cable. Let's just say that two hours of my life I want back. I've seen a lot of Dolf Lungren movies that I've liked but this one was horrible. The acting was bad, the lines were bad, and the story was bad. It tries to be a Mad max type movie but fails misserably. I would give it zero stars if I could but I can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just watch","review":"The last warrior, I would have to say this is by far the worst movie that Dolph has ever been in. The plot was laughable and really made no sence at all. The cast was terrible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a very good substitute to a high cost macro lens","review":"As my title says - a very good substitute to a high cost macro lens. I am producing high quality macros on my Panasonic GH1 camera. The converter is sturdy and well built. The converter clip-on to a camera lens is acceptable but not very secure - do yourself a favor a purchase a lens ring adapter, in my case a 52mm to 43mm. I attach the converter to a 14mm-45mm lens and I am out there playing in seconds. Yes, it takes practice to understand what you are doing but doesn't everything? When you get your first successful macro shot - wow. What a feeling!It get's real wild when I use my 45mm-200mm zoom lens with the converter.

But the captured images are sharper."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent high quality lens","review":"I've used this lens with a Sony DSC-v1 and a Canon G6. I've had great experience with both setups, and have generated many high-quality macro photos of insects, flowers, and other small things. I also own a Raynox DCR-150, which gives less magnification and nicely compliments the 250. My only minor complaint about the design is that the front and rear threads aren't the same size, making it more difficult to stack the 150 and 250 together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"I purchased this for my fujifilm hs10.

The overall cinematography and audio track failed to impress this viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good narration ...","review":"Not a bad documentary.

This is a rather tepid treatment of the subject matter and suffers from trying to be much more apologetic towards the owners of the sports club that caused the entire disaster with shoddy maintenance of the dam. The original PBS version was much better but PBS will not release that version, preferring to push this pale imitation instead. Please contact PBS and ask them to release the real episode!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow by comparison","review":"I grew up in Johnstown. I have seen the films at both of the Flood Museums. The film at the downtown museum (the former Carnegie Free Library) is the Guggenheim film that won the academy award. It is an excellent film that far outstrips the one here reviewed. However, the film presented at the damsite is even superior to the Guggenheim film. Unfortunately, it can only be seen at the museum. I found the film narrated by Richard Dreyfuss to be a very \\"watery\\" story with some awful cinematography and effects. The dramatizations were terrible: actors with modern accents and mannerisms in Victorian costumes...! I thought this was a very shallow representation of a terrible disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnstown Flood","review":"This rendition of the tragedy of the Johnstown Flood in 1889 cannot be favorably compared with the first offering from The American Experience on PBS. The 2003 Dreyfuss-narrated version does not use the quantity of archival material available; it barely hints at the social and political pressures, especially by members of the social club situated at the top of the dam, which contributed to the breaking of the dam and the tragedy that followed. Richard Dreyfuss is overly dramatic, seeming to revel in the details of the tragedy in his delivery, and is not at all equal to the terrific David McCullough as a narrator. The use of real actors to repeat quotes from survivors and act out portions of the aftermath is just ludicrous, and none of them show any talent for this portrayal at all. It was very distracting to have these people plopped into the narrative willy-nilly. I was extremely disappointed in the 2003 DVD, and cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and incomplete research","review":"I have to say that, after watching this video, I believe this to be one of the most biased and/or incomplete displays of research that I have seen in a while.

The lids did not fit and my husband took the containers to work for lunch and because they were tall they were hard to reheat and eat out of. I love this the storage is great. I am always having to fish around for the lids of containers and this system not only has a great price and a well known name it had the container sizes that i needed low and round. The storage unit is great and the 2 larger cups use the same lid so there are only two diffrent size lids. For those of you who have the spin and save and have the same problem i did with a little push the ziplock containers with the screw on lid fit in the spinny thing but they are tall as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality, functional item","review":"I bought this because I was tired of disorganized, randomly sized containers. This set fits the bill! The containers are well made, the lids fit well, and the material is solid. They work well for freezing, clean well in the dishwasher, and the sizes are convenient (although not sufficient for all of my storage needs - not big enough). The only problem I've noticed is that they are not very airtight. I've tried to store cookies and crackers in them and they go stale very quickly. Otherwise this is an excellent and convenient set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubbermaid Never Disappoints","review":"This is a good sturdy storage container system, what one would expect from a Rubbermaid product. The other reviewers are virtually on-point on their commentary of the set. Personally I don't use the container rack because it does take up a bit of space, despite its use as an organizer (which it's terrific to have if you have the cabinet/counter space). But these containers stack beautifully, so they are spectacular space-savers. One of my better purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable lack of quality","review":"After ONE wash in the dishwasher in the top rack, the lids for the smallest containers no longer perfectly fit the corresponding container. When I placed water in the container and put the lid on it, the lid leaked. What a huge disappointment!

I thought, hey - an \\"official\\" kickball, should last me a while, right? Nope. Not only did it fail to hold air after about a month, but it became misshapen rather quickly. We didn't abuse it or over inflate it. I was unimpressed - I'm now going to try the Voit ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible ball","review":"This ball is cheap and terrible. Get one with nylon casing inside the rubber instead. This ball loses its shape after a couple good kicks. It looks like a wobbling football flying through the air.

Play with a smaller ball so you can actually throw it and hurt someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke during use in second game!","review":"So all I can say is I am disappointed. We were playing our second having allot of fun the the 4th kicker in the top of the second inning kicked the ball to 2nd base.

I hope it was a manufacturing flaw and the vendor will send another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality ball","review":"This was the second WAKA ball I purchased. Immediately upon receipt, I noticed the rubber surface appeared aged and cracked. Thinking this might only be cosmetic, I used the ball for a team practice. Unfortunately, it developed a hole after only 2 hours. If I had been able to see this ball in a local store, I would have chosen a better looking one. Your results might be better, but I don't plan to order another WAKA ball from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has no bounce.","review":"The ball arrived kind of soft. It has no bounce. My son was so excited to get it but then doesn't ever play with it because it's not bouncy. I'm sorry I picked this one. Also it's very big. I didn't realize how large this would be. I should have gone with something a little smaller and a lot bouncier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Kickball","review":"This is a great kickball for a local game or used in a tournament setting. This ball totally reminds me of my grade school days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun While It Lasted","review":"The official \\"WAKA\\"-approved kickball leaves a lot to be desired in the realm of durability. Right after I bought it, I rushed back to my university and started up a kickball game. Little did I know it was going to pop three innings in. A friend of mine kicked it and as it flew over my head, I could hear it hissing the whole time. Just as he was about to touch base, someone else pegged him with it only to find that it was flat. Everyone had to go back to their dorms and study, so maybe a little good came from this ruddy kickball.On a side note, it worked pretty well until it popped. I'm not sure if it was a bad ball or we were too rough on it. Judging by the reviews, it's not built to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons! Dragons!

This is the first time in many years of reading that I felt I could not go on with the story. It's interesting that it's only one of his family members that raves about the book here.

The current Harper's Bible Commentary (see the text \\"this review refers to the hardcover edition\\") is a much expanded version.There is a need for a commentary that condenses or summarizes whole chapters or sections instead of verse-by-verse commentary, but don't assume, as I did, that this book is a condensation of the current Harper's Bible Commentary as the information on this page would lead you to believe.For an orientation to the books of the Bible and their themes, the Pocket Bible Commentary can be useful.

The new songs are decent at best, and I had all the other CDs, but the liner notes are soooo great. Steven Page, the band's front man, goes through each song and what he was thinking. It's great to read the band's view of all their best songs. Also, the live version of Brian Wilson is really cool, I hadn't heard it live before, and I love it. This is an essential CD for BNL fans, even if you have all the other CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotsa Fun","review":"Too little contemporary music is as free of self-consciousness as the Ladies.This is a band that seems oblivious to trends, image or \\"having a sound.\\" This is a very good thing, I think.I bought this CD, only knowing two songs by name, \\"One Week\\" and the insanely funny \\"Be My Yoko Ono\\" - Turns out I pretty much know all of these songs...and really like'm as well.

But that didn't stop me from buying this latest CD from BNL.I love these guys!!!! I realized upon listening to this that a lot of these songs on here I know only from Rock Spectacle, so many of them I had never heard in the original form of the song (\\"If I Had a Million Dollars\\" is the one song that comes to mind, but I know there are more).This is a great driving CD - I highly recommend this to the diehard BNL fan, or those of you that have never heard them.

The songs are alternately fun and sweet, but they're almost all excellent. Even my sister, who only likes old stuff, had to admit that this was a great CD. This CD has all the songs I know and love, such as Pinch Me, One Week, and If I Had $1,000,000, plus some truly great ones I've never heard before, such as Get In Line, and the Wizard of Magicland. I was slightly disappointed it didn't have \\"Who Needs Sleep\\", \\"Some Fantastic\\" or \\"Never is Enough\\" but you can't have everything.I happen to know that this band didn't get famous for being a bunch of pretty boys, like certain other bands I can mention.

Buy this CD, you will never turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's like hearing them for the first time again","review":"I sometimes take BNL for granted. I don't realize just how amazing they really are. Very rarely is a band able to be so silly and still be able to pull off serious, and profoundly moving songs [Lovers in a dangerous time,what a god boy, etc]. Their combination of humour and heart is what i adore about them. I still remember the first time i heard \\"if i had a million dollers\\" [doesn't every Barenaked Ladies fan?] and still to this day i have to laugh everytime it comes on the radio..such a cute, funny little song, yet at the same time it evokes a dark image of society's greed and obsession with money [well to me anyway]. This greatest hits package offers a pretty good representation of what BNL are about. My only wish is that they had included the song, Alcohol, but i can live without it on this record. If you are new to BNL pick this up and see what you've been missing out on."},{"rating":"1","title":"bare naked ladies","review":"The seller stated in his ad that this item was in very good condition.

Both of them.One of the most annoying artists of the 90's. To me, Barenaked Ladies are to the 90's what the Stray Cats were to the 80's - trendy, annoying purveyors of just plain bad music that was beat into your skull ad nauseum for a brief while, then went away as far as \\"current\\" music was concerned. Unfortunately, even in 2002, oldies radio ensures that I won't completely get away from the Stray Cats any time soon, and I'm sure the Barenaked Ladies will continue to abuse our senses long into the next couple decades as well.I will give BNL this (geez, I can't believe I just referred to them by their fanbase nickname) - at least their drummer sits at a full kit instead of standing at a snare drum with a couple of cymbals passing himself off as a adequate percussion section."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Barenaked Fans Should Get This CD","review":"I love this CD because it has most of my favorite BNL songs as well as some others that I like. I own everyone of their CDs, but there are songs on them that I just don't like to listen to. I like every song on this CD and I never have to skip around. It's great to listen to, and it's a nice addition to any BNL collection. I reccomend this CD to anyone who loves BNL, even if you already have all the CDs, and to anyone who wants to get a taste of this great band. If you don't like what you hear on this CD, try listening to one of the other albums (I love their X-mas CD). Don't be turned of from this band by reviews saying that the CD is terrible.

It's a collection of almost every single hit they've had, all the way back to the days of the Be My Yoko Ono. The song selection is great, nearly every single song that I love from them is on here. I like the decision to make What a Good Boy and Brian Wilson live, but I think that The Old Aprarment, and If I had $1000000 should have also been live. Well, c'est la vie. Other than that this album is superb. I really like the remix of Shoebox and the inclusion of Get In Line to the album. Also the new songs are great, especially Its Only Me, which is sort of different for the ladies. Can't say anything but good things about this album so I'll stop now. Bottom line, if you're a ladies fan, buy this!

The bonus DVD shows what a charming and hard-working artist he is and allows one to see why he is so thrilling in the theatre: without exaggerating he clearly throws his whole self into the character and situation of each aria. For me, perhaps the most exciting number on the disc is \`Je crois entendre encore\` which perfectly illustrates his mastery of the French style; I tingle with pleasure at the seeming effortlessness and sweetness of tone when, at the climactic note, he moves up into a head-voice and seamlessly descends from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything Goes (The original cast with Ethyl Merman)","review":"Very disappointing!!

When I pulled the Shurtape off I had nice clean lines, but also exposed drywall where the tape had been removed. It pulled the paint right off the walls.

Complete and in-depth coverage of the theory and design of filters. I use this book primarily for the tables but the coverage in the early chapters is essential reading for any filter designer. This is an indispensible text book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"There's a part of me that, whenever I hear Knopfler's guitar, longs for the instrument to become what it wants be in his hands, a lead guitar. Mark's been beating it into me that he's no longer interested in the pyrotechnics, and it took this CD for me to come to terms with that. He finds inspiration from virtually anything, from Roadrunner to mulligan stew, and crafts stories that place us, for a few moments, somewhere far away, but somewhere real. The music exists more than to provide atmosphere for the story, but to hold it aloft in caring hands. This is a truly beautiful album that rewards the listener in greater measure with each listen. Turn it up loud; it won't hurt your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Like the Title","review":"He's my favorite musician, but, somehow, this CD got past me (it was released in 2002).

There is some good lyrics and MK has for sure improved his singing but that's not very unik. Where is that guitar-man we love to listen to? Golden Heart was nothing but excellent and I don't know how many times I have played that CD, and MK:s second solo album Sailing To Philadelphia was also great, but what happened to his latest recording? I use to admire Mark Knopflers music and especially -of course- his wonderful guitar playing, but MK:s latest effort is not what you would expect from such a talent guitarist and musician. MK, go back to what you once was! Or do you dont't really care about your guitar and your unik sound anymore? MK used to be able to put together some wonderful music but The Ragpickers Dream is nothing but some kind of ordinary recording and even if I try I have a hard time appreciate his latest album. The Ragpickers Dream is certainly not a \\"MK-guitar-picking-fans dream\\" in the record player:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after \\"Sailing\\"","review":"Judging from the other reviews I'm very much in the minority here but I was very disappointed with this follow up to Sailing. Mark is a huge talent and if he wants to make an esoteric album that's fine, but I wish I had had some warning before plunking down my hard earned bucks for this turkey. Just too personal and quirky for my tastes. Destined for immediate obscurity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"As a huge fan of Mark Knopfler since the first Dire Staits Album, it's time he moved on from the Nashville scene to create music that more cutting edge. No great and memorable music here, just a rehash of the lesser known songs from \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\". I wish I could be more positive..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Geordie","review":"Mark Knopfler's solo albums have been more stylistically varied than his work with Dire Straits, with forays into Celtic, Cajun and other sounds.In \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\", Knopfler continues this musical wandering. It's less electric than previous albums, with lots of blues, country and spiritual elements, resulting in a very traditional American feel. At the same time and perhaps ironically, Newcastle and Northumberland figure very prominently in the album's lyrics (for instance, in \\"Why Aye Man\\" and \\"Fare Thee Well, Northumberland\\" -- a Geordie stuck in in old-time musical America, singing songs of home.The music and songwriting are excellent throughout. The album is memorable, distinctive, and eminently singable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Knopfler deserves more credit","review":"Ragpicker's Dream is by far Mark Knopfler's best solo album. Although not one single song on the album is better than Sailing to Philadelphia's \\"What it is,\\" the album as a whole is very strong. \\"Why Aye Man\\" and \\"Old Pigweed\\" are, in my opinion, some of the better songs. In general, Mark Knopfler does not get the credit and publicity that he deserves. I encourage people to listen to any of the older Dire Straits albums as well as his previous solo album \\"Sailing to Philadelphia,\\" which is also quite good. If you are not familiar with this material, you are in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the finest singers ever.","review":"i have always loved mark knopfler and he is one of the finest singers ever.i really think that quality shoe is a perfect song for me as well as coyote,coyote has a great driving end..if your having a bad day,why not turn on some mark knopfler and he'll make your day much,much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gem For This Sultan Of Swing","review":"The Ragpicker's Dream is another fine recording from former Dire Straits leader, Mark Knophler. This CD takes on a more acoustic format so if you like the electric/Dire Straits sound you may be shocked and a bit dissappointed.There are several captivating melodies. The swing flavored Quality Shoe is a nice toe tapping tune. The title track has a nice homey feel to it with a little holiday sentiment in the air. A Place Where We Used To Live and Fare Thee Well Northumberland feature some nice interplay between the guitars and the piano. Love the folky feel of the later one.Its good to see musicians step out and grow. Mark Knophler is certainly adding new elements to his repetoire and this makes The Ragpicker's Dream a charming CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I understand it\`s folk, but why?!","review":"I dont got much to say about this album. Huge disappointment would fit nicely. While \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" was a major success and something for everyone, \\"The Ragpickers Dream\\" is a..well its not a bad record, for its not! I just cant stand it. This review is not to say its bad, its to warn those who think it is something like \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\". I thought it was, and bought it. I wasnt particularly happy after it was finished. 2 great songs, \\"Why Aye Man\\" and \\"The Ragpickers Dream\\" isnt enough to make the record good. They are the only two songs who could have fit on STP.I dont know what to say about this. I am a huge fan of his Dire Straits style, with his slideguitars and catchy riffs, but they are gone!

As a fan since 1980 I have to ask is he turning out this garbage just to make a cheap buck? Sailing to Philadelphia was above average, this CD I threw in the trash bin. Give me more of that Dire Straits sound. I hope this is not the end of MK. While his concerts are stunning, he needs to get back to that familiar sound which made him famous and not dissappoint die hard fans. What horrible work. What was he thinking.

If someone who has been writing letters for many years cannot do it correctly (or so it seems) I can't expect my grandson to get it right either.

A few of them have been edited and the closing credits don't match with the episode (apparently very poor editing, why would you want to see who is in the cast you just watched when the closing credits belong to a different episode?). Worse, the company superimposed their company logo on the corner of the screen. Very annoying. The packaging is very attractive, I'll give them that. But it's the only thing attractive and good about these DVDs. If you want superb quality, I recommend you get the 25-disc box set from CoverOut dot com because their product is much, much better. I bought a set last month and have been pleased all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Total agreement w/ last reviewer.Vol 1 (not labeled as one) has at least two shows that are on other discs in this series. No attempt to properly sequence in order of showing. Expected less than perfect quality due to age of shows, but quality much poorer than restored discs of this same vintage.

'Through the Wall' is simply a masterpiece. This and 'Santa Ana Woman' from Songs for Tomorrow Morning are similar in that they are their two most emotional songs, as ever, with some humor but 'Through the Wall' is a marvelous story of yearning that, as the BOBS always do with their best songs, is so satisfying musically as well. Wot a bunch a vocalists. This line up lasted for their first four albums and they, coincidentally, ended up being their albums with the biggest number of true hits on each record they ever did.This album is a must have.

It just was not up to my expectation of excellence for this writer. The only story I specifically remember that I like whas something about a priest who lived off somewhere by himself and one of the giant cats from the Karse sungod thing... if you have read the books, you know what kind of cat I mean, I just can't think of it. I also can't think of the name of the stories because I barely made it through by skimming to see if there were any I wanted to read after reading a couple. I didn't see this as a good investment other than completing the collection, and if you aren't a book collector, I recommend checking this out at a library or going to a used bookstore or borrowing from a friend.

Not great literature, but a really good read.That said, I have not been impressed with her forays into editing. Sun in Glory suffers from the same faults as its precurser, Sword of Ice. There are a couple of decent stories, notably Nancy Asire and Tanya Huff's entries, which provide interesting forays into Valdemar. Most of the rest read as if they were fan-fiction. Not truly terrible, but unsatisfying and unable to stand on their own as good stories.My advice - go off and pick up a copy of Magic's Pawn or Arrows of the Queen, or Oathblood for some *good* Valdemaran short stories. Give this book a miss, unless you are intent on completing the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sun should set on this one...","review":"I normally enjoy most of Mercedes Lackey's work.

One of the other stories wasn't too bad, although it wasn't memorable enough for me to remember its title (it would be the one about the priest and his suncat).I think this is probably the worst book with Ms. Lackey's name on it since she changed the complete history of Skif in 'Take a Thief'.

Some of the vocal arrangements were very similar, but the instrumentals were horrible - like something you might here over the speakers in the local grocery store.Don't waste your money expecting to hear songs that you remember as a youth in the 70s.

I suffer with it on my bike, but I couldn't go hiking in them it would kill my feet. I recommend ordering up a size. Wasn't an option for me though, they don't offer 16. Construction looks good, it appears that they will last. I wish they had 1 more lace hook up high, as the top feels a little loose. All in all they are a good buy through Amazon.

I am disappointed by the results:1) The cable seems to have a short in it. When I move it, the signal cuts in & out.2) When I do get a signal, tone and volume are both adversely affected, (I don't think this is due to the short but I suppose it may have something to do with it).3) The instrument that is not currently in use has to have the volume knob turned up or I get no signal from the guitar hanging around my neck - which completely defeats the purpose of what I'm trying to accomplish.Other Thoughts: I could personally live with #1 since that's easily solved by re-purchasing or doing an exchange.

Honestly, it quite simply is mindless. The graphics are great, and if you liked the original, you'll be nostalgic. However, there really isn't anything to challenge your gaming ability. Typically, bosses in this sort of game are tough and you need to learn strategies to beat them. I do not jest in the least when I say that I beat every single boss (including the final one) by holding down the attack button and standing in front of it. It's just that easy. There are 8 characters and 4 hidden ones. However, it's the same game over and over, no randomization, nothing really tailored to different characters.

It gets into some of the physics of strokes -- for example, the discussion of levers is very good. The emphasis on footwork / base (what Nick calls the \\"athletic position\\") is really excellent. Overall, this video exceeded expectations on non-obvious technical aspects of the game.One curious aspect: the video is more oriented around one-handed backhands than I expected. It is still useful for two-handers, but more on this would have been welcome. Among the many greats to emerge from Bolettieri's Academy, two handers dominate. More broadly, if you look at the lack of women hitting a one-hander today, it is fair to say that the one hander is almost obsolete on the women's side of the game.One other plug: for parents looking to work with beginner kids, the best I've seen is Fast Lane Tennis by Joe Dinoffer. He is a corny dude.

I am a new cichlid owner and this is not the first book I bought. I already had my tank and my starter fish. I wanted some information that was not in your average \\"dummies book\\" which I had already read. What I got was some new information, but for the most part, it was just a review book.Also, I wanted an idea for some more fish to buy. This book has profiles of 40 cichlids, which sounds like a lot. However, when you take into account the size you want (in my case 4 or 5 inches) and the disposition of the fish (a lot of reviewed fish would not do well in a community species tank), you end up with just a small number of fish you would even want.In conclusion, it was an informative introductory book, but I wish I would have spent a few more dollars and gotten a more complete species guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your resources","review":"This book is awful. Crump repeatedly takes unfounded shots at Christians and Clergymen. Eventually I had to give up on the book, it became intolerable.The rest of the content was mediocre at best. He made very little effort to keep the reader interested. It read more like a lecture from a dull professor. This is not due to my lack of interest in the subject; I'm a 3rd year physics student. Thomas Crump just managed to suck and blow while writing this book. His insulting attitude towards Christianity didn't help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hempz is the best!","review":"There is NO lotion on the market (in my opinion) that smells so good, is so thick and works wonders at this lotion.

I received it and was immediately disappointed. The book is 115 pages (+/-) and conatins very little history. The muster rolls are all available on the internet. Pages 38-115 contain photos. The right page contains a single photo approximately 2x3 inches. The left page contains a one to two line location/explanation of the photo. No mention is made of the 14th's involvement in the photos. A real waste of paper putting only one photo per page and using a whole page for a description. A waste of money overall in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!","review":"Just received my book and read it in about 15-20 minutes. There is very little in the way of historical facts in the book. It contains mostly pictures that don't indicate the 14th Alabama was a part of the photo displayed. The only way this book contains 115 pages is because of the way they stretched out the photo section. The right page contains a single picture of roughly 2x3 inch. The left page contains a very brief description (one to two lines)of the photo. This method took up pages 38-115. The list of names on the muster rolls in the book can all be found on websites making this book, in my opinion, pretty much a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but wish it had \\"tips\\"","review":"We really enjoy reading these book and it is full of awesome information as with all of the \\"Read and Find-Out Science\\" books.

It is about a man who is anti-conservative, anti-imperialist, anti-pop culture, anti-Christian, ... basically anti-everything. The book goes into the man's internal struggle and reflects many socialist views. Though the book is not all political, and in fact much of it analyzes the idea of suicide. There is a lot of swearing but I feel the passion of it cancels out its ugliness.

It works well with the new Windows Vista which I have been running for the past few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the product!","review":"I love this product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it would be nice to have a choice of aquarium backgrounds. To be able to change that once in a while would be nice. Other than that, being able to change the lighting and the fish is great. They look very realistic... almost as good... but in some ways better than a real aquarium. You don't have to worry about cleaning the tank or having the fish die. My granddaughter loves it and wants it to play all of the time. I love having the soothing bubble sound.

He calls it \\"Horsey\\", in reference to the horses that they show in many different parts of the video. I think it's cute too, and the part where the Noodle siblings perform their western dance usually makes me giggle. BEWARE, though, of the horrid \\"Monster Clubhouse\\" short after the credits end!

Their was an interesting parallel that was drawn between the forces of Irish terrorists and that of the local neighborhood druglord, Julius.

In fact the last track on the album \\"In A Silent Way\\" musically parallels the act of writting and thinking. The song is complex but gentle and features Miles at his creative, post-fusion best. \\"In A Silent Way,\\" and all the tracks on this album (some by Bill Frissel) are like well behaved children, evoking all the complexities and beauty of life yet demanding no atttention or energy. perfect music to accompany the solitary act of writting or just a quiet day."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Jazz....","review":"I bought this CD for Israel Kamakawe-ole's rendition of Somewhere over the Rainbow/What a wonderful world, and I ended up falling in love with the musical stylings of Bill Frisell.

Those exercises (and perhaps the glucosamine that I take) have gotten me back to where I can again play badminton once a week, and no longer have the serious back pain I had before. (The book does mention, of course, the possibility of getting help from a physical therapist.) I'd recommend the book - just don't increase your pain by overdoing the exercises - as the author warns, in that chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!!","review":"Fast shipping quick and easy!!

I've had this game for 2 days and I don't want to stop playing. It has the first 2 Pitfall games hidden inside (Pitfall + Pitfall II-Lost Caverns)that were on the Atari 2600. The only way they could have done better would have been to have included Super Pitfall from Nintendo NES, but maybe they can fit that in on the next sequal (hint hint). If you like Disney's Haunted Mansion & Shinx and the Cursed Mummy you'll like this.The game play is great & I think I'll like playing it over & over.No need to go into detail, this is classic Pitfall Harry action on steriods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no.......","review":"I rented this game a couple of days ago. Right when I got inside, I put the game in. After 10 minutes, I took it out and never put it back in. This game is awfull! I like the old pitfall, but this game gets boring in like 5 minutes!!!! Trus me on this. I dont know how someone could give this 5 stars.The graphics are okay, but not anything compared to other ps2 games. The controlls get me so mad; I try to get on a rope and I keep falling, completly missing!! Sometimes it jumps, sometimes it doesnt want to.The only good thing is that you can unlock the old pitfall, ( if anyone will go through the most boring game ever, ) But I didnt get far enough cause this game is so bad.RENT FIRST!!!!

I never thought much about that thrill, but when I saw this book on the shelf in Barnes & Noble and flipped it open I came across all these passages with people's insights on why and how people gamble. I never really thought of gambling in connection to belief or religion, but this book shows how gambling goes way back into the history of many cultures and how it appeals to that contest between human beings and their destinies. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand gambling better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take this book to Las Vegas along with \\"Das Kapital\\"","review":"This book contains a lot of wit and wisdom gathered from a vast array of sources.

I know many of the events to be true, simply making the disclaimer in the front of the book about its characters and events being ficticious a lie and a reason to question the integrity of it's author. I was easily able to identify all of the main characters, even with my limited knowledge. The accusations of sexual immorality, fiscal irresponsibility, and moral laxity are all the more disturbing because of the blur between what is truth and what is fiction. Perhaps Mr. Stewart called it fiction so that he could report vicious rumors that circulated during their tenures in office. He should know better! Whatever his motivations, he diminished himself in my mind. How sad that a man I considered to be one of the best leaders the denomination ever had has proven himself to be anything but."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"Having read this book, I am greatly troubled that Rev. Stewart chose to call it fiction when anyone associated with the denomination of which he is a member clearly knows many of the characters and the events that he includes.It does great harm to those family members and friends still living to read all of the sordid details about their loved one. Even if some of them are not true, the seeds of doubt and distrust are planted, and reputations are besmirched.I see absolutely no redeeming qualities in this publication and greatly regret that Rev. Stewart felt justified in writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely suprises","review":"See page 42, interior with painted leaves flowing from the ceiling where two walls meet."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft skin","review":"Murad C Cleanser is very good to your skin.

I've tried many cleansers and this is the first that actually does something for my skin (which is pretty normal, but occasionally breaks out). Some cleansers wash off makeup but do nothing else and others do a little too much, stripping my skin of oils and leaving it taut and dry. This, however, cleansed gently and left my skin feeling softer, smoother, and clearer the next day. I can't vouch for it being an \\"environmental shield,\\" or for any functional purpose of the little orange beads, but I like the way it left my skin and it's definitely a go-to when my skin breaks out.

The CD's best tune, \\"Polaroids\\" has a wonderful sound until the twangy guitar solo interupts. Deeper into the CD, Colvin lets off a few country sounding \\"yips\\" that I can only describe as Shania Twain-like. Yikes! Come to think of it, many of these songs could be in Shania's act.If you like that kind of music, this CD is for you.

I also love the complexity and mystery of \\"Kill the Messenger\\". Colvin's lyrics are so crisp: \\"Sometimes the beuaty of life Hits like lightning wahsing everything clear/And gthe dimmers of doubt flicker/Fade out and disappear.\\" Hasn't everyone experienced those moments of clarity expressed so beautifully in Colvin's song? She articulates feelings the rest of us could never say so eloquently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to her best","review":"Well, a lot of other reviewers have said that this is Shawn's best album. While I do love this CD, I wouldn't agree 100%. The album starts off well, with tracks like \\"Polaroids,\\" \\"Tenderness on the Block,\\" and my own personal favorite, \\"Round of Blues.\\" After that, though, the songs get more uneven. Every other song is good, but it's not a strong second half. She makes up for it by the end, though, with the wonderful \\"I Don't Know Why,\\" a simply beautiful song which really showcases her great voice. So, while Fat City is an excellent album (and one I'd highly recommend), I still think Steady On is her best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good disc","review":"This is definitely one of her better releases. It's got great uptempo songs like \\"Climb On (A Back That's Strong)\\", \\"Object Of My Affection\\", and \\"Round Of Blues\\". In fact, \\"Object\\" always reminds me of driving fast from Santa Cruz to Half Moon Bay on the PCH, probably because of the following line: \\"Jump up into the night, gas up and downshift/Cruise up the coast on the FM drift/It's a crazy world/On the head of a pin\\". Contrasting those songs are two great, melancholy numbers that begin and end the disc, \\"Polaroids\\" and \\"I Don't Know Why\\". Her voice sounds great, rich and clear, and she has some great backing from Mary-Chapin Carpenter and Jackson Browne. A couple of songs fall flat, like \\"Kill The Messenger\\" and \\"Orion In The Sky\\", but overall, this is a very good A-C/Pop/Folk-Rock recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced users only !!!","review":"Very large unit , had to have several sessions to get it all in , lube is a must,perfect fit once in,and comfortable if you don't cum first, cleans up with no residule smell , highly recomended !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite big enough","review":"I purchased the Medium size from fear of all the reviews on the Large size.

It is very comfortable to wear and hits my prostate just right, it can be shifted easily and has a nice base that sits between your cheeks perfectly.

No one should even consider this large sized plug unless they can comfortably and reliably accommodate the medium one.The larger Tantus plugs are pricey, but they are of high quality. The \\"platinum\\" silicone material is mirror-smooth and easy to clean, which is a plus. Lubrication must always be used, and patience is needed -- especially with something this big.

It takes a little practice to get used to the controls but exploring the enviroments (jungle,savana,Andy's room, etc) was fun. As other reviewers note, the game does take some planning ahead (ie. setting up for a grind or something to pull off trick, or getting to where you need to go). The game has little mini missions that allow you to unlock levels and skaters.I recommend the game for the ages listed above.

There's lots of crude language/jokes that tries to pass off as funny. If you're bored and have nothing else to watch then this is the time waster for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie you'll ever watch.","review":"During this movie i laughed so hard i peed myself 4 times. Granted ive been known to do that often but it is seriously the funniest movie ive seen. Its like step brothers + the hangover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way, way, way too many F bombs","review":"I watch this movie expecting to like it. Good cast and a great tv show that has become a movie. I am not one that normally complains about language in a movie, but in the first 20 minutes of the movie I bet they don't go 90 seconds with out someone saying the F word or worse. The story week and most of the humor wasn't what I think is funny. A few good spots here and there but overall BAD. I haven't seen a movie this bad in years. Maybe 22 Jump Street will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie","review":"I wanting to buy this movie and it finally was available for purchase I knew I had to get it.Movie made me and friends laugh hard. I give it five stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Punchline Trash","review":"Probably both of their worst movie, based on basically genitals and getting high and a few predictable punchlines to try to make it funny. How anyone can give humor this lacking of any kind of substance or intelligence (even the so-called intelligence in the movie was not even close to impressive). I was disappointed. The trailer is pretty much all of the movie. The rest is just filler fluff that makes you want to cringe."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a MESS !!!","review":"This movie was a mess, a co-working said he couldnt stop laughing and it was suppose to be such a great movie.. Well i was highly disapointed, it was only slightly smarter than the lastest batch of teen spoof movies and lampoon garbage (long disgracing the lampoon's title Chevy Chace helped create) Back on topic this had the potential to be such a funny movie, and it simply tried to hard on most fronts, i thought the funny stuff felt forced and the story line was sloppy, Rapper ice cube played the Captain and he came across as way to angry of a \\"angry black man\\".. I could go on and on but in short i guess im happy i only spent a dollar to rent it, im more upset i wasted my time watching it.. 2 stars for a few, and i do mean a few mild laughs.."},{"rating":"1","title":"cussed out","review":"I loved the Jump Street T.V. series, however this movie discussed me within 15 min. of watching it. I'm sure those that that don't let cussing bother them found this to be a good movie. For me I couldn't get past the language used to enjoy the movie. Sad too because I really thought I would like it. To those of you whom are offended by the use of the F bomb in every other sentence and other derogatory actions should steer clear of this movie. If offensive gestures and language doesn't bother you the movie might be just what you want to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Crap","review":"21 Jump Street seems like it was put together in about two week.

Did not think this comedy was funny, unless laughing at horrible acting counts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"This is a horrible movie. Jonah Hill is terrible (as he is in almost everything) and channing Tatum is just plain bad always.

Save yourself the time - don't waste it on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of crap","review":"Not funny at all!! The crude humor was over the top and not even inserted (no pun intended) to make the story better. Even the whole role reversal/fish out of water thing fell flat. Wait for it to come to TV if there is nothing else on."},{"rating":"1","title":"21 Jump Street","review":"I know it's rated R, but I expected more humor than cussing. That was not the case. To me it seemed that the writers may have been going for a record of how many F-bombs they could put in a movie. The cussing was really unecessary. This could have easily been a PG-13 film if the producers weren't so excited about every cuss word in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drugs give the laughs","review":"In the same vein as the recent movies that seems to cater a teen crowd : Ted, Project X...Watch scenes where the characters get stoned on drugs and smoke pot give you the laughs.Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"They weren't even born in the 1980's","review":"As the forty year old virgin age of humor came to an end with Walk Hard we get these millinel kids showing us they do indeed watch reruns and wish they had been part of a more exciting decade. You know these seth rogan movies were no longer funny after green hornet. But these well connected show biz kids certainly have chutzpah. Further testament that the nineties weren't that interesting of a decade as hollywood has broken their cardinal rule and are still drawing from the 1980's. The twenty year rule insists that they only try and rehash the 1990's. Further testament that American culture stop being interesting after Seinfeld."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I find it hard to believe anyone would call this a movie.

I fell asleep about 30 min into it but other person watching said it got worse--and he's far less critical."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I watched this movie searching for anything that might remain true to the series that I loved when I was younger. I found nothing. I found less than nothing actually. I was so heartbroken that they took this amazing show that covered such a wide range of important and relevant issues like drug abuse, gangs, teenage sex, and domestic violence and turned it into a series of bad jokes and slapstick moments for brain dead jerks. If a negative rating was possible then this movie would deserve it. If you are a true fan of the show and it's message please don't waste your time with this sorry knock off brain dead movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!","review":"I don't usually watch movies like this, but I had a credit on Amazon and I like Channing Tatum, so I decided to go for it. It was absolutely HILARIOUS!!!! Especially in a teenage-high-school-boy kind of way. I watched it over a week ago and still laugh about it with my co-workers almost every single day. I definitely recommend this one for a \\"laugh until you cry\\" kind of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Funny","review":"This movie gives you what most comedy films do now a days and that is a few laughs and some cliches nothing out the ordinary. It has the story line of almost Every movie dealing with friendships gone wrong and how they mend it. Great movie to watch with friends or a girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I really hadn't heard a lot of great things about this movie but it was actually very funny. I would watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonah Hill ruins it...","review":"I get this is sort of a send up of an 80's classic, but it gets a bit insulting to the fans of the original. Channing Tatum's performance is surprisingly good, but Jonah Hill sucks the life out of about every scene he's in. His one-trick pony approach to being funny just gets old after about 5 minutes. I wish that I had something more positive to say, but this movie is pretty awful if you ever appreciated anything about the source material. If you have no clue that this was based on something else, I hear it's mildly humorous! ;P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment!","review":"This movie is not even worth renting and definitely not worth owning.

We were just looking for a fun movie. While we did laugh some, most of the movie missed for us. We just looked at each other during the movie, like, is this really supposed to be funny? We were laughing more after the movie discussing how the writers seemed to think streaming a certain word was apparently funny and how obsessive they were about a body part. A shame really, because I do think the premise was promising as a farcical comedy and it had it's moments. The Johnny Depp appearance was good, and I think I will try the series for an interesting drama series, but imo, this wasn't much of a comedy. I regret wasting money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Don't waste your money!!!This movie is terrible, not funny and completely stupid!!! We thought it would be like the tv show and even the cameos were pathetic!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Johnny Depp, Please!","review":"My wife and I went to see this movie, being fans of the original show. To say it was a let down is a HUGE understatement.I'm a fan of Channing Tatum, and he is usually very good in whatever role he is in, but he could only do so much with this script.The humor would only appeal to people who love raunchy jokes that take no creativity or imagination. There must have been at least a hundred references to a certain part of the male anatomy throughout the film, and I'm being conservative there.These guys are supposed to go back to high school as undercover narcs, and you you would think that would be cool and funny, but this is like dumber and dumbest in high school, minus the laughs. Anyway, I believe the joke is on you if you watch this movie, but go see it if you don't believe me.I give this a 1 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Amazon, Thank you for posting this preview.","review":"I'm so happy I got to preview this movie before actually spending money to rent or purchase it. I could only suffer through the first 2 minutes 56 seconds of it, before I had to stop watching. Having seen the original 21 Jump Street series, I'm sure I came into this with much higher expectations than perhaps I should have. I have also come to the conclusion that I am not a Jonah Hill fan, although the short-lived FOX show Allen Gregory gave me a pretty good idea of what to expect regarding the humor of Jonah Hill.Everyone must make up their own mind regarding what is considered entertainment. By watching this preview, you should get a pretty good idea of where you stand regarding your willingness to rent or purchase this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-Order is rediculous","review":"Why on earth would Amazon put this movie in the search results a month before the release date?

Don't waste your time with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Funnies; Some Juvenile; Some Pointless","review":"A lot of slapstick humor that the under 12s would appreciate. A lot of sexual, drug; language humor that the over 16s would appreciate, that is if they were still mentally stuck at under 12. The spoofs of action and chase films were nicely scripted e.g. which trucks are going to catch fire or explode and is turns out it's the truck with the chickens; the apartment drug exchange shoot out with the customary unlimited ammo. Acting was pretty much just act stupid and read your line with exception of Ice Cube who gave his character a bit of personality. A favorite foil for Hollywood script writers are school personnel and they didn't hold back for this fictitious school and to their credit created a couple of interesting portrayals but also had the usual stereotypes.A mindless tolerable entertainment for 99 minutes if nothing else is happening in life (like sleeping) but a more productive entertainment if ff to about half that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"21 Jump Street","review":"That was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

I was expecting it to be hilarious, and I kept waiting for the funny part, but it never came. It was vulgar, and it was definitely not necessary to drop the F-bomb every 20 seconds or less. This movie was a complete waste of 2 hours that I will never get back.

It's sad at how many people thought it was good. I watched it to the end just because I didn't want to waste the money I had spent but I would not recommend it or re-watch it. I cannot believe the former actors from the tv series agreed to have spots in the movie. I really like Channing Tatum and he is the sole reason I bought the movie and watched it but I think this is one of those movies he should either leave off of his resume or put it at the bottom in very small print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"One of the best comedies I've seen in a long time.

I am old enough to remember the TV show this movie was based on, so I was afraid that they were trying to do a serious take on the show, but by replacing the leads with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Had they done that, this movie would have been absolutely terrible. But they didn't. What they did instead was take a more tongue in cheek approach to the remake, one where they weren't afraid to poke fun at themselves. The result is one riotous good time! Seriously!I won't go into my favorite jokes because they might not be as funny out of context, or worse, they might ruin something for you, but if you're looking for a good time, then you should definitely check this out!

Please don't waste your money. I rented this because I was a fan of the tv show. This is the worst remake of any tv show I have ever seen. If you enjoy throwing your money away, why don't you waste your money on the lottery or some scratch tickets instead of this movie.

This movie is more of a continuation of the series, and reboots the franchise. It was hilarious from beginning to end. I cannot stress enough how epicly awesome this movie is. It's filled with dirty jokes, car-chases, gun-play and action. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play Schmidt and Jenko. Schmidt was a nerd in high school, and Jenko was a dim-witted jock. Seven years later, they meet up again at the police academy. They become partners and assigned to park patrol. When they screw up, they are reassigned to a revived specialty division on 21 Jump Street.

The original show dealt with real high school issues, they may have made it light-hearted occasionally, but this movie version was vile and a slap in the face to real teen issues.

These two cops are more Felix and Oscar than they are Starsky and Hutch. Or Hansen and Hoffs, in this case. The whole movie is a joke, from its' premise, to being a recycled idea to obvious adults posing as teens and the screenwriters know it and keep it as running gags throughout.Channing Tatum. I like Tatum and always have. I know I'm not getting Olivier when I watch his movies but he has a nice, easy-going charm that I find appealing. Hill, on the other hand, I've never cared for.

Seriously, how many references to \\"sucking d***\\" and anal sex can you put into the first hour of a movie? If you're not sure, either view a porno movie or rent this piece of garbage. I was looking forward to watching this movie and saw how great it could have been (some parts had me laughing hysterically). But, alas, I had to turn it off about halfway.

Anyway, I first thought i had bone spurs on my heels (other bumps formed later) and thought I would try these out. Well, these were not the right tool for the job. They seemed to put a lot of pressure right on the inflamed spot and actually made the pain worse (particularly in my running shoes). I thought maybe I just had to get used to them but it didn't get any better, and seems to have gotten worse worse. I'm switching to some Spenco insoles and initially those seem to be much better for my particular injury. I'm sure these work for some injuries based on the other reviews I've read, but not for mine.

I've pushed the limits playing basketball 3-4 days per week, now its hard to walk more than a block. The HTP Heel Seat is somewhat comfortable however there is almost no cushion where the center of your heel sits on the insert. If they would have put a little cushion there the comfort and healing may be more successful. They are versatile, and fit snugly in most shoes without removing the existing insert. Around the house I wore them with crocs, which I have found provide the most cushion. I wore the product for two weeks straight and found no appreciable pain relief. I recommend stretching and icing 3-4 time per day, with zero impact exercise over this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not help!!","review":"This product did not help my feet at all, if anything it made my condition worse.

So while not exact to what I've heard, it's close enough. I do wish the missing section was included. I also notice some other slight differences in with some of the other, better known preludes (Prelude III in particular) compared to the other Gershwin sheet music collections I have of the same music. All in all, a good collection, and the book stays open without resorting to abuse (I hate sheet music books that do not stay open easily!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and well-done","review":"I'm no Gershwin scholar, but the musicological and performance notes are informative and engraving is well-organized and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is an awesome video it has Gospel Gangstaz, Kirk Fanklin, Trinitee 5:7, Walter Hawkins and etc. B-Rite and Gospo Centric put this wonderful video together and it is worth ordering and you can get your praise on!

Yes, your probably thinking that i havent played GTA to its fullest, but i have. I own gta 3 and gta vc, and i love them. This game takes the character and throws him into underground tunnels to do Max Payne/Enter the Matrix action. The weapon system is like State of Emergency because you pick up weapons, use them, and lose them. Now instead of stopping there, they threw in a whole Street Fighter thing. After you drive ruthelessely, dodge bullets, and hang with hookers, you get to beat the crap out of your enemies the Street Fighter way.Oh, and one more thing, the BEST part of the game is the in car gun duels. Driving by on behind someone and IN SLOW MOTION blowing them to smitherines, is by far the coolest thing.

People say that being able to drive all over LA is a good thing, but u get lost so easily and if u try to get back somewhere it takes u forever to figure out where in the hell u are.Im glad that i rented this game before i bought it.I do not recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK GAME, BUT I'M GOING TO GO WITH- GTA VC/GTA 3","review":"TRUE CRIME IS AN OK GAME.

The physics are crap, the cars are too slow, and the cars are just boring. These guys should be embarassed to put this game out when GTA and Midnight Club have already hit the market with far superior cars and driving experience.3) The fighting is only ok, and the moves are average. Not enough to save this game.4) While the graphics are decent, we are the point now where we expect good graphics and alot more for our money. Again, not enough to make this a worthy purchase.

The graphics are realistic and the action is all over the place. I have some issues with viewpoints/camera angles, but this game is pretty easy to play overall. I also liked some of the old hip hop blaring from my car's stereo (bone thugs' \\"4 the love of money\\"). There are a lot of missions to complete although they seem pretty easy.

It wasn't until Waters put out the live DVD a few years ago that I regained an interest in the album, since he did several of the tracks live on tour that year. I then picked up the CD from Amazon for less than $10 and started listening to it again. For some reason what I didn't get then seemes much clearer now almost 15 years later. This definitely is Waters best solo work, on par with \\"The Final Cut\\" or \\"Animals\\", though not as strong as \\"The Wall\\". Unlike KAOS, this album holds up well and almost seems more relavent now than when it was initially written. My favorite track is \\"The Bravery of Being Out Of Range\\". I guess it takes on a whole new mean in the neo-con Bush era. Hopefully now that David Gilmore has put out a new solo disc it will goad Roger in to matching him with a new CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has he lost it?","review":"I will defend \\"Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking\\" and \\"Radio KAOS\\" until the bovines come home, but this disc truly makes one wonder if Roger Waters has lost it.

What a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amused To Death - bored to tears","review":"Roger Waters has to pull to side of the pretentiousness highway right now. What was he thinking?

Only for the die-hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I amused? no not really","review":"Roger Waters... a awesome singer/songwriter, dont get me wrong but this album \\"Amused to Death\\" is far from what I expected from Roger Waters. The thing that annoys me the most from this cd is the background singers, boring lyrics besides a couple songs, I mean when I listen to this cd I dont hear the same Roger Waters I grew to like, and when I listen to this cd it just makes me think of how this wouldve sounded if Roger was still in Pink Floyd and how all of the creative talents couldve made a true masterpiece. This album is no comparison to the Wall or anything from Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, rambling","review":"Waters packs his songs full of \\"too many\\" words. His themes are compelling, but he could have been better served editing his material by half. What he sings is almost unlistenable, like a combination of Bob Dylan and Mark Knopfler. Arrangements and mix and instrumentation are good, particularly the guitar work of Jeff Beck. I came away disappointed. THe brief instrumental \\"Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\", all by itself, said what Waters wanted to say with the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real thing!","review":"An absolutely brilliant album from Roger Waters and the true follow up to Pink Floyd's 'The Final Cut'(1983),this is were the debate has shifted.Jeff Beck,far from trying to be a David Gilmour stand-in ,shines brightly with innovative guitar work.Flawless and intelligent,this record demands the inescapable conclusion that when Waters left the band,he took the Pink out of Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! A true surprise","review":"I am a little miffed as I type this for reviewing something I SHOULD have had for years. This is a complete masterpiece. One of the greatest concept albums ever. No need to go hunting for good tracks. In fact, every time I have listened to it, its been from start to finish....there just isnt a bad track and it flows so nicely. Reading through the lyrics in the booklet would give plenty of satisfaction for 10 dollars...but then to have Roger song them, with such a sense of timing and effective nuances, is just so special. Cynical doesnt begin to decribe it. At times you just have to grin and shake your head in wonderment. Having said all that, if you're looking for another Floyd album, this doesnt fit the bill. However, it is every bit as moving as The Wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Waters - His Best Solo Album","review":"This is Waters best solo album and although it has some flaws is probably the closest he has come to the glory days of Pink Floyd. Guitar god Jeff Beck guests on this one and helps to bridge the guitar gap missing on Waters albums ever since he split with David Gilmour. The album is another concept piece mainly revolving around war, politics, and more war. The themes of the album are as relevant today as when they were written in 92. Waters tends to be a bit wordy at times and has a tendency to drive his points home probably more than needed, but for the most part this is a solid effective disc. As with his other solo efforts the album failed to generate a lot of interest at the cash registers. 15 years later he has yet to do another solo album. It's a pity because I think with each solo release Waters was producing better material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing I have heard come out of the 1990's","review":"This album is a beautiful summary of our society at this point in time.

Roger explains to the listener how we have become so amused by our televisions, through war and politics, that if anythig were to happen to us we would all be around our TV's. In today's crises with the reasent horrifiying events in New york, and in the past with the Gulf War, Roger's thoughts are true! Perfect Sence part 1 & 2, I think personaly is Roger's best work yet. Those songs are very moving and are fantastic to listen to!The album makes you feel good, sad, and it makes you think! And Roger Waters may be the best lyric writer of all time! This album is a classic, and if you like Roger's music with Pink Floyd this album will top it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't worry","review":"If you do not own this record yet and you have doubts about buying it because you read some bad reviews, don't worry, by the moment that you listen to \\"watching t.v.\\", you will start crying i guarantee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect, But Not Quite","review":"What can I say about this album that hasn't been said before?

Still a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the proven leader of the floyd","review":"When the question comes up,and it does frequently,who is the true leader of the floyd success story,it is a difficult question to answer.The Roger fans swear by his genius,the gilmour fans will do the same.It is my belief that this album answers this question honestly.Roger is at his absolute best.His lyrical content ,as well as his compositional awareness is in fifth gear and rolling.Rogers genius shines through and glitters as gold as the cd he released.It is his crowning achievement in his already illustrious career.The concept is in tact,its song strings tell a story that is near to his heart.He empathizes with the tragedies of latter modern tragedies,as well as questions authority,with a slice of personal philosophical belief.The music is flawless,and takes you on a journey that makes one think.If ever there was an addition to a collection,this one is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Waters is a lyrical genius","review":"This album is definitely the best of his 4 solo albums ( I consider 'The Final Cut' a Roger Waters solo album).

When you compare this with Gilmour's recent effort The Division Bell it becomes ever more clear the answer to the question \\"Oh by the way which ones pink\\" is a resounding \\"Rog Is\\"(or was). This is Rog at his lyrical best and the music aint bad either. My personal highs being What God Wants Pt1 and The Bravery of Being Out Of Range, as for lows.......there are none. My advice - Listen to it on headphones and it'll blow yer socks off!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of his solo albums.Very Wall like sounding.","review":"He called a Radio station here in Boston(a 45 minute interview)he said he would never get back with Pink Floyd.They asked him to do Dark side of the moon on there 94 World tour,he said no way.Anyway this album is his best work to date.Jeff Beck is also the guitarist on this masterpiece,He is almost as good as Clapton was on the Pros and Cons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Real","review":"Let me first say that this album is not without artistic merit. Some of the lyrics and even some of the music strike chords. I can even appreciate the album's themes, dealing as they do with the decline of Western Civilization. That said, I find this album excruciating to listen to. Let's face it, Roger Waters was never a vocal marvel even back in his heyday with Pink Floyd. But at least back then he WAS capable of carrying a tune (well, usually...). Alas, this ability has seemed to have departed him entirely. How on earth could anyone, especially those weaned on the melodic splendour of Pink Floyd, listen to Water's dry, cracking, out of tune instrument and be entertained? As much as I love Pink Floyd, and as much I truly admire Water's song-writing talents, this album is a clunker. Get over yourself, Roger, and get back together with David Gilmour. I daresay you need him a whole heck of a lot more than he needs you."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored to death","review":"I'm a huge PF fan, but I feel like after David Gilmore and Roger Waters split up, they never really reached their potential. Gilmore's first solo came close. This moody album doesn't live up to the standards set by previous PF albums. While I'm no fan of the present course of civilization, I didn't find these lyrics to be particularly profound or persuasive and I really miss the guitar and harmonies from the good ole days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that amusing at all","review":"This album seems to try to harken back to the \\"big\\" sound and ambition of the last two Pink Floyd albums. Unfortunately it stumbles out of the gate. Unlike \\"Pros and Cons\\" and \\"KAOS,\\" the musical efforts here are rudimentary and heavy handed. The lyrics are mostly muttered, and for the most part extremely caustic and bitter - this may have been what some fans were waiting for, but unless you thought \\"The Final Cut\\" was the best Pink Floyd album I'd approach this with caution. As this was effectively the last Roger Waters album, it seems like he had run out of gas at this point and realized it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the \\"movie\\" begin... let it move you","review":"Ah, what a fantastic album this is. A wonderful, powerful concept album that is everything I know and love about Pink Floyd albums, without Pink Floyd, of course. Ex-Pink Floyd singer/songwriter delivers a powerful album that is more like a movie - Raw, emotional, moving. This is a great continuation of Roger Water's finer masterpieces... Dark Side and The Wall. A genuine, heartfelt experience and it is, I believe, his best solo work to date. Roger Waters is an incredibly compassionate human being. This album is filled with songs that are beautiful, thought provoking, and terrifying - sometimes, all at once. If you are a fan of Pink Floyd's work and Roger's, I suggest you give \\"In the Flesh\\" a listening... it is a great live album showcasing highlights of both Roger's solo songs and Pink Floyd songs, wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all","review":"I admit I was a bit skeptical about this cd, but now that I've listened to it, I like it. Roger Waters really is a genius and this cd picks up a little bit of that Pink Floyd sound that everybody loves. I think the highlight of this cd is \\"What God Wants\\" That song rocks. This just goes to show that you can take Roger Waters out of Pink Floyd, but you can't take Pink Floyd out of Roger Waters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What to listen to following the Terrorist Attack","review":"Nine years ago this CD really put my feelings following the Gulf War in perspective. In light of the terrible terrorist attacks this past Tuesday in NY, DC and Pennsylvania, one should listen to this album to gain some inner understanding and keep a balance between their anger and sorrow. Many of the songs on this album carry very powerful messages about ourselves and really makes us question where our values are truly centered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rog!","review":"This album is simply a masterwork. Very emotional songs, arranged in a devastatingly powerful manner, all set to convery Waters' message of a society beset by false images and false realities.There is a book by Neil Postman titled \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\" which echoes this message, and, I suppose (but I have no idea) that Rogers must have taken his inspiration from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth giving it a try...","review":"Waters at his cynical best.. Though there are flashes of brilliance, musically I'd say this is nothing comparable to the classic Floyd stuff.. Worth giving it a try if you are a true Floyd fan.."},{"rating":"2","title":"This species has amused itself to death","review":"After \\"The Final Cut\\" which was a really amazing album, Roger seperated from Pink Floyd, and put out his solo albums \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchiking\\" and \\"Radio K.A.O.S.\\" which while good, were somewhat of a let down after the final cut but then came \\"Amused to Death\\" which is by far 1 of the finest things Roger has ever doneEvery song on here is excellent with no filler material. There are the powerfull and ironic \\"What God Wants 1-3\\" the softer \\"It's a Mircale\\". \\"Amused to Death\\" is nice, it soft in the begining then has 1 powerfull loud part with nice guitar solos in the end. The best song is '\\"The bravery of Being Out of Range\\" This song is your traditonal rock song, and of course like so many other of Roger songs deals with war.this album is not just for Roger Waters fans, or Pink Floyd fans, its for everybody, everyone will find something they like on it, if not the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-Doz required","review":"Once again, I fell victim to glowing reviews and purchased a CD without listening to it. What are you people talking about? This album is not good. Waters' voice is shot and I resent being beaten over the head with his social commentary. A little more lyrical subtlety would have suited me.Musically, I was nearly lulled to sleep several times before even reaching the fifth track. Plain and simple, John Lennon needed Paul McCartney, Roger Waters needs David Gilmour. And vice versa on those, by the way.I respect Waters as an artist, and usually revere him as a lyricist, but he missed the mark CLEARLY on this CD.Overly long, funeral-paced, and not lacking for obvious social cliches, Amused To Death dies a slow one.And what the heck is he thanking FLEA for in the acknowledgements anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Waters masterpiece","review":"This is Roger Waters' finest solo work and the best thing he's been involved with since The Wall. Unlike the dreadful Pros and Cons of Hitch-Hiking, which abondened melody in favor of the lyrics, and Radio KAOS, which had decent tunes but a bad plot, Amused to Death hits on all aspects. The music is incredible (especially the final 3 songs) as is Jeff Beck's guitar playing. And Waters lyrics are excellent in most cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD That Any Pink Floyd Fan Should Love","review":"This cd is great, any Pink Floyd fan should love it, and if they don't, I would seriously doubt that they are PK fans. Waters has a unique voice. This means that not everyone will find it a good one, but at least it is something that stands out and is interesting (unlike Gilmour). For those that keep saying that Waters can't carry a tune, you are wrong. You must be the ones that are tone deaf, because he can carry a tune. Most likely you are just saying this because you don't like the way he sings. Different people have different tastes, and to say that this cd is bad just because you don't like the way Waters sings on it (which is not much different than the way he sings with PK)is stupid. Without Waters voice in PK, the band would have sounded just like any other popular english rock band. Gilmour has a good voice, but one that isn't very interesting. It was Water's voice that made PK stand out."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"come around to a new way of thinking, roger confirmed my supicion about the civilization of mankind, may he posess the chemicals that dillute his master pieces and continue to culminate in the record machine.ashes and diamonds, foe and friend we are all equal in the end bluesboy"},{"rating":"2","title":"What God Wants?","review":"What God wants is for a certain pigheaded individual to sack up and reunite with his old band. Life is too short to harbor petty grudges. ............ a great album nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Waters is the man of the hour","review":"Let me tell ya somethin, Roger was the talent that produced all of those Floyd albums that we all love and his solo stuff is twice as good as Floyd's stuff without him. Momentary Lapse Of Reason sounds like the band Simply Red and is weak as hell when compared to Roger's solo efforts. wtg ol' Rog at least you haven't turned into a pathetic, shadow of yourself who is trying like hell to swim in the same ol' fish bowl year after year."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss Roger","review":"I picked this album up several years ago. Must've been right after its initial release. Roger has always been a lyrical genius, but on 'Death' he's has incorporated a musical touch that amplifies his message. Had this album benefited from the musical genius of David Gilmour, it would have (no doubt) been ranked among the most brilliant pieces of Floydian history. It's still a masterpiece, regardless of the abscense of the 'Floyd' sound. Roger is my eternal hero, but the added emphasis of Dave would have propelled this album beyond The Wall and even Wish You Were Here.Stop.Roger and Dave still command the ranks. 'Death' is better than any solo album and even better than any post-Waters Floyd album. Dave did a fantastic job with 'Division Bell' and 'Reason', but 'Death' is Floyd reborn, and Roger is still at its core.I definitely recommend this album. If you like powerful lyrics and (even in this case) powerful music, Amused to Death is an experience you will not soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am surprised that it isn't banned&#65533;","review":"This album gives us a rare and shattering experience of seeing the reality of the Evil that is hidden behind a respectable facade of our human nature. This great achievement is worth hundreds of albums, books and movies in terms of intellectual and musical value. This powerful album is NOT an entertainment and only suitable for mature people who is capable of abstract thinking. It possesses rare psychological depths and penetrates to the core of the flawed human nature. How can we rescue ourselves from ourselves? When learning our true selves, don't we all enter the abyss \\"deeper than hell itself\\"? After all, the highest and lowest both come from the depth of the soul... Buy this album and listen to the dry and sometimes dark humor of this wise Brit in search for answers. It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Nothing You Need to Know Is In This Book!","review":"Lucky for me I checked this book out from the library. Let me save you the trouble. Don't buy this book. Judging from the table of contents, this book would seem to be informative. It definitely lists the things that are important to know about learning disabilities. However, I only wish that the content lived up to the expectations generative by perusing the table of contents.

You have to have been there to really beleive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Sultana's Daughters","review":"Another great book by Jean Sasson! I was so touched by the bravery and heartbreak these women and girls have endured. One can tell that Ms Sasson is very knowledgable about life for these women behind closed doors. Having lived in Saudi all those years certainly gives the author credibility. More to come from Ms Sasson, I hope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is part of the Princess Trilog. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would highly recommend it. It certainly gives you a picture of life for some women in the middle east."},{"rating":"1","title":"De ja vu all over again","review":"If you read \\"Princess\\" you would be wasting your time reading this follow up book. Nothing has changed in Saudi Arabia or in Sultana's life and in the long run - after 911 - who cares. What is most not believable about the narrative is that \\"she\\", Sultana, contradicts herself repeatedly. It is almost impossible to believe that her husband, and her husband alone, would allow her to conduct herself in a manner that goes against everything the arab male stands for - a female with a mind and will of her own, even a wife, that he would allow this female to dictate to him even in his own home, no less. Sultana does not always get her own way but I cannot believe she never suffered physical and a great deal more mental and emotional abuse than she says in this book. Not convincing. Again - who cares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simpering and somewhat unbelievable","review":"I read the first book and was appalled (although not surprised) at the treatment of women even within the wealthiest of households in Saudi Arabia. In fact, I read all 3 (because my Kindle makes it easy to just keep going!) - and by the time I got to the end of the trilogy and found the tone so saccharin and phony that I couldn't finish the third book. Princess Sultana emerges as a spoiled princess with an artificial sense of her own enlightenment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you thought it couldn't get better than \\"Princess\\"","review":"Jean Sasson has proven that sequels can be better. I thought \\"Princess\\" was one of the most riveting books I have ever read until I read Princess Sultana's Daughters! In this book we learn about Sultana's marriage to Kareem, her brother, Ali, still as devilish as ever, and the birth and lives of her children. We also learn several horrifying stories of the oppression of women in Saudi Arabia as well as other countries. We also go far deeper into the soul and being of Sultana and learn more about her strengths and weaknesses. I would definitely recommend this book even to those who have not yet read \\"Princess\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great read","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as the first one. Looking forward to the third. Very interesting how our worlds are so different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A continuation of a great story","review":"This keeps the story continuing, and it kept my interest just as much as the first book. Fascinating look into Saudi women's lives. Bottom line, I would recommend this for anyone to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a novel....","review":"....because frankly, that is what I think it is. These books just do not ring true like biographies and autobiographies normally do. I always feel I am reading a trashy novel, not at all the confidences of a woman trying to remain anonymous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This book shows true revealing information about the goings on in Saudia Arabia. The only thing that I felt was horrible is how her daughters turned out. I see nothing wrong for a woman to a feminist but she has no respect for husband or her own family. There are things, I would not share, and would keep in a journal or diary. Most definitely stick to her life but out of others. She is demanding respect but has none.However, this book is wonderful, and a quick read, I could not pur it down. Maybe she will be watchful next time of what she says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reading but book 2 is not credible","review":"Book 1 was a great read but by books 2 & 3 I was convinced Sultana is not real. I think it is a collection of news items, gossip and J Sasoon's viewpoint that I was reading. After reading lots of books on the middle east and looking at her website, I have doubts about the truth in the book. This also makes me question what she says about what she reports about her stalker and lawsuit which is up on her website."},{"rating":"2","title":"More horrific tales from Sultana","review":"After reading the review by \\"A reader from the USA\\" dated May 7, 2001 I became so enraged! I thought to myself, how could someone be so ignorant? Yes! These stories are all true! You don't have to have visited Saudi Arabia to know that the discrimination described in the book is true... I am glad that 'Sultana' has had the courage to write her story - She had opened the eyes of many Western men and women. Thank You 'Sultata' for sharing your story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Followup","review":"This book was filled with a lot of depressing stories, albeit, they were told well and interesting, but they were depressing.

(GREAT BOOK THOUGH)","review":"I want to first start out by saying that I have family that lived in Saudi Arabia in Jeddah and for this, all that I have read I believe to be true. My aunt has told me some horrific stories of how they treated her over there, so I can only imagine how they treat other women who are there. This book really sheds light onto what goes on in other countries such as Saudi Arabia. I have shed many tears over this book and others that I have read by Ms. Sasson. To all of you out there that say that this is a false book, and can't be true, all I can say is...WAKE UP! This stuff is happening out there, and actually \\"Sultana\\" was very lucky to be married to guy like Kareem, who treated her with SOME respect (even though I would not put up with his crap in the U.S.) If you are looking for a good book to read, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I highly recommend this book.

Not worth even the few bucks it cost. The bottom is warped so badly a flat stick of butter won't stick to it, so teh butter slides all over loose. amd sometimes rolls off the tray if not moved carefully. And it doesn't stay inside the butter dish, because the lid doesn't snap on like it is supposed to, because the flat ridges it is supposed to snap over are warped. Butter dish wobbles in the fridge, lid falls off when you pull it out of fridge, and butter flops around on the bottom holder.

The only reason I bought a new one, is that the bottom of the old dish is missing a piece of plastic after falling on the floor. The base and lid of the old butter dish snap together tightly, so that you can easily lift the whole unit by the lid, without the pieces coming apart. The new dish is supposed to be the same design -- It has the same plastic ridges which should snap together. But it just doesn't snap closed. I can use the old lid on the new base, and it will snap closed properly, but the new lid is just not the right fit, and sits loosely on the base.

That said, if you are a little shaky or careless putting the lid on when the butter is soft, you're in for a mess. Also, the place where the butter fits, the side walls are too high for the knife to go all the way through to make a clean cut. The walls are about 1/2 inch high, where the butter we use is about 1 1/2 inch. So all in all, it's pretty much a waste of money for us.

It is THAT slow..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Just this weekend we purchased the GameCube system for my 4 year old son for his birthday. We purchased this game thinking it would be fun and exciting just like watching the movie. Unfortunately, the game is rather difficult and boring. It's only for one player and it's really geared more towards adults than children. There is only ONE game to play and you can get stuck on one level for ever!! Unlike Mario Brothers games that give you lots of differrent game options. I would not recommend spending the price on this game, try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY - UNLESS YOU GET IT USED","review":"My son (7 yrs old) wanted this as soon as it came out - we ran out & bought it & what a disappointment!

A lot of the races will be too hard for young kids, but WAY too boring for adults (and probably young kids). I couldn't believe how repetitive this game was. I thought, Oh yay, a new level with new challenges. But . . . WRONG. Each new level had the same challenges. Seriously 90% of this game is trying to swim through bubbles while chasing a character.

So let's imagine THQ staff chating at the office, the guys with feet over the table, and the director tells: come on, we have to deliver this game until next weekend! And they just had the work of copying movie scenes and making a no concept, with terrible gameplay title. Last, and most important argument of all to hold you far from this game: the bigest challenge is to exercise your pacience with the HUGE loading time. It takes about 4 minutes (an eternity if you look at an ugly clownfish swinging at screen) to load a new level. You don't have clear goals to achieve, you feel like beeing pushed to the end of each stage. People of Pixar and Disney must be ashamed. It takes an unbeliavable distance beetwen the movie and the game.

Powerful!","review":"Ms. Williams asked me to read this book and review it..I was only too happy to help out and am I glad I did! This is a very powerful, sensual, intriguing love story. You'll laugh, cry, and want to be there. Her writing transcends all race barriers, whether you're black, white, purple, or pink, you'll love and understand and feel everything each character is going through. Sam Ross and Ashela Jordan have to be two of the most developed characters that I have read about in a long while. Their love affair is taken at a pace that's believable and when they do finally make love, it's passionate and so sensual it burns up the pages. This is a definte good read and you WILL read it over and over. Keep it up Robyn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you've got to be kidding","review":"I was previously a fan of Ms williams until I read this book. The first half is well written and keeps one's interest.

I tell everyone I know who likes reading romantic fiction filled with twists and turns that this book is a MUST! The reader is drawn into these characters as if you actually know them. The more I read, the more enthralled I became. I really liked the way the author never failed to mislead the reader into thinking one thing and revealing something else in the end. A Twist of Fate is a love story that's exciting, sensuous, sad and captivating all at the same time. I can't wait to read her first book, Preconceived Notions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Twist of Fate","review":"This book is definitely classified as a page turner. I could truly feel Ashela's pain throughout the story. My heart just went out to her and I always wanted the best for her. Every woman would want a man like Sam in their life. After all that Ashela went through she deserved someone like Sam by her side. Excellent love scenes. Keep up the good work Robyn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spicy","review":"Spicy and hot! I loved A Twist of Fate. Robyn Williams caught my immediate interest with her superb character development. Then things just started to unfold. A Twist reminds me of the fact that the decisions we make can and do impact us for the rest of our lives. It's what we do to recover from not so good decisions and how we take advantage of the good ones. I've already passed this book on and have told friends it's a must read.. I can't wait to read Preconceived Notions. Robin, thanks so much for your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Williams has a new fan....","review":"I REALLY enjoyed this book. Loved the characters.

Ms. Williams has presented another novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The characters, storyline, twists and turns, and the finale were just AWESOME. The pages came to life as she unfolded this satifying piece of work. She is definitely making a literary statement and I personally am hearing her, LOUD AND CLEAR. I can't wait for the next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I absolutely did not enjoy this book. I found myself skimming through it about a third of the way. It wasn't keeping my attention and there was way too much going on and I found it tedious to be expected to follow it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with twists and turns!","review":"A Twist of Fate engages the reader and affords us the opportunity to glimpse into the lives of characters who are well drawn on paper. For those who long to play before vast audiences of people, this novel shows that doing so is a steep way to realize your dreams. Through the lives of Ashela Jordan and Sam Ross, the story shows us how mean and ruthless life is inside the risqué world of music. To achieve their goals, the characters sometimes did things by any means necessary, sometimes even betraying the friends and lovers who cared about them most. The story comprises a maze of intricate circumstances and is beset with scenes of betrayal, revenge, and self-revelation. At times, the novel came across so real that I had to keep telling myself that it was just a book. Overall, A Twist of Fate is an excellent novel. Every single woman with a dream to improve her station in life should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The writing seemed directed toward a juvenile audience. Too much like a daytime soap opera and not enough substance. The daily crisis approach instead of a well-developed story overtook a promising start. The main character had so many flaws I couldn't stand her by the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and sensual experience.","review":"A Twist of Fate was thoroughly delightful to read. I loved the intensity of Sam and Ashela's relationship. I thought the storyline was layered with drama and filled with interesting characters whose lives and experiences I came to care about. I liked the way all the players involved \\"came to life\\" and managed to inspire me in ways unimaginable. Sam and Ashela's lives evoked humor, anger, pain, as well as sadness. With real-like intensity, Ms. Williams easily drew me into the cut-throat \\"me first\\" world of artists and stars. A Twist of Fate is also filled with some very passionate and erotic situations. At times I felt like a voyeur peering into someone's bedroom while the couple made fierce, passionate love. Although the book is long, I could not put it down and I definitely did not want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Scandalous!","review":"I'm still trying to close my mouth after reading such a thrilling piece of work! I'm at a loss to describe just how utterly suspenseful this book, A Twist of Fate was. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster ride at Great America. As I was reading some parts of the book, I actually stopped to look at the cover of the book and had to ask myself how on earth did the author come up with some of these scenes? They were so realistic that only someone who's actually lived or experienced them could write about it the way that Ms. Williams did. My only complaint about A Twist of Fate was that it wasn't long enough. I hated to see the book end. At several points along the way, I kept checking to see how much more I had left to read because I just didn't want to get to the end of the book. I've just ordered my copy of Preconceived Notions for Amazon.com and I can't wait to read it. If it's anything near as good as A Twist of Fate, it promises to be a phenomenal read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart stopping...Drama to the end....Tell somebody about it.","review":"I do not need a lot of space to say that this book was FANTASTIC!!!!!

A relief from the plethora of 1500 pg \\"upgrade\\" books on the market, with their scholarly compendia of Intel chip specs and pinouts, and the superficial beginners books that are so broad-brush that you wonder if you've learned anything.One drawback is that the book is a few years old.

There are 6 different Princess games each with different game mechanics. This is good because it will keep the player from growing tired of the same mechanics.

The other deal breaker is having now save system which forces the player to start over after every power down. Would only recommend for kids who are obsessed with Disney princesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Young Girls unless...","review":"This game is really fun; but is more for older girls.

Although it's a very fun game, it can get a bit frustrating both for kids and adults. The controls are not consistent and Pitfall Harry suffers from what I call \\"grease on the floor\\" syndrome - where the character seems to be slipping on the floor all the time. Also, as was stated previously, the special powers Harry picks up along the way don't always work the first time. The major problem (especially for someone not familiar with Pitfall) is that the character of Harry is not developed sufficiently so that you actually care about him.

The only drawback that I saw, and so many others have pointed out, is this probe's female receptacle for connecting it to your meter. I thought the price being asked for the companion connector was excessive, and after finding nothing in my test lead collection that fit it, I made my own. I chose a common wire splice that looked about the right size then by stripped off it's plastic insulation. The metal part of the splice fits into the probe tightly and sticks out far enough to connect to my meter's alligator clip. Problem solved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Test probe","review":"Been an electrician for thirty-some-odd years, don't know how I made do without this. Makes testing live circuits a snap.

The extender is inexpensive at $3.56, but unlike the Green wire probe, it's not eligible for Amazons super saver shipping. So you must also add $6.12 S&H to complete the $11.66 probe.

Thinking this was just some mistake I fast forwarded the entire DVD trying to find it and after about 2 minutes of fast forwarding the DVD stopped. There is 16 minutes of battle footage on this dvd, the actual show had right at 30 minutes. This is completely unacceptable that a company would break this up into two parts and mislead consumers into purchasing them both. I've got movies twice the length of the actual show on DVD and a company sees fit to split at most a 2 hour DVD into 2 discs sold seperately? That is ridiculous and I feel horrible about wasting my $15 dollars on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they serious?","review":"The HBO broadcast of this battle was what, about an hour long?

The season mode is interesting but there's no plot behind it. You just beat someone up and maybe get a match after a while. There's no feature to challenge for a belt or request a certain match (solve 4 months of fighting with a Cell match).The CAW is very expansive but really nothing new.The gameplay is very simple and after an hour or two just down-right redundant and boring.The best feature in Raw2 is the ability to really tweak your ring entrance. Everyone knows you can rip music from CDs into the game but THQ also created some big Pyro effects that you can synchronize to your character and the music. Sadly the moves your character makes are pretty lame and most intros start with a shot of the audience so you miss any opening pyros. The only way you can see a wide shot of the opening pyro is if your guy walks out like Goldust or HHH.The game is good but I'll wait for Smackdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"WWE RAW 2","review":"one word describes this game when compared to some of the classic wrestling games from the past -- \\"meh\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a horrible game that will amount to nothing","review":"this game is horrible in every sense of the word. so what if it has more matches than raw 1. this trash grows old very quickly. the graphics are ugly. the gameplay is really bad. and the actaul wrestiling is just plain HORRIBLE. the wrestelers move very very slow. i tried so much to deliver a move to my opponent and it didnt work. i just couldent be done. i tried several moves none of them worked. even if you can nail a move which isnt entirely rare. its not fun or exciting to execute these moves because they look so damm sloppy. raw 2 uses an engine that is that slow. none of my desired moves would worked. the gameplay is so messed up. heck even the original smackdown for the original playstation moved faster than this MUCH MUCH FASTER. i could go and on and on but ill just stop right here. maybe some diehard wrestiling fans could enjoy raw 2. but im definitely going back to smackdown here comes the pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game is lots of fun","review":"this game is not exactly what we all wanted,but it's fun.the season mode is better than all other games.u can exactly steal,fight backstage,and set traps.the finishers are not what we wanted but it's good.you can acually f-5 your opponet off the top rope.i hope they would've put the elimination chamber,and the inferno match in this game.hopefully it will be in raw 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring boring boring hey thq thats for you and raw 2","review":"ok im gonna keep this simple this game is a waste of money ."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate it","review":"why is it so hard to just up date No Mercy with better graphics, i have been waiting so long for a decent wrestling game on xbox, ps2 and cube but still they are all cheap rubbish with flashy graphics and hell in a cell matches. this doesnt make a good game, it would probably shock THQ that there are wwe fans older than 12 who want a playable game. i hate this game i hate wwe xix and i aint touchin smackdown.i am making a pledge never to buy another wrestling game made by THQ unless they go back to AKI or wwe give their licence to some other company. i have waited to long for a decent game so i guess now its up to EA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a dolla!!","review":"This game is really bad!!..

Unfortunately, it does not live up to the hype AT ALL. The only good things about this game are the large number of wrestlers (there's a lot), the create-a-wrestler mode (lots of options), and the great entrance sequences (which are just like WWE TV). Unfortunately, the gameplay is terrible. It seems like everyone is moving in SLOW MOTION... It's not fun at all to play. If you like really boring games, this game might be for you! I was also upset to discover that the game DOES NOT allow custom soundtracks during gameplay (even though it says so on the box!!). It only allows custom soundtracks to make-a-wrestler entrances. Overall, this is a slow, boring game with nice graphics. I'd recommend Legends of Wrestling II or Backyard wrestling instead (if you enjoy ACTION over marketing!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WWE Raw 2","review":"This game is cool.

In the music that everybody knows, the Rosenkavalier waltzes, Mehta is not competitive--his readings are big, generalized, without wit or special interest. But who really knows the music from Der Liebe der Danae or Intermezzo? It's garrulous and unispired compared to Strauss's best, but a nice plunge if you like warm chocolate. The recording isnt the best. Horns are far away, strings very up close, winds buried in a bit of a haze.

I would go so far as to say that this game is better than all of the classic Sonic games made for the Genesis. The addition of Cream is great. She fits right in with the rest of the characters. The graphics are wonderful. All of the characters have new animations but handle exactly as they should. The audio is classic Sonic and the boss battles are challenging but not too difficult. Since most all of the characters must be unlocked in order to play them this adds tons of replay value.

There are six fantastic levels and a final showdown with Dr.Eggman. You may think this game is easy when you start it but it gets harder. You can only save characters with Sonic but, that isn't to much of a down fall. There is also a new character Cream the rabbit. You might not think she kicks butt but looks isn't everything. You save Knuckles last wich may be somones favorite character.

I was very enthusiastic to find this one on Amazon. And after reading your reviews, I decided to buy one. The shipping was quick b/c I got it in three days. However, since my z3 hotshoe does not fit the flash, I have to use the wireless connection. The instructions about setting up the connection are straight forward and the flash worked like a charm after the set up. I put it in different angles, close and away from my camera and it worked every time. Remember to move the cursor from the N back to other settings or it won't fire. I used it with my Samsung 1050 pocket camera and it worked as well.I am very happy to get it and would highly recommend it.I would give it a 5 stars, if the shoe wheel were stronger so it could better be tightened to the bracket.

The graphics are better in some situations, but worse in others, not too consistent. I beat the game in less than 7 hours (all 3 endings + upgrades, and alternate episodes). After you get the hang of the game, it becomes increasingly easier and easier. Which is weird, since games usually get progressivly more difficult. Plus, it goes from a realistic storyline to fantasy storyline.The best way I can summarize this game is: It's a game that you would like to play until you beat it and never play it again. Hardly any replay factor, unlike the GTA series (for me anyway). If you want my advice, go to Blockbuster, rent it, solve it, return it.

You have a one-two punch or kick that's not very effective when you're fighting. The computer has way more powerful punches and kicks that drasticly bring down your health. The only way to damage your opponents is to hit them with a special attack when they're stunned (GOOD LUCK ACHIEVING THAT GOAL). I won't totally bring down True Crime, since there were some good things in the game: Roaming the city and stopping steet fights was fun, frisking people for drugs, guns, etc., and rescuing people from kidnappers. One more thing I could never understand in gun fights -when you give someone a headshot, the game takes a point off your Good Cop Meter. This is ridiculous. The game has an excellent soundtrack from Snopp Dogg, N.E.R.D and other rap artist to keep the game moving.

Sure the graphics may be looking great and the destruction is fun for the first few minutes and then you get tired of the garbage. It's a down right shame that people actually like this crap over GTA: Vice City; awarded Best Action Game in the VGA awards. If you want superior action I highly recommend GTA 3 and GTA: Vice City.

Best band on the Suburban Noize Records label.California Poppy is beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"File under: sucks!","review":"First off, I made a major screw up today by buying this CD 'blind'. Normally I won't take a chance on a new CD unless it is by a band I already know to be good, and sometimes even then I won't purchase until I check them out at Amazon or on LimeWire, etc. Secondly, although OPM appears to have been around for awhile I can only assume their earlier releases were better? Being a big KMK fan I noticed they were on the same label and decided to give em a try. BIG MISTAKE. These guys try to look all hard on the back cover sitting around a table littered with drugs and guns but turns out their music is about as hard as 2nd grade math. Is this a 311 or Sublime tribute band? Total crap! It has no funk, punk or edge which most other SubNoize bands bring to the table. It's not even good stoner rock. A collection of worthless wanna-be raggae ballads. Might make a good frisbee though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Poor Effort","review":"Looking back on my years as an OPM fan, dating back to the release date of Menace to Sobriety...it is painful to have to sit and suffer through California Poppy and then convince myself that this is actually an OPM album. The style is so noticeably forced that it almost makes you tense rather than the \\"soothing\\" sound it obviously looks to achieve. Another huge downfall of this album is that it lacks any of the punky, funky and upbeat sounds that were so necessital and well-placed on earlier OPM endeavors; and also made them so memorable. I remember thinking that OPM signing with Suburban Noize Records was a promising leap forward in their career, but now I realize that it has pushed them down a road toward stoneristic stylings rather than the mutli-genre collectives that made their earlier albums so easy to replay. Save your money for the next OPM album down the road, because this one is simply not worth it, and is almost better forgotten than ever put in your cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth and at home","review":"Sanders spends time in the streams, his reference points and detailed helpful hints make application of the book a complete pleasure.

I havent taken those courses in years so I found myself referring back to my old undergraduate textbooks quite frequently. It is a brief overview guide, being only 180 pages, It leaves out a lot of important information reguarding each hormone. It's no textbook.4 stars because the book lacks essential tables and graphs that outline the major functions and effects of each hormone.

It's a good book and expands a little more on the Spacer/Settler interaction on the planet Inferno through the vehicle of Chanto Grieg's murder. Lot's of interesting touches like the forced conscription of robotic labor that help define the society and dress the stage for Utopia. A very good book if not as good as the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the trilogy","review":"'Caliban', the first in this trilogy, is a good book and well worth seeking out, so is the third one, 'Utopia'. This is easily the least of the three. Although Allen tries to expand his examination of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics by introducing New Law robots the concept is not done with any verve, pace or excitement. As noted by another reviewer it has an Agatha Christie feel to it but without the charm or style of her mysteries. It's not even a particularly interesting puzzle. There's nothing in this middle book that can't easily be caught up with in the third. And the concept of Three Law/No Law and New Law is better examined there as well. You really don't need to spend the time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sequel should have been better, but was not","review":"While the murder mystery was well set up, the ending was more of Agatha Christie ending, with a parlor room scene and a head shaker of a perpetrator. The political intrigue which should have been the height of this story was not focused on well enough. This is a society in the grips of an awful set of diriving forces that should have rocked the foundations of the planet. But you didn't feel that pain from the governor. The 4 law Robot introduced isn't given the same exploration that Caliban was in the first book. You do not get behind his head. The pain of transition should have been brought to bear hear as their are real world examples all around us. This missed the boat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for Isaac Asimov.","review":"If he were alive to see what Allen did to his Robot Universe, he would strangle the guy. This is a perfect example of why Allen should've stuck to those Little House On The Prairie sequels. The basic idea of Inferno (Just like it's predecessor, Caliban) is the creation of two new kinds of robots: The New Law robots and the No Law robot, and their effect on the society of the planet Inferno. The New Law Robots are freer than the original Three Law robots in Asimov's books, but have their own share of problems; Caliban, the only robot created with no laws, is of course the most free, but is far from human. This is all well and good, and in a more capable writer's hands would have been interesting, but Allen takes his one or two good ideas and throws them in a turbine. I'm sorry, Mr. Allen, but I don't really care about the intimate details of Tierlaw Verick's body, or anyone else's, for that matter.

The videos are just the ones from the game though, and although they're XBox quality, they're really not worth it unless you're some extremely hardcore Star Wars fan and can't miss out on the storyline.

He gets frustrated and visibly upset (surely all that adrenaline isn't good for kids?!) and it was making my heart race, too. Most of the sections (he's on Level 6) involve a race of some sort or going through 2D platforming mazes (think Crash Bandicoot).Some of the graphics are truly excellent, but not for small children. There are scenes with Bruce the shark chasing and trying to eat Nemo and Dory as you navigate them through minefields and in the sub. The music sounds pretty threatening, too.Personally, I love PS2 games aimed at kids (e.g. Ice Age 2, Curious George, the Spyro series, etc.), but this game is repetitive and aggravating. Fighting against the current for some of the games makes it difficult and frustrating...which is decidedly unfun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This game is rated E for everyone and is targeted for a younger audience. My son is eight and has great difficulty in many areas. My daughter is six and can't play it all. And because you have to go all the way back to the beginning of a level when you quit, we often leave the game paused and turn off the t.v. so we don't have to lose what progress we've made.
