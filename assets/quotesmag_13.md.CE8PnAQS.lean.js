In General this mp3 player sucks. A nice MP3 that holds up to 60 hrs. of songs like the apple Ipod or the Dell DJ is a much better MP3! not like this which only carries 20 songs!!! which is better? The only good thing about this is the fm radio. The bateries didnt last very long AND IT ONLY HOLDS 20 SONGS! TRUST ME YOU ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF ROOM VERY FAST. In my opinon you should buy a Dell DJ 15 GB it is cheaper the Apple Ipod 15 GB. so you won't be spending to much on the same and not to little on 20 SONGS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Steves is my travel god","review":"Rick Steves, albeit dorky, is a genius European traveler.

I have not even been to Copenhagen, and already find this travel guide extremely traditional in its approach and narrow in scope for travelers. For example, no mention what the kids would like if you are traveling with family. Copenhagen over the years has been transformed into a very hip city which this book failed to portrait.

Plus there's no automatic shut off and the \\"off\\" position is between the high and low instead at one end or the other and so it's easy to forget and leave it on when you think you've turned it off.

The Helen of Troy's bristles are longer for better grabbing and holding of the hair..thus a tighter curl. It has two heat settings which I find adequate for my very fine hair.

But, now, some new observations have placed in doubt parts of the concept of \\"beauty.\\"This book excited me more than any has since Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time. Dr. Livio succeeds in explaining complicated scientific theories in a way that make sense to the simple layman (I am not a scientist, and have had practically no exposure to physics since my college days).

This book helped me get it together, otherwise I may have ended up as a drop out...... I made past college and onto a career & family. Looking back the book was great tool to help me reach my dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fun","review":"I didn't like this book. It takes forever to get to the point. I got nothing out of it. I am a returning student looking for studying help. I wasn't getting much out of my time. I spent to much time prepping to study than actually studying. I needed help and this wasn't it. Its a story of a guy talking to kids giving them assignments to help them out. The book talks more about the students and you really have to filter out material to get to the point. I couldn't even finish it. I had to get back to spending to much time making flash cards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The bands are great but the description stated that the kit came with a vhs tape which was exactly what i needed for where i would be using it.

I'm a woman, in OK shape, and I started with the green - way too easy. The red challenges me on most exercises. I really like the book that came with the bands, as it explains clearly how to do the exercises. I haven't looked at the video yet. I wish there were more ways to use them without having to use the door attachment, though...most places where there are doors are just not great places to work out!

The board I purchased looks like it was routed out with dull bits. The grooves on the top side look all chopped instead of smooth. The depth of the groove is also inconsistent. The top and bottom surface is uneven where the pieces of wood meet. Feels like an old wood floor. The bottom side (which is supposed to be usable) even has wood putty filling a 1/2 inch hole or gash. The manufacturer wants me to send pictures of their \\"shoddy workmanship\\" before I can send it back for refund or replacement. I have yet to put a knife on this board so I will take pictures and send them to Mountain Woods.

The interviews were top notch and very \\"straight from the horse's mouth\\". These were people who were there, in the thick of it!!!

I was reminded why I went to physics grad school and not math. There were times where the wanderings of symbol pushing left me floundering. Quite a few times I found myself half way through a derivation, having forgotten what we were trying to get to. But it never made me angry or despairing. If anything it reminded me real mathematicians are explorers.The author very successfully mixes pure math, history, some biography, and some real physics. This is not easy. Agreed this is in no way an exhaustive treatment of any; but an exhaustive treatment would be 10 volumes, and then who would read it?As some reviewers have pointed out there are several mathematical errors in the text. But I have to admit that I found it thrilling to catch one myself.-Michael Clarage[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning","review":"Don't buy this book without buying the companion i book by Paul Nahin.

Gameplay and graphics are much improved and the announcers voices were crisp and clean. I was also surprised to see that the rosters were also as up to date as they could be (i.e. Juan Gonzalez on Texas). This is also not an \\"arcade\\" style baseball game, stats are pretty accurate like real MLB is and you aren't hitting hr's every other ab. So all in all it's a pretty good game, 4 star rating for a lack of \\"franchise mode\\", but do you really want to keep playing after 162 games anyways?

I'll take it back today. The players are on the teams they were on last year. The big trades that happened aren't in this game. There's no franchise mode, only season mode and they even botched that. It has the 2001 season schedule, not this years. So if it has the players on the wrong teams and the wrong schedule, why bother? As much as I wish Kenny Lofton was still on the Tribe, it just isn't right.The graphics are a little better than they were but still not as good as All Star Baseball or even Triple Play. I don't even care about the graphics I just want this years' schedule because I like to play the game that is scheduled in real life to be played that day.

I just purchased it yesterday and, so far, have only listened to a few cuts. The \\"This Was\\" remake is interesting for many reasons, not the least being the fine playing (in my opinion it measures quite well with the original). In fact, the title of the album \\"This Was\\" completely fits the re-recording. The other album is a nice mix of reworked Pig originals and blues standards. I have not seen the DVD, but, understand it does not have recorded performances, only an interview (a shame, reflected in the 4, not 5 star rating).

Excellent if you live close to a bike park since you won't be pedaling up.

I enjoyed how she shared her personal experiences, making it more real for me to relate and not so technical. I also found the book to very motivating and inspiring. There's a few words of advise the author gave that I always think about when I run. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is beginning to run or considering running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good geology, but not enough PTr event","review":"I enjoyed the history of geology and especially thehistory of establishing the Permian age itself. Iliked the thorough discussion of the Russian sites,but as a geoscience professional I am probably moreinclined to this than the average reader. There wasalso a good discussion of the KT event (that wiped outthe dinosaurs) and several other extinction events.My gripe is that when he finally got around to the PTr(Permian - Triassic)event, he basically explained whycertain hypothoses were not good, but didn't reallygive a strong hypothesis of his own. Maybe that isbecause the evidence is not good enough to have a stronghypothosis, but the title is misleading in that case.Overall, I recommend the book as a history of geologyand the Permian specifically, but don't expect to comeaway with a real answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book on Evolution, Plate Tectonics, Catastrophic Events and Scientific History","review":"There's nothing I can really say about this book which hasn't been more elequently stated elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the reader will become familiar with many of the early scientists which formulated current theory and recent advances in theories once thought absurd but are now considered pro forma, such as plate tectonics and catastrophism. While the title does imply unique focus on the Permian extinction (still its primary focus), it actually deals with the 5 largest extinction events. The book is not technical in nature at all, and should appeal to anyone who has a lay interest in the Permian period and similar epochs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly informative and well written","review":"This book covers the historical, intellectual and factual context of attempts to understand the transition from the Permian to the Triassic. It does so in an entertaining way, and I have had difficulty putting it down. The important interplay between geology and paleontology is very well explained. What I find most satisfying about this book is that it really describes the process of discovery in a most wonderful way. Whether or not some parts have since become out of date is not particularly important. The interested reader will have been brought to a level where he or she can easily find out more for themselves, and I think this gives this book a value which will not diminish with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long run, short slide into the Jurassic","review":"There are lots of interesting facts and stories in this book, and eventually they are assembled into a theory on the cause of the end-Permian extinction. First, though, we learn a lot about nineteenth century geology from a European, primarily British perspective. Then we learn a lot, a whole lot, about other extinctions. Finally, we get a rather tentative, politically correct proposal for the cause of the end-Permian extinction. The author even quotes Al Gore.Fortunately, the author writes in a relatively readable manner and knows well the many subjects he presents . The graphs and illustrations are well done and complement the text. I just wish the book were shorter and more direct or that the author had split it into two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Specialized vocabulary","review":"The author hangs on to too much specialized knowledge and vocabulary for this to be interesting enough for general readers.I was looking forward to a being led by an expert into a new area of knowledge related to geologic timescales. But I couldn't find much of the excitement that you often find in equivalent popularized science discussions by experts in astronomy or physics for example.I think the potential is there, but this was not the author for it. The author however is clearly capable, competent, well-informed.If you remember the times when the neighbor kid went on for hours about his rock collection and you liked it, this book is for you.Meanwhile, I'm still looking for the author who will open the door for me to geology and other like topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off","review":"This has to be one of the most expensive, smallest capacity ink cartridges on the market.

The retellings were wooden and lacked the graceful flow that all well told fairy & folk tales should possess. Many of the stories are taken from Pu Songling's \\"Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio.\\" Moreover children and parents may find some of the stories in this collection both morbid and cruel and not of a \\"cuddly\\" nature. I would encourage both adults and children to look elsewhere for a better, more approachable collection from the rich Chinese tradition of imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on it","review":"I have read Chinese fairy tale books that spark the imagination. Unfortunately this is not one of them. The language is dull and the illustrations are not up to par...I actually fell asleep while reading them several times. This book does a disservice to these tales and hopefully it will not deter others from trying stories from other countries. I bought this book used and it is still not worth the reduced price. The author probably had good intentions but this is one to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book because the front cover review compares the author's writing ability to Robert Boswell, Russell Banks, and Richard Russo, 3 of my favorites. However, Breaking Her Fall lacks subtlety and emotional resonance. It is a story told in a very flat, almost unbelievable, way. It is unclear to me how the Chicago Tribune reviewer could have thought such a comparison possible. Every book I have read by the 3 R's lives on in my thoughts because of the deep connections made by the characters. Goodwin's book, alas, is plot driven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some insight for parents of teens","review":"What filters back to current parents of teens is very bewildering. They don't seem to have the same inclination their parents had as teens to find \\"first love\\", and they seem willing to perform what \\"we\\" thought of as private acts in front of each other. \\"Breaking Her Fall\\" certainly doesn't dispell anyone's worst fears of what it is really like. But it helped me to read about it and find out I'm not crazy! I was glued to every page. My mild critcism is that Tucker Jones made choices in his own life that were as bad as his daughter's; he doesn't seem destined to find personal happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very human","review":"What I love about this book is how human it feels. He really explores mistakes that the characters make and all the phases of getting \\"through\\" those mistakes: regret, remorse, anger, shame, frustration and ultimately forgiveness. I love this because it feels real to me, I thought the author did a great job creating characters with all their strengths and flaws.I have young kids, but not teenagers (yet!), just thought I'd mention that I really enjoyed the book even though I'm not going though the same things as Tucker, the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the first 3/4!","review":"Breaking Her Fall's main character is a flawed man who knows it. He's a single father raising two children with an out of town money/status-hungry ex. He gets himself into a spot of trouble while searching for his daughter who is not where she said she would be. As the parent of a daughter just a tad older than the daughter in this book, I felt Tucker's actions were a bit over blown and obsessive. He has not learned to trust himself and so defaults to 'testoterone dad'. This book was a terrific read for the first 3/4 of the way into it. Then I felt the author kept repeating the same conversations/fatherly musings/ and themes. I had to make myself finish it because I had so loved the beginning I wanted to wrap up these characters and see their happy ending. The daughter/dad final 'coming to terms with what had happened' set in nature conversation seemed contrived. I felt as if it could have come 100 pages earlier with more succinct writing. All in all a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title was compelling...","review":"...and the book started out pretty good; I found the synopsis intriguing; however, overall I found BHF to be tedious and the characters unsympathetic.I didn't care for the way the children were allowed such disrespect in their words and actions toward their parents, and I was disgusted at the way the parents were portrayed as total patsies to their children.Even worse, I thought that the main character's (Tucker) disinterest in holding the boys who violated his daughter, a mere 14-year-old child, was unrealistic and reprehensible. I find it completely unbelievable that there would be a man out there who would not want to see predators such as these brought to some kind of justice.I was relieved to finish this book. Besides the above criticisms, I found it to be far too wordy due to several sub-plots that were unnecessary and distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I had high expectations for this book. Normally a story line involving a father/daughter relationship would suck me right in, but Breaking Her Fall just didn't do it for me. Peppering the teenaged characters' dialogue with profanity didn't convince me that Goodwin has a firm grasp on their insights. There was a world of material that the author could have focused on without delving into the neighbors' sorrows and other tangents. I felt as though the daughter's depression and the theme of abandonment were not given the development that could have made this book wow instead of blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"allow him to digress--and digress--and digress","review":"After reading reviews (it's difficult to find ANY book on this site that has a general rating of less than 4 stars)I was eager to read this book and I really did want to like it. Thank goodness it only cost me a trip to the library. The author mentions one thing then gets sidetracked to something else then something else until the original point is totally lost. Since I was only able to endure 17 pages I'm giving an extra star on the off chance that perhaps this book got interesting somewhere along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I didn't really care for this book, and that surprised me, because I've read quite a bit of Jodi Picoult's work, and she covers the same territory -- parents dealing with a teenaged child they no longer understand.

Also, if you're wondering about the truth of Clark \\"Count Clarkula\\" Dickson, it is cleverly revealed. I could go on and on about this book about a million times(heck, I just read it tonight) and if there is one thing I would say that would most likely surprise you, it is the ending. You're gonna love it and hate it at the same time, I guarrantee!:)P.S.

I clean and clean and clean the printheads and the printing gets WORSE! And cleaning uses ink! And the ink is expensive! It's a horrible, horrible circle of frustration. I just bought a Canon Pixma MP600 printer and can't wait to hook it up. But I'm waiting until the Epson's ink runs out before I do it. I want to use it all up because I don't want to waste any money.

On the other hand, this same formula may be what has forced me -- and many others, according to the reviews I've read -- to trash the C84 ink jet printer. Many people, myself included, have found that said printer suddenly stops working because of clogs that can't be unclogged, and one widely accepted theory is that this ink has dried to such an ultra-hard consistency that it has gummed up the works beyond all repair. So if you have an Epson ink jet printer that's still working, just be very careful to follow all recommended precautions to keep it working -- and keep your fingers crossed.

When I did, I did a lot of research on the Internet, and the Epson CX6600 came up as the most efficient user of ink at that time. I have had it for a few years now, and really like it.

Nothing at all about the best food/toys to buy ... if you happen to just want a pet.

The story is small and focused mainly on two characters, each at the crossroad of major decisions in their lives. I loved how the action is paced throughout, lending more time to building characters and raising the stakes. The chapter with the farm attack was incredible and quite shocking, showing the massive power and stamina of the garou.

To me the words \\"charge all at once\\" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it.

It is terribly designed. The back compartment only fits a very short power strip, and you do really have to jam it in there. However, the short power strip is only long enough to fit 2 traditionally shaped AC/DC converters - ie the ones that are too wide to fit into adjacent plugs. If you're thinking that's no big deal because I have the slim kind of AC/DC converters that CAN fit into adjacent plugs (like for your bluetooth earpiece), HA! The back compartment of the station is too narrow to fit those converters. The only real option is taping the power strip to the outside of the station.

Matthew Reilly likes to write super fast, unrealistic, one man hero type books and we all read them. I thought his first few books were entertaining, and a few of the ideas were even thought provoking. This, however, is not true for this book. Besides jumping on the religious conspiracy band-waggon that we all love reading about (see: Dan Brown); Reilly also adds in the cliche' middle east anti- Arab, anti-Israeli, as well as the anti-American party mix we love to hate. I get it already: Arabs bad (except one), Israelis bad (except one), Americans bad (all of them), and Australians are super-human! I was hoping for a little more as his writing progressed and he matured, but I guess I was waiting in vein. All this being said, it is a fast read that mindlessly keeps you turning the pages. Who am I to critic him, I haven't written anything great either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, Badly written","review":"The idea behind the story is very good.

Ever","review":"This could possibly be the worst book I've ever read, and I've read \\"The Last Templar.\\" The story is so stupid that you want to gauge your eyes out; the writing style is worse than that of a twelve-year-old; he uses exclamation marks like there's no tomorrow; and the characters are so flat you could build a card house out of them...Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.Read James Rollins instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer's Remorse","review":"I really could have found a better use for the eight bucks I spent on this book. I've read four of Reilly's books and have become a big fan. If I were new to his work and started with this one, I would never get around to the others. I'm about a hundred pages into it, and so far haven't seen much in the way of character development. It's hard to care about a character you don't know. Normally, I'd be rooting for someone by this point. Yes, there's a lot of action; in fact, too much action -- no time for the suspense to build up before the bullets or grenades or lava is flying again and the characters are somehow managing to avoid it all. And yes, there are way too many exclamation points. It's supposed to be exciting. I get it.My advice for Reilly fans is to skip this one and hope his next novel is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth avoiding","review":"Sometime ago I read Ice Station by the same author. While it was definitely outrageous, it was still fun and inventive. This book is really neither. I don't think there is an idea in the book that isn't ripped off from somewhere else. Badly drawn diagrams of the various locations supplement the bad prose.The traps and the ways the team figure out to evade them is sort of like reading a narrative of someone playing a videogame. Activate the disable bullets gadget, jump left, dodge the oil, hit the \\"Call Falcon\\" button, jump over the crocodile, snatch the little girl before she's scalded by hot lava, and so on. Since none of the characters have any depth and the story itself is silly, reading this book quickly becomes a chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun action, good research... lots of diagrams?","review":"I really enjoyed the history and research in this novel - Reilly did a great job using those to build an exciting backdrop for an action-packed story - about the 7 wonders of the ancient world. Lots of well-thought out traps that are barely believable... very 'Indiana Jones' style. My only real problem was that sometimes the traps were so intricate that they were hard to accurately describe in text, so you had to depend on some sometimes confusing diagrams (thankfully) included as part of the story. I spent a lot of time flipping back to the diagrams to try to visualize the text, so that I could follow the story.. sort of distracting. The traps were cool, the 'ancient wonders' very well fit into the plotline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"As a child I was always interested in the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, so it was nice to find a book that entailed these wonders. I thought the action was very good and kept your interest. I have enjoyed all his other books, so I knew I would enjoy this one.

It was a lot of fun reading through a book with non stop, albeit slightly silly adventures, sort of allows ones brain take a little holiday. That being said, though, I spent the larger portion of this book wondering where the heck the editor went. I mean wow! This book makes a bigger use of exclamation points than I've ever seen! It's sort of like having a conversation with an excited 11 year old girl! Lets not forget the liberal use of italics! Just in case the exclamation points didn't get the point across well enough! Let's hear it for enthusiastic writers! It was similar to reading a story written by my eleven year old daughter! Actually, I was a little disappointed in the book! I usually really enjoy Reilly's books, but the editing of this one drove me...well..crazy!! Okay, I'll stop with the punctuation now...! (Sorry had to do just one more..)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Novel","review":"Reilly fans will probably find his latest novel to be quite a disappointment. For some reason, Reilly forsakes all the things that made his earlier books great. Instead, this novel is a thinly disguised political statement which reveals Reilly's prejudices against various governments and religions. The plot is obviously borrowed from \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and the characters are one-dimensional pawns whose main purpose is to verbalize Reilly's personal ideology. For the first time in a Reilly book, I managed to finish the book out of sheer determination rather than out of any interest in the plot or characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been a while I haven't finish a book","review":"In The Netherlands I payed 19 Euro for this intriguing title.

I kept reading after the first chapter just because I haven't got anything else to read.After the 747 landing on a golf course and doing some VTOL I gave up.You can compare it to some cheap tv action series that you always ask yourself \\"who would watch that?\\".The bottom line is don't waste your time and money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This makes Clive Cussler look like a literary genius!","review":"At the risk of sounding like a literary snob, I must say I found myself embarrassed to be reading this book. I also must admit I had to quit it half way through, but it also forced me to write my first review. I have eclectic reading taste, and once in awhile I like to read a \\"turn off your brain\\" novel, ala Crichton, James Rollins and the like. This book however, is so over the top comic book bad that it had me laughing! You can only have so many hairs breadth escapes and non-stop action. Nothing in this book is based in reality. If you are looking for a little bit of character development, and some kind of realistic plot don't look here. My son gave me this book for Christmas along with \\"Map of Bones.\\" If you are looking for an action packed thriller that still has some plausibility I recommend you try BONES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Matt, you have lost your touch...","review":"C'mon... I loved Ice Station, enjoyed Contest but this new \\"style\\" of writing is a load of crud. You disgust the art of it, you made a orginal plot, then chopped it up, chew it up and spit up to make your nation the \\"king\\" of the world. Listen up. Never use your own nation always winning, it makes you look like some dumb nationalist. Then your main character has a mechcanical arm? This is the twenty-first century, not the twenty-second, you make loony toons sound more realistic, then you make him a Austrailian Nationalist, who in your opinion must also be the king of the world because he just can't dye, but the other half of the team can. Reilly, pull your socks up, you starting to lose it all... if you haven't lost it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on","review":"It seems to be a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on the success of the Da Vinci Code. And just in case you missed it, there are several references too! The plot is wafer thin....who on earth would expend money and effort to simply chase a 4000-year old dream? All situations seemed to be too easily contrived and coincidental. Traps built several thousand years ago continue to work with the efficiency of a Swiss watch. Reilly thinks he's writing to a bunch of school kids.....exclamations, sound effects and hyphenated actions abound! Too obviously, the protagonists (Lily and West) have genius-level IQs and crack codes like you and I would crack our knuckles. The heroes have unfettered access to almost everything. Save yourself money and time .... stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a comic book with no pictures","review":"I think anyone who gives this book a 5 needs to use their fingers to count that high. I admit I didn't like that the americans were villians but since I had liked his previous books I decided to give it a try. Too ridiculous for words. Lets see a group of commandos with different cool names with special skills. COMIC BOOK! Hero protects little girl. COMIC BOOK! The characters are like stick figures. There were more super gadgets in the first chapter then Q gave Bond in his whole career. This seemed like a formula book. A hero, gadgets planes, trains and automobles. After the first chapter you just know whats going to happen after that it was all up hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your brain at the title page","review":"This book has some great ideas buried in it but the total disregard for any form of reality or research makes this book almost comical.I had signed off Reilly a while ago but got a free advanced readers copy for this book and being immensely interested in archeology and ancient civilizations decided to give it a try. Mr. Reilly's complete disregard for any of the physical sciences does disservice to what could have been an intriguing novel. I had to try and come up with so many harebrained excuses as to how most of the action and settings could take place that I was completely unable to maintain any suspension of disbelief. It obvious that when Mr. Reilly comes to a point in the story where some form of fact checking or research is needed he pretty much just makes something up to keep the story moving along.I'm the first to admit that some realism needs to be sacrificed for good story telling but this book doesn't even begin to attempt to balance the two.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest wonder is that it got published","review":"I gave up after the guy jumped off the cliff onto the back of the croc to save the little girl. I kid not you. Reilly wrote that and I did give up. I figured anything was better than wasting more time with Reilly and I didn't even pay for the book.Fiction is, well, fiction, and a suspension of disbelief is often part of the deal. However, Reilly's \\"plot\\" is really more like a bad cartoon. He makes the most recent, worst James Bond movies seem like documentaries.Is it possible this was supposed to be a comedy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the warning...","review":"I am currently reading this book and, at page 54, was tearing my hair out.This book has been writen for morons. The tiny little paragraphs, the itallics, the exclamation marks make this a very frustrating read.I actually commented to my husband this morning - it's like a computer game that you read instead of play!Thanks for the heads up - it obviously won't get any better so I won't be investing any more of my valuable time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a great plot for a good action movie, written by a capable screenwriter. However, as a book, it was lame. There was little character development to the point that you just didn't care about the heroes or the villains. The choppy writing was difficult to adjust to and it was hard to get into a smooth flow. Frankly, it could have been read at one sitting but why bother. I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, but atrocious writing","review":"It's a shame, because the author obviously has some great ideas, but this book is appallingly written. It's rather like listening to an enthusiastic young child describing someone else playing a very fast, very violent video game.You wonder if the author is trying to sell a screenplay for a successor to the \\"Indiana Jones\\" and \\"Mummy\\" films - if so he's forgotten two things, to create characters you care about, and to get readers to the end of his book.In the end I gave up. I advise you to save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"Quite simply the worst book that I have read in the last 10 years! My wife gave me this book as a birthday present and I only finished it to please her. I am ashamed to say that I reside in the same state of Australia as the author and if his writing style is indicative of the educational standards in this country, then God help us all. Within the first 10 pages I was sick to death of the story, the illustrations and the never ending \\"bangs!\\" and \\"resounding booms\\".I absolutely cannot believe that this guy is a best selling author....it is beyond comprehension.This story belongs in a B-Grade comic book and is an insult to all good authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"Not worth the money. Too many diagrams which could have been dispensed with through good old-fashioned writing. Really bad, or no, editing. Too many over-used exclamation points!!! Yeah, like that. But--what really annoys me--is that I will NEVER get back the time I spent reading this book. Definitely the first... and last Matthew Reilly book I will read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Fantasy","review":"In Seven Deadly Wonders by Matthew Reilly a team of adventurers are searching for the capstone to the Great Pyramid in Giza. It is a race against groups from Europe and America to gain portions of the capstone in order to avoid one group gaining great power and ruling the world for 1,000. There are a lot of similarities between the 1,000 years described here and the Nazi's Third Reich goal.As Reilly says in the interview in the back of the book, this is a fantasy book based in normal times. That is a perfect characterization. I would bet many people do not like the fantastic \\"toys\\" that each side has, but I don't mind. For instance, I am okay with a hovering 747.I also like West's hawk, Horus. Horus is brilliantly trained and an incredibly smart bird. West has taught Horus to do things that are also unbelievable, but also enjoyable to me.I really liked this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"After the first 50 pages...","review":"things get sorted out with the books format and such, at first i was ready to give up and chunk it, but then things got better and i figured out his style/format for the story, and then things made sense and from then onward i could not put the book down!all i can say is, give the book a chance! you won't regret it!happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain stupid!","review":"Perhaps that best describes me for even finishing this book. All US bashing aside this \\"story\\" is ridiculous. Miraculous saves left and right as this band of idiots travels around the world destroying ancient artifacts. Entire tombs are found in hours using ancient scrolls that apparently are available to anyone. Magma and boiling mud active for thousands of years, flowing through hidden passages triggered by elaborate traps, the likes of which would defy any current day engineering. Self-deploying awnings (made apparently from unobtanium) used to divert lava carried in the mother of all utility belts. Stupid from beginning to embarrassing end. I'm embarrassed to say that I have read other Reilly novels and even enjoted a few but this will be my last. Without a doubt THE worst book I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"Save your time and money. This is the first book I have purchased written by Matthew Reilly and I can assure you it will be the last. Without a doubt, the worst book ever written in the history of literature. I wish I could have my money and time back I spent on this book. It should be placed in the children's section of the bookstore, but that would be an insult to 5 year olds. Mr. Reilly should consider another career suited to his talents, maybe greeter at Wal-Mart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge fan, but real dissapointed","review":"Being a huge fan of Reilly's previous work, i was highly anticipating this one's release. Well, it came, then went right on ebay. It's that bad. It's like all the imagination reilly had in his other novel's has left him. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head with the \\"Comic Book\\" quote. Hopefully reilly's next book will be researched with something more plausible to give us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the Class of the Scarecrow Series","review":"I received an advanced copy of this melange of Riley's previous types of characters and plots. In this one a group of military types with the aid of a little girl go in search of valuable artifacts of the ancient seven wonders. Riley tries to use the formula of the small band of highly trained military types against much bigger military forces and a miraculous escape per every page. Where this worked in the Scarecrow books and in his early work Contest, this story falls flat with too much going on and really uninteresting characters. Riley tries to make the highly confused non-stop action understandable by throwing in many diagrams but it really doesn't work.The only reason I gave it any stars at all was because some of the history of the seven wonders was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard-cover video game","review":"7 Deadly Wonders is typical of Reilly's writing style, all \\"whiz-bang\\" action and adventure with an attempt at putting a storyline in there somewhere. I enjoyed his earlier books, a guilty pleasure, I admit, but this one I simply cannot defend. The science and history behind the story, the benben stone of the great pyramid and the seven ancient wonders of the world, are flimsy at best, and laughably ignorant at worst. Obviously, little or no research was done beforehand and what research is evident seems to come from excessive playing of tomb raider and viewings of Indian Jones. I quickly grew tired of his \\"... at exactly the same time..\\" and \\"just as...\\" style of action, and it rapidly loses any sense of reality. Reilly disapoints because he actually does have a talent for creating an intriguing story idea, but simply does not have the skill or talent for putting it on the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book for Generation Xboxers","review":"I cannot believe that the same person who wrote such pageturners as \\"Contest\\" and \\"Ice Station\\" penned this poor excuse for a novel! As one reviewer mentioned, this isn't a novel; it's an outline for a video game! It reads like a video game on steroids. A comic book is a better read than this dud. As a novel, it's missing a lot. Like suspense, excitement, and character development. And there is one element here that, if included, would have made for a GREAT novel: James Rollins!!!! Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This is the first book I really wanted to throw in the garbage unread.I tried so many times to read it.Struggled through 200 pages.It got to the point that I didn't care what happened to anyone or if they found what they were looking for.I like action books but this book took it to the max entreme to the point of very stupid.Nothing like his other books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy did I laugh!","review":"Laugh at how bad a writer this guy is. It's been said before but I'll say it again, when a writer this bad is selling millions then the world is in a very sad place. Poorly researched, cliched concepts and horrendous grammar. The man simply cannot write. I can only assume he is like a literary crack dealer selling second rate thriller 'junk' cut with Cussler's worst day of writing to semiliterate action junkies with no girlfriends.Thankfully its seems by these review that his fans are growing tired of his 'head exploding' act. A few more years will resign him to the bargain dust bins of time.If you want an ever bigger laugh than this 'geopolitical thriller', have a look at the FAQ on his website. Talk about ego."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-packed","review":"The action-packed story line never slows down as the race for the seven pieces is dangerous for those competing and perhaps even more so for those observing. Matthew Reilly provides a powerful adventure thriller that is action, action, and more action.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost painful to read","review":"The style of this book is very amateurish. The action is jerky and predictable, and the plot and character development are hurried and cliché. The net effect is a very difficult and unpleasant reading experience, very much reminiscent of how an excited pre-teen boy might tell a story he was making up as he went.Perhaps worse is the fact that Reilly borrows ideas heavily from other works, and reuses the same borrowed themes tirelessly throughout the book. Though the general premise of the Golden Capstone is exciting and has great potential, the execution is hopelessly tired and done-to-death. Imagine the opening sequences of Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indy bypasses the traps to retrieve the gold idol and then outruns the boulder. Now imagine reading the same scene, over and over but with slightly different traps--for more than 500 pages--and you'll start to get a feel for how Seven Deadly Wonders reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!!!","review":"This book is an absolute waste of time and I usually love reading this genre. It seems like the author used a checklist to write the book rather than developing any characters or background. \\"The group worked their way past several more traps\\" is an example of the type of writing you will see here. Read Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child or James Rollins for any well written action thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!!!!!!! --- count those.","review":"Again, I saw the title, read the plot summary and got excited for nothing. This book was truly painful to read. Hence my not finishing it. Now, as I hope, many of us pay attention to punctuation and how it is used. It affects the message trying to be sent and I think most of us read a sentence and do so in the way the punctuation requires. Let's try:\\"She broke the back of the chair.\\"\\"She broke the back of the chair!\\"\\"She broke the back of the chair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\"They are all different. There were WAY too many of those !! in this novel and in places that did not need them. The worst part is that this book was so complex, that there were diagrams aplenty to NOT aid you in understanding.I dunno anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was he thinking?","review":"Up to this point I have been a huge Reilly fan. I disregarded the customer reviews and bought the book. I haven't even finished it yet and now I'm sorry I did buy it. After reading \\"Contest\\" I was expecting a really great read, but I am very disappointed. Reilly seems to be using the book as a political opinion format and bashes the United States. Since I spent my money on the purchase of the book, I will finish it. I agree with other reviewers: He uses too many exclamation points and one line paragraphs. The character development is just not there. He took a wonderful concept and threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pachinko","review":"This is one book I put down - no way I could finish it. There are no characters in the book; no point of view; no empathy; no plot; no purpose; no accurate history; no believable scenes.The book caught my attention because I love ancient history. My first instinct was not to buy the book, but the premise held some promise - how bad could it be? Well I found out. I felt throughout the third of the book that I managed to plow through that I was riding a ball in a pachinko machine (even the diagrams added to THAT effect.) Where was it going and what was the purpose?The use of history is non-existent. The descriptions are laughable. The only suspense is - will there ever be anything worth reading in the book? Resetting traps --- from 2500 years ago? Characters that disappear and reappear.Boring - totally. A waste of money and time. The back cover was a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathless writing - not necessarily a good thing","review":"Reilly's imagination is certainly fertile. His protagonists get themselves into the stickiest situations one can imagine, and, assuming you can suspend all possible disbelief, always manage to extricate themselves with a maximum of demolition and destruction. However, Reilly's writing frankly is jarring, and never allows me to become absorbed in the story. He is overly fond of exclamation points (outside of quotes), breathlessly throwing them about where better description would more appropriately serve the reader. He cries out for an editor. Each novel reads like a blockbuster movie script, for which you must be willing to leave all common-sense at the ticket counter in order to enjoy it. Some might find this just their cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven Deadly Wonders","review":"I had recently read Six Sacred Stones and wanted to see what had come before. Hope there is one that follows Jack West again!!! Was not disappointed in the Seven Deadly Wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better offerings","review":"I've enjoyed several of Reilly's books (Ice Station, Scarecrow) and disliked others (Temple, Area 7). This outing falls into the latter category and shares many of their faults - poor characterization, action that is so outrageous it becomes dull and a \\"reality\\" that bears little relation to the one we inhabit. The writing is very weak and saps whatever joy the concepts manage to muster from the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Theme, Lousy Book","review":"This is the first negative review I've posted, ever.I picked up this book because the theme of the 'seven ancient wonders' is extremely cool -- and I've read other books by the same author in the past, so it seemed like an instant winner. Wrong.This book is a dud - I stuggled through the shallow plot, predictable outcomes and less-than-thrilling scenes in the hope that something would improve. Although there are glimpses of a potentially decent book, the author failed miserably in the delivery.Clearly, this is the worst thriller I've read in the last five years. Sadly, I must recommend that you skip along to the next book on your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, Really Bad","review":"My history with Matt Reilly: I was a big fan of both CONTEST and ICE STATION. TEMPLE was a bit of a disappointment but I thought Reilly redeemed himself with AREA 7. I didn't like SCARECRW much at all.Well . . . SCARECROW is a complete masterpiece compared to the dreck that is SEVEN DEADLY WONDERS. Writing has never been Reilly's strongest skill but at least he could set up a decent action scene and even that slim skill deems to have deserted him. I'm just shocked at how stupid and badly-plotted this book is. I'll be very surprised if we see another Reilly novel in hardcover here in the US. If I'm wrong than at least they can be assured I won't be buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 Deadly Wonders","review":"I had to purchase this book for my brand new kindle...it was one of my favorite series that I have read recently and was excited to have the books again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"First book I've read by Mr. Reilly, but was pleasantly surprised. From the very first page, all the way to the last, the author keeps you enraptured and wondering what was coming next. Buy it and get ready to be entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it in a comic book","review":"At one time I enjoyed reading a Matthew Reilly book, but after forcing myself through half of this one, I began to wonder if someone hit him on the head, causing a loss of writing ability. I had to put it down once I hit the 100th time he spelled out the sound of a machine gun...RAT-TA-TAT-TAT!!!!!! (or something close to that).Note to Matthew: If this is going to be your writing style going forward, please learn to draw and put it in a comic book.Note to editor: Grow a pair and exercise some control.Note to Publisher: If this is all he can do, don't waste the paper to print it, unless you also publish comic books. HOLY RAT-TA-TAT-TAT BATMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the format.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Reillys' other books. They are fast-paced and his earlier books had more character developement than the recent one. But this book just didn't click on all cylinders like the other books. For one the format was really weird. You would be really flowing and he would but a weird break in the writing. Either by doing someting like..... .....this where he would put in the (....) I can kind of see it like a suspenseful ending to a bad mystery movie. And the killer is.... .....John Doe. It just didn't work for me and kind of took me out of the book, which is good from other aspects but the format was just too weird for me to really enjoy it. But I would liket to say that all his other books are amazing, if you like lots of action, and would highly recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven Deadly Wonders (Reilly)","review":"I truly enjoyed this novel, and find Reilly to be a compelling and fun author to read. While I agree that the publisher overused italics and certain punctuation and that it proved a distraction, the character development is first rate, and the plot moves along without any slow points. The relationship between Lily and the team is wonderful, and the first 8 pages of the book are some of the best I've read in this genre in a long time. I'm going to go purchase the next in the series today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading a bad video game","review":"This must have been written to please teenaged boys who live to play violent video games.

Don't waste your time with this drivel unless you have an IQ below 65."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd!","review":"The last couple of reviews are very accurate in that this book is poorly written, has no character development and requires a complete suspension of belief. Normally I don't review books but this one has me fairly annoyed because I feel my money was stolen. It's the suspension of belief that is most frustrating. For instance, the hero is left behind in tomb, in the next section he's calling to be picked up from a resort island and the explanation is an implication that the hero started and drove a 60-year-old Nazi submarine across the Mediterranean sea. Let's not forget the stealthy 747 jumbo jet, this jet completely avoids radar detection because it has been painted with radar absorbing black paint. What? Then there is the wobbler that prevents bullets from flying straight. I could go on and on. This book really makes Clive Cussler seem like a literary genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"This book sucked. I got to about page 300 before I decided to check what the reviews on it were. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. This is the first and last Reilly book I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen","review":"A new Matthew Reilly book was something to look forward to.I have really enjoyed all his previous ones which were exciting, action packed and well written.I'm sorry but this one was about as realistic as Tom and Jerry and less entertaining.The characters were non existent and confusing. I couldn't remember who was who and even worse I didn't care.With such a fascinating subject (7 Wonders) how could it go wrong so badly - well it did.I certainly hope things improve with the next book, if not I won't even be buying the paperback version rather than the hardback one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with a established brand!","review":"Don't be fooled by the price......You are much better off buying an established name brand memory card."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product for the price","review":"So far I haven't had any problems despite other reviews I read before purchasing this item.

One of my favorite things about traveling is the time it gives me to read and I especially enjoy reading science fiction. Whether the reading takes place on an airplane or in Paris or Bangkok its time well spent!All of the stories selected are excellent. They are all travel stories that most people can relate to on some level.I love getting short story anthologies because they give you a chance to try a number of different authors and short stories lend themselves to a busy schedule. This book is one to bring along on a trip and pass along to another traveler in a cafe somewhere when you are finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book","review":"My husband has lost most of his teeth one by one. I thought he would get a big kick out of knowing he's not alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Perspective","review":"An interesting new perspective on George Washington. It makes him seem more human to children. Young children are intrigued to have the myth of wooden teeth squelched. Ther book provides a historical timeline in the back. This is a great book for children of ALL ages. Even I, an older child and teacher, learned some things. I had no idea our first president was so obsessed with his teeth and that he had such an active role in the solutions to his dental problems. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Washington's teeth were not wooden at all","review":"After reviewing this book for a graduate Children's Literature course, we were surprised to see how much George Washington's teeth played a role in his day to day life. It was a comical rhyming story that would be appropriate for elementary students. As Kindergarten and First Grade teachers we would incorporate its theme into teaching dental health. Young children are often very excited about losing their baby teeth, however, this book would convince them to take very good care of their grown up teeth. The book could also be used in upper elementary classes to discuss myths, like George Washington's wooden teeth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a tooth story","review":"We bought this book last year after visiting Mount Vernon. We had told our (four and five year old) children of George Washington and his teeth since they started regular tooth brushing. We used the story of how poor George lost all his teeth to motivate them to brush their teeth regularly. Needless to say, they both have good dental care habits and good teeth to go with them! This book has cute illustrations to go with the rhymes on each page and made the stories all the more real to our children. At the back of the book there is a wonderful timeline that chronicles the story of George Washington's life and how his teeth were a big part of it. The timeline is done in a manner that will make adults appreciate the story of George Washington's life in a new way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fun, and history too!","review":"Comora and Chandra have made a book to delight wordsmiths and history buffs alike. A verse narrative, each stanza informs by amusing. The great craft of the poem is never visible, but always in evidence -- none of the inane repetition that often informs such efforts is found here.The whimsical illustrations are more than fine, and laid out to support and complement, rather than compete with the words.A true delight for President's Day, and many others besides.Bravi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed bag","review":"Asimov does his typically thorough job of annotating, filling this book with tons of information about obscure references and historical tidbits. However, I was a bit dismayed at Asimov's heavy-handed critique of Swift in the 3rd book. As many readers of Swift know, the 3rd book contains a very harsh criticism of science and technology. Asimov decides to use his annotations to defend science. While his aims are certainly admirable, I think that he takes Swift's comments out of context in an effort to prove his own case.That minor cavil aside, this is an excellent book for young people studying this great classic of literature, and for fans of both Swift and Asimov."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made my hair feel silky!","review":"This product left my hair feeling silky and looking shinny.

My hair felt, thicker, stronger, and it did not alter the color of my jet-black rinse. Now that I have natural hair, it'll be interesting to see what it does. Henna, aside from it's dying qualities, is known to strengthen hair, because it \\"fills in the gaps\\" between hair's protein; so I'm hoping it will do just as great of a job with natural, afro-textured, tightly coiled hair.

It is _the_ WORST product ever. The quality of the wok is so terrible and crude that I can not even imagine using it. The discription of the item is totally puff!Do _not_ trust what you read!I have purchased other wok and kitchen wares that made in China from local stores and they were all fine, but this seller's product is really really disappointing! I just wasted a big chunk of money! Down to the drain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game.","review":"I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I played this new version of Onimusha for the X-Box. i'd already beaten the PS2 version. This new one is much harder. The enemies all take much longer to kill, and you are often overwhelmed. The PS2 guide is very little help, as all the puzzles have been altered, and they don't even contain the same items as before.Then, there's the whole 'Green Soul'thing. Once an enemy manages to get a green soul inside them, they get much faster and harder to kill.It is much creepier than the original version. Especially with that demon doll. *shudders* Makes me think back to Clock Tower's Scissorman.Overall, the game is really good. It's very difficult, but not impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I didn't purchase this!","review":"I rented a copy from [a video store]. The commercials looked cool, most of the reviews I read were favorable, and I liked the theme etc... Then I loaded it into my console and attempted to play. The controls are difficult to get used to and not at all intuitive and you cannot customize them at all. The story is very broken up and I was disappointed to have some of the screens where the player is \\"in contol\\" be so simplistic (goal: walk across room). The graphics were still pretty good, but as far as I'm concerned, that's all it has going for it and it simply isn't enough to keep me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do horrible controls still get put in games????","review":"All right folks, be warned. While this game is on XBox, and we all like to think of the graphics first on the big green machine, you'll have a major obstacle in your way. the CONTROLS. it's sorta of bad Mojo, too. this game could have easily been put in the same category (or close) to Devil May Cry if the controls were better. you ONLY get to use the D-Pad, no analog love for us! think Resident Evil Controls, but worse, you gotta push on the old Nintendo-Pad to move. remember doing that back in the days, when we just didn't know any better?? maybe the army has just gotten me thinking like this, but how could something [like this] continue to happen to games? i hate to see things like this persist in any area, especially gaming..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casual gamer - very difficult","review":"This game is too difficult. I'm a casual gamer, but after playing Max Payne and Halo, I just couldn't get used to the controls. I gave up playing after about 2 hours. It was annoying. I found the movement in the previous games easy to master. GO requires you to spend a lot of time becoming comfortable with just moving around (I don't like the D-pad). The program also doesn't spend much time teaching you how to move and fight in the game environment. Upon getting killed you need to restart from the previous save point which might require replaying large segments of the game. I found it more frustating than fun. I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read this","review":"...trust me this game is good.

It's super informative and a great read too. Two thumbs way up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"$16,000 in scholarships and climbing!","review":"This book helped me win $16,000 in scholarships, and the scholarship winnings continue to build. Yeah, I probably could have won some of these scholarships without reading the book, but the book made everything so much simpler and showed me exactly what I needed to do. The essay section itself is worth many times the cover price as it helped me turn unsuccessful scholarship essays into ones that seem to be getting results. That section was also really useful for writing college essays and school papers as well. Overall, you can't go wrong by getting this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only get this if you are in High School or less","review":"If you have finished high school, I wouldn't suggest you get this book. It is mainly aimed for students who are just about to start a life in high school and have their lives ahead. It talks about what students can do to improve their grades and participate in activities so that they would have something to write in their scholarship applications. Furthermore, it also promotes ideas in ways you can get recommendation letters. In high school, there are a lot of ways to do that, but when you have already graduated from HS, it is very limited. The book does have a few good pointers, which is why I made it a 2 star, but you have probably haver heard it before. It's just said in another way. I can only wish that there was a place I could have borrowed this book. It wasn't worth my money being spent on. Maybe if it had cost me 3-5 bucks, then we're talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get this book if you are a grad student","review":"I have been researching ways to find grad school scholarship money, and this book was not helpful. The author did give some helpful tips, but they were mainly common sense strategies. This book is aimed mainly for high school students, so I do not suggest buying it if you are looking for money for grad school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely useless and condescending","review":"As a senior with ok grades applying to college, I found this book completely useless. The author assumes that you have a background at least as good as his, and constantly peppers his book with annoying \\"you can do it\\" encouragement. The fact is that if you are applying to Harvard, which is his alma mater (which the author shamelessly advertises on the front cover), you don't need this book. If you are simply a hard working student with good but not great grades, don't waste twenty bucks (like I did) on what amounts to a self-congratulating biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the run-of-the-mill kid?","review":"Mr. Kaplan does a good job at describing the methods that worked for him, and certainly communicated the persistance that is necessary to garner awards of the level he received. However, the real secrets aren't really articulated, just hinted: first, have the grades, test scores and recommendations which qualify for Harvard admission. Second, be a ranked athlete. Third, lead, as editor, a high-school newspaper which has national-level recognition. Fourth, have remarkable writing skills.It's clear to me that superlative skills such as his are prerequisites for the types of awards he received. Most of us need a practical guide for the 'pretty good student, pretty good athlete, all-around-good-kid'. Is there any help for us?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Kaplan is very misleading about the actual odds of getting large scholarships. Lets say that the average 600 SAT student has about a one in ten thousand chance in getting a given scholarship. This book will improve that student's odds to about one in eight thousand. You decide if this makes sense.After watching my daughter bust her tail on scholarship applications and seeing the outcome, the one thing anyone needs to know is to go after all the LOCAL scholarships."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to win a scholarship olny if you're a genius","review":"I found this book completely useless. I tried all of his strategies, and I won absolutely nothing. And it's not like I am a bad student-I have a 3.7, got a 29 on my ACT and an 1170 on my SAT, have tons of community service and extracurriculars, and take AP classes and I still won absolutely nothing using his methods. The only logical way he suggests avoiding costs is taking AP tests, but he failed to mention that those cost $100 each to take and do not guarantee credit. This book might be useful if you are just starting high school and have no self confidence. The constant \\"you can do it\\" made the book that much worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better than this book","review":"Talk about a self-absorbed author who calls himself the \\"scholarship coach.\\" After many applications sent out based on his techniques, I haven't won any money for college. He had the great grades and activities to get into Harvard, so he thinks that he has learned the \\"secrets\\" that other less-stellar students can copy. To sum up how I feel about this book, I returned my copy and thankfully got my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"There is a lot of hype about this book. Personally, I don't see what all the fuss is about. The book's only useful section is its very, very meager list of possible scholarships. (Plenty more can be found in other books). If you really think you can go to college \\"almost\\" for free with this book, you are dead wrong. Unless \\"almost\\" free means taking a few hundred bucks off. His idea of slashing off 25% of your tuition is to max out on AP courses and pass their tests (extremely difficult tests), which he calls \\"easy\\". Who does he think he is? If we all had the skills and grades that he has, we'd all be ending up with $90,000 scholarships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Feel and comfortable","review":"It has nice feel and is comfortable.

For another, he's beautifully believable.For the plot/story - everyone over the age of 14 (due to sexual content) should watch this movie, b/c of the otherness of it. Most kids, I'm sure, don't know the lives that are portrayed in this story, but they should know them, and accept them. The fear of ways of life that are different from children's own lives that is often encouraged will be taken away by seeing this movie, b/c it is so raw and human - taking away the otherness. For children who are more exposed to this story in their own lives, I imagine this will give them a different perspective. For adults watching the movie, it will either expose them to an uncommon way of life that they should at least have knowledge of, or portray their life, or aspects of their life, on the big screen - validating, even if in a small (media) way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pariah","review":"This is a great quality product would recommend doing business with.

This book has neither, and the author has created an inferior work to all those far more excellent ones at your local library. His only fresh approach is a dubious and tasteless tie-in to Diana-mania. It is just too contrived and amateurish. The fact that Kirkus, a highly political organ, has given it a good review is due to the author having a prominent place in the elite and liberal literary community it is comprised of and promotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"death by fame","review":"This is not a review of the book but to warn customers of Amazon to look carefully into anything they buy.

Although at some points the author assumes the reader to have little knowledge, explaining the basics of what DNA is (together with a half-hearted attempt at a diagram), by then he has filled 20 pages with phrases such as \\"eluctible holism\\", and he immediately afterwards starts talking about the \\"ligation of 3' to 5' phosophodiester bonds\\" and the size of the \\"human immune repertoire\\", without explanation.The very first word of the book - in the title of the first chapter - is \\"Prolegomenon\\", and it's not a teaser to be explained later, you're supposed to know what that means.It's very frustrating because the content is very interesting and the arguments well thought through, but the author makes me work so hard to try to follow them that I cannot enjoy them or be certain that I fully understand them."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless pursuit","review":"The book appears to be a disorganized collection of author's reflections on origins of life, life itself, order, disorder, reductionism and constructivism. I took pains to read it more than once but I have not found a single thought that I would not have encountered before in writings of other authors and scholars. The author seems to repeat opinions that have been popular among scientists for at least 40 years but his own narrative is written in obscure yet imperious manner. I don't really understand why the editorial review and the author himself imply that the approach is original and innovative.

The lines of glue in the picture are closer to the edge on the filter I received, and they line up with plastic tabs on the vacuum cleaner that make it impossible to insert without modifying the filter or the vacuum cleaner. I chose to cut out the glue on the filter, but it is difficult to do that without puncturing the filter media.

Also, the metal piece and the knob that allows height adjustment do not work and did not stay attached where they belong. So the fan cannot be adjusted to be as tall as one would like it to be.I really thought this fan would work for a small bedroom. It doesn't. It doesn't have enough air output. It is on high speed and is only good on cool days. I expected more quality from Honeywell. I do not recommend that anyone buy this fan. Please avoid it and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"It wasn't that great, the remote controller felt extremely cheap and the fan is too loud.

The only problem is my DirectTV remote must be on the same frequency because whenever I turn up the volume the fan changes modes. Kind of annoying but the fan works so well, I can let it go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crank It Up","review":"I purchased the Honeywell HFS641P a little over a month ago and I am very pleased with the choice. I also purchased a Soleus fan with remote for my roommate. I bring them both up, because they are both terrific fans depending on your likes. The Honeywell is very powerful and moves a lot of air; this fan is louder because of it. The other fan is much quieter, but doesn't push as much air. I am happy with mine because I don't mind it being a little louder- and in my case with my window facing a well travelled road the sound is enough to drown out the traffic noise, while not being a nuisance. If you want much quieter, Soleus seems to do a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Honeywell Fan Died after 3 months!","review":"My Honeywell 16-inch remote control fan just died. It has been about three months since I purchased it; it was used with reasonable frequency. It has a 5-year warrenty from Kaz, Inc, but you have to send a $10 check for handling, return packaging, and shipping charges ON TOP OF what you will have to pay to mail it back to Kaz, Inc. I paid $43.99 on Amazon. So it would cost me another $20-$25 to get it fixed/replaced after only having it for three months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after 2 weeks","review":"Our fan quit working after only 2 weeks. Honeywell directed me to talk to the vendor, but the vendor refuses to replace either the fan or our money. I recommend that you stay away from fans with touch pads/electronic controls. Reliability is not good.Honeywell HFS641P 16-Inch Remote Control Stand Fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan very good, but a bit loud","review":"This fan is a bit loud due to its different type of fan blade, but it puts out a lot of air. The fan blade is a turbo prop style blade like found on small aircraft. Thus it puts out a similar sound to an aircraft, much LESS loud than an aircraft, but still louder than most fans. Works great for me and was very easy to assemble. I would recommend this fan to anybody that wants a good fan with remote control that is not concerned with the extra noise. If you want a \\"whisper quiet\\" fan, do NOT buy this one. Otherwise this fan is great. Only drawback for me is that you cannot control the oscillation of the fan with the remote. You must control oscillation from the top of the fan itself. Auto-off can be controlled by remote and is 2, 4, 8 hour options. I will likely buy another of these fans next month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice fan ...except....","review":"I bought this fan to replace the same model that had gotten fried from a power surge/lightening strike. After setting it up I realized that the frequency the fan's remote works on is the same that the frequency of the remote control for my TV. Whenever I press the volume button on my TV remote - it turns the fan on and changes the speeds on the fan. Needless to say this has been very annoying and I have to make sure either the fan isn't plugged in when I don't want to use it OR that I don't use the remote anywhere near the Fan anymore when I am using the TV remote. This is annoying to say the least. I assume they changed the frequency of the remote on the fan since I purchased it the last time a couple of years ago. Otherwise the fan itself is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"would be nice if I received it","review":"This fan looks great, but despite saying that it is in stock, the company that Amazon outsources with for this product does not actually have any available.

I am not happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Fan Sucks - Not In A Good Way!","review":"In two words - it sucks! The fan is made from cheap plastic and metal parts - including the mounts that hold the back portion of the grill in place. Bump into fan by accident and it falls apart. Grill tabs that hold the fan top grill to the back grill are hazardous and sharp. I bought two of the fans for the bedroom and living room - the first fan went into the trash heap within six months - the second lasted a year before the motor burned-out. The remote control unit on these fans are one step up from a cheap kid's toy! Spend your money wisely - a better choice would be a column fan from SPJ - but not from Honeywell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth","review":"I used to have an 18 inch model during my college years and this new one now serves as it's replacement. It's a shame they don't make fans like this anymore. It's not loud. I've had enough fans to know what's loud and what's not. It sounds like any traditional 16 inch stand or desk fan. To make things better, it is powerful. The only thing I dislike about the fan are those grill clamps located on the rear grill. They were on the front grill of my 18 inch model. I know fans are supposed to be child-proof, but you need the jaws of life to pry those clamps open to give this thing a good cleaning. If you want a little delicate piece of junk (like those tower fans) that feels like someone is blowing their hot breath on you, then don't buy this fan. If you want a traditional-looking, poweful fan that's going to last for some years, then here you go. I hope Kaz/Honeywell don't ever discontinue this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big time airflow = Big time sound levels","review":"First, this fan is made well. It is VERY powerful, even on low. It is VERY loud, even on low. I bought this fan because of the natural wind function that works on all speed settings. This setting makes the fan go from your speed setting to almost off and back to speed again. It simulates natural wind blowing. I have had a fan with this function for years and it is my favorite feature on any fan. With the natural wind setting, I do not get a sore throat from leaving the fan on in my bedroom at night.If you want a fan that has a very low setting, do not buy this one. It is a brute with big time airflow and big time noise. I honestly don't think I have ever seen a consumer grade oscillating fan with so much power.The remote is of average quality and works as expected. It does not interfere with my home theater equipment as others say it does.I would buy it again, but I would prefer a lower setting with less noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only gloves I use now.","review":"I use a lot of gloves for working on cars mostly, but also other household projects.

The music does a good job supporting the film; for example, certain parts underscore the main character's bizarre, twisted mind (although this might be due to the power of suggestion after having seen the film).Nonetheless, once you listen to the tracks (and judging by their length) you might get the impression that these are fragments of musical ideas which could have been further developed. Of course, the limitations inherent in film scoring are well-known.After listening to the soundtrack you might wonder how it's possible that anyone can write music like this. How can anyone \\"think\\" of writing such hauntingly beautiful chords, etc?

It surprised me because it's closer to the book than many movie versions are. It is basically a filmed version of all the characters' diaries and most of the dialogue and exposition are taken directly from the book. John Johnson, the director, who also plays the role of Quincey Morris, definitely had a feel for the original material and put a lot of thought into his film. OK, the production values aren't high and the FX aren't the greatest, but the story is there. The film was a pleasant surprise for me and I believe anyone who loves the book won't be disappointed with this retelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This was a low budget film from beginning to end.

It takes a bit of force and adjustment to get it in place after you've got it on, so it's not ideal for adjusting during play unless you've got about a 5-second rest. Even then, I feel like it might push my strings out of tune if adjusted too much. It does hold the strings firmly down when in position.When playing the fret directly above the capo, I find that the my hand getting cramped against the protruding screw of the capo, so I haven't used it after trying it the first time. I'd give it 4 stars if not for this bad design, but because of this poor ergonomic design, it's very awkward and uncomfortable for me to use. I'm giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb DVD","review":"This is the first mountainbike DVD I've bought and I'm going to get the other Collective movies - this is stunning. Great blend of cinematography, music, interviews with the guys, and mountainbiking action. Love all the different camera angles. The riders are excellent, as you'd expect as they are at the top of their game. It's cool to see mountainbiking from an observer point of view too. The stunts are incredible but this movie nonetheless makes mountainbiking feel accessible; unlike watching some other sports (motorbike racing comes to mind) this is something us mortals can do, even if not to this extreme. Very inspiring - makes you want to get out and ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I saw just one scene of this video on Youtube and then decided to buy it.

The sound in SP mode is very acceptable if you only need to record voice conversation, and it can record for over 3 hours, which was perfect for me. The best part is the fact that you are not dealing with mini-tapes and, even better, you can download it to your PC as a .WMA file. Very compact, and the docking station is nice for downloading on to your computer through a USB port. With a little practice, working with the program to get the files loaded onto my PC seemed easy.

I'd like to know why? My office bought a bunch of these to record meetings. Last night I had a meeting, took it out, and the batteries were dead. Why? Because I left the batteries in it! Why on earth would Olympus not include a power switch on this? To save a tiny amount of room? To make it a buck or two cheaper to manufacture? Totally ridiculous in my opinion. The manual instructs you to remove the batteries if you aren't going to use it for a prolonged period. We got them to record meetings that occur a couple times a month.

Woodstock, wearing little green alien ears, is sitting in a crater. My first thought is this is Mars and Woodstock is supposed to be a Martian, but the dirt Snoopy is standing on is light enough I wonder if he is on the Moon.Either way, this is the most disappointing ornament in the series.

See Theda Bara, Pola Negri, Lillian Gish, Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth and even the child star Shirley Temple put their own indelible brand of love on the screen. It examines how, over the course of sixty years, women's sexuality has evolved, and played itself out in different arenas in film.

Never did I expect it to have serious undertones.Nevertheless, the book was thoroughly enjoyable and I read it in one sitting (I was down with the flu). The story revolves around Linc, who has just moved his family cross-country so that his wife can take a new position. He decides to settle his family into their new life and becomes a househusband.Linc struggles with depression as he searches for a new balance in his life. He seems to seek some sort of control which he finds in domestic duties.

The main character, Linc, was the biggest whiny baby I've ever encountered on the written page. I felt sorry for his wife, Jo, the working mother who the reader actually never really gets to know even on the most superficial of levels.Author Ad Hudler seemed to go out of his way to make Linc, the \\"househusband\\" come off as pretentious and arrogant as he possibly could've, but I know that was not his intention. I think the author has a lot to work out in his personal life and that came out in the writing of this book. Unfortunately the reader ends up being the unpaid therapist who has to listen to his moaning and groaning, page after page, without compensation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous!!","review":"This book is a scream! I honestly couldn't put it down and read it in a weekend! I went to high school with Ad, so it was wonderful to read it! Ad has always had a fabulous sense of humor.

While a number of these fall into bona fide chestnut status, kids who are being exposed to poetry for the first time won't be aware of that, and that old black magic should work just fine on them.

I've used it in the classroom with first, third, fourth and sixth graders -- because of the high quality of the poetry, it holds up to the scrutiny of middle schoolers and keeps the attention of six year olds. Hearing the poets read their own work gives the children an introduction to reading their own poetry out loud.We use many of these poems as writing prompts for our own poetry in the classroom. The resulting poems are exiting, high-quality pieces the children and parents treasure. I would also recommend the Kenneth Koch-edited books \\"Rose, Where did you Get That Red?

They just don't pull off looking like they should be in that time frame. Many, many comedic attempts have tried to go the bawdy romp route and failed, and this one is no different.For a much better movie, and similar theme, look no further than television and the British production (shown in the US on Masterpiece Theater) ofCasanova (Masterpiece Theater).

While she waits for her prince to come, other two gentlemen fight each other for her love. One of them (DARTH VADER) is confined to a convent of nuns where he is deaf and dumb and works as a gardener taking care of some very special 'flowers'.

However, the only woman he's truly interested in is Pampinea (Mischa Barton), who's also being fiercely pursued by several other men. The plot of the film moves along at a painstakingly slow pace, and there's one graphic sex scene after another in place of much by the way of plot or character development.

While the movie is full of beautiful women and the R rating allows many Lovely maidens to lose their costumes,I'm guessing that Barton's waiting for a bigger movie to drop the duds,alas.While it's not the best movie I've seen this year,there was beauty to be seen and a couple slight chuckles (Mathew Rhys was amusing)and I thought better of the 97 minutes I spent here than some of the other things I've seen recently (naked ladies help!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Question...","review":"OK, just one question, how does Hayden Christensen ever get any work. This has to be the most awful actor in all of Hollywood. OK, if you have to deliver stiff, Lucas-speak, then maybe he's your man, but in anything else, he's hopeless. Think Nicholas Cage without the charisma.With that said, I don't think Michael C. Hall (Dexter) could have rescued this disaster. Someone mentioned that they were going for the Heath Leger vibe, but that doesn't help. It is too period for the \\"Porkys\\" crowd, and too raunchy for the intelligent crowd.Don't defile your DVD player with this disk..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pretentious Waste Of Time!","review":"This movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy, loosely based on classical literature, but it is far from funny. In fact, it is very sad to see such a feeble attempt at movie making! It begins with a very long, tedious narration which is supposed to be humorous, but isn't even close. I couldn't wait for the narration to end, but when it did, the dialogue wasn't any better. Everything is uniformly mediocre(that is being generous). Even the acting is lousy, which is surprising, since the cast is quite impressive. but that is what happens when good actors are given a bad script. If you think that the \\"R\\" rating will at least offer some stimulation, think again. Even that aspect is totally amateurish. The special features are more interesting than the movie, since they are not really scripted, so just watch them and skip the movie. Spend your time and money somewhere else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Strange Movie","review":"The quick review of this movie could be summed up as an 80's porno film, the kind where they attempt a plot line, with all of the sex scenes cut out. Very poor acting and plot, combined with a lot of 12 year old boy fantasy of the horny milkmaid, stranger, and even horny nuns, willilng to have sex 30 seconds after meeting someone.Movie is an hour and a half of talking about sex, then wholly unbelieveable situations leading to sex, with the scenes cut as soon as the very attractve girls show thir breasts.The movie does have entertainment value in that there is an almost constant stream of boobie shots, and if you like the 'what the hell was the producer/director thinking when they made this' type of movie.I found the movie entertaining strictly on those two items, I like 'boobie movies' as well as movies that are so ridiculous that you cant help but laugh at the thought of someone actually thinking it was worth filming and releasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Was a pretty terrible movie. I liked some of its narrative structure (the character who narrates was interesting, but never developed). Some reviewers seem to think it has a lot of T&A, but I don't think they were watching the same movie. I counted 3 or 4 scenes with nudity. In any case, the movie was pretty boring. The narrator character was far more interesting than the protagonist, which usually makes for a lame story, except maybe in some novels like Cárcel de amor. Bottom line is that I paid $8 for this movie, and it's not really even worth that. The characters aren't developed. There's nothing funny about it, and there isn't even enough gratuitous nudity to make the movie worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A movie to spend some funny time...\\"","review":"\\"If you are expecting \\"Titanic\\" grateness from this film, you are going to see it for the wrong reasons. The movie is one of those kind of film with no complication in plot, a bit humorous, a bit romantic.The great movie that you want to see just to kill time in a funny way. I laugh a bit and was touched a little bit also. During the whole movie I see it has a medieval adaptation of American Pie or Porky's. I don't gave them the full 5 stars because they should have gave the plot a bit more complication, make you be at the edge of your chair.How ever it is good to see it just for the fun of it...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it - don't buy it.","review":"I picked this because I love period films. But being familiar with the B level acting chops of Hayden Christensen and Mischa Barton, I did not set my expectations very high. This was in the same campy genre as A Knight's Tale but with more bawdy scenes and nudity. No big LOL moments but was \\"entertaining enough\\" to watch. Lots of eye candy and cheap laughs with predictable story lines. The costumes are not accurate, the modern rock music is very out of place but the scenery is beautiful. For me, this was light-hearted but not as delightful as say, The Princess Bride... and I can't say I will willingly want to watch it again anytime soon. This is more of a frat house rental movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless self promotion with little actual use","review":"This book was a textbook for a course I took on documentation and policy writing. I used it as a reference guide for one of my projects, and found that it was practically useless. Half the content was the author promoting himself and his other books. The other half could have been summed up as \\"use the internet to find examples of existing policies that you can copy.\\" Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I was expecting","review":"I though I would find more detailed and practical information about how to write documents"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The P&P-series had a great start. P&P: Vampire and P&P:Judge were both two great books, P&P:werewolf was ok. This one ,unfortunately, is the worst in the series so far. The characters from P&P:Judge and P&P:Werewolf are here brought together. That is Douglas Sands, Kaitlin and Black Rindle. The book is filled with depressive social-realism. Kaitlin's perspective which was refreshing in P&P:Werewolf is in this book excruciatingly boring. If you are looking for horror and a plot with surprises, then don't read this book. Nothing that happens here is surprising.Contents? the wyrm, hunters vs werewolf, pregnancyLet us hope the next book brings this series back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buslink on Linux","review":"If you want to use this on Linux be careful.

Dr. Fiore's explanation of why we procrastinate and how we can develop our compassionate voices to help ourselves resonated with me. That said, the audio version of this book is boring. The author's reading style is so distracting that I could barely recognize the concepts that helped me so much when they were in writing. I'm a huge fan of audiobooks, but pass on this one. Read it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old news.","review":"This book deals with procrastination in a \\"Don't worry, everything is going to be fine\\" attitude. I believe that a much tougher more mature version needs to be stressed. I have found this method to be addressed more fully in Dr. William J. Knaus' recent book \\"Do It Now: Break the Procrastination Habit\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much about self talk.","review":"This reminded me too much of the ever popular self talk movement of the late 80's. Too much about feelings and not practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring book","review":"This book is a clunky, poorly designed, uninspiring book filled with cliches that put one to sleep. It seems written for bureaucrats and corporate clones. Instead, wake up, and delight yourself with The Procrastinator's Handbook!!! Much much much better. Refreshing, beautifully designed if that matters to you, not ponderous and redundant like The Now Habit. Says it all, in fewer, better written words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideology","review":"This book promotes the internalization of a Protestant work ethic, which is perhaps what readers may indeed desire. Fiore has some interesting insights into the psychology of the chronic procrastinator, but I found the book's ideology too much to swallow:\\"We all have a number of things we would like to accomplish, things we tell ourselves we 'should' accomplish -- increasing our net profits, learning to play the piano, making a million dollars, taking a vacation, writing a book, finishing a degree, repairing the house, losing ten pounds, spending more time with friends, getting up earlier...\\" --- how much more bourgeois can this book get?Procrastinators, you are more than producers!! No matter how \\"fun\\" efficiency can be, life is more than setting and meeting goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Audiobook, Just Read It","review":"I listened to an hour of the audiobook and found it quite unbearable. Not because of the content, which I was excited about, but because the reader was doing a terrible job at keeping me focused. Way too slow, amateurish, and he basically sounded like he wasn't familiar with the text at all (perhaps reading it for the first time?). Again, this doesn't say anything about the quality of the written version."},{"rating":"2","title":"great content--terrible reading","review":"This is seriously some of the best information and advice I have ever \\"read\\" on the issue of procrastination. It inspires, motivates, and offers real-world practical advice for procrastinators who really want to make a change but don't know how. Please don't consider the audio version though, unless they record a new speaker--the reader on that version is terrible. However, I highly recommend this book to anyone serious about overcoming procrastination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative.","review":"I didn't do many of the exercises but I did take away some good information and it has changed the way I think about things. I would recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the subject--a life-saver!","review":"I've read plenty of books on procrastination, but this one stands apart as the best of the Bunch. Neil Fiore gets to the root of procrastination--the anxiety behind it--and explores the process in a compassionate manner. He introduced me to the idea of scheduling play as a strategy against procrastination...I would have never come up with that one on my own.My copy, a few years old, is filled with underlined passages that spoke directly to me. If you want a book that treats you gently while still giving you the tools you need to conquer your problem, look no further!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clutter keeps it from being all it could be","review":"Get your highlighter out because Dr. Fiore really gives some great advice on what you can do to overcome your tendency to procrastinate.Unfortunately, in my opinion, he clutters the book with profiles, descriptions or stories of people who allegedly suffer from procrastination. The stories, frankly, sound made up or like they are composites of several people's experiences. I found this unnerving: going from really hardcore direct advice to a clearly fake story about a clearly non-existent person.Fiore could have made his book far stronger - even if far shorter - by dumping these bits and pieces of fiction.I found that the only way I could get through \\"The Now Habit\\" was to highlight the bits and pieces of solid counsel and ignore the silly \\"case studies\\". Do that and \\"The Now Habit\\" is a good place to turn when you're suffering from procrastination.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good ideas, but so much filler","review":"The principles are quite good, but there wasn't any silver bullet. Mostly a lot of common sense and some good concepts for programming yourself to rethink your time wasting / saving etc. It's the kind of advice you often hear from friends and work colleagues. So I never really learned anything new. At the very least it reinforced the advice.What always gets me with these self-help books is the sheer amount of filler and many case studies. You spend so much time reading all the cases that you actually forget the learning principles - I know the case studies are supposed to support the principles, but in this book it didn't work for me. After a while it just became a tedious read and to be honest I can't even remember finishing it - shows you the impact it had on me!For me, the ironic part is putting a tedious book with so much filler in the hands of a procrastinating person."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably the single best self-help book for procrastinators","review":"By a long shot. (And I've read a lot! :) )As the tv commercials for laxatives say, \\"It's gentle and effective.\\"It works. It will change the way you work."},{"rating":"2","title":"an innovative approach","review":"The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is because I still haven't followed its advice. If a self-help book can actually get me to CHANGE, then I'll give it five stars. In short, I haven't yet made the changes in my schedule and lifestyle that the book recommends, but the book has shifted my thinking quite dramatically. I now understand that it is just as important (in fact more important) for me to plan, schedule and commit to doing things that I love to do, as it is for me to plan, schedule and commit to doing things that I don't want to do (or that I resist). The author's proposed \\"unschedule\\" is a radical approach to addressing procrastination - one that holds tremendous promise for anyone struggling with productivity in any form. I fully intend to create my own \\"unschedule.\\" Now, if only I could get myself to actually do it . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't listent to the CD - the narrator puts me into a zombie-like trance","review":"I wish I could say that I've listened to the entire book on CD, but I'm stuck at disk number 2. I've listened to it several times and can't tell you what was said.I'm fascinated by the reading style of the narrator. I can't get past that voice and that intonation- it's all I can hear when I try to listen to the CD. The narrator uses some of the strangest speaking rhythms I've ever heard. Maybe not the strangest, but he ties for strangest. I think the he studied acting or script reading at the William Shatner school of acting.Maybe I'll buy the book, in the hopes that it's better than the CD, and that I can get through it without wanting to jump off a bridge. But maybe not- I've already paid for the CD.Does anyone want to buy a nearly new book on CD? Many of the disks are still in their virginal state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some helpful insights, but generally dangerous","review":"I'm glad some people found this book helpful. But I frankly think this book misses the point and has the potential to seriously harm the productivity and psyches of people who need its help.My biggest complaint is with its mantra of \\"play more\\". \\"Guilt free play\\" cannot take place until one feels like his/her life is under control. By recommending that people walk away from their work while it is still under control, Fiore is recommending that people engage in dangerous denial.What people need is strategy for getting their lives under control. Fiore attempts to offer that at times, but insufficiently.If you want to get your life under control, I strongly recommend David Allen's Getting Things Done. It provides the strategic approach you need to get your life under control, so you can actually enjoy some guilt free recreation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time = procrastination","review":"I read 40 pages at least, without any type of \\"strategic\\" knowledge being introduced. Even tried the audiobook, one of the least helpful books ever. He just baits you in by asking you if you apply to 100,000 general symptoms. Book took to long to get going, ironic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Procrastinating on Finishing the Now Habit","review":"I have only listened to about the first hour of \\"The Now Habit\\". I am not sure I can force myself to finish it. I am afraid to listen to it while driving - I might fall asleep at the wheel. Not sure if it's the author's tedious prose or the narrator's emotionless droning or a combination of both, but it is a painful listen. But at least I am glad to know that it's not my fault. I am not lazy or undisciplined. It was all caused by my parents.Recently I learned the \\"Pomodoro Technique\\" from a friend, and it has helped me in a short time to be more productive and to procrastinate less. I will certainly have to use it if I want to finish the unpleasant task of listening to this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is posting images of his other books?","review":"Decent book but I wonder about the author, Neil Fiore, Ph.D. He is uploading images to Amazon of other books he has written. For example, he has one image uploaded from the \\"The Now Habit\\" and another image form another book he wrote - \\"Awakening your Strongest Self\\" and vice versa. He has also uploaded an image of one of his books to a book he did not write - \\"The Making of a Therapist: A Practical Guide for the Inner Journey\\" by Louis Cozolino. This seems like a very shady way to promote books and what does it say about this author? If I like a book by a certain author, I just click on the name and see what other books he or she has written. I was going to purchase more books by Niel Foire but decided not to after I noticed that he was doing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle pricing - lost sale","review":"Based on the reviews and a personal recommendation from a friend I was going to buy the book. However the fact that the Kindle pricing is more than the paperback price really really really pissed me off. I will borrow the book from my friend or buy it from my local used book store. No revenue for the publisher or the author. None, nada, zip. If you can give me value proposition for paying more for an electronic edition then I might buy. But as a matter of policy I refuse to pay more for something that costs less to produce without some other kind of added value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew! Finally! Someone who understands.","review":"This is the first book about procrastination that didn't leave me feeling like I had been beaten over the head with my \\"flaws\\". It was helpful to learn the reasons behind my procrastination, and to be given plans of action that make sense for those reasons. We are much more likely to grow through encouragement than through censure. This author's approach is esteemable."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just about procrastination","review":"The book goes beyond how to deal with procrastination. It provides me a new philosophy of life, that is, choosing to do what I commit and never push myself into victimhood. The book does offer many easy and effective \\"tools\\" to deal with pressing procrastination problems, but most importantly, the book keeps telling us the procrastination is the result of underlying fear and anxiety, and I believe it's more important to understand and tackle the fear instead of fancy strategies of dealing just the symptom, that is, procrastination. By this I want to thank the author. The book sometimes repeats itself and becomes less organized, but overall it's very easy to read and implement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is an excellent book! For years, I have had serious problems with procrastination. I have read numerous books on the subject. Each time I have re-dedicated myself to being a better, stronger, less lazy person. But I always wondered if there wasn't a better explanation for my behaviour than laziness. The Now Habit has answered this nagging doubt in a productive and valuable way. I now have an explanation for my choices and behaviour. More importantly, The Now Habit has provided me with the tools to change the way I work and live. This book has significantly altered my life. Thank you Neil Fiore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Start with disk 6","review":"I really like this book and even as I am just beginning to implement Dr. Fiore's tips I can see a change. I must say that the first couple of disks are hard to listen to, I would start with disk 5 or 6, continue on to 7 and then start back with disk 1 and continue through. Having context for where the book is headed makes the early disks much more helpful.

It does talk about some of the things that i heard before in other self-help book but for the most part, the exercises are good. My take away in the book is not feeling guilty for my so called not getting anything done and just being able to say NO, without any guilt. That was really refreshing and I am now doing that and taking a stance. I personally had some other things going on with me that was allowing me to procrastinate and now that i have tackle those issues, i am now focus once again.

It is simply impossible to ever progress at programming without understanding functions and this book doesn't even mention them.Get \\"PHP and MySQL Web Development -- by Luke Welling, Laura Thomson\\" instead.

The first chapter is on installing and configuring PHP, the second chapter is on \\"Basic PHP Techniques,\\" and the rest of the book is basically about database connectivity (Chapters 3-8). The only thing I found lacking was that it doesn't include information about templates. If you are creating a website, you will want to use templates!

There's examples on PGP encryption and even writing your own online store. The basic syntax is covered for everything from basic data structures to integrating databases into the page... and it even gets into specific database programs (MS SQL, mysql, postgresSQL, Informix, and plain ODBC to name a few).

It is clear and easy to understand. The author explains the why's as well as the how's so that a beginner can understand everything without trying to guess what is meant by ambiguous statements... which has been my biggest complaint about the rest of the books on this topic.

OH THE OPTIONS!!!! :) BUY THIS and have some fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for 40 or 50 batches!","review":"This kit works great! We have made three batches so far and if you follow the directions it comes out great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed making cheese","review":"This was my first time making cheese. I just love it. It was so easy! I hope to get the kids involved in learning where food comes from and how its made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy Experiment","review":"I bought this kit to use with my kids for a study of enzymes. My daughter couldn't wait to try it out and we made cheese for the first time today. The mozzarella turned out great. I will make some minor modifications in our method next time, but I have no complaints about the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your own Organic cheese!","review":"This kit makes cheese making fun and easy--and I use organic milk and make organic cheese for way less than anything you can buy at the store. My kids love it too! Just make sure that you don't use milk that's been ultra-pasteurized."},{"rating":"2","title":"I made cheese","review":"Made cheese. It was easy to use. It was fun. I accidentally doubled the rennet amount so I did not have any issues with curds forming. Maybe that is a good thing after reading other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheese, please?","review":"Kit was bought as a gift. Said it worked out okay, but needs a bit of practise. Sounds like fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous fun","review":"This kit is easy and fun to use. I really enjoy making Mozzarella with my friends and family and trying different infusions. It is great as a gift too. There are so many options for making different mozzarella and ricotta it is surprising and fun. Great for the foodie and/or crafty person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I just finished eating a pizza made from my first successful batch of this mozzarella. I had one failed batch before this successful one and the second was great, definitely better than store-bought cheese. The instructions were good but I supplemented them by watching youtube videos and an article on instructables.com. Even with that prep my first batch failed because I didn't drain enough whey off the curds before microwaving it, and I got some mushy stuff. Now that I know where I went wrong it's a pretty easy process, and other than the kit it only required a pot, a strainer, a slotted spoon, a bowl, and milk. It took a little over an hour and I got about a pound of good cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - tip for newbies","review":"I just got this kit for Christmas. I had been making yogurt, so stirring milk and watching the temperatures for cheese making was nothing new to me. It's just a little tedious, but not difficult. I will suggest that you follow the instructions exactly. We have access to a local dairy, so I didn't have any trouble with the milk. I did waste an entire gallon of milk on my first attempt because I thought filtered tap water didn't have chlorine in it. I was wrong. The chlorine killed the enzymes. I bought a jug of spring water for my second attempt- success! This is an excellent project for people who are concerned about where their cheese is coming from. I bought it due to the rennet being vegetable based."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunday afternoon fun","review":"I bought this kit on a whim, ended up having the greatest time making fresh mozzarella. The directions could be a little clearer, but cheese was produced despite that. Delicious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good product, except for the thermometer","review":"I am overall happy with this cheese kit. But one thing disappointed me. A mercury-in-glass thermometer is not suitable for cheese making because a temperature scale does not show numbers between tens, i.e 10-20,20-30. And it is crucial for cheese making, as the instruction says (95, 135 degrees), to get the right temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to make Mozzarella!","review":"We tried four times with different milk and could not make the mozzarella! It was a disaster- the cheese came out hard as a rock! But, the ricotta was a success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother unless you can get RAW MILK","review":"The directions say you can use pasteurized milk, but not ultra pasteurized.Then it goes on to say that milk marked pasteurized is usually ultra pasteurized...Either wayit won't work. Then there are directions to use powdered milk and heavy cream, guess what..it doesn't work either.There are very few places you can get RAW milk and if you cannot get it, you are out of luck.Kit is basically cheap junk too,you can pick up everything you need at walmart for about $5.00 (less the raw milk).If you really want to make your own Fresh Mozz, just go to youtube and type it in.Many, many videos on how and what to do.Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheese!","review":"Haven't made this yet, gonna do it on hubby's next day off. Just add milk! We love that we only need 1 ingredient to get us started."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"The enclosed directions did not make great cheese. After going online and getting alternative ways to make the cheese it still didn't make very good product. It all ended up in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructions too vague","review":"I got up to the taffy pull stage, after carefully reading and annotating the instructions. Then realized while I was trying to stretch the cheese that I'd never made taffy and had no idea what to do. Since basically you are buying the materials and instructions, I think the instructions should be MUCH clearer. Who wants to look up help in the midst of making cheese? I wasted a gallon of nice raw milk..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need for perfect mozzarella","review":"I recently started making my own cheese and I have to say that it is my new favorite hobby. Although I've only mastered making mozzarella and ricotta, these are two of the cheeses that my family uses most often in cooking anyways. The instructions are clear and the kit gives you enough supplies to make many many batches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for the money","review":"Smaller than a happy meal...don't recommend... buy some products outright..not in this tiny kit..if you include shipping it was $39."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible packaging.","review":"I haven't used the product yet but the packaging is TERRIBLE.The thermometer is \\"cheesy\\", it looks like the kind of thermometer you stick under your tongue - useless!The Salt and Citric Acid are in baggies that aren't even resealable.Sorry, but I only bought it in a kit for convenience, this isn't convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!","review":"I had been looking for this book for quite a while. I first read it when I was a teenager and absolutely loved it. My book arrived faster than I expected and was in perfect condition. I also appreciate the fact that the cost of the book went towards making a baby outfit for charity. Overall, I am extremely impressed with the seller and will be happy to purchase from them again if I find another book I want from their collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Instead of buying a Cliffs Notes version, why not save your money and get an edition of Romeo and Juliet that has good explanatory notes? That way, you get the original language as well as a modern-day translation. In reading Cliffs Notes rather than the actual play, you miss out on Shakespeare's rich use of language (puns, poetry, metaphor, detailed images, neat phrases) in this classic tragedy. I know Elizabethan English takes some getting used to, but please, do yourself a favor and read the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wing Three Step Safety Ladder is great!","review":"If you need a really solid and sturdy wide-step ladder for reaching modest heights, this is it. It's not cheap and it's heavy but it won't slip around or tip over and it won't break or even flex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Solution for us","review":"This ladder is an excellent solution for those of us that need super sturdy! I no longer worry that my husband is going to have a step stool collapse underneath him, and he doesnt have to lug in a huge ladder to do small jobs. I'd have given it 5 stars except that the price -- seems a bit pricey but otherwise excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best step ladder ever!!!!!!","review":"I cannot sing the praises of this little stepladder enough!!! It is an awesome product that I would recommend to anyone in a heart beat! I am a big guy and I trust this stepladder to hold me and whatever I am holding without a problem. It is extremely durable. Yes you may say it is a little pricey but trust me it is worth every penny!Great! Great! Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ladder","review":"Good Ladder. The mechanism that holds the bar in place broke after only one (4 month) project. So, I am giving it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating. The rest of the ladder is very sturdy and comfortable for a big guy. I am not even sure when it broke. I just noticed one day when I went to use it that the bar did not lock in place. The tab that locks it in place was bent. I am a bit disappointed in this as it is a very expensive ladder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Giant 3 step ladder","review":"Solid as a rock.Great value.If your looking for a step ladder thats safe and sturdy this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Ladder","review":"I love this ladder. It is so sturdy and easy to carry around the house for small projects. I feel secure on the steps as they are larger than regular ladder steps. It folds nicely to tuck away in a closet as well.I'm not young anymore so I can't move up and down the steps as quickly as I used to and I feel very comfortable using this ladder."},{"rating":"2","title":"very sturdy","review":"this is a well balanced and very sturdy ladder. the hand rail at the top is quite helpfull. The 4 star rating reflects the one drawback which is weight. Pretty heavy to me \\"a guy age 56\\". Also it's opening mechanism can be somewhat cumbersome. The stability this ladder gives the user is a fair trade off to the weight issue. I would buy it again, but it's not my first ladder to pull out of the storage area to do a quick task or reach a 9' shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really heavy duty!","review":"This is a great little ladder. Very sturdy with extra wide steps for long projects. It's a bit heavy for a \\"step stool\\", but wonderful for big projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged in shipping twice by UPS...VERY FRAGILE ITEM!","review":"I have been very disappointed with this product. It was delivered twice by UPS damaged. The factory packaging was very poor. The ladder appears to be a good idea, but it does not meet up to the standards of other Little Giant Products that I have owned. I have always highly rated Little Giant Ladders and prefer to use them over any other product. The first was crushed at the top. The second was bent at the steps reinforcement bars. Amazon.com will not ship a third and refunded my money. If this item is so fragile in shipment, I doubt that it would be durable in everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome","review":"I own 3 other Little Giant Ladders that I'm very happy with, this is not one of them. My other ladders are US built and this one comes from China and it shows with heavy cast aluminum steps instead of light-weight extruded steps and stiff movement. Deploying and re-stowing the ladder is overly cumbersome and really not worth the hassle. Once set up the ladder is sturdy and easy to work from, but so are many others at a lower price point. I spent $29.13 in postage to send it back and thought it money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"step ladder","review":"Sturdy - 300 lb. capacity, not flimsy like many others. Well worth the price difference as not only is this stronger, but will last much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate 3-Step Ladder?","review":"All I can add to other, detailed reviews is my impression and experience. Tis stepladder is costly, but also a good value. It is very strong and provides a stable platform(s) which gives the feeling and reality of safety. I'm about 5'-8\\" 215 lbs, and my 5'-8\\" 320-lb friend has also had great experience with his. As has been noted, the ladder is heavy, difficult to carry and awkward to store, but those things can be good -- I bought one for my 88 year-old friend to replace her rickety old ladder partly so that she will be less likely to use a stepladder at all, and will be more likely to get help when it is needed for a task. To summarize, I feel this ladder is so good that I am willing to live with the \\"issues\\". It ought to last a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAFER THE BETTER","review":"We wanted a step-ladder that would give our employees a great sense of safety. With the rubber pads and its wide stance, our people feel safe, even with wet boots on. The highter hand rail provides everyone with a strong support to hang on to. Would higher recommend this step-ladder to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wing Little Jumbo Two-Step Safety Ladder","review":"This Wing Little Jumbo Two-Step Safety Ladder looks great in the photograph, but when I opened the package the steps had bright red lettering on them.

Not at all.Installed on a 1998 Chevy Malibu and they have a high squeal sound whenever I lightly touch the brakes.

His brother, a pilot trainee joins up... his father, a WWI vet owns the local gas station and they are expected to ration food, rubber, gas, and other precious staples. He and his best friend travel around on their bikes savaging metal for the war effort.This was an entertaining (and educational) story of how a country pitched in to help each other during a time of crisis. I particularly enjoyed reading about the various characters that inhabited the town, and the cantankerous old teacher Miss Titus that put a mousetrap in her purse to thwart the class bully. My only complaint is that this book wasn't longer.Well worth a listen for adults and kids alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. Loved the humor and the sensitivity of the first person character. Peck has such a wonderful way of creating pictures in my mind with his words. I can actually see the neighbors on the porch swing, dad hunkering down in the car waiting for the \\"horn blowing vandals\\", and the individual descriptions of the many people in his life brought the whole town to life. I manage a senior housing facility and read this book to them during our weekly reading time. They loved it and best of all could relate to many of the wartime references. It brought many stories out of them. I read it aloud to my husband as we were traveling downstate and all the way back home. Lots of laughter and comments. I have requests from both venues for more of his books and I will definitely do that. Wish I could have given it an even higher rating!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Wings of Heroes","review":"I really enjoyed the book because the story was told like my grandparents would have told it. It reminded me of the stories they would tell to me over and over as I grew up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to spoil the party, but...","review":"I grew tired of this book about halfway through and put it down. The prose is perfect, the imagery vivid, but nothing kept pulling me further into the book. I feel hesitant criticizing the award-winning author, but I can't imagine a middle school boy reading this book unless he had to, because nothing much really happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!!","review":"The gun doesn't even work and I have had no resonse from the company to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap gun cheap price","review":"i would only recommend this gun to a \\"noob\\" airsoft player or someone plays with these same level guns. the fps and accuracy is just too low for even the mid range guns. for a beginner this is a good buy as an entry pistol but dont expect it to take you far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk.","review":"THis guns fps is horrible, can hold baerly any BB's, and looks retarded.

This one is just sad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my god","review":"First off I bought this gun off amazon and when I first got it I had thought it felt weird in my hand. Also the picture looks nothing like the gun. So when i first shot it it went about 12 feet. it started to shoot well though after about 5 shots and I started to think it would be a good gun. Hahahahah was I wrong. The gun just stopped shooting and when i pulled out the magazine a bb fell out. I tried cleaning the barrel with the barrel cleaner the gun came with and it sucks about as bad as the gun. My advice would be to buy like 15 gumballs then this piece of crap. Im just a kid and i only have 2 other airsoft guns but this by far is the worst gun I have ever shot [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"16 shots before it broke","review":"The seller was great, I got the gun in only a few days, but the gun itself has some problems. Well, one problem.It sucks.I took only 16 shots before it stopped firing, so now I've got a 20 dollar paper weight. No damage during shipping, or anything like that, it just sucked. If you're looking for a cheap little airsoft pistol, go grab a spring pistol."},{"rating":"1","title":"this gun sucks","review":"alright when your standing about 10 feet away and you get this gun shot at you, you can literally dodge them. it goes about 30 fps. i shot my brother from about 5 feet away and asked if it even hit him, i said yes but he did not feel a [...] thing. Then from about 4 feet away i shot my friend on bare skin and he couldnt even feel anything either! It shoots about 15 feet tops.this gun sucks. im not trying to joke with you, if you buy this gun you will reget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Gun","review":"This is a very nice gun. It goes really far and shoots fairly hard. It has full and semi automatic, which is a plus, and is pretty accurate. I would say that this would be a great back up pistol for use in battles and is also good for plinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great backup gun","review":"This is one good gun. Semi or FULL automatic, 180 fps, and able to hold 15 bbs.....on a pistol!!!!! I admitt i'm a noob at airsoft (i only have 3 guns), but this pistol totally rocks!! I got mine in great condition and it shoots farely far. It's accurate, and shoots super fast. If you just want to have target practice or little battles with your friends, then this is the gun for you! And if you take airsoft really seiressely, this is a great backup gun. Buy it!(I might have posted 2 reviews by accidint...sorry)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought two of these pistols at once. When they arrived brand new out of the package, neither of them worked. I know it is tempting to see a semi/full auto pistol at this price but it is all irrelevant when they do not work. I went with an electric P70 instead and it actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly and fascinating","review":"This is U.of Texas anthropology professor Richard R. Flores's brilliant analysis of the symbolically manufactured cultural resonance of the Alamo across nearly two centuries: first, within 19th century San Antonio's transformation (with much turbulence) from a Mexican villa to an American city, and then later in folklore, film, and television. A fascinating read, especially for those curious Texans who cherish their state's rich Hispanic heritage, and are not afraid to question the quasi-sacred symbolism they were taught in school.Fav.

You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album \\"Dark SIde Of The Moon\\" or the Eagles \\"Hotel California\\" or Elton John's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\"; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I first heard this album on vinyl, and it completely blew me away. To this day, it never gets old.It's so deep, so emotional, so...in a sense, thrilling. Two songs in particular are my favorites. \\"Biko\\" is an amazing, classic live song about Stephan Biko. \\"Family Snapshot\\", however, combines Gabriel's Genesis years with what he would do in So. Melt is an overlooked classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Gabriel's Best CD Ever","review":"PETER GABRIEL 3 is the best album ever by Peter Gabriel. The songs are dark and scary, but in an appealing way. The themes range from loss of identity (\\"I Don't Remember\\") to attention-getting at all costs (\\"Family Snapshot\\") to excessive warlike behavior (\\"Games Without Frontiers\\") to cliquish attitudes (\\"Not One Of Us\\") to South Africa's old apartheid system (\\"Biko\\"). The songs, taken together, send a message that we could all learn from about treating each other, and the planet, with respect. Gabriel's support of efforts to free people unjustly imprisoned in countries not their own makes PETER GABRIEL 3 an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart buy, great value at even twice the cost","review":"This is not the priciest wheeled laptop tote on the market, but it is the greatest value. It has plenty of room for your laptop and required accessories, like the power brick and headphones/earbuds. The lower portion has rigid sides so other items like cameras, MP3 players, and phones, etc., are well protected and not smashed together. There is lots of room for documents and literature. The retractable \\"Smart Strap\\" really works and is not gimmicky at all. It is very useful in tight quarters (like onboard ANY airplane) and is functional even when loaded down with all of your stuff. The extendable handle at first seemed a bit flimsy, but 3 weeks of running through Europe and Japan didn't even make it flinch.My wife has a similar case from Travelpro which cost twice as much, and I am glad I purchased the US Luggage product instead. This is the best deal on the market today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice for those who visit or live in bear habitat","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone who vacations or moves into bear country. Through the words of expert biologists in the field as well as the experiences of communities that have developed plans to keep bears and people safe, Linda Masterson offers valuable advice. When it comes to coexistence with bears, education is the key, and this book offers very practical education. As an educator for Appalachian Bear Rescue and a presenter of bear programs, I find this book to be an invaluable resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read, accurate, practical","review":"This is far and away the best book available for a typical person who has a home or cabin in bear country and wants to know how to cope with bears. It doesn't read like a boring textbook--the writing is light and easy. But retired Colorado Division of Wildlife Conservation biologist Tom Beck did the technical editing, so it's accurate. Most books about bears have not been reviewed by a real expert, so they're filled with erroneous information--some of it quite dangerous. You can trust the advice in this book. It's practical without being preachy. If you decide to be a beekeeper in black bear country--yep, bears do like honey--Living With Bears gives you detailed instructions on how to keep bears out with an electric fence. It provides pragmatic advice for any bear situation you're likely to encounter. If you live in bear country and you want to be a good neighbor, this book will help you understand why bears behave the way they do. Outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good general guide","review":"This book is worth the money and proviodes lots of good tips for avoiding conflicts.

I would reccommend it to anyone interested in bear-human conflicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Bears, oh my!","review":"This book provides a lot of practical information for those who live in contact with bears. My only complaint is that the author doesn't discuss the use of paint-ball markers, which we have found is a very effective way to harass bears. Never shoot at the face; simply firing the paint balls in the general direction of the bear will get it running, we have found. Then, shoot for the rump.

I can tell because the book itself rushes its events, from the solution of the summit meeting to the problem of David. They weren't given any thought, thus making this book worthless. So do yourself a favor and stay away from this book or borrow it if you are desprate to see the ending of the trilogy that started out great. P.S. I consider this the downfall point of the Animorph series. From this point on seeing a good animorph book is rare. This book is the one that started that bad trend of bad animorph books."},{"rating":"1","title":"From an aspiring director","review":"I hope to be a film director some day; I've studied a lot and even dabbled in short films. I try to read every book that seems relevant, a hard task since it seems that everyone is writing about film, with or without credentials. This book intrigued me because it indicated its determination to make a case that the real \\"auteur\\" of films might be the scriptwriter. I was ready for an intelligent argument to sustain that notion--or else, as I began to hope, this would turn out to be a satire on such a mock-theory. Both my expectations were quickly dispelled. The book is serious about its off-beat and dated thesis; and it lacks any humor to be satirical. I read to the end, hoping to find some kernel of originality. I found none. For an antidote, I saw Eisenstein's great silent film \\"The Battleship Potemkin\\" Now there was an \\"auteur\\" who used visual images to evoke language."},{"rating":"1","title":"What \\"Auteur\\"?","review":"Not long ago I was ecstatic because I sold a spec script. I felt like an \\"auteur\\". It wasn't long before I learned that it had gone to two more writers for \\"rewrites\\" that the interested director (just interested, mind you) had demanded. The title was changed, two characters became one. It was horror after horror. When I read about this book propounding the theory of the screenwriter as \\"auteur,\\" I bought it knowing it would provide me with a few laughs that might lessen the impact of my experience. It didn't even provide that, just lots of theorizing that didn't even make sense. If you want to be an \\"auteur,\\" don't believe this little book; write a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Added muddle","review":"A friend in my directors workshop gave me this little book to see what I thought of it. I thought he was recommending it because it was good, even helpful in our field. It isn't. It's a totally naive and not even an original take on the function of screenplays on a finished film. I doubt that Kepen has been actively involved with film-making. If he had, he'd know that the final script is a collaborative effort and that to find the \\"auteur\\" involved is so difficult that, often, writers sue for credit. I thought at first that Kepen was satirizing the state of the screenwriter, but he's not. He's just added muddle to the situation of what makes a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radically disappointing","review":"As a student of film, I know that film theory often tends to be written in a private language only the writer understands. The best books are written by the film-makers, who know what they're writing about from having actually worked in the industry. What drew me to this book was the \\"radical\\" in the title [...]. I approached it hoping to find, at least, something new. I didn't. Does Kipen have any experience in film-making? Has he ever even talked to screenwriters; some films require a dozen film writers before they're shot, to the point that the credits themselves become blurred. To say that a writer leaves his or her imprint on a film so that it is detectable after version after version is somewhat silly. Too bad the book didn't deliver anything radical or even new--and not good writing either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool book","review":"I wish all polemics were like this -- funny and smart and just plain intersting.

She is also accompanied by some of the best musicians that I have ever heard that help in creating the various moods that cd covers. The songs range from Jacques Brel to Elvis Costello and for good measure there are original compositions as well. Chanson is an emotional journey that you do not want to miss.

That would be a grave error, to say that it continues to shape it. Almost as grave as mistaking early Christian practices with the modern day Church. The Mysteries of Mithras, was in my opinion both fascinating and frightning. I was fascinated to learn about such a ancient and complex religion but on the other hand, it was recommended to me by a friend, who I will call Nrob.

I hava a P80 18x optical zoom which deffinitely can use the support, yet is small and ligth.Yes theres a silly spring loaded ball on the base to help avoid the base to unscrew from the camera, which came out the back but you can easily live without it or fix it with adrop of Krazy glue as I did.

Just a waist of money.:-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, Light, Adequate","review":"The SMP-1 is very inexpensive. It's much lighter than my other monopod and has easier to operate flip-locks for the extension sections. The head flips in one direction, but with that you can angle the partially extended monopod to brace a camcorder against your body. The monopod has a minimal foam handle grip at the top. It has only a short wrist strap so you can't use the strap to help brace the monopod by using it around your neck, or carry it that way either. The monopod extends to 60\\" and collapses to 17\\".

Little by little over the course of a week, the plastic started to break on this, during normal operation such as separating the quick release base from the unit to tighten up the mount screw, until finally the whole tilt head came off and nearly sent my camera under the wheels of a jeep.

He went into too much detail on all the problems he had just getting there, but was not very discriptive of life on the ice. I was never drawn into the book and thus did not have much emphathy with the characters. Felt like Messner did more complaining about things than trying to describe the adventure he was on. He complained about his life before the trip, he complained about all the problems he ran into trying to get to Antartica, he complained about his partner during and after his trip, and he complained about there being people at the South Pole.

Eerdmans","review":"Biblical scholars today often sound as if they are caught in the aftermath of Babel-a clamor of voices unable to reach common agreement. Yet is this confusion necessarily a bad thing? Many postmodern critics see the recent profusion of critical approaches as a welcome opportunity for the emergence of diverse new techniques. In this book the author, a noted biblical scholar, considers the effect of the postmodern situation on biblical, primarily Old Testament, criticism over the last three decades. Engaging and even-handed, he examines the quest of historical criticism to objectively establish a text's basic meaning. Accepting that the Bible may no longer provide secure \\"foundations\\" for faith, the author still highlights its ethical challenge to be concerned for \\"the other\\"-a challenge central both to Old Testament ethics and to the teaching of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voodoo Doll","review":"I purchased this for a fun novelty grab bag gift.

If you are looking for songs about Drinking, Driving, Death and destruction, this is IT. Steve has a great voice, which puts a lot of his odd sense of humor into everything he does.The songs that are fast paced are done well, and the slower songs still pack the punch that keeps you listening.

I do wish before something is placed on Kindle, that is not meant to be read without a CD.I almost requested my money back,but Shaman music is available on Itunes, as are guided meditations.As for the book,I enjoyed it, it seemed to have some sustenance, but, without the CD, I'm left out in the cold. The author does give one a basic understanding of power animals,and clearly describes a few. (What about dogs? I guess dogs are considered to be domesticated.)He describes several animals, but it is limiting.I did enjoy how he described to meet the animal guides, but I don't enjoy that he continually refers to the CD. Some books are not meant to be digitalized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"We bought this for my office.

This is why I have to hide it whenever we're done playing otherwise he'll rip off the feathers on it. The rod that the string is attached to is a little flimsy but still very fun for the cats and myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cat Toy Ever Made!","review":"I volunteer with a cat rescue group and have a steady stream of cat fosters going through my home. This is the only toy that ALL cats love to play with, regardless of their age. What makes it unique from other \\"feathers on fishing pole\\" toys is that it is attached with a fishing lure so when you move it through the air it twirls like a real bird.My 19 year old cat use to jump 2-3 feet in the air to \\"catch the bird\\". I always had to hide it after playing with the cats because if I didn't one of the cats would steal it away and eat through the cord and tear up the feathers, my cats all time favorite toy.I always recommend it to my adopters, all 500+ of them to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this so well","review":"I had one of these bird feather teasers and loved it so well that I had to have two. Well, I should say that my kitty's loved it so well that we had to have two. I have 2 of the darling kitties and if I had da Bird in one hand and ANYTHING else in the other, even if it was the mouse which is also a Da Bird Product, it was ignored by both in favor of Mr. Bird. So that each kitty was not flying through the air and bumping into the other trying to catch up with the ONLY bird, I had to get another. Now each kitty is busily engaged with a bird of his own as my arms stretch and stretch to keep the two apart. I have to admit. I have as much fun as they do. It is a GLORIOUS product. Every kitty owner should have one for each cat and each kitty own had best invest in an arm or finger, at least, to dangle said Bird from. It is a riot of fun, dangling, bouncing and trouncing. Please buy away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Made","review":"I really hate to give something a negative review, but this product, while very cleaver, is so poorly made that it fell apart almost immediately.

Both of my cats love this toy. Even my somewhat overweight cat will get air and do flips midair trying to smack this thing out of the air.Pros:Cats go mental! They absolutely cannot resist the toy. My cats can be asleep upstairs and then they hear \\"Da Bird\\" flying through the living room and they come running.Easy setup and breakdown.The feather part of the toy is durable, holds up very well.Rod is flexible, which allows for some leeway when the cat pulls and tugs the featherCons:String gets tangled and knotted very easilyThe knot between the string and the feather breaks easily and I had to retie it very often. My cat easily breaks the simple knot and needs to be retied every other week.Overall: I would recommend this to anyone who has a lazy cat or an active cat. My somewhat overweight cat typically doesn't play with any other toy other than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"USE CAUTION","review":"i bought this because my cat is strictly indoor and i knew he needed to get more exercise. i read about the toy in a cat behavior book and bought one. it seemed great at first, my cat was crazy for the toy & i was glad he liked it. i thought i was being careful with it but i was not careful enough. my cat really got the \\"bird\\" experience and when he would catch it he was very posessive and wanted to \\"break\\" the bird's neck, which he did every time howvever getting it back from him was not always easy. plus the head/neck portion is a small plastic piece. he ended up swallowing it and usually would vomit it back out. but, one time he did not. he had to have surgery and it ended up costing over $2000.00. we were lucky that it did not damage him seriously and they were able to \\"easily\\" remove the plastic. please use caution if you choose to purchase this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I cannot express how disappointed I am in \\"Da Bird\\". The product is essentially useless because of its poor construction. The string curls up and makes it impossible to use. The poles do not connect properly so it is always in two pieces. I literally used this one time and because the string is so cheap, it is not usable. Maybe I got a defective model -- other people seem to have had positive experiences -- but I will never pay money for this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, poor quality!","review":"On the first day of playing with my cats, they managed to break the tie between the fly and the rod.

This is a cheap quality product and I would recommend that no one buys this product without knowing that it breaks easily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crack for cats!","review":"The feathers lasted less than a week, however, I didn't hold that against the manufacturer in my rating. Feathers are easily shredded. It's now just a plastic nub with a few feather stubs sticking out the end but still my cats LOVE this toy and bug me all day to get it out and play with them. The reason I tried this toy was to redirect some of my (neutered) male cat's aggression and it's worked wonders in that department. He rarely bothers the other cats now as he spends all his spare time either sleeping or concentrating on getting me to play Da Bird with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"my kittys luv this toy","review":"my little ones luv this toy. shipping was very fastI took one star off because on day 2 of the toy my cat got the nub off the end of it---choked 4 30 seconds...I dont know cat CPR.

The feathers are destroyed quickly..but its all good fun.Do hide the toy or else the will bring it to u in the middle of the nite...and dont let them see where u hide it..they will open closets , drawers, and even cabinets to get at it.

Unfortunately, the very first night he played with it the toy became detached from the string that holds it. Now we can still use it, but we have to keep retying a knot at the end of the string to hold the toy onto the end. The toy comes off fairly often. Our cat is not overly aggresive and was not chewing the string, just normal cat-play. This product would be better with a small chain holding the toy onto the end instead of the string."},{"rating":"1","title":"My waste of ten- dollers!","review":"I had this toy two-days and my cat snaped it in half from not letting go, she also pulled the feathers out of it from me trying to get it out of her mouth.

One of the best toys out there next to the cat play cube and the new automatic laser pointer I found at Petco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"I had read about Da Bird in more than one cat book and was disappointed that my local Petco only had a generic version. Because I wanted the exact product I had heard about, I ordered one through Amazon. It was definitely worth it! My cat's response to this toy over the past few weeks is consistently amazing and it doesn't seem to be letting up! In fact, i am back on Amazon to stock up on replacement feathers, because although it is a simple toy, the arrangement of the feathers makes a distinct sound when you \\"whir\\" it through the air. My cat will see the feathers stickng out of his toy drawer sometimes and he won't leave them alone! He really loves this toy and I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cat Toy Ever.","review":"I've never met a cat that could resist it.

The wand that holds the feathers is a two-piece thing which doesn't stay together well at all.

I've had many of them because of this. The top of the feather toy comes off it's hook, so you can't use it any more. The clip breaks that attaches the toy to the string. The string breaks. It just goes on and on. One of my cat loves this, so I keep buying them. Dopey, I know, but most of the cat toys on sticks just don't interest my cats. A great cat toy, just don't expect it to last very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitty fun!!!","review":"My 5month old kitten is absolutely \\"wild\\" about this toy! We have to put the toy away because she will play until she is panting from exertion! I would strongly recommend this to anyone who needs to get some activity out of his/her cat(s).

(haven't used yet) These feathers look like a real bird flying around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toy","review":"I bought this for my parent's older cat and he loved it! He was jumping and running around all over the place. The feathers actually mimic the way a bird flies, which is pretty neat for such a cheap toy. It is really easy to put together (comes in 2 pieces that simply hook into to each other) and shipped really quickly. The quality is also great! One word of caution, my parent's cat actually hisses and growls at us when he finally catches the feathers because he thinks it is a real bird! He tried to walk away with the feathers in his mouth as though he had made a kill. So, if your cat is temperamental at all, be careful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The cats LOVE it","review":"The Da Bird is truly wonderful. The feathers flutter just like a birds wings would and the cats go wild. Even the old, fat cats leap into the air and go crazy with joy.

One more for me and 3 for friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is awesome","review":"This thing is pretty sweet. When you swing it around the room it looks like a bird flying around, the feathers make it twirl in circles and it looks pretty cool, and I'm pretty sure my cat thinks its a bird. A lot of fun. If your kitty is anything like mine, it will love this toy and rip it to shreds very quickly ... so buy extra replacement birdies haha"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitten loved it...","review":"My kitten loved this toy but the string didn't last more than a day.

When i first saw the toy i realized it can be a hazard but my cats loved it too much. I decided to keep it and even bought several ones to replace it. my cats really really loved it. The problem with this toy is that the part that attaches the mouse to the wire has small parts that can get stuck in a cat's tooth while playing. I tried to be extremely careful when handling this toy but it seems that you can never be careful enough :(It chipped a relatively small part of my cat's tooth, but this warning is more than enough. I felt like i was obliged to tell everyone about this. By the way, the same thing applies to the other version of the toy (the one with feathers). I will post the same review for the other version as well.I really hope the company sees this and try to modify the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for some hilarious antics from your cats...","review":"This toy is just great. We have two 4 month old kittens, a brother and sister. Our boy took to Da Bird immediately. He leaps, runs, flips, and basically goes crazy over this toy. Our favorite is when he gets it in his mouth and starts growling, warning anyone near by that the bird is HIS.Even though our boy LOVES this toy, our girl doesn't seem to care about it at all! She sits by passively watching as her brother goes crazy over it.

It's a shame she won't be enjoying another one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stimulus program for your cat.","review":"There is not really anything else that exists that my cats will get half as excited for.

Very worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Bird is Da Bomb!","review":"Da Bird is a well-made cat toy that my cats love to play with. It is such a favorite, I made sure I had replacements of both the toy and the replacement \\"birds\\" on hand for when the toy wears out. The toy mimics bird flight realistically (so say my cats), probably because the toy is constructed from the flight feathers of guinea fowl. Even after two cats have captured and mauled the \\"bird\\" over and over, the toy continues to work as designed. The string attached to the pole is sufficiently long that you and your cat aren't too close when he turns into the savage little predator he was born to be and he captures and mauls the \\"bird\\". The string sometimes tangles, but the fun your cat will have with the toy cancels out this small wear issue.[...] Here is a video of Andy and Dougy, my two Persian cats, playing with this toy.

Thanks to Da Bird Interactive Feather Cat Toy, he plays and plays for hours and does not give up on it. He gets so tired he starts panting like a dog. But he is still determined to get that toy. When we are done playing, I have to hide it in my closet on the top shelf where he can't get it because he knows how to open the closet and he still wants to play!

She was very distressed to say the least and it really scared me because it could have happened when I was gone for a much longer time.I cut the string to get her free, but, now a few months later, am ordering another one because she did really love it when I played with her with it and it is a great, interactive, toy.

My cats are absolutely convinced it is a real bird and chase if vigorously. I was unaware of its power over them and quickly noticed as the ended up running into walls and into all sorts of trouble and crashes trying to get a hole of this toy. It gives them the best exercise possible and is very well made. The toy itself will not last too long as my cats chew into it and carry it around like a fresh kill, so I would stop up on refill replacements.

The stick and string are about as cheap as they come, and will break within the first ten minutes, not to mention leave fiberglass slivers in your hand. The feather and fishing hook they attach to the cheap toothpick is very hard (and scary to some cats). If you sucker to buy this crap, don't hit your kitty with it or you'll be spending money at the vet, not on rip-off cat products.

Sending it back. What a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAT LOVED IT BUT IT BROKE AFTER 2 DAYS OF PLAY","review":"It was an immediate hit, and gave my 6 month old kitten lots of exercise. Problem was, after 2nd day of play the string frayed, and then the feather broke off. It was a pity because he really enjoyed playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feather Toy","review":"The cats love the Da Bird cat toy.Me on the hand, not as in love with the durability, but love to see the cats excited to play with its realistic movements.The complaints I have is that the feather comes away from the string they use to attach it to the wand and it is difficult to retie, or the feather has come completely out of the plastic attachment that holds it to the wand, and this is all within the first two weeks.The wand itself is light and long. It is easy to store too."},{"rating":"2","title":"best to buy","review":"This is the best toy for cat. Handle with perfect length, so I can sit relax and swing my arm at the same time.My cat love to play this everyday. Best buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily our kitties top favorite toy","review":"We have an older cat that generally allows the younger cat to steal all play time. Da Bird is a great toy to play with both kitties at once, as the bird can fly high (where the older cat is on top of a cat tree) and then fly low (where the younger cat is racing around) -- and one person can play with both cats at same time. We've purchased two of these, so that when two people are around, each cat can have her own Da Bird to chase around the house. Definately the best toy we've managed to find so far for our girls. The birds don't last too long for us (younger kitty is a beast), but we've got a stock of replacement birds so that we're always good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"DANGER of CHOKING","review":"Great toy but dangerous for curious kittys. Label says PUT TOY AWAY OR YOUR CAT WILL LOVE IT TO PIECES. WHAT THEY DO NOT SAY IS THAT IF YOUR CAT FINDS THIS TOY WHEN YOU ARE NOT AROUND HE CAN BECOME TANGLEd IN IT AND CHOKE. The long cord and the long wand are dangerous. My 4 year old cat found his Da Bird in our bookshelf at 3AM last week and managed to get it wrapped around both his neck and his back paw. He then panicked and ran choking and frothing through the house with the three foot wand whipping around behind him tightening the cord as it flipped from side to side . He went unconscious and we were able to cut the cord which was wrapped tightly around his neck. It is 7 days later and he still will not play with his replacement DA Bird.......so BEWARE......too much \\"love\\" is not a good thing. PUT YOUR TOY AWAY WHERE YOUR CAT CAN\\"T EVEN SEE IT OR GET IT! Fortunately they have 9 lives............RACHEL"},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed tears...","review":"This is the best cat toy I have ever tried, and believe me, I have tried A LOT. From the minute Da Bird \\"flew\\" out of its container my cats were obsessed. Every evening when I get home from work if I even glance in the direction of the closet where Da Bird is stored they go nuts. We have a daily playing session that leaves them tired out and me with a belly full of laughs. My cats make the funniest hunting faces and sounds you cannot imagine (the chirp like birds). We've had it for three weeks and even after daily use they never get bored of it (unlike the 40 dollar spinning mouse contraption I \\"invested\\" in). If you love your cat, buy Da Bird. He/she will love you for it!!! It's a great thing for both of you. An excellent stress reliever by the way!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our kitten loves it! His favorite toy!","review":"We have a Bengal kitten (3 1/2 months old) and this is his favorite toy. He loves to leap and chase it around. He's smart enough to know the feather is on a string so he attacks that too (and the pole on occasion).Just bought him the puff ball attachment and more refills. He's pretty rough on things so hopefully these refills has longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cat toy ever","review":"My three cats go nuts for this toy. They get so excited when I bring it out they fall all over themselves. I literally have to lock it away when not using or they would find it. They are very picky about toys too. \\"Cat dancer\\", not interested, fake mice, bleh, balls, crinkle bags, stuffed toys, nothing. If you have cats that hunt mice, fish, birds, lizards, and snakes, like mine do, or did before they became inside cats, then get them Da bird. They will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"da Bird can kill da Cat","review":"My cat loved this toy. However, he really loved the string. He ended up eating it, and I spent two days sick with worry that he would need surgery to remove the string from his intestines. Luckily, he \\"expelled\\" it on his own. I wouldn't advise taking the risk that your cat might enjoy the string better than the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 5 star","review":"I'll add another 5 star rating for this product. For the price, you can't beat the interaction you'll get with your cat. It scared my cat for about the first thirty seconds, then he attacked it with a ferocity I've never seen him have before.Now all I do is walk to the closet where I keep this toy and my cat goes *expletive* nuts!Trust me and the other hundreds of 5 star reviews... GET THIS TOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERY CAT loves this toy","review":"Even my overweight cats are leaping off the ground to catch the toy. I love the long wand so I can twirl it around and back and forth in a large area. My scaredy cat will even come out and play. When big ole Butch gets a hold of it though, he can pop out the feathers. They easily go back into the rubber attchment. This is a must have toy for cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cat toy","review":"my cats love Da Bird Cat Toy. We play with them everyday with this toy. We have 2 cats. One of them was skittish and the other aggressive. The skittish one has gained confidence and the aggressive one is calmer. This is a great interactive cat toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat loves it but BEWARE FIBERGLASS SPLINTERS","review":"This is a powerful toy! I barely had it unfurled before my bored and jaded cat lunged, and I got clawed trying to get it back....she LOVES it, madly. I don't recommend giving it to a child to use because it takes some thought and skill (and space) to manage it without destroying everything in sight. The package recommends putting it away when not in use, and that is excellent advice. I have to sneak around to hide it where she does not see me do that or she would probably level the place til she got it back. She is not that ambitious, so you can see how appealing it is! I hope she will not be harmed by the clip or other parts when she catches it. However, BEWARE. It split like wood at the far end (as a result of our first skirmish?) and gave me a very tiny but vicious splinter and heaven knows how it might harm the cat. This was not a two part pole, either, for what that's worth. The packing box was big enough for a baseball bat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please get this for your cats!","review":"This thing makes them go crazy. The size and weight are perfect. Most cat toys are too big and unrealistic - the cat can tell that it's not something they would go after in the wild. However with Da Bird, it's exactly the size and weight of some kind of creature they would actually hunt outside. It flaps around like an injured bird, which really gets their attention! It's the first cat toy I have seen that really gets them tired, which is great for using before bedtime so they don't stay up all night.Make sure to let them catch it sometimes so they get that satisfaction. Watch out for the little metal spinner piece which can hurt their teeth. Also, make sure to put it away when finished to avoid any strangulation hazard (and to keep them from ripping the feathers apart).This is how cat toys should be - interactive and realistic. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Book, it a long ad for the required software","review":"This book is basically just a long winded ad for the expensive software. They should have just made this book cost $150 and included the software. Or they could have added $20 to the cost of the software and just given this book out as the user manual. Costantly the book explains a setup that requires the software to take advantage of. Don't buy this book unless your prepared to invest the additional monies into the chasis setup software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a secret after reading cover to cover","review":"I bought this book expecting some explicit instructions on how to set up my race car and maybe a learn few secret tricks as the title suggests.But there are no secrets or even basic set up techniques to be found here, only incoherent ramblings about how experts will disagree with the author, but nothing tangible is ever said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt get the book so I dont know.","review":"Here it almost a month after I ordered the book and I still dont have it.

I watched all episodes and reruns I could get my hands on. I think they were INSANE to drop it from television.I eventually bought the entire collection at once.The only reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, is because of the quality of the DVD. The inner clips of the box break very easily. The DVD always defaults back to subtitles between episodes, which is really annoying.Even with the problems of the DVD, I love this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy install.","review":"Install couldn't have been easier, with the included instructions I think even a novice could install.

Good book for OsGemeos lovers though!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gently Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this one. It's a beautifully put-together book, with a lovely cover. However, one mustn't judge a book by it's cover. The essay here is a very basic biographical sketch - and that's it. There is really nothing to it - no analysis whatsoever. The photos, while nicely composed, never give an overall picture of the project discussed. There are very few plans or other drawings.Overall this is not a very good book if you want to find out about Aalto. It's of even less value if you already know Aalto and want a deeper understanding.There are many good books about Aalto, this is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Service","review":"Good customer service - my new opener stopped working a day after installing.

Felt that this was the way to go because I didn't have to worry about the batteries dying on a wet cold winter's night (for the wireless entry pads).

The Keypad is dependable and the electronic part is very dependable. Hardest part is the installation. Making a 1/2 inch hole for the flat cable between the keypad and the electronics is worst part of the installation. An occasional wipe with a damp cloth will keep the keypad from looking like a dirty mess and keep from giving away your access code.

Finally, I took time to read the manufacturer's instructions. \\"Don't hold the glass by the stem to dry,\\" they say. \\"That causes torque and your glasses will break.\\" The only glass we've lost since this revelation has to do with clumsiness and red wine and a light green carpet, and nothing to do with the fragility of the glasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to break","review":"Nice glasses, but because they are so thin, they are extremely easy to break.

My advice, pass on these. I've had a back problem for over 18 years and just always slept with a regular bed pillow between my legs, waking up in the middle of the night to find the thing somewhere else but not where I left it when I fell asleep. So, the ergonomic design and the idea that I can turn in-bed without losing my pillow was very appealing. I bought two because I spend part of my time at my place and part at my partner's place. The pillows compress too much to be of any use. The compression is such that it's like not even having anything there. I don't know why Amazon would carry a product like this except that they get suckers like me to purchase them.

I say this not simply because I approve of most of his policies, but because FDR, even when wrong, was magnificently wrong. He could relate to ordinary people, even though he was born privileged, but he could also reside above us all, making the visionary decisions that pundits could only whine against, visionary decisions that saved us all.Black doesn't grovel before such greatness--you'll learn appalling things about FDR that make Nixon look like a backstreet punk--but he remains convinced of FDR's greatness, in an age when no one can be great anymore, because we now eat our presidents for breakfast."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Took a While!","review":"It took a month to receive my book; I was happy with it once it arrived, but the slowness was a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Flynn instead","review":"Enough revisionism and bandwaggoning already !\\"The American politician, without troubling his pragmatic mind with the meaning of words, has discovered socialism, and embraced it, not as a great system of social organization, but as a wondrous machine for the purpose of buying votes.\\"- John T.

Sometimes vindictive, often underestimated, FDR's ability to lead and leverage public opinion is unmatched by any modern day president. The complicated relationship between Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill was navigated with great expertise. The personalities surrounding him - Eleanor, Teddy Roosevelt's side of the family, Stimson, Smith, MacArthur, Patton, Eisenhower, etc. are cause to hit the Barnes and Noble shop again soon for a few more biographies.

We now demand such a high level of personal conduct from our presidents that we've traded it for cut-rate intellect and sheer stubbornness as a proxy for character.Urbane, charming, and ultimately a great flip-flopper, Roosevelt taught three generations how American politics is done best, and his lessons are still worthy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tory Praises FDR!","review":"Once upon a time the meaning of the term \\"conservative\\" meant something very different from the meaning we have today.Conrad Black is Canadian and very rich - and not a \\"liberal\\".On an impulse, I bought this book as a Christmas present to myself.

The combo system is non-existant, making Clayfighter a button-masher. Backgrounds are okay without really being notable, and the music is plain forgettable, except for a wacky singing intro (yes, it sings).There were some vague differences between the original and the tournament edition, but not enough to really recommend both as a purchase (it's hard to recommend one as it is).

I have found it helpful in those areas of the yard where I need to actually transport the leaves some distance (rather than simply blowing them into the woods). It is not great for cleaning huge volumes of leaves (it simply takes too long), but it is good for cleaning leaves off of stones or in gardens.A couple of criticisms, the hose could be longer and it could be attached a bit more securely. Mine pulled loose on the first use. It is easy enough to pop back in, but it should stay put.

As many others have pointed out it is extremely prone to clogging (every 10 seconds or so, I'm not exaggerating). Additionally I had both clips that hold the hose onto the blower snap during the first season. Annoying, but for a while I simply tied the ends of the fabric strap to the hose. Until the strap broke.A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toro leaf collector","review":"We haven't used the leaf collector yet, we are waiting untill next spring when we have a lot of leaves.

The only way to use it effectively is to have a big pile of leaves near you/the basket used to hold leaf debris and keep your Toro (or other compatible) blower/vac and the attached hose as stationary as possible. I had debris accumulate around the edge of the cover as others have noted; key is to move it as close to the edge of the container as possible (I'm using the Toro model it's \\"designed\\" for). The real problem is making sure the hose stays inside the cover opening during leaf collection. It's a real pain, so much so that I ended up setting it aside and using the normal catcher that came with my Toro blower vac. The idea is great; however, the design is terrible. Echoing others, it's hard to believe Toro would put their name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Toro 51500 Universal Leaf Collector with 8-Foot HoseUnpacked the unit, connected it to my trash can.

After trying several different ways to hold the sheet on the collapsible Toro barrel or keep the hose attached to the sheet, I gave up. As a fairly resourceful 65 year-old woman with a disability, I didn't have the patience to try ingenious fixes such as duct tape; I simply assumed at first that I was doing something wrong. But after reading the directions several times, couldn't find any subtle hints I might have missed the first time. I suppose that I'll try to rig a fix, but in the meantime,Toro should pull this from the market and Amazon should stop selling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"The collector cover does not stay on any container, either Toro's own or a simple plastic garbage can. You'll spend more time reattaching it than you will mulching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Universal for Remington Mulching Blower Vac","review":"You have to use the funky adaptor with a Remington mulching blower vacuum. You have to remove the glued in foam, slide it over the tube where the bag used to be attached, hold both grip tabs out while you slide the adaptor over the foam, and then tighten the short velcro strap / loop the long strap somewhere around the blower to keep the unit from falling off.I am using a rubbermaid trash can with minor amounts of mulched leaves blowing out. I will try drilled exhaust holes another reviewer suggested. Also the handles hinder the seal so I might remove one.It was either the collector or another replacement bag. Third replacement bag had blown out the zipper nylon from its fabric at the bottom of the bag. Mulched 270 gallons so far... 300 gallons more to go. If I didn't have so many leaves I wouldn't waste my time or money. I have had to buy a replacement bag every two years from the wear and tear. If I can make this work for me it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"While the attachment is a neat accessory, it is not effective. It was difficult to keep the bag on the trash can without a second person.

Overall, very disappointed with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toro Leaf Blower Extension Hose - Use with Toro Leaf Collector","review":"It sucked - no pun intended. I connected to the Toro 'leaf barrel' (also purchased at Amazon) but the hose weight kept causing the expandable Toro recepticle to fall over. Wasted time & money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaf Collector","review":"I was hesitant to buy this product because of the very mixed reviews but thought I could rig the thing up to work OK. I was able to do it by using a rachet strap around the cloth adaptor that fits over the trash can so it wouldn't blow off. That part worked fine once I made various adjustments on it. The thing definitely does not work straight out of the box.My big complaint about it is that it is just too slow. If you have a large amount of leaves, it takes forever to pick them up. Also, large leaves don't pick up well and any leaves that are even a little bit damp don't pick up well. The damp leaves don't grind up well and don't compact down as well as dry leaves that break into very small piece.Overall I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaf collector is a waste of money","review":"I bought this leaf collector thinking that I can suck all the leaves on the lawn directly into an garbage can. I was wrong. This device is absolutely useless and poorly designed. It uses a string to attach to a receptacle which is the biggest problem of the design. The canvass cover will not stay on the gabage can during operation, and the whole apparatus is too cumbersome to lug around. I tried drilling holes in my gabage can to allow more air to escape. But it did not help that much. Don't waste your money. I actually prefer using the carrying bag that comes with Toro leaf blower as it is much more mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"not universal","review":"Maybe this works with a Toro blower and the Toro spring bucket, but with my Craftsman blower and normal plastic (and/or metal) garbage can it fails totally. I spent about an hour today trying to keep all the various parts together and ended up covered in leaf dust, with almost nothing in the garbage can. I really wanted this to work because I hate to empty the leaf bag - so much dust! I could not get the bag to stay on a garbage can, except for briefly once, and then the bag came off of the hose. The attachment to the blower is only slightly better than to the can or hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Incompetent design. My 15 year grandson could design better. There is nothing to hold the hose in the cloth bag - the elastic is NOTHING. It blows off. I had to put a hose clamp around it to keep it in.

If you are just vaccuuming small quantities of leaves, the stock bag included with the vac works fine.If you have larger quantities of leaves to pick up, this hose and bonnet accessory is the way to go. It works best with the optional collapsible Toro container because you get a good seal.My only criticism of the product is that a longer hose would be more convenient for working in areas where you can't get the container in close to the vac.That's why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro Leaf Collection System","review":"Get yourself a waste bin with a lockable lid and adopt it to take the pipe from the Toro - you have to make some additional holes around the lid to release the pressure, otherwise even a secure lid will be blown off - such is the pressure this machine generates. This will then work great with dry leaves - my adapted bin has wheels and I can move round my yard sucking up heaps of leaves. DON'T TRY WET LEAVES - THESE CLOG UP THE PIPE FROM THE MACHINE TO THE BIN. Overall with the adaption I've made this works well. Come on Toro - you could make some more money by building your own wheeled collection system."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much help.","review":"I have stopped using it because the bag explodes off the the collection bag.

The barrel cover is made of tightly woven material and does not breath. When in use the air is forced to blow out of the edges and with it goes half the leaf mulch that was sucked up. The cover should be made of a breathable canvas like the leaf bag that comes with the blower. I had to attach the canvas bag from my old blower to the end of the 8 ft hose to get any use out of it. Toro should tell their chinese producers to use a more breathable material for the barrel cover and send me one so I won't feel so ripped off. I'd return the whole thing but I do like the convenience of the hose. Bad purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great promise-whimpy product","review":"This product promised the perfect fit to my Toro blower/vacuum for shredding and collecting leaves. I found the leaf collector very lightly constructed with light weight materials and with design flaws that really surprised me regarding a Toro product. The 8 foot hose separated from the canvas cover the first time I used it and continues to an irritant. The straps and connection materials are poorly constructed as well.The biggest surprise for me was the fact that although I had a Toro blower this attachment did not fit the blower connection. Why would Toro design a Toro product that did not fit a Toro unit? I guess they feel you should buy a new blower unit at the same time. I do not use this unit anymore, it is easier to manually bag the leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea..Poor Construction","review":"The design team did not think this through. The hose continuously blows loose from the bag. A snap attachment on the inside of the bag would have solved this problem.

Right now it is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless for even slightly damp leaves","review":"Though this product works excellently on dry leaves, it clogs immediately when even slightly damp leaves are sucked up.

The biggest problem is that the \\"universal\\" attachment is just a velcro strap to tighten the connection but it doesn't actually work against the blowing force of the vacuum.

I tried some of the suggesstions such as tie around the hose--that did keep the hose on, I tried plastic trash can, and cloth leaf barrells and the top would blow off. I tried putting bungee cords around the leaf collecter to keep it snug, and that did not work. My rented yard is full of mature trees, and therefore leaves. Last Fall, I was not able to keep up with them. I hate yard work, and can not afford to pay someone else to do it. This product did not help--I think it is more work than using the bag to the leaf vacuum.

The old collector was still working with some duct tape an zip ties holding it together, but the blower had to be replaced and the connection was different. I use it to shred and collect leaves so they can be composted.The critical design change is the fabric: it doesn't let enough air through to relieve the pressure in the bin. This results in too much pressure in the bin, blowing the skirt off, and popping the hose out. It also results in lower velocity in the hose, less leaves sucked up, and a slower job when it works at all. It does contain more fine dust, but I was adept at positioning myself upwind of the dust so it didn't bother me.I'm looking to get my money back, both for the Blower Vacuum and the Leaf Collector, either from Amazon or Toro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a buck","review":"I bought the package including the Toro 51599 Ultra Electric Blower/Vacuum, this Toro 51500 Universal Leaf Collector with 8-Foot Hose and the Toro 29210 43-Gallon Gardening Spring Bucket.

First the collector would not stay on the Spring Bucket, then when I cinched it up tight enough to stay on, the plastic hose came loose from the Collector fabric shroud. There is nothing to keep it attached. I wound up using the Leaf Vac with the carry bag to successfully shred 34 bags (recyclable) over two days.

The bag gets pretty heavy when full, and the need to constantly detach it from the blower and then tilt the bag over a trash receptacle is tiring itself.

I found it easiest to temporarily install 4 bolts, two each in the inner holes of each end of the lathe bed, without lockwashers. Next I installed the outer 4 bolts with lockwashers. Finally, I removed and reinstalled the inner four bolts with lockwashers.

I have turned several pieces and am very pleased. It takes a little while to get used to keeping one handle on the tool rest from interfering with another but thats no biggy.

The stars are not \\"embroidered\\" and the stripes are not \\"sewn\\". They are just stamped on. you can see right through the flag it is so thin. I have bought cheap flags before (not from this seller) that were decent for the money. I'm flying one right now. This is not one of those flags.

As soon as I hung it on the wall, I noticed that (1) It is sewn crooked, and (2) the seams are on the wrong side. US regulations require that a flag hung vertically have the stars on the top left. If you were to hang this flag in such an orientation, the side that faces the viewer is similar to the inside of a shirt - the seams show and the overlaps of the stripes and Union blue are strikingly apparent. In addition to this, the flag is not a perfect rectangle; one side, when hung vertically, is noticeably shorter than the other, making the flag look crooked (as it is).This being said, it IS a $7 flag, so I guess you get what you pay for.

I began flying it sometime in Jan. of '11 on a 20' flag pole in front of my house in East Texas. I fly it 24/7 taking it down before storms and high winds when possible. The flag is now faded and began tearing and shredding about 2-3 weeks ago. Today, being a windy day, I took it down to find the stripes end of the flag torn and shredded for about a foot into the flag. Approximately 8 months of use is all that I received from this flag. If you are looking for a flag to fly most days of the year at your home or business, and will retain its deep color (the blue seemed to fade less than the red), this is NOT the flag for you.

His live concerts are wonderful, as well, with his stories, and wonderful style.This is a hard-hitting album, lyrically, that has the potential to offend some, and radically change, for the better, many's view of the Church, and what she was, is, and can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut to the heart","review":"I first discovered Derek Webb through his 2006 album Mockingbird when a friend sent me a link from Derek's website stating that the album was available for free download. I was impacted by the lyrics on this album and thought I would venture further into his catalogue upon the recommendation of a friend. I was not prepared to be cut to the heart as deeply as I am by this album. Derek's commentary on the church and his personal faith are poetic and impactful. His lyrics have made their way into both my worship and prayers. Buy this album if you are looking for some honest and raw thoughts on a church whose tendency is to turn away from her first love and the Lord's gracious response."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Webb's First Three Albums","review":"This is the best of the three \\"normal\\" albums Webb has created (not counting the little House album). It is devotional, worshipful, thoughtful, and poetically creative. It's a good buy if someone likes a folks/blues/pop fusion, with a little Bob Dylan flavor to it. I've heard this album got into some hot water for its repeated use of the word \\"whore\\" in one of the songs, but I can testify that it's use of that word is consistent with the Old Testament sources from which it came (such as Ezekiel and Jeremiah). In contrast, his second album (I See Things Upside Down) isn't as worshipful or musically creative; and the pacifistic political opinions expressed in his third album (Mockingbird) distract from the contents of an otherwise good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly? I was dissappointed.","review":"When I heard that Derek was coming out with a solo project I was looking for it because the songs he wrote and sung lead on in the Caedmon's Call albums were my favorite. However, the only song on this album that is really worth a must listen is \\"Wedding Dress\\". If you have a friend that has this album then borrow and listen to this song. It is painfully honest and it's simplicity musically adds to its poignancy. The other songs had some good lyrics but did not reach me lyrically or musically.

The first one lasted about three years. Three years of light use, maybe once a month for three months out of the year. Not a lot of landscape to trim. The first broke where the plug would plug into the cord. So I gave B&D the benefit of the doubt and bought the Hedgehog off of Amazon. This one lasted two years and broke today, simply just kept humming and did nothing else. Nothing was jammed in the cutting part. That one was use a total of 10 times. So I have come to the conclusion that B&D makes junk. Not only from these two products, but from toasters, a can opener and other items I have purchased that where B&D. I will never buy another B&D product. The quality has gone way downhill. Guess the company hopes the stuff lasts a year, so they don't have to honor their warranty.

The cord is a true pain especially if you have any significant distance to drag the cord. When I reach the end of the hedge trimming area I have extended over 200 feet of cord and that is a true pain. Why I have not bought a gas powered model is only because I am probably too cheap to do so. I am also waiting for this one to die so that I can justify spending $200 for a gas one. If, however, you are trimming a small area of hedges then this is just right. It is light and fairly well balanced. Please be careful when you are using it. It can cut you or the cord.

I had the trimmer jamming every 2 minutes on branches that were no larger then 1/2\\". The main reason I believe the trimmer was jamming is due to the blade design.

In \\"1,000 Years for Revenge\\" Peter Lance uncovers facts, connects events, and discloses a pattern of FBI behavior that together paves a glaring path to the tragedy of 9/11. His passionate presentation of material is captivating and frightening. But it is Lance's gift as a compelling storyteller that makes this book read like a best selling novel. Two real American heroes are the intimate human thread around which the story unfolds and gives this book heart. Further a glossy paged timeline in the middle of the book, provides a brilliant method of distinguishing all the players by identifying each with their picture, each time their name appears. For those readers not familiar with Middle Eastern names, like me, it is an easy way to grasp the continuity of the persons over time. We should all know this story and Peter Lance tells it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"1000 Years For Revenge","review":"Well written,well documented study of a series of events involving terrorist attacks on the US. Basically a study of how egos and poor attitudes crippled our ability to protect ourselves then and now. Clear examples of inter/intra agency missteps are given. This book should be a wake up call to agencies and individuals to change their focus . Getting the job done is more important than looking good. It also raises the question of how protected NY can be when drastic cuts are made to their Fire Deptartment and emergency services. It questions ,what exactly have we learned and what have we done to correct our vulnerabilities? It would be a tremendous tragedy if we have not learned from our mistakes after identifying them so clearly. It would be a shame if people got caught up in a political debate about this book as opposed to keeping the real issues in mind.

That is like not reading about the Nazis after WWII. We all need to be educated, and Lance's format draws even a casual reader spellbound into the Al Queda plot.

Polar mounting less adequate","review":"The mount is adequate for mounting an ETX scope in altitude-azimith mode, but a beefier mount is needed if one wants to use an ETX125 in polar mode for imaging. An annoyance I have experienced with the tripod is that the clips on the mounting bolts tend to slip off, especially in polar mode. Each of the two mountng bolts has a clip, washer and spring that can be difficult to find in the dark if the clip slipping causes them to shoot in a random direction. This tripod as sold is difficult to polar align. I bought a third party bolt to replace the rod that holds the tilt-plate to make adjusting the angle of the tilt plate easier. There is no easy way to adjust the azimuth of the scope in polar mode; one has to rotate the whole tripod. For most users, this is a great mount, but those planning to take long exposure photographs/images with their scope will be frustrated with this mount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't touch this media","review":"I bought the 25 pack and approx 2 out of every three discs ended in a write error.

Nevertheless, his apocalyptic vision has undoubtedly given rise to what, however his fans viewed it at the time, can be seen in retrospect as some of the most inspired and passionate performances of his career.This album sets Dylan's (continuing) \\"Christian period\\" music back into the context of the black gospel genre that helped to shape it, and whether or not you share Dylan's faith, there are some stirring performances here. Ironically, Dylan himself contributes the album's one silly moment in the hammed-up chatter that precedes his otherwise powerful duet with Mavis Staples.Among all the Dylan tributes on the market, this one stands out for the unity of its vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful idea and well sung, too!","review":"Kudos to Jeff Gaskill, who spent some years hatching this tribute to Dylan's born again music after being impressed by Dylan's concert presentation of the songs. I remember one of those incendiary shows and I'm happy to know others were as blown away as I was. He convinced a terrific list of gospel singers to record the tribute and even convinced the principal to add some icing to the cake. Happily, a majority of the touring band also has a hand in this tribute. Nice to hear Regina McCrary, who was such a big contributor to Dylan's gospel records and tours. Probably Shirley Caesar and Aaron Neville get my vote for best performances after the first couple listens, but the whole project and package are worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"My friends told me this was a great CD (I'll deal with them later!) so I was very eager to check it out.

The recordings are a representative sample of various periods in Brubeck's career, providing the listener with a diverse collection of complex, high-quality music. The tracks (particularly the newer recordings) have a full, rich sound, and the cd comes with an informative booklet that helped me know more about Brubeck and jazz in general.

I basically bought the unit for its portable size and smart design. It takes up little space on my nightstand or kitchen counter or out on the patio table and loading a disk is a snap. The radio tuner has good reception and it doesn't bother me that it isn't digital. However, I do wish it was a stereo unit. Its compact size, I don't think, would suffer terribly if another speaker were attached on the other side. The outlet for the detachable electrical cord is recessed and unobtrusive.

Unfortunately, the CD player portion stopped functioning. It's been 14 months and the warranty is only for 12 months.

So far is is working perfectly and a great size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I bought 6 of these for work. I wanted something that was on the smaller side and could be easily operated by people of all generations. This CD player hit the mark. It's great. It's small, plays loud enough, easy to operate. If you are looking for a sound system this is not it. This is just a CD player for occasional use. I really don't think it would keep up with lots of use, but it is good for light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"It didn't take long for the radio on this to conk out. It takes a lot of fiddling with the volume to get rid of the static. I use it mainly to play CDs for my toddler for sleeping, and that works OK. But I wanted to be able to switch to the radio during the day sometimes, and now wish I'd just gone with a higher-end iPod player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than 3 months & company was useless","review":"I bought this to play CDs for my baby to help him get to sleep at night. The sound wasn't bad. It wasn't expensive. The radio still works. But the CD player spins once and says error. It died less than 3 months after I bought it. When I contacted Emerson they said they would fix it but I had to mail it back at my own expense. To do that or even drive it back to the store where I got it would cost almost as much as the machine! Save yourself some money, don't buy this machine. There are cheaper and lighter radios out there if you just want a radio instead of a broken CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after only 3 months","review":"This machine often gave us error messages when playing a cd (the cd played fine in other machines) and sometimes would just spin the cd without any sound. After only 3 months it is totally broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that portable","review":"Everything about this radio/cd player is ok, except that it uses 6 C batteries if you don't have it plugged in and they don't last very long. The C batteries are huge and expensive and this cd player goes through them very quickly. This means that it's not very useful as a portable music player. If you want to use this as a portable stereo or if you plan on giving it as a gift, you should stock up on batteries and/or make sure to include a supply of them with your gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old fashioned product","review":"I needed a CD player that was solid and substantial and had a good radio with a reliable speaker that was loud enough for a group of people.

I like the look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage","review":"This worked well for a few months. Then I started having trouble getting the radio to play. You had to keep jiggling the bar that switched from AM to FM. The CD player still worked okay. Soon the radio wouldn't play at all and this was quickly followed by a failure of the CD player. It became, literally, garbage as I threw it out with the trash. I would give this zero stars if I could.A short while after I trashed mine, I noticed the same radio on a coworkers desk. She told me that hers no longer worked either. So mine was not a random incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compact radio","review":"I purchased this Emerson radio almost a month ago for my kitchen.

The sound is decent but it would have nicer if it were in stereo,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"I'm a little surprised by how awful this CD player is. Granted, it's cheap, but this is ridiculous. From day one, the sound quality on this unit was pretty mediocre. We heard some noise while playing a CD, and the sound was rather tinny. These problems progressed steadily. In the few months that we've owned it, it's become so bad that we now need to purchase another unit.Somehow, the speakers managed to blow out despite the fact that the ONLY thing we have ever played on this unit is a CD of lullabies. We use it every night for about 10 minutes to put our toddler to bed. This nightly 10 minutes of lullaby playing on LOW volume proved to be far too much for this unit to handle.Put your money toward something better. This thing is less than useless--it's now destined to rot in a landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compact, but not functional","review":"This one did not work right out of the box for me. The radio was functional, but the CD player was completely non-functional. It would give a weak spin, then give up. Obviously, you might be lucky and get a version that works, but it says something about the workmanship.The unit is light and compact and runs off battery or extension cord, which is nice, though it takes a ton of large batteries. The radio is analog, and it didn't seem to pick up great signal when I was running it in my kitchen despite having the antenna fully extended. I think the analog dial would be a little annoying in this day and age. The unit cheap and plastic-y looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"cd player does not work","review":"I purchased this radio/cd player as a Christmas Gift... The CD player no longer works and there does not seem to be any way to return it now without penalties as I bought it in November, but it was not ever used until January.....

HORRIBLE quality over time","review":"OK, I confess. We were burned the first time and we bought another one.Why? Because it matched the decor of the bathroom we use it in (bathtime for kids).The first one completely died after very little use. The second one is also barely used and we have to hit the CD buttons over and over to get them work.The sound is fine, the size is great and the radio works ok for what it is...but the CD player is tempermental and we're just waiting for it to completely die again. It's already showing signs.BTW, we bought it both times at Kmart for about five bucks less both times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"We use this unit for the CD player only. Haven't had any problems in 6 months. We haven't quite figured out how to \\"loop\\" the playing yet, if that is possible. A little bit heavy but good sound. Would recommend since there aren't too many units like this that do not require headsets for portable listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"Ever hear that expression? Ever wonder why you pay no attention to it when you're shopping?This unit is a piece of crap. First the volume dial broke, so I manually took it apart and glued it back on...otherwise the unit would be impossible to use. Now the antenna has broken.Pony up a few more bucks and get a good name brand...trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space saver--but that's about it.","review":"This player is a great space saver but the CD player is very fickle and won't play certain CDs one day and the next it will. This is very frustrating when my son wants to hear a specific CD and it won't work that day. The volume dial also gets stuck sometimes and won't turn down. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product","review":"I would not recommend this product or any other Emerson product. I bought this for my baby boy to play CD's when he sleeps. I bought it when he was almost a year old and he is now 2 1/2 and the CD player has stopped working. I contacted Emerson about this and I was told because the warranty has expired there is nothing they can do. A product like this should not stop working after 1 1/2 years. I was very disappointed with this product and the response from the company that I will never purchase a Emerson product again. A company needs to stand behind their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"High price for what you get.","review":"We purchased this last year for our outside deck, The reception is weak at best for both AM and FM. We live in Boston with many great radio stations that have strong reception but this radio can't pull them in. If you don't mind retuning every 5 minutes buy it. If not get something else, I believe this price reflects the name but in this case not the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Do not waste your money on this. Within only 3 days the cd player no longer worked. After 5 days the speakers were shot.

A total waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable Radio/CD player","review":"The only thing I didn't like about the radio is there is no place to store the electric cord.

I wanted basic, but this was rediculous ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Please save your money and get a CD player that actually works. I was enticed by the slim look of this player, but it is a lemon. The CDs had to be re-inserted over and over- they actually fell forward! then, when they stayed in place, they skipped, and ONLY in this player. Also the plug kept falling out of the back! But even with batteries, the dreaded skipping continued. If you need to save space, get one of the little round players where the CD rests horizontally- it may be a little wider, but at least it will play! I wish they had a negative star option, I'd give this a negative 5, as it now rests in a recycling yard somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Review","review":"Although the product didn't work when we got it.

Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible player didn't last long","review":"I purchased this CD player about a year ago. It worked for a short time but now, with VERY low usage, it is practically useless. The volume knob will not allow fine adjustment - it goes to either really loud or really quiet. And the sounds shorts out completely while adjusting the knob. Sometimes while I'm in the middle of listening to the player, things will suddenly get very quiet. And then they will get loud again when I touch the volume knob or tap it a few times. I guess it's okay if you want to listen to the radio, but other than that it's not at all recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it","review":"I bought this for the CD player. Unfortunately, the CDs skip. It's not my CDs since they work just fine on the Walkman. It was disappointing and a hassle to have to return it. Maybe it's too low end for anything but the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"This little machine only cost me about $25, so it did just what I expected it would do for that price. I took it to the beach with me and it worked perfectly when playing CDs and the radio. I got good reception from the stations. While it doesn't get as loud as I would have liked, the sound at lower volumes was good and pretty clear. However, when on maximum volume, the sound was kind of muddy. Also, when playing CDs, the player was kind of sensitive. The CDs tended to skip with minor movement of the player. It runs on AC, which has a decent length of cord, or 6 size C batteries. I put in 6 fresh batteries (Energizer) and after 4 hours of CD playing and 4 hours of the radio, the batteries were still going strong.If you're looking for something small, lightweight, and just enough sound for a small room, bedroom, or the beach or something, then this should work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD Player!","review":"I bought this CD Player for my 19yr old son who drives a 1967 Ford Ranchero with no working radio.

Oh, well, I should have spent more money for a higher quality product made in a place other than China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"Giving this 5 stars as it was the best $12 I ever spent (I notice the price has gone up)!

It displays two dashes on the lcd display and will not even spin up the disk anymore. For the almost half hour it worked, I was very pleased (although, I also noticed it doesn't have a \\"shuffle\\" function, which most modern CD players do), but this thing is going back to amazon TODAY and I will stick with more reliable brands in the future.

Calling into the picture wackos either Left or Right to mock and dismiss is just plain lazy, which is my main issue here. Additionally the slant towards justification for ignoring climate change and pandering to that particular brand of ignorance is more than distasteful, it's borderline immoral.

My favorite tracks are:~Just About You~ 6/5 (My favorite on the album;he should do more R-n-B ballads because they fit his voice!~Couldn't Care Less~ 6/5 (My second favorite...nice pop ballad; I'm a sucker for the ballads!~Superman~ 4/5 (Another decent pop ballad!)~Get Ready 4/5 (Uptempo club joint)~Never Change Me 4/5 (Uptempo club beat)~Shook 4/5 (Hit single/decent beat/catchy hook)If you like any of the artists that I mentioned earlier, then you should definitely give this cd a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This cd is weak, after reading these reviews i thought i would receive an amazing album.

Can I even imagine what a Shawn Desmond fan would look like? Nave 15 year old girl, going through a brief, choreographed dance stepping, bad boy phase?Poorly masquerading as a slick R & B crooner, he puts face to the universal, early 20's, High School cruising, suburban dance club Nancy-boy; another racially confused and culturally alienated white kid.

All the extra gear and the hard shell plastic case are fine. My only complaint is that you have to manually turn the nob to change the lazer's location. When your target is over, say, ten feet from the level, and/or the target is some angle other than perpendicular to the level, it is difficult to land on a specific vertical target- for example the edge of a 2x stud. With a hand held remote, you can stop percisely on your target- that's nice. The only question in my mind, is a remote worth the extra hunderds of dollars it costs? For the money, I'm happy with the Stabila 4100- I just make sure I use it BEFORE coffee break."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I bought this level based on the reviews that I read here. BIG mistake. This thing is a piece of crap. The level I got had the batteries already installed, that sent up a red flag right there. Next the thing sounded like it was grinding glass. It didn't spin at the appropriate speeds and the laser line hit at a different spot every time it rotated. I just learned a valuable lesson...trust your gut. I thought buy the Porsche, not the VW. Boy was I right. If your not getting a self leveling laser your still framing with a hammer and not a nail gun. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tunnel Trance Release","review":"This will probably have to be one of the best in this series. Most of the songs are mixed perfectly and has no real errors in it. But there is some songs which really doesn't belong in this Mix. To those who don't know what DJ Networx is: This is one of the finest mixes in EURO-Trance and has a combilation with some of the best remixes of new and popular songs.

The pictures alone are worth the price of this book. The entire book, including all text, is laid out amongst glossy color photos. Some pictures are common among Sublime fan web sites, but many are rare and never seen before. The interviews are very casual, which makes it very easy to become absorbed by the book. What a brilliant man, what a loss to society. I have a friend who is having many problems with the same drug that took Brad's life. This book has really helped me deal with the thought of loosing a close friend. A must read for all Sublime fans. A good read for anyone who wants to better understand the hardships of drug abuse. Either way, you won't be able to put this book down!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely formatted for Kindle, very readable","review":"A nicely-formatted version of Richard II.

Little evidence of the undoubted charisma Wesley must have possessed. There were some silly scenes with very amateur minor character performances, and the film frankly failed to engage me at any point. Clearly we must continue to await a film which does justice to a fascinating and passionate subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much exposure","review":"The story spends much time showing wesley discovering what it means to put his faith in Christ. But what puzzles me is why the film shows so much of his girlfriends chest with a low cut dress. The film seems to be a college made film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This story would have been excellent, if it hadn't been for the way his girl friend was dressed in the first part of the movie. The first part of the movie focused way too much time on the girl he almost married. She wore the same dress most of that time, which was so low cut, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Too bad, because the last half of the movie was excellent, showing how Weley's life was turned around after he'd gotten saved. After this experience, his works were done because he was saved, and not for the sake of gaining salvation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good movie but could have been better","review":"A good movie but it left out some very important milestones in the life of Mr. Wesley. Far too much time wasted describing his relationship with Sophie Hopkey while other important relationships were neglected. No mention made of his marriage. Mr. Wesley was 5'3\\" tall & weighed 128 lbs. The actor portraying him was a tall, solid built man who towered over others in the film. Unrealistic. Barely touched on the far reaching changes his ministry had on eighteenth century England & on the establishment of the Methodist Church in the U.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"More","review":"This was a good movie. I would have like to seen more.... maybe a sequel. I especially would have like to seen more about how Methodism developed. Wesley had a unique vision for the church and community and I would have like to have seen more on the Methodist societies, use of lay people in ministry, and how women contributed to the church in Wesley's day - including his mother's influence on women in Methodism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wesley is well worth watching!","review":"OVERALL I FOUND THIS VIDEO TO BE INSPIRING! It is a thoughtful and educational film, sensitively and skilfully portrayed by the lead characters. If you find it a bit slow-moving at first, stay tuned--it picks up and keeps moving until the end. A must for those interested in the Wesleys, the history of the Church of England, how the Methodist church was started, and for anyone who is struggling with the way of salvation in the Christian faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Strangely Warmed","review":"I really enjoyed this movie on John Wesley and I showed it to a Fellowship Hall full of Methodist people. They loved it too. While a low budget film, it had all the \\"feel\\" of Hollywood blockbuster. Wesley only covered the life of Wesley through mid-life and stopped short of the Methodist movement in America. Some people were disappointed with that. All in all, the movie did a good job portraying John Wesley and his heart being strangely warmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, moving, especially for low-budget","review":"Ultimately, the movie is not of equal caliber with multi-million dollar main-stream projects that Hollywood produces, but it IS a great, moving film that brings history to life.This is a low-budget period piece based on the life of John Wesley. It is remarkably well made given the small budget and the challenge of removing all traces of modernity.The first half of the film focuses on humanizing Wesley. Wesley never married, but we see his struggles between living solely for God and his attraction to the woman he loves. Some may disapprove of this character, as her dresses reflect the low-cut fashion of the period.The remainder of the film focuses on Wesley's redemption and the rise of his ministry, which is much easier to appreciate, having gotten to understand him as a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves the toy","review":"My son loved the toy he really liked.

It is strange, however, that as a whole they combine to create one of the best CDs I own (out of a collection of 100+).

This item is poorly designed.Designers at I agree with the above review. This item is poorly designed. Designers at Maclaren probably never placed a baby in this rocker.

I cut a few cuts, measured them with my combo-square protractor and they were 43 degrees, or 47+ degrees depending on the slot you used. Even the 90 was off about 1.5 degrees. Then I put a t-square to the miter box and it was clearly off about an eighth of and inch from the top of the slot to the bottom.

Check out this book and enjoy the tale of an teenage girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst in the Series","review":"Of all the books in the series, this was the only one that I bought (rather than borrow), and it was the most disappointing. To me, it was a bit unrealistic and I don't think it sent the right message. Don't get me wrong, I like Moore's writing, but this one i didn't agree with- for instance, the way Payton tried to start preaching to that guy after his brother died (i don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read it.) I don't believe we should be preaching to people like that especially when they are upset. Don't ge me wrong, we should share our faith, but not like that- that get's on people's nerves. The best way to witness to people is by our actions- not preaching to them all the time. So in conclusion I say if you want to know what happens to Payton to end the series, read it.

It also have this load position, where if you press the lever, it doesn't fire, but it also doesn't fall out. Good for display storage. However, there doesn't seem to be much movement in this model. The outter shell might have something to do with it. They could have done something better witht the feet.It actually comes with the watch-cell batteries it needs, so that's a bonus.

Blogs have a huge potential for making companies look human and help sell products.The book is very 'straight from the heart'. You can see that all over the place :).

It includes plenty of case studies of good and bad blog behaviour. For those who have been blogging for a while there are still a few insights to be learned here (at least for me anyway). For those just starting to think about how blogs may work in a business context, this is a great read.There were a couple of 'opinions' that I may have disagreed with (which I will blog about) but the book does a great job of pushing you to think about appropriate blogging behaviour and the risks associated with NOT blogging.Great work, will be required reading for my marketing class at Delaware."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Should Read","review":"Naked Conversations breaks down the steps that need to be taken to have an outstand blog in today's over saturated blogs and websites.

If you want to know that you are not alone and that you can heal, this is a very valuable book. But a book alone can't do it all - professional and personal support are also really necessary.

I don't address these ideas to those who have always had memories of their abuse, however:Any book that encourages people to believe they were abused with absolutely no concrete evidence is DESTRUCTIVE. Any book that encourages people to get as angry as they possibly can, as sad as they possibly can, and let their abuse define them and take their lives over is destructive.

Accuse dear old dad and he did not do it? Now your family REALLY loves you!

If you listen to it through your TV then may be you don't mind or probably the music will sound good. On the other hand if you listen through high quality stereo then you will hear the boominess.P.S.

The others on Ebay were vintage. I found the Amazon price of $199 quite reasonable, as the size tureen that I purchased sells at retail stores for $370.

Your writing lists of instructions so that the processor will interface with other onboard devices and hardware and execute ALU operations. I don't believe the author was meaning that you are to change the hardware.2. I'm not familiar with the AMD MPU but am skeptical of the video control issue. Depending on the architecture of an MPU it could act like a video card.3. If an MPU can execute most of its intruction at reduce bus cycles (translating to reduced clock time) yes it will process faster.If there is anyone out there that can provide a fair review of this book and point out why I should buy the book besides the manufactorers user manual I would be very interested in reading it.MikeElectrical Engineer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, especially the flex-tube functionality.","review":"Haven't used it long enough to confirm reports of short longevity or the motor brushes wearing out. But I can say that I am completely satisfied with the functionality of the flex-tube. I am a bigger guy but still use the unit with the shoulder strap and direct the air with the flex-tube which has a real nice joy-stick style handle.Two very minor points to be aware of and which made me give it 4 instead of 5 stars:1) The unit is kind of \\"bubbly\\" looking so hanging it on the wall in the garage was a bit awkward until I got a proper wall hook.2) It could use more power.

B & D electric trimmer gave up the ghost last week, so I decided to replace it today with a newer model. The HT2200 is much lighter than my previous trimmer, which was great news. It also easily cut through my evergreens and magnolia bush. So far, so good. Next, the bad news: as soon as I moved over to my rather large arborvitae (about 8 feet tall), the extension cord came out of the unit about every other swipe. I tried switching extension cords, thinking that perhaps the connector on my cord was faulty. Apparently that wasn't the problem, though, because the second cord popped out even more than the first. Talk about annoying! Fortunately, my tots were out in the yard with me so it kept my frustration from becoming audibly offensive ;). However, I fully plan to take this unit back to Home Depot tomorrow because I can't deal with aggravation of having the cord fall out every 10 seconds (literally)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I purchased this unit based on price...it seemed like a good value.In the past I had always borrowed my friends professional gas trimmers but I kept my expectations in check as this unit is 1/10 the price.

If you aren't into ragga jungle and/or like artists like L.T.J Bukem and that light drum n bass sound, chances are you will find this mix a little aggressive and grating. Ton's of well programmed time stretched Amen breaks and hardcore ragga vocals. All three mixes are excellent. I really like how Wagon Christ and Plug (both aliases of Luke Vibert) make an appearance on the final track. I would have liked more detailed info of when one song ends and another begins to find out who exactly I am hearing in a given mix. A great CD.

Its subject is sex and violence, and not believably rendered, either. Plot development is piecemeal, character description is barely enough to form a consistent mental picture, and its themes are a series of clichés alternating with pop-schlock movie images and highly questionable pseudo-psychological insights, such as, if you let a big guy beat the crap out of you, it will make him cry. (I'm sure if the author could track me down, he'd make my head explode, pick my broken teeth out of the flesh of his knee, and end up completely covered with my blood...all except for the whites of his eyes.)On the other hand, from reading the other reviews here on Amazon it becomes clear that this is a novel written for male adolescents, and that they like it just fine. So who am I to say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is what I'm talking about!","review":"Mick Foley's first foray outside the wrestling arena,sort of, grabs hold of the reader and keeps him interested in the plot development all the way through till the very last sentence. Even though the protagonist of the story is a teenager who is fighting to survive in a world he never made along with his more than slightly eccentric pater, it is a book that will relate to anyone from age 15-99. Foley puts an intense passion into his character that makes you believe he was actually a member of Tietam's life viewing events first hand.

I'm not from Hollywood, so I didn't know who he was talking about, if anyone.I would recommend other books over this one - \\"Mr. S\\" by George Jacobs (a book about Frank Sinatra and friends), and I plan to read the Eszterhas book \\"Hollywood Animal,\\" that just hit the book stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banner waving","review":"This is a very deceptive book prefaced as though objective it is clearly a parade down main street for the contributing writers, proclaiming their theories to be right and all opposing theories to be wrong. I would have preferred more facts.The arguments made against archaeologists such as Gimbutas by others in this field with opposing views, work equally well when turned back upon the contributing authors of this book. A theory is a theory and speculation is speculation. Not being able to prove something makes the argument weaker and less impressive, yes, but it does not equate to error or fabrication. There is nothing in this book that disproves the theories of Gimbutas and others like her.

The lid is larger than the opening of the actual bag, which i find useful. It covers the whole opening to reduce fallout and provides a tab that you can lift up to get into the bag.My qualm lies in the fact that it renders my back passenger's seat useless for passengers, as there's a bag of trash right at face level. I unclip it and move it when i have people back there, but since it's tapered at the bottom, it doesn't stand up when i move it to the floor.Overall though, i'm very happy.

Even my co-worker sitting next to me upon hearing the first few tracks verbalized my thoughts on this recording. Coincidence? I don't think so. It sounds more like Stanley recorded this out of obligation to his fans(and perhaps his record company?) rather than being genuinely inspired to make music. Nothing sticks out on this record in my opinion. Truth is this record fairly reeks of smooth jazzism and bedroom music, something I'm sure old school Stanley fans would find disdainful. No edge, no excitement, and no grit. And that's about it folks.

Many of the songs have a certain \\"fullness\\" with strings that perhaps I just never noticed before.1, 2 is really cool, \\"Where is the Love\\" is well done (although I didn't care much for the female vocals) \\"Anna\\" (She loves the good life) is so AWESOME I can't stop playing this one, \\"Bout the Bass\\" is the show, so you know in certain terms that he's still the man.

I suppose what I've heard represents the best of various CDs. I bought this CD expecting a similar compilation but was disappointed. To my ears, the music on the first CD sounds like Indian versions of American movie music of the 1960's (not my cup of tea). The second CD is more contemporary, but I didn't discover any \\"gems\\" among the tracks. That's my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design--chews branches off","review":"I am a retired quality control manager and impatient with tools that don't work. I returned this hedge trimmer after using it one half hour to cut tender new growth less than 1/8 inch diameter. As you sweep the trimmer bar across the hedge, the branches bend while the blade chews away at them. Many looked like they were torn off. It's bad for the hedge and hard work as you have to go back over and over the same place.I gritted my teeth and bought a Little Wonder 19 inch elecric hedge trimmer that cost three times as much, but it is a joy to use--the branches fall away, cut cleanly."},{"rating":"1","title":"HS 1010 Hedge Hog","review":"I agree with two out of three of the other reviews. The Hedge hog runs smooth, but does not cut small growth. It just smashes them, and leaves the stem hanging on the bush. This is probably due to the very short (1/8\\") cutting blades. I don't like to be negative, but just wanted to alert others to this problem. I bought a Black&Decker HT-2000 with the old fashioned large blades, and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker Hedge Hog HS1010","review":"This double action hedge trimmer is no better than one I bought 20 years ago. (And Quit using after half a season). The reason for the displeasure is that it does not cut the branches off cleanly, it chews or nibbles at them until some of them fall off. As with all their other models the blade moves much too fast. The double action models only add to the problem.Last summer I used a German manufactured hedge trimmer that operated much slower. It had llolypop shaped tines that actually held the branches forcing them into the blades rather than away. This trimmer worked with ease and cut branches of all sizes on hedges and various types of bushes and ornamental trees. Unfortunately this unit was a European model that operated on 220 volts and they do not manufacture a 110 volt model for export."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good first impression","review":"I had never owned or used a hedge trimmer before. My first try with this tool was on a 30' line of 5' tall boxwoods which had grown unhindered for at least five years. After a short time of getting accustomed to it, I found the trimmer easy to use, though had to be always careful about keeping the cord away from the cutters. It was light enough and strong enough to do this medium-duty job well in about 2 hours. I'm glad that I did not get one with a shorter blade, and glad I got the dual action type. Only quibbles so far are that it seemed rather loud (however, no previous experience for comparison), and it was too easy to accidentally switch off because when holding it I could not avoid having a finger right over the trigger. Still, overall I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"It chews the branches off!!","review":"I have to agree with the other ratings for the Hedge Hog, it does chew the branches off of the bushes.

A 50 cent piece of plastic would fix that. Even after someone telling me about it, I forgot. When it stopped all of a sudden, the only thing I could think of was that I had tripped a fuse. I went downstairs, but none were tripped. Then I remembered about the cord. It had moved out only about a half inch, so it did not look unplugged. Probably had to re-insert it 20 times during a one hour trimming session. That is my only complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have paid attention to reviews before purchasing!","review":"Cuts (really doesn't cut) rather chews off the shrubs and leaves a brown stem sticking out of what has been cut.

With tracks like \\"Drink You Away\\", \\"Country Girl\\", and the Hank Williams Jr. based \\"Tradition\\", you find a good mix of both rap and honky-tonk. On \\"Mexico Rain\\" and \\"Another Ex\\", he shows off both his rap skills, and his sensitive side. And the rest of the tracks are just good old fashion rap, even with some touches of rock-rap.

Essential concepts and techniques are explained clearly without talking down to the reader. There's thorough coverage of the most commonly used T-SQL elements, in an easy-to-read style. It's well organized and includes appendices and a good index, making it easy to use as a reference. I work with both SQL Server 2000 and 2005, so it's ideal that the book covers both environments.There are tons of code samples; most of them use the AdventureWorks database so reproducing them is easy. The exercises at the end of each chapter are good practice - not too difficult, but still good at reinforcing the content (answers are in the back of the book). Parts of my work involve reporting, so I found the chapter on doing Reporting Services development helpful as well. The biggest drawback I've found to this book is that my copy keeps getting borrowed.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not cover the important new features","review":"I bought the book, based on previous positive critics here (Amazon). The implication was that this book covers the new features of SQL Server 2005. Well, the first one that I was looking for, the PIVOT (crosstab) is not even mentioned, let alone covered even briefly. I did not search all the new features, but if you want a book that cover both old and new features, this one is certainly NOT the one that you should look for.The publisher rep tried to tell me that no one book could cover all subjects. This is true, but for a book that specialize in T-SQL and T-SQL only, the features should have been covered, or, at least mentioned briefly.I've found books that cover the new features only, or the old features only.

In fact, its downright boring. Arthur C Clarke should sue the makers of this movie for playing on the title of 2001.

Right from the start from the poor send up of Dirty Harry sending his car through the store window to the end this is not funny.This ground is not new having already been covered by the excellent Spaceballs, but this pales in comparison.Some of the tricks of Spaceballs are apparent as there are representatives of different movie life-forms among the aliens.Try as I might I cannot find anything positive to say about this movie. Leslie Nielson does not need the damage to his reputation.On the front cover the blurb says 'the most outer spaced-out comedy ever'. Clearly the author of that remark is spaced out on something and is not an astronaut.The only good thing about this movie is that it leads one to revisit Nielson's past glories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Travesty is right. This is one of those movies that tries so hard to be funny that it becomes terrible. It could have been so much better if the writers had done anything right.Leslie Nielsen stars in this, but he is hampered by both bad writing and an awful supporting cast. Both throw his comic timing off, which makes it impossible for him to showcase his talents. Everything in this is lame, from the plot to the acting to the special effects.

There is absolutely nothing about the first half of this movie to recommend. It failed to make me laugh even once. It even failed to coax a smile out of me.

Even the references to Star Wars and Star Trek do nothing for this film and just falls on deaf ears.Judging from the name and box art, you'd think that this would be a space adventure but it's not. The best part of the film is when they are in space and meeting aliens, but even that's still mediocre. When Nielsen returns to Earth, which is surprisingly fast, it goes downhill from there.This entire film just misses it's mark big time and just comes out horrible, and this is coming from a fan of Leslie Nielsen. Not worth buying, barely worth watching. Horrible film, but Leslie Nielsen fans can endure just to see him"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"i'm not sure exactly what has been happening to leslie neilsen lately. it's hard to imagine that his taste has become so poor, but it's even harder to imagine he made a movie like this for the 'art.' the comedy here is juvenile even for one of his movies. everything just sort of seems flopped together without any real concern for making a coherent parody. the acting is poor as well. bombs like this make me long for the days of 'the naked gun' or even 'spy hard' for that matter. hopefully he'll get out of this rut and give us something better the next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"All time low...","review":"I had always thought I would never in my lifetime see a worse movie made than Batman and Robin, well this movie proved me wrong.

In the midst of an armageddon, the shopping malls remained unlocked? And, who buried the last of the dead bodies? The simplicity of virtual within virtualness is so weak. This story is like a cheap sci-fi movie, no, I take that back. I cannot credit this story to any of those 'classics'!

The way that Idlewild is structured has quite a bit in common with some of the better thriller films out there.The story of Halloween and his friends in their virtual school is inventive, fast-paced and occasionally moving. The characters are believably written, and the dialogue snappy. The great good-natured fun of it all allowed me to forgive a few of the more obvious plot holes that might have otherwise distracted from the ride.Do not expect something at the level of the more complex cyberpunk writers like Gibson or Sterling.

We don't usually share the same tastes (I'm a huge mystery/thriller fan), so I acted happier about getting it than I actually was. But she promised I'd love it, and sure enough she was right!Nick Sagan's debut novel is a literary gem and a true genrebuster. Not only did I find the plot smart and compelling and the characters well-drawn, but the writing itself is crisp and moving. The mystery keeps you guessing, but it raises deeper questions too, the kind that rise far above the average whodunit.I sped through this page turner in three days and now can't wait for the sequel. If all science fiction books read like this one, I'd be a major fan of the genre.Idlewild is powerful fiction, read and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Approach with Skepticism","review":"This has everything going for it except the story itself. The jacket blurbs, cover art and author bio (I'll ignore his lineage, that really is unfair for a freshman effort) all point to an excellent, mysterious, thought-provoking story but instead you get a choppy, ill-paced, fairly flat plot.There are a few intriguing ideas in here but the thinly veiled \\"twist\\" is actually more distracting than it is enthralling since the more read science fiction reader will have figured it out halfway through the book. Key points in the character's development are given very poor treatment, resorting to self-absorbed inner monologues and very static emotions. The ending feels rushed, as if Sagan realized nothing could save this story.A young reader or someone fairly new to the genre might enjoy this but anyone else will most likely leave feeling at best unfulfilled or at worst angry at the time wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Imaginative Mind Candy","review":"Creative writing with rich perceptively visual landscapes.

The TMobile warranty does cover the buttons and sound quality, but not the screen in the 1 year warranty. TMobile is the manufacturer and the service provider. When I got the phone back from their service facility untouched, all they can say is \\"I'm sorry, I understand,\\" but your only solution is to have bought insurance in the first 7-14 days or else its too late and you will have to buy another device full price.

I'm in Boston and have no problem with a signal from T-Mobile. I do wish the built in camera was at least 1.3 mega pixel but the pictures are not too bad. I have shot some real good ones if the lighting is good and you're not too far away.

Yes the phone is bulky, this could be a problem to some who don't like bigger phones, so check one out in person before you buy.I must also say that the internet is not that fast on this phone, but again as I have told many people it's not a PC.

Another thing is the battery, The battery is located inside the phone so if your battery breaks you have to send it to T-mobile to fix it and it takes Around two weeks to fix and the insurence plan I pay for doesn't cover the battery. It cost me like $200. The service is just straight out bad I don't get service practicly any where.Please people don't bother reading the Teenagers reviews because they just use the aol instent messagenger they don't even care for anything else on the phone.I suggest you save your money and if you want a pda cell phone go for the palm treo's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Phone , Bad Coverage","review":"The Sidekick II phone is amazing, it's like a mini laptop.

The customer has to go to a UPS Store with an order number and send the Sidekick in. It will take 10 days to return, 5 to 10 days to repair, and 10 days to get back to us. They don't give you a loaner Sidekick either. Very bad customer service, and low quality phone. Still waiting to get it back, I hope they fix it.

As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny.

I don't know what this company is doing when it comes to parceling out these bugs, but they need to find a new method.As for what the bugs did after they were released, well that isn't the company's fault.

They nested all over the roof of the greenhouse and a month later there are still quite a few there. The flaps have been opened nearly the whole time since that first night they just prefer it there. Needless to say they're doing their job:) The ones I released on the raspberries outside didn't stay nearly as long though I haven't seen any pests on them since.

Good thing I followed up because this was a project for school. They get them from a 3rd party so be careful~ Try and find a company who sends them direct! There are a few.... if you Google Live Ladybugs a bunch come up. The only thing that stinks is that the over night shipping will cost you so much money. I paid $6.50 for the bugs and $32 for the over night shipping!! It was well worth it though! They came the next day and all were alive. If you need these by a certain date pay the extra money.

I thought this would be a great experience for their classmates as my kids have loved doing this for the past few years. The kids were quite bothered my the fact that over half of the ladybugs in each bag was dead.

Second, the type is small, my wife saw that right away. Thirdly, he uses a wide border from text to page, so that I have to yank and pull and stretch the book wide open in order to see the text towards the binding. It's nuts!

If you want to buy GRAND THEFT AUTO 3, just buy it; dont buy Xbox's lame version. Wrecklass is great looking, thats what sold me; but the game itself is way too coached and the story is weak. I was greatly disapointed with this game, I just hope Xbox comes out with better games in the future. Otherwise I will consider my Xbox to be the worlds most expensive paper weight.Wrecklass will be yet another Xbox game that I will end up trading in for hardly nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of [money]","review":"Flat out waste.

Its a damn kids game. When you look at a title named \\"Wreckless\\" you think of a game that would forsurly show car damage right? All it shows is some dull blurs on your car. The realism gives you the feeling of your kids gameboy or something? I mean, when you crash doing 50mph you would think a part of your car might be damged but in this game, NOT! Dont waste your money. Burnout 2 would be a better pick, christ for that matter a slinky would give you more amusement than this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets see.... it looks good","review":"Well, it looks good, but that's about it. After reading all the hype about this game, I bought it the first time I saw it at the store. I got home and played it for about an hour and have not played it since. It's very repetitive. What's the fun in just smashing into stuff? All the missions are timed so you can't even explore the city. The vehicles are not the easiest to control either. I guess I was hoping for something along the lines of GTA3. All I can say is rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"good potential but rather poor","review":"this game isn't all its cracked up to be. Halo is a god of a game, so is JSRF, but this....well, its playstation quality.

Thiis game has some of the best graphics ever, but worst sound, and gameplay. The Controls are ok, but what mainly got this game a one, was that you can't play the song on the x-box harddrive with this game and there is no 2 player mode. The missions are sometimes ridiculously hard to beat, trust me. If you have already bought this game, either return it or sell it to amazon.com.

Its not for serious car game lovers, this is a light-hearted fun game. The control are good for a game like this and the CG movies are *ok* at best, but its definetely a lot of fun too play (but it does get repetitive)... and its okay for kids too since you can't run over people and there are no guns -- yes even without guns, its still a fun game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome racer","review":"This is a fast pace game, that builds on your experience.

You not only don't care about the damage you're dishing out, you're looking forward to the next big object you can take down just so you can see what it will look like. The outstanding graphics and lighting are the kind of features we've been waiting for on the Xbox. It looks like something fresh, something that could only be done on the most powerful machine around even though it follows the old school videogame formula of low brow fun and more low brow fun.Even with its shortcomings, lack of features and depth, Wreckless is the first in a string of upcoming Xbox titles we're about to see that delivers well developed solid gameplay to go with those outstanding Microsoft powered graphics. Xbox owners have had to suffer through a lot of old PS2 remixes and ports up to this point, but Wreckless is one of those games that will make you glad you have the system."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of crap!!!!","review":"Thank god i only rented this game....but it wasnt even worth the couple of $'s. the graphics are the usual japanese stuff but the gameplay is absolutely crap. i played it for 5 minutes then took it back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wreckless","review":"Not as good as the GameCube or PlayStation2 versions.

Graphics, realism, and sound are all weak and the story line is cheesy (Hong Kong gangsters?).To me, high-end games like Gotham and Halo are reasons I bought the XBOX in the first place. Wreckless looks and feels like an old Playstation-caliber game and I suggest you don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"activision takes a fall","review":"The graphics in this game aren't that terrible exept for the doors always falling off. I don't think this game would be worth your [this kind of money]. This game will have you screeming on the top of your lungs and ripping your hair out. Personally I have never sworn so much in one day. You will run into invisible walls, hit very small bumps causing you to spin out and it seems the traffic purposely runs into you [messing] you up and having you start the mission all over again. Over all I think this is definitly not worth [the price]... You'll hate the game in 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much fun","review":"This game was another disapointment for the XBox.The good:1) You can run into anything2) The cars are fastThe moderate:1) Storyline is dumb, and uninteresting2) Characters are ditzy, and totally uninteresting3) Some unique missionsThe bad:1) Graphics that look PS2, not XBox quality2) The game is boring after 30 minutes3) A totally indestructable vehicleRent it, DO NOT BUY THIS TITLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous graphics, but horrible controls","review":"Wreckless cooly shows off the graphic power of the Xbox. The rendering of a stylized Hong Kong looks just gorgeous. The framerate is also good, and there is a lot of action. But the controls are a big letdown and makes the action a moot point at times. For some reason I have a lot of trouble making simply left and right turns, and when I try to powerslide I more often than not slam into a wall -- mind you that I thought I was pretty good at playing Project Gotham. The cars also flop too easily, and you can get stuck occasionally due to what looks like a bug. Very frustrating. At best a rental title."},{"rating":"1","title":"wreckless","review":"wreckless is a total waste of time. yeah, the graphics are great and all but when it comes to game control it is terrible. if you're in the mood to waste 50 dollars then go ahead and buy it. but in my viewpoint it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent Before you Buy!","review":"I rented this game and I'm glad I did so I didn't waste more money than I paid to rent it. Which in my opinion, is how much it's worth. Don't get me wrong, it had good graphics and the replays were pretty cool. But after playing GTA3 on PS2, no other driving games are fun anymore. Wreckless also had terrible gameplay, the missions that you have to do are very hard to accomplish and I don't remember their being any difficulty setting either. Also, it doesn't seem like they give you enough time to accomplish your goals and that just adds to the difficulty level. I like a good challenge, just not \\"Wreckless.\\" No matter how good someone says a game is, my advice it to rent before you buy, so you don't end up spending [money] on something you think is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Dissapiontment","review":"This is an Great looking game.

I picked it up thinking it would be something like Grand Theft Auto 3, but it's nothing like it at all. You are stuck in your vehicle the whole time, and crashing into other people gets really boring after about 10 minutes. The missions are lacking, and downright easy, and the graphics aren't all that good. The cars handle really bad, and I find it awkward to steer them at higher speeds. I don't know what catagory to place this game in, I'm thinking JUNK would be a good one though. Right now, with games like this out, I'm thinking I should have stuck with the PS2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replay-ware at its finest.","review":"I was really excited when I saw this game preview. However, the replayware that was presented in the previews is all this game is. The actual game is not very exciting or fun to play. You can drive around and bash all of the surroundings and your indestructable car will lose a few pieces but it will still run, other than that the over all game play is cheesy.The graphics are good but it doesn't really matter when the over all game play isn't very good. Hopefully if there is a next version it will be the best of both worlds (good gameplay and great graphics). It is probably a good thing to rent this game before buying it. I wish I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible graphics, but the fun stops there...","review":"Wreckless is a very graphically impressive game, the reflections are incredible and the framerate is smooth, however the gameplay is unoriginal and repetative, the cars are hard to drive, and the missions consist of chasing cars that look the same, down a track that seems to repeat itself and smacking into the back of them repetatively. Also, whenever you hit anything, static, or moving the screen becomes very blurry, I kept thinking my contacts had fallen out. The blurring \\"effect\\" only serves to detract from the gameplay even further, and is not done well at all. If I had actually bought this game instead of renting it, I would have cried, don't even rent it, it's a waste of the 3 bucks or whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wreckless","review":"The game is good.

Luckily rented first and thanked God I didn't buy it. Tre the graphics are excellent, but the missions get so boring. After abou 20 mins. of plaing this game i got bored. It was useless to play. It would have been so much better if there was a free play mode just to look around and hang out in the city. But there isn't. After all i said, it's just not a good game. You will get bored of it pretty quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wreckless...yet another Bloodwake disappointment","review":"I got Wreckless with the antipation of owning a new fun XBox game. I, being a veteran gamer, was left sorely disappointed. After playing several missions I've come to realize that the developers of the game must think we gamers love having to do boring things over and over again. They also think we'd like to see a terrible looking instant replay of us doing it over and over again. The game frequently pummels you with below the belt hits, smacks you with cheap shots and puts a doom clock over your head just for spite. The graphics are fantastic but who cares when the gameplay is lame. They say the physics engine is accurate. I don't see it. GTA3's better than that. At least the cars don't disappear in front of you or corners throw you for a 180 everytime your near. The in game arrows will blind you and the huge map and displays all over your screen make seeing where your going a huge hassle. Bottom line, Save your money or just rent it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break","review":"You have got to be kidding me. What was the X box thinking. Wreckless has to be the worst game in history. Sure the graphics are okay but the driving [stinks]. This is no Grand Theft Auto 3 or Grand Truismo 3 Aspec. I played it for 5 minutes and was already sick of it. The Sounds [are bad] in this game and if I were you I would spend my money on a game like Halo or something else like this. Sorry being rude and all but you have to put some thought in the game. It's nothing like you see on T.V."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Cares?!","review":"This game is awesome. A lot of people rate this game poorly because there is no free roam mode. First of all, the time limits are pretty good and so you can just ignore the mission and drive around wherever u want. Another bad thing is that there is no two player mode. Hopefully there will be a sequal with free roam and multiplayer modes, or a booster disc (like DOA3 will have). Unlocking the hidden cars is fun, such as the monster truck or taxi cab. Anyway, buy this game if you want to do the sometimes fun mission or just ride around smashing things up for about 2-3 minutes per turn. Don't buy this game if you are looking forward to driving as long as you want with NO boundaries at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misadvertised!","review":"Come on! From the outside of this games box, it looks to be the Xbox's answer to GTA 3. What you get when you put it in the machine is a different story. Cheesy cartoons characters and a weak plotline, backed up by monotonous game play are more than enough to offset the fabulous(and I mean FABULOUS) graphics. I've just rented it, and almost already beat it. If you want a cute cheesy game with great graphics and good driving, this game is for you. If not, just rent it, enjoy the graphics, and send it back"},{"rating":"1","title":"great graphics..fun for a few days...","review":"this game was predicted to be one of the reasons to buy an Xbox but unfortunately that prediction was way off.

In \\"The Firefly\\" she is free of Nelson Eddy's wooden presence and is better supported by Alan Jones who, unlike Eddy, can act. Jones' contribution is his performance of the wonderfully whimsical \\"Donkey Serenade\\" popularized by this movie, and more fully enjoyable when seen as performed here. You may have to be patient with the 130 minute running time but the resolution of the spy versus counter-spy plot is worth it.Too bad it is not available on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Watched It for Warren","review":"Yes, the sole reason I sought out this movie was because it features as a villain one of my favorite (and just about forgotten) actors, Warren William. Now, with the same technique, I've come across some really good movies, like \\"Cleopatra\\" and \\"Employees Entrance\\", but \\"The Firefly\\" ain't one of them. And it isn't because it's an operetta--I liked \\"Rosemarie\\" and \\"Maytime\\". No, it's because it's boring and extremely unbelieveable. Eventually, I grew impatient waiting for Warren William to appear, and put the film on Fast Forward. Even then, time passed slowly. In addition, I had heard the name, \\"Donkey Serenade\\" before, but I found that song to be something of a loser too. SO, my advice is, watch some other Jeanette MacDonald movie, not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Vietnamese Flag","review":"I purchased this gift for my grandmother during the Christmas Holiday.

With the exception of a few edits, weak remixes and a couple of other \\"hits\\" (one not even from the Fugees, but just Lauryn Hill), there is virtually no reason to purchase this cd if you already own The Score.

It has hard-hitting tracks like Red Dragon, Crunch and Freak Fantasic, and softer tracks like Long Way Down. This album has something for everyone! Whether you're into Swollen's underground vibe, or their newer, more 'mainstream' vibe. For all those people that say Monsters In The Closet is tottaly different than Balance, they are absolutely right. I believe the reason for this is that S+M have found that 'formula' that they have mentioned several times. But without taking on some of this 'formula' Swollen might not be as sucessful as they are today. They are not 'sell outs' like some of you think. They are grounded, they know where they came from, and they know where they want to go. They are UnDeRgRoUnD fOrEvEr, and will never loose that underground vibe or influence. This album is great, and if you like hip hop of any sort, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good 2.5","review":"Well If you like swollen members then you will like this album.

What was worse, when I saw them live they opened for GHOSTFACE KILLAH of the legendary Wu-Tang Clan..what an absolute embarassment to have these clowns opening for you abusing what ghostface and the Wu did to build and revolutionize hip hop music.

For some reason the Caterpillar song is by far the one that strikes the best chord with my 21-month old, though. \\"When the Ants/bugs Come Marching In\\" is also fun. I can't recommend the series enough--and this particular DVD is top-rated because of the final segment in my opinion, along with the ABC's and counting to 10 (which are both after the final credits, and make the DVD worthy of purchase IMHO)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great tool from Signing Time!","review":"The Great Outdoors is an excellent video for kids to learn more about sign vocabulary and it especially touches the heart with the final song \\"I wish I were a butterfly\\" with an emphasis on special needs kids.

The Derailers, one of the world's great honkytonk bands, get buried under slick Nashville production and hackwork songwriting. When the sessioneers outnumber the bandmembers, you know something's wrong, especially when your producer hires an extra drummer, an extra bassist, four extra guitarists and five extra harmony singers to handle positions the band itself is quite capable of doing themselves, and better than these so-called pros. Singer Tony Villanueva, one of the best in the business, sounds bored and disengaged from the material, and with complete (edited) like \\"I Love Me Some Elvis\\" on the docket, I don't blame him. His partner Brian Hofeldt, an excellent harmony singer and a bleeping GREAT guitarist, might as well not even be here, and given the audio evidence, he may not be.This record takes one of the most distinctive bands in country music and turns them into just another piece of product. Genuine? Not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty damn good","review":"As a music fan, I give this album a 4 because it is a good sounding, fun disc that won't be listened to once and tossed aside. \\"Uncool\\" is a great commentary about people in this day and age. If you like to sing along and dance around in your living room then pick this one up. However, as a hardcore Derailers fan, I have to rate it a 3 only because I don't like the direction they are taking. I got hooked on them because of their simply produced albums by Dave Alvin who knows how to capture the awesome energy the band has live onto their studio work. Kyle Lenning overproduces using too much fiddle, backing vocals, keyboards and effects that too often washes out the good old two guitars, bass, drums and pedal steel Bakersfield sound. I hope the band works with Dave Alvin again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I own every Derailers CD, and I regret to say that \\"Genuine\\" does not even come close to the others. They are an incredible band--the best at honky-tonk--but this album is bad. There isn't a single good song on the whole CD. I don't know what happened. Buy \\"Full Western Dress\\" and \\"Here Come The Derailers\\" and you'll hear some incredible music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genuinely disappointing","review":"Sadly, another stinker from a once great band. I was hoping their previous two releases were anomolies--a bit of failed experimentation in a new pop-influenced sound--but, alas, this one is even worse. Gone is the fresh, tight Bakersfield sound and first-rate song writing. It is way too overproduced. Songs are forgettable and [average]. The once great Derailers have become another bland Nashville country act. I agree totally with Micheal Toland's review above. If you are fan of the Jackpot, Reverb Deluxe, Live Tracks Derailers, you will be genuinely disappointed with Genuine."},{"rating":"2","title":"As described","review":"This book came as described in excellent condition.

As a Genealogist I can say, Portrait in Blue is an outstanding piece of Literature, written by someone who had a wonderful understanding of the Hayden Shipbuilding and Sailing Legacy in the growth of Essex, Connecticut. I highly recommend this book, not simply because of heritage, but for what it represents in the quality of childrens literature. Any parent who wants to provide their child with a real connected experience to the growth of America might wish to consider reading this book to their child, then bring them to Champlin Square in Essex, CT to see her house as it stands today and then visit Amelia's grave in Essex, CT in the small quaint Grove Street Cemetery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not functional for my lathe.","review":"Figured I would go ahead and take a gamble on this cheap face plate thinking my odds were good with the brand name Grizzle on it.

Another problem is that the threads only extend for roughly 5/16\\" in from the face (also not mentioned in the product description).

First off, Im not sure why they call it a 'precision' controller since the L and R trigger throws are actually shorter than those of the Xbox Controller S, in fact making it less precise. Theyre higher up on the backside of the controller, making the grip on the controller a little awkward but tolerable. Secondly, the directional pad (the old-school left, right, up, down pad) is very loose and not very solid at all. I think I've been spoiled a little bit by the Nintendo Gamecube Wavebird controllers after having those for about 2 years though, fyi. It might sound like Im bashing the controller a bit, but Id much rather have it than the corded controller. Plus, it includes a rumble feature which the Wavebird does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Original XBOX wireless controller","review":"anyone who hates cords everyone for the original console I highly recommend it, it has great range.

I got to hold it at 'best buy', and it seemed to feel fine with a little getting used to, but I never actually got to play with it. I was quite melancholy after I started playing halo2 @ home, for the a,x,y,b buttons would not respond with a simple push. They must be pressed quite hard for them to respond, which really messes up my gaming experience. Other than that, the D-pad is quite unfixed, but the feel is comme-ci-comme-ca.

Like Randy Moss or someone make a touchdown and dances and yells out \\"Whoooo I am the greatest whooo!\\", then out of nowhere a guy comes a tackles him, the Randy or someone would go \\"ooooh my ribs ah!\\" The game is fun too, but when you lose or your just about to make a touchdown a guy from the other team jumps up and intercepts the ball you just wan't to curse at them but remember it's ONLY a VIDEOGAME.

First the actual seller would not provide any tracking information. Next when the mover actually arrived in my area the freight company had to make several attempts to deliver and then sent a semi even though I told them that a smaller truck was required to get into my driveway. I ended up helping the driver push the crate on a pallet jack the several hundred yards from the street. After unpacking the mover and doing the partial assembly I started mowing. The mower lasted about an hour before the engine let go. I contacted the seller and started the procedure to get a refund. So far they have refused to refund the purchase price until they get the mower back but have not yet managed to get it out of my yard.

Fabricated in China, it uses generic RG-174 type coax which is of course all polyethylene and will normally provide a loss of about 5 dB for 10 ft at 2.4 GHz. If you want significantly lower loss, consider a larger cable such as RG-58. Connectors are typical Chinese RP-SMAs with some unspecified gold plating that usually holds up reasonably well.

I fell in LOVE with the movie! It is by far one of the best movies of all time, but this review is about the game. The game arrived about a day or two after me seeing the movie. I popped it in and got hooked from the moment I hit the start button. The characters are so detailed and the plot is almost identical to the movie.

Not only do you play through the whole of the movie AND get to play with each character at some point, but you also get amazing additional storylines, the playable histories of each character and the gang itself, terrific gameplay and controls, as well as some classic arcade-style mini-games. Even in our current age of gaming, where everything is beyond sleek and online play is massive, this is still a standout game.

I have trouble distinguishing the difference between this and State of Emergency.When in cooperative mode, the game play splits into two screens and everything gets a lot smaller. The camera gets confusing and the game looses any atmosphere it's supposed to have. In the end I just remember running around in circles fetching for items in these mini like city portions.

I wasted my money on these and will have to find someone who wants them, or I might just have to end up throwing them away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The instructions say to wet your face, wet the cloth and rub for a rich lather.

I liked how compact and light it was when folded. However after using it at home, I soon discovered how difficult it was to push and steer and turn. Nothing was smooth about it and it required such effort in pushing my daughter. Also, I couldn't imagine her getting any bigger and sitting comfortably in the seat, it wasnt very deep and she appeared to be uncomfortable sitting in it. I ended up getting rid of it and purchased a PegPerego which I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Stroller","review":"Well the clasp just took out a piece of my flesh when I was opening it for son.

I also wanted to take this stroller to Florida for our famliy vacation. Well I ended up bringing my big stroller. My son just doesn't seem comfortable in this stroler he is always slouching to the side and he's 14 months old. The tray is way to high so he can't really use it and the sun shade is ridiculous that's the main reason I didn't bring it to sunny florida. It is very hard to move around also I find myself getting very frustrated at it. The positions of the seat are way off - They are like kindof sitting up and kindof laying down. I was really excited about this stroller and actually told 3 other people to buy it which they did and now we all feel we wasted our money even if it was just $40."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!","review":"I purchased this stroller for my 10mo about 1 month ago. I was very excited, it had everything that I was looking for...light weight, easy to use, tray for toddler and adult, canopy...We took it to Disney World 2 weeks ago, when I took it out of the trunk and opened it, the canopy ripped. I am still baffled about how this would happen. I thought that it was really no big deal something that could be fixed.But, then last night I had my son in it shopping in the mall and the wheel came off! Yes you heard me right, while walking, the wheel rolled away! Thank god my husband was with me, as the wheel would not reattach and we had to carry everything out of the mall. I don't know what I would have done if I was alone.Needless to say I am now today on a mission trying to find a replacement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!! Dropping off at goodwill!! Hope someone else likes it better!","review":"I bought this stroller because it looked to have everything I wanted (cup holder, basket, recline) in a \\"affordable\\" lightweight stroller. The only thing good about this stoller is the basket and the cup holders! This stroller is very hard to push because the front wheels spin into opposite directions. The back of the seat is so hard my daughter will not sit in it for long. The buckle is very hard to push together and will pinch you (taking skin with it) if you are not careful!I am going to purchase another stoller to replace this one. Maybe you do get what you pay for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE BEWARE!!","review":"Please think twice before buying this product. The belt bucket is extremely hard to open and close, and it clipped both my and my husband's fingers, making them bleed. But even worse, it clipped my daughter's belly and took a chunk of skin, and now she will have a scar. Neither Babytrend nor Toys R Us seemed to care (or even believe me). So I just want to warn other parents about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dangerous!! AND CHEAP!!!!!","review":"I purchased this stroller thinking that it would be nice and light quick to get around and overall easier. What a nightmare the wheels stuck since day one!! It is very dangerous because my daughters feet would constantly get stuck in the wheel.She is only 24 pounds and on the shorter side.The tray is a joke as well ,it comes off all the time. The \\"recline\\" feature another joke.Sometimes the back just falls all the way down without warning!! Please anyone whom reads this save your money and buy a better stroller stay away from this \\"joke\\" that they call a stroller!! I really did not want to spend a arm and leg on another stroller however, I purchased a Maclaren Carbon it was worth the money!! Alot less headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and Big Waste of Money!","review":"Do not bother wasting money on this item; just add more and buy more expensive one. Yes this thing is light and has all these trays, BUT SO DO THE OTHER STROLLERS!!! My son's feet always slide off the foot bar and caused him an injury, wheels never spin smoothly - I have to fight to push it all the time! In addition, my son always almost slides out of it and most of the time he has to ride in a very uncomfortable position because no matter how many times I pull him up, he slides down within minutes. Also, I had my fingers pinched by the clips - I think others had the same problem. It is a terrible product - just add $20 and get a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not recommend","review":"I purchased this stroller for my 14 month old son, because I was looking for a lightweight stroller with a tray (which is impossible to find) and a storage basket. I am now in the process of looking for a new stroller. The seat depth is too short, the harness is sooo hard to get unbuckled, the tray is too high, and most of all it is impossible to manuever. I would not recommend this stroller to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this stroller","review":"I bought this stroller as a cheap inexpensive light weight stroller to use in a pinch. However, the strap buttons are way to tight and the stroller is very hard to collapse. I have to spend a lot of time messing with it, just to get it open. I only use my graco from now on, it's bigger, but it's much easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it seems...","review":"This stroller seems to have everything, but once I actually used it, I was very disappointed. The seat is too small (in depth) for my 13 month old daughter-I felt like she was going to fall out. The tray is positioned too high-I was afraid she'd hit her chin if we went over a bump or something. Finally, the back cushion isn't really a cushion-it's more of a board with a cover-very hard with no give or flexibility. Overall, enough features that made it way to uncomfortable for my daughter. I returned it & got a different stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this stroller!!!!","review":"I bought this stroller because we were traveling out of state and we did not want to bring the big stroller and besides our son was getting older and we really didn't need the travel system stroller anymore. My son does not fit in the seat right, he leans to the side because the seat is too short. The stroller is also impossible to stear and gets stuck on the smallest bump. We will be throwing our practically new stroller out!!!!! Listen to other reviews like I didn't and don't buy this stroller. The ten dollar umbrella strollers are better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest stroller, but the tray fits on Maclarens!!","review":"Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this stroller has several weak points (difficult harness, shallow seat, poor maneuverability, etc.). HOWEVER...I discovered that the tray fits on my Maclaren Quest, and that has made it worth the price! Now my Quest has become a near-perfect stroller! I wrote this review in hopes that some other person willing to go to great lengths to get a tray on their Maclaren stroller will benefit from this little discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"I was so happy when I found this stroller like others have said it had a storage basket, lightweight, snack tray, and cup holder all hard to find in a lightweight stroller and it was affordable. BUT the seat was to small the clasp was really difficult to get my child out of and it was hard to stear. Don't be fooled by the 39.99 price! I returned mine and am still searching for a better stroller. Maybe a graco literider?? Wish I could give 0 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I wanted a new lightweight stroller for our younger son (almost a year) and this one looked great. I used it today and I am going to return it tomorrow. My thumbs are red and swollen from trying to unbuckle the straps and when I went to get him out, he was so far forward that he could have walked out on his own!! My son is an average size so that should not have been an issue. I agree with what everyone else said about the size of the seat, steering (we were on a smooth sidewalk and it was tough), closing it was so hard that my husband had to do it when he got home, and those darned straps! I am so disappointed - I will certianly research more before I buy another stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before buying this stroller!","review":"I bought this stroller for my son because it had the features I was looking for: compact, lightweight & easy to use. I brought it home and put it together with no problems. I tested it out in my living room before ever putting my son in it. Thank goodness for this because the back seat rest kept collapsing. All it took was a little amount of pressure from my two fingers and it would fall. Needless to say I returned it immediately. I now use the Graco LiteRide stroller and LOVE it! Babies R Us is now selling a model or you can find several models at WalMart.com. It's small, lightweight, has much better padding & a generous basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK Stroller","review":"This is the worst stroller ever. I've been thru alot and finally found that the Graco LiteRider is the best for the price. This stroller handles terrible, it has been the source of many frustrating shopping trips. Please, don't waste your money, spend the extra $20 for the Graco."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"We bought this stroller based on a few good reviews which said it was perfect for trips to the mall, airport/travel, etc. This is one of the only lightweight strollers that has a tray in front, which was something we needed for our son. What a mistake... we refer to this product as \\"The stroller from h**\\". I told my husband we should give it away, he said we should burn it! I'm glad we didn't spend more than $40.00 on it.It doesn't handle well around corners, etc. The basket beneath doesn't hold too much. The front tray and tray near the handles comes off easily. Our son is miserable in it and looks totally uncomfortable. The only good thing about it is that it is lightweight, other than that it is totally useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!! NOT for OLDER babies or toddlers!!!","review":"I just want to say, this stroler is so easy to assembly, but definitivelly IS NOT A STROLLER FOR OLDER KIDS. My 1 it's just 24 pounds, and the stroller was so hard to manuveur, also his legs were practically in the front wheels. The one hand fold it's tooooooo hard; I think it's maybe a 4 hand fold!!! Also the seat belts. I asked for a refund after the 1rst time I used it for a short mall trip. Then, I bought a Jeep Liberty Urban Terrain (not the one with air wheels). This one it's more expensive ($99) but worked great!!! Super easy to ride with one hand!! I went to Disney World and I just have to say this stroller saved my life!!To conclude, If you like this lightweight stroller (Babytrend) you can buy it only for a lightweight baby (maybe 9 months max.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money!","review":"I thought I was really going to like this stroller but it is a big NOPE! I have had it about 3 months and already thrown it away. What a waste of $[...]! I should have used that money towards a more expensive model. The wheels were impossible and kept getting stuck in a sideways position where the stoller would not go at all! The fabric gets stuck everytime you try to put the seat in the upright position. It never did collapse right when you went to put it away. Also watch out for the clips! I pinched my finger trying to close it and drew blood. Thank god it was not my son's finger. My son could not sit upright in this stoller, he kept sliding down. ( and he is 2 years old so he can sit up fine!) He always looked so uncomfortable in it!Dont buy this stroller unless you are looking for a big headache!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"OK, there are a lot of good points about this stroller, it was reasonable priced and had a lot of storage space but it was nearly impossible to unclip the belt. It almost made my fingers bleed! I thought it might loosen up over time but almost a year later it still kills me every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For The Money","review":"Basically everything that has been written so far is true. The stroller is small, lightweight, has drink holders, child tray, recline, and storage basket. It is hard to push in the fold up button or unhook the strap latch and the stroller is not the most comfortable for baby. However, this is a great stoller overall especially for the money.We started with a Graco travel system, which was great, but needed to get smaller. The Graco took up the entire trunk (Acura TSX) and was a pain to get in and out. The Baby Trend goes in easily and slides to the back of the trunk. With the Graco we had about 2 cu. ft. of storage and with the Baby Trend we now have around 10 cu. ft. I would recommend this unit to anyone in a similar situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful!","review":"This is a terrible stroller-I too have had chunks of skin taken out of my hand twice now! It's so hard to get the clasp undone and done up-I don't know what the problem is.The wheels/steering on this stroller is AWFUL as well. It seems like the wheels are constantly jammed and it's not going anywhere.I only have one son (7 months), but tend to have a diaper bag and bags from shopping. I thought I'd be able to 'steer' one handed and handle this stroller. Not so! I ususally carry my little one (he hates the stroller) and the stroller is going this way and that-I've been tempted to just leave the awful thing in the mall!Needless to say; we're going to try and return it-if they won't take it, we'll throw it out. It's TERRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"I thought this was an excellent stroller with the looks, storage space, lightness and other features UNTIL it folded on me. My daughter is 21 months and 25lb, not a heavy load. She got her finger stuck in between the bars and the skin got sheared off the tip. This stroller folded on me a total of 4 times in 1 month before she got injured and I returned it. Be especially careful over curbs, train tracks or any type of a bump in the sidewalk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Very easy to put together and very lightweight. This will be much easier for me to lug around as compared to one of the travel system strollers. all you have to do is attach the wheels and the infant and adult trays and your all set. Its a good price as well!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this stroller","review":"This is my 3rd baby trend stroller. I was happy with the first two (snap and go and jogging) but will NEVER buy another baby trend product after the TrendSport. I can not press in the button to close the stroller unless I use two hands and it still is very hard. I have sent it back TWICE now to baby trend since Babies R Us said it has been too long and twice it has came back the exact same way. I asked for a refund but they said no. So, I just contacted them to send it back a THIRD time. I don't want a stroller that I can not easily close. I have since purchased a Chicco Capri that I love and will not be buying anymore baby trend products."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed...","review":"I wanted so much to like this stroller. It had everything I wanted: cupholder/tray for me, cupholder/tray for baby, big basket, lightweight. HOWEVER, my poor baby looks miserable sitting in it. My 14 month old is 23 pounds and his little belly presses against the tray. There is no room for him to sit, only about 6\\". The buckle is extremely difficult to open and close. The wheels are flimsy and I was just waiting for them to fall off today. It doesn't handle well. WHen trying to close it and get it back in the car this afternoon, it took several minutes to figure out why it wouldn't close all the way - the wheels have to be in the flat position...Not what I wanted... THink I'll take it to the Salvation Army. Maybe someone else will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money.","review":"Yes, there are some faults with the stroller, but based on the price, it is still probably the best bang for the buck. We got this stroller because I needed something that I can carry up and down the stairs while I am on the subway. Most people in NYC are helpful, but every once in a while, I have to do it myself. I would not know how I would do it without my Trendsport.My husband bought the Graco MetroLite, which was 18 lbs, so I complained that I needed something lighter. The Trendsport was perfect, since we did not have to shell out a lot of money. Sure, there are some problems trying to steer it, and there are only 2 seat-positions, but these are very minor drawbacks. It is still a great stroller and definitely a great bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"We were looking for a lightweight, inexpensive stroller. What a piece of junk this is. The buckles are so hard to work they practically took off the ends of my fingers. The wheels are flimsy, and the steering is a joke. The part of the 3-point harness that goes between the legs pushed right up against my son's privates, and that was the only thing keeping him in this thing. He screamed the last time I tried to take him shopping in this, so it went back to BRU. Buy something else. Anything would be better than this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Boss of all Bosses\\"","review":"Scarface at his best! Only a few artist can set the Standard and Raise the Bar.

The beats are hella clean and the lyrics are hard as usual. \\"Balls and my Word\\" has more guest rappers than the average Face record, but it definitely isn't a bad thing here. Z-Ro put down a hook on a couple of the tracks, Bun-B adds a tight verse to the 50 Cent Dissin' track \\"B**ch N*gga\\", and Devin \\"The Dude\\" puts down the Chorus and a verse on \\"Only Your Mother\\". My Personal Favorite tracks would have to be \\"Stuck At A Standstill\\", \\"Make Your Peace\\", \\"Spend The Night\\", \\"Recognize\\", and \\"On My Grind\\".

The characters are as different and variated as in reality. And the music. Ah, the music. Not enough can be said about the music to express the unhindering awe I have of it. All in all, everything is simply perfect.I'll admit, the first time I rented the first DVD, I got so lost in the voices, colours and music I didn't pay much attention to the plot. The plot is very complex and confusing at times, since while there isn't a lot of action, there is a lot of talking and theor[ies] and to remember it all is hard. However, once you start to weed out the important aspects the series is really amazing. The character relationships and grow of the characters is really something to look at.Overall, if you're into fast paced anime, I'll agree, this probably isn't the anime for you.However, I have found it extremely enjoyable and would recommend it to those with a lot of paitence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saga Continues","review":"The storyline continues to develop and suck you in more and more.

Even though the story takes place in a futuristic setting and many of the storyline concepts have changed, much of the plot and rich characters of the original \\"Seven Samurai\\" have been retained. Clearly the budget was spent in making sure the Nobuseri and other CG images meshed well with the traditional animation of the characters, and it works on that level.Granted the first two episodes of Samurai 7 start slow, but it is necessary to establish the characters of the mismatched seven who come to the aid of Kanna Village. Furthermore, the issues of honor, war, respect that were prevalent in the original are once again on display in this anime without overshadowing the awesome fight scenes, or vice versa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to watch, not to buy","review":"As a fan of samurai movies, anime and having watched the original 7 samurai, this movie was mildly entertaining. The story line was decent but aside from the character development, I found it quite empty. An annoying kid, and a bumbling fake samurai (at least the original was somewhat competent) distracted from the already quite shaky adaptation. In my opinion, it is interesting to see where the characters go and how their pasts and paths unfold but not something I plan on watching again anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the pleasure reader","review":"This book provides complex analysis of congressional behavior.

I say attempt because I find this to be inferior to early Exploited and any crust and metal bands there. It is music without a real direction, seemingly created to look \\"hardcore\\" for a dying band who has abandoned their punk roots altogether, for the most part.I hate to negatively review for what seems like such a stupid reason, but fans of early Exploited will understand how horrible this is when they hear it after listening to their \\"Punks Not Dead\\" LP again.

If you are the same, I see no reason on why you would dislike this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I absolutely love Tony Jaa's movies. His movies are the only martial arts movies I'll watch.But this movie sucks. I love Ong Bak 2, but 3 is so damn BORING.Instead of taking the route of the second film, they focus more on supernatural aspects and more on good vs evil, rather than a story of vengeance. Half the time I was watching I was asking myself \\"what the hell is going on\\" because the subject matter is so distant from that of the first two films.85% of the movie Jaa is crippled or recovering from being dead, so there's less fighting and more whining and tantrums about being crippled. The only decent display of action from Jaa is approximately 10 minutes before the end of the movie, and it's still not his best performance.I would expect any Tony Jaa fan to watch this and form their own opinion. This is simply my opinion, and damn was I disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Christmas gift","review":"For Christmas I gave my son all three of the Ong Bak movies. \\"Ong Bak 3\\" starts where 2 left off and Tony Jaa's character is beaten and must make his way back with the use of meditation and learns how to deal with his karma. He returns to his village but his enemy awaits him.My son likes the third movie best of all three, and I have to admit that other than the scene where Jaa runs across the backs of moving elephants in \\"Ong Bak 2\\" I like 3 also. The elephant scene was just unbelievable and makes 2 stand out. Tony Jaa is excellent at what he does, and including all types of martial arts from different Eastern countries is very interesting as well. The Special Features included have a lot of good information in them.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story with Yin Yang emphasis","review":"I love this movie? Yes, there is a lot of violence, but with great martial arts.

Both share the same over-kill problem so endemic to martial arts films in general: fights go on just too long...and too often. That's one reason Jackie Chan's American films were so popular: fights are cut down to a reasonable length. But that's catering to American tastes, apparently. I gather Asian audiences like the fights to go on and on and on. But getting back to this film, I can think of no other film where the lead character spends so much time comatose before reviving and triumphing. I like Tony Jaa and think he's amazing. But I do think he needs someone else to direct him. He gets a wee bit too self-indulgent when he's the only director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you're expecting","review":"Boy was i surprised at all the negative press regarding this release. Alot of people really wanted the story to go in typical fashion, and it doesn't quite do that, granted. But. BUT. It's still tony, it's still shot marvelously, and frankly, there is plenty of interesting angles to consider in this story. It is not meant to be a standalone, watch this with ong bak 2 (they were originally intended as a single movie, but overruns forced a split in the project.) Some of these scenes are just EPIC"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think that was Ong-Bak....fast forwarding.....yeah, I think this is it.","review":"I have been a fan of the original Ong-Bak for some time. I imported the original before a US release and find it to be one of my favorite martial arts movies period. I was very excited for this movie to come out even though Ong-Bak 2 was a major departure from the original. The fight scenes were great and entertaining but they definitely lacked the raw feel of the original. Some of the stuff done here cannot be faked and that's it what I loved about the original.The big downfall to me is that the cultural differences between Thai and the US are dramatic in this movie. I was so confused by things that were going on and did not understand how certain scenes related to the movie. I found myself fast forwarding to skip through long drawn out scenes. I can't really say that I would watch this movie all the way through again. I may show some people some of the fight scenes though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was disappointing...","review":"The movie starts where it leaves off at the end of Ong Bak 2. It felt like it was starting to be good, when the body healing process begins for Tony Jaa's character. The healing process continues... He's wrapped up like the guy on Kung fu Hustle, but for more than an hour of the movie. When he finally heals, the action isn't nearly as good as the other 2 Ong Bak movies. The villain he's waited to kill for his whole life is killed by some demon and it doesn't make sense. When he fights the demon it isn't that entertaining... This movie isn't a must see... It's not enough action... Save your money... Watch Ong Bak 2 again and imagine your own ending..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I shall Dance, I shall Meditate, I shall put you to sleep","review":"Bad.See Tony Jaa get beat up, meditate, dance, meditate some more and dance some more.I walked out after an hour+.

Some cool action, yes again. Was it as good as part 1 & 2, NO. I felt as though in part 1, Jaa showed us what a bada$$ he was with the stunts and bone-crunching fight scenes. In part 2, he showed us his adaptability with the various forms of martial arts. Part 3, he was all about story telling. Which is fine, but all this magic and dancing when Jaa is an ACTION star? For me, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very VERY disappointing","review":"I loved the first ong bak... second one was not nearly as good as first... and this last one... well it sucked. the story was TERRIBLE and I can usually put up with bad story lines and bad actors as long as the fight scenes are good.

Im a HUGE tony jaa fan but this was just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I saw Ong Bak 2, and it was great, but if you want to watch this movie, watch the first five minutes, skip the next hour, and watch the 20-30 minutes left unless you want to see an hour of Tony Jaa laying down unconscious, waking up mangled, regaining his strength only to then spend his time sitting, dancing very slowly, sitting some more, dancing some more, and, you guessed it, sitting once again. The end was the only part worth watching, but sitting through the rest of the movie even made that part less exciting than it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why you should not watch this movie...","review":"The video quality was atrocious, the cinematography was amateur, the acting was sub-par with few real characters, the story made no sense and the fight scenes were uninspiring and stale.To give some background: I didn't care much for the first OngBak, but I did enjoy the second and was hoping the third would carry over some of the intense action and story. This was not the case and I was left feeling like I wasted my money.

I had no idea what was happening half the time. Definitely not worth paying the Amazon Prime price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ong Bak 3 is not as good as Ong Bak 1 & 2","review":"I saw this rental since I was a fan of Tony Jaa, but priced at $9.99 you are not getting your money's worth if you are comparing the story telling and action scenes from the first two movies to the last. This movie seemed to have much more graphic violence to make up for the lack of story or action. I think Ong Bak 2 ended fine and part 3 never really needed to be made. This movie picks up with the protagonist being resurrected after being brutally killed and follows with his quest for revenge/retribution. Ong Bak 3 takes on a broader theme of good versus evil. The added mysticism aspect of the movie did not throw me off as so much as its execution in filming. Then again, perhaps I am being overly harsh since it's a Pre-Theatrical release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie,.....","review":"Although, I like Ong Bak 2 I really enjoyed Ong Bak 3 as well especially the ending and i would recommend the whole series to get the entire story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not what it should have been","review":"When I watched Ong Bak, I was captivated by the storyline and the martial arts. It even ended well. Then to know a sequel was coming out, I was excited and watched that too. That ended with a cliffhanger that leads us up to this one... part 3.If I had to compare this movie to anything it would end up being the 3rd movie in the Matrix trilogy. It's a trilogy that started off strong, had a decent sequel then one heck of a sucky 3rd outting. This one is just that.The storyline takes a back seat to religious fluff and the martial arts sequences (when you can even find any) are bland and boring.This movie is a bad aftertaste to an otherwise great storyline. Only watch it if you want see something beyond what the first two movies offered for action and storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hack job","review":"Ong Bak 1 and 2 were great movies. The martial arts in the first one was amazing, and the cinematography in the second was breathtaking. There is not much to like about this one. The story is meh, the fighting is meh, and the imagery is meh. Its not a BAD movie, but a sever letdown from the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is No Fault of Pavarotti","review":"The first eight songs on this CD appear to be either studio outtakes, or very badly recorded concert material. The ends of several songs are faded off too soon; Pavarotti is still on the note and you do not get to hear him finish. These bad edits, plus a lot, and I mean a lot, of distracting, unpleasant, and surprisingly loud background noise, mar what could have been a bargain. But it is not. And although I think 10 songs is a bit stingy, may I emphasize that the real problem is the abysmal noise and amateurish edits. The last two songs are fine. I recommend that you spend a bit more and buy another Pavarotti CD. He was great. This CD is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHRISTMAS WITH PAVAROTTI","review":"Christmas With PavarottiThis is a marvellous recording. It is a selection that one can listen to all year round.

However, K.A. herself admits that it is to be a silly book. Although I have no objections whatsoever to silly books, it seems to me a waste of a character. Cassie can be so effectively used to express the most powerful issues (#19, for example), but instead, is wasted. She is used for moronic stories which waste her potential (#14, #9, and, it seems, #24), and has only two of five good stories to her name (#4 and #19). K.A., you are a great writer, and never stop, but please realize that your characters have more potential than you seem to give them credit for."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT book!!!!!!!","review":"This book is one of the best of the animorph books that I've read and I've read them all!

These very small, very rude beings manage to get their hands on the blue box that is the key to the exclusive morphing power. So, the Animorphs have to get it back immediately before it falls into the wrong hands! This book has some humorous moments, and of course a little bit of action, but the plot is a bit weak, especially when compared to some of the thrillers that the author has wrote in this series. Unless you are a diehard Animorphs fan intent on collecting all the books, I would steer clear of this one and look for something with a stronger storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Normaly I really like Animorphs but this book is awful. In this book the Animorphs find out about aliens called the Hemerclans. They shrink the Animorphs to 1/16 of an inch high and the Animorphs have to get back to their size. How pointless can you get?! K.A. Applegate shouldn't have written this one. My advice: don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was disappointing, the Helmacrons needed more stories.","review":"The Helmacrons were more powerful than the Yeerks and the Animorphs. With that power, they could've held on to that idea for at least three other books. It wasn't bad though, and I think Cassie is the best at explaining the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was full of action and remarkably detailed","review":"This book is a Cassie narrative where a tiny race of aliens steal the blue box. It is vital to the Animorphs, so they want to rescue it. In the process they get shrunk to the size of a grain of sand. Visser 3 also gets shrunk. This book has a bit of humor which everyone will find entertaining. This is one of the best books of the series. A must read and two thumbs up. I just wish they could figure out that Tobias could become normal by staying in human morph for two hours than using the blue box to get morphing powers. Maybe the author wants the point of view of a hawk, loneliness, and being different. Anyway buy this book now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING","review":"GO AHEAD, ASK ME.

Most of his statements are at least funny (e.g. \\"When a company grows it needs to constantly change, because if it doesn't change it remains the same, it's very simple\\").Well, at least this supposed CEO is using some smart sales promotion techniques by selling his DVDs by pretending to be some unrelated vendor and offering a used copy to seem like a bargain (which was actually new)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't go into it seriously; I knew that going in.","review":"This was an exercise and a lark to look at this book and try to see if I could take it seriously.

This book is slightly more than 300 pages and I've been working on it for almost 2 weeks now. I dread reading. But, I always finish a book, hoping there will be a redeeming quality at the end. Not the case with this book.Much like Carol Wolper's Cigarette Girl and Secret Celebrity, I think the Hollywood mystique the authors are going for are lost. The whole world does NOT revolve around Hollywood, and some people can even get ahead in live without \\"glomming.\\" Guess I should learn my lesson and stay away from Hollywood fiction.I was considering reading Cranberry Queen, too, but The Difference has turned me off from Kathleen DeMarco. She'll have to prove herself for me to pick up another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars?? you have got to be kidding me","review":"This book manages to be dull and boring as well as confusing. I finished it, but it was an effort. Don't waste your time on this waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!","review":"I'm so very glad to have purchased this wonderfully informative DVD, and am very thankful to the good people who produced it. The whole film is laid out in a clear and very effective way to get the message out, this should be mandatory to watch, especially for non believers of the Fatima miracle. Only those whose pride comes first and couldn't employ the mind God gave them would find this a waste. I'll pray for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consecration of Russia to Our Lady Obstructed","review":"This is the most crucial DVD to show the need for Russia to be truly consecrated to Our Lady of Fatima. Previous papal attempts did not mention \\"Russia\\" specifically by name as Our Lady requested, and the Catholic Bishops throughout the world did not join with the Holy Father on one designated day for any consecration to be valid. Time is truly running out and the consecration \\"will be done late\\" [as Our Lord told Sr. Lucia, the last Fatima seer]. The horror is that it appears \\"nations will be annihilated\\" because of the Vatican's repeated failure to obey the Mother of God and do this consecration as Our Lord has requested through Her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Beware","review":"This is a great album, the problem is the so called remastered version released by \\"Candlelight\\" records, it seems to have been recorded directly from a vinyl record, the thing hiccups throughout the whole recording.

Mr. Bernhard's view is perceptive and frank, refreshingly unburdened by the overly familiar political considerations of correctness that tend to suppress the expression of what one really experiences and wants to say. It is the very liveliness of the author's descriptions of Islamic life in Manhattan that makes this book stand out.I would like to see \\"White Muslim\\" present pros and cons less, and stick to recounting the author's observations of the converts and their milieux, pre- and post-conversion, all the more. Overall, \\"White Muslim\\" is a fascinating and important book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great part of an excellent series","review":"I enjoyed every step on Jesse Morgan's adventure. There were surprises all along the way. Each time I read it, it keeps getting better. I wish there were more books in this series because I have read each one many times.

Keep it up, Mr. Cavanaugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"I was looking for a protective case for my PSP that could (at a minimum) carry my PSP, the power cord(s), and ear buds. This product doesn't deliver. This case would've been better if it was bigger, or even if it was smaller. The internet pictures make this look big, but it's a really nice oversided console case with well padded walls that only holds 1-2 UMD disks in it's compartment.I would recommended getting a smaller console case to protect the PSP console/screen, and then getting a toiletry, camera or small duffle bag to store the console case, power cords and games in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trophy House -- ho hum","review":"Rarely do I feel qualified to criticize any author's work. Who am I, a mere reader, to do so? But this novel was one of the worst I've encountered in a long time. The first few pages put me off, but I continued on, hoping to care about at least one of the characters. This was a non-story: empty of emotion, suspense, or character development. Perhaps her other work is good. I'll not waste my time to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer treat","review":"Trophy House is the kind of novel you sneak off to finish reading when you should be doing something else.It's a perfect summer delight--fast paced, clever, humerous--and filled with astute observations about our culture. Whether you hate trophy houses, live in one, or covet one, you'll love this book. Of course it's not just about trophy houses or the folks who inhabit them or try to eradicate them-- it's about marriage, love, friendship, and being a parent. Dannie, the narrator, is the kind of smart, warm woman whom you'd like as a friend. The ending is a wonderful surprise--and absolutely right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses on all levels","review":"I couldn't agree more with the majority of readers who find thisbook vapid, shallow, and completely boring. I cannot understandhow one reader (from Boston) found the author had captured theessence of Cape Cod...I frequently spend time in Truro and Iwas utterly disappointed that neither Truro or the lower Capeever came to life in this book. She might have been anywhere.The characters never came to life and what little we learn of them does not make you want to know more anyway.I gave this l star because there was nothing lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I read and enjoyed other novels by this author, so I looked forward to reading this. I can't remember a more unrelatable, dislikeable protagonist, so self-centered and caught up in her own sensibilities and aesthetics to the extent that other people served as decoration. I agree with the political slant being overworked; the message again is that one's personal aesthetics and sensibilities can trump the rights of other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below expectations","review":"Boring, boring, boring.I kept expecting the story to get better and more interesting, but it never did.The mystery was laughable and the character development was wafer thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"Amateur writing - words, even paragraphs missing; odd vocabulary selections. Hollow, self-absorbed characters suffering from unformed consciences and moral bankruptcy. Extreemist leftist/feminist political tirades that have nothing to do with the story. Self-rightous and judgemental. Hanging plotlines.I knew I wasn't going to like the book by Page 4 when the main character noted that her best friend was \\"not deeply into feminism...\\"Like they say: Those who can't do, teach. I pity Anne Bernays' writing students (especially her potty mouth - very unbecoming). Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"I love books with an Island setting, so when I heard about Trophy House, I had high expectations. I was sorely disappointed. The characters were superficial & highly underdeveloped, and this book did not do justice to the beauty of Cape Cod. I generally read a good book in one day, this realtively short novel took me 4 days as I found it EASY to put down and DIFFICULT to pick back up. If you'd like to read a truly great book this summer try: Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, by Lisa See! 5 stars & more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"I thought this book was superficial and not very well written. There was virtually no emotion shown by the characters. They divorced and remarried in record time, and with nothing more than a vague nod to feelings. The back story of vandalism was ridiculously underdeveloped, as was virtually everything else in this book. I'd pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased this book in part because it was supposed to be part \\"thriller\\". In fact, there is no mystery and no thriller. The crime happens early in the story, and thereafter pretty much disappears. It is not what the book is about. That would have been OK if the story was a strong one. But, as other reviewers have mentioned, there is really no emotional depth to any of the characters, including Dannie. There is no exploration of what makes any of the characters behave the way they do, and so the dissolution of Dannie's marriage has about as much feeling to it as a decision to go out to dinner. I was also dumbfounded by Dannie's observation that her daughter's new boyfriend must have a blue-collar background, because of his large hands. Dannie could not be that dumb. Finally, the title of the book -- \\"Trophy House\\"- actually has little to do with the story. The house is in the story, but is not particularly important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"If I hadn't been stuck on a five hour flight I never would have finished this ....There was no reason for her political rantings and the plot was silly...so much for book reviews, reader reviews are always better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid","review":"My personal rating system for films often gets me to a negative number based on ticket price--for example, an $8 film can get a rating from $8 to minus $8. I gave this novel a high negative number. I review nonfiction, mostly business books, so when I read fiction it is for enjoyment. This novel puzzled me...nothing to it, who are these people and who cares? It seems like it was a series of short stories, disconnected and unfinished. I was miffed at myself for reading to the bitter end, but as I was closing the book I thought of two words: vapid and insipid. I looked up the meaning of those words to be sure they described my sense of this book. Yup, they do. So all is not lost.

These are CD's that use a different format so that video can be included.The problem with CD+G discs is that they don't have very many songs on them. Many of the discs only come with 4 songs, but some of the newer discs have up to 16 songs.It also takes a while for the system to recognize the disc. So, if you want to jump around from song to song and disc to disc, there is a lot of waiting around.The fun thing about this system is that it does have a low resolution camera so that you can watch yourself as you sing.You might want to check out the Leadsinger microphone instead. It is a self-contained unit that comes with 300 songs. It is cheaper than this unit and has some neat features. You can also buy more memory chips for hundres to thousands of more songs and in different languages (but they are expensive).

Everyone who sees this great program starring a youthful Ken Howard and Steven Weber feels totally entranced and captivated by the exciting and convoluted plot.Although the visual and audio quality are that of the '70's, I was eager to come up with the low price, which also included very prompt shipping. AMAZON enabled me to find this long-lost story so my college classes of today could enjoy the experience and learn the lessons contained in this great work of American writer Mark Twain."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the book, avoid this one","review":"A travesty! The book is loaded with wit, irony, humor, great characters. Someone decided to rewrite the story, cast the dullest actors available and put their audience to sleep.

I threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight Into Addiction Treatment","review":"First off, I have read the book many times since I bought it and have learned something new each time I have read it. Dr. Pinsky has really done well in explaining the relationships that form between doctor and patient and how important the establishment of good boundaries is to the process of addiction treatment. It is most obvious to this reader that much effort went into writing this novel and that it is truely an attempt to explain how codependancy can influence one's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Getting It\\"","review":"As a recovering alcoholic, sober for four years, I found this book difficult to put down. Dr. Drew has an understanding of himself that puts him in an unique position to show empathy for the addicted and yet not enable them. My favorite part is when he speaks of \\"Getting It\\" and how important that is for recovery. His postscript reinforces my belief that God is the \\"It\\" needed to recover. A brain on God is better than a brain on drugs or alcohol every day of the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking","review":"More and more, I find the callousness of the insurance industry extraordinary. Treating drug addiction and alcoholism takes time, first to break the physical dependence, and then, much harder, to find and treat the underlying emotional causes.

It's kind of scary in that way. As Mr. Fishman notes in his review, the good doctor bravely admits, in an indirect way, how contemptuous he is towards his patients, getting aroused by his female patients and casually toying with the idea of snuffing the more troublesome ones. It's probably good that we know this about our medical professionals, but it certainly is disturbing knowledge, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, however...","review":"I'm a fan of Dr. Drew, and believe that \\"Cracked\\" brings a lot to the conversation by revealing a doctor's side of addiction.

Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting It","review":"Dr. Drew, on an episode of Loveline, professed the title for his book should have been \\"Getting It\\" and not \\"Cracked-Putting Broken Lives Together Again\\". Drew knows that in his profession \\"he\\" is not the one doing the healing of those who have fallen off the wall, he is simply putting the bottle of glue in their hands and offering encouragement for \\"them\\" to put themselves back together. This is not a fix-it manual. You want to fix an addict, first fix yourself then be present...you be the one offering the glue; that's about all you can do. Once an addict can accept their powerlessness over the addiction then they have the chance to \\"Get It\\".

I've seen Dr.Drew's radioshow loveline change a lot of peoples life cause it offers something alot of people don't have common sense. The callers on that show deserve what they get said to them.

A few times, my hair on the back of my neck stood up during the course of his book. I had no idea, living a somewhat sheltered life, what addiction does to people. And Dr. Pinsky meticulously laid it all out so even I can grasp the pain and anguish these people go through; as they struggle to extirpate their addictions. This book should be required in high school, if all kids read this book, I believe, substance and drug abuse would go way down. Hopefully, Dr. Pinsky has plans to further his writing career, as his writing is sumptuously genuine. Fantastic book!

If you watch Dr. Phil, you will never see him talking about himself at the expense of his patients. With Dr. Phil, the patients come first. Dr Drew perpetuates the self-serving notion that drug addicts can't hack it without the kind of long, EXPENSIVE treatment Dr Drew offers, and he teaches them that they can't help themselves and drug addiction is not their fault. This is a bad lesson that is causing our society to fall apart. Dr. Phil NEVER stoops to this kind of blame-everyone-but yourself method. Dr Phil's method forces the drug addict to take RESPONSIBILITY for her problem and to solve it herself!Dr Drew is part of the problem in today's society. Dr Phil is so much smarter, nicer, and better. If only there were more Dr Phils and fewer Dr Drews in today's addiction treatment profession. Unfortunately, Drew is the rule and not the exception.

I don't have a Germany or Florida but I still hope you read this review. The favor I'd like to ask is that will you please tell Adam to stop making fun of Hawaiians.

I'm a nurse and work in a chemical dependency unit and often throughout the book, I was nodding my head saying to myself \\"oh that is so true!\\" because I deal with many issues presented in this book; from the behaviors, messy rooms etc. What has me curious though is how the older man (patient) is related to this story unless Dr.Drew was a primary care physician at the time in addition to being Medical director on the CD unit. That part kinda confused me, maybe I need to read it again. I recommended it to the other nurses on my unit too and most of them have read it as well. It definately gave me some different perspectives that I never thought of, and helped me understand addiction even more. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks like a full popcorn can","review":"On Dr. Drew's repeated on-air advice I picked this book up, only to wish that I'd spent my $25 on something worth while.

I was gracious enough to skim through your book in the store last week, so the least you could do in return is to give my new novel dozens of favorable mentions on Loveline. I think you'll really enjoy my novel. It's called \\"The Fabulous Fast Life\\". It's about how young girls can have it all if only they can get thin and sexy enough to land the Perfect Man. The heroine is a sex advice columnist for Cosmo who has lots of affairs with married men before she finally lands the hunk of her dreams by using the profound knowledge of male sexuality that Cosmo is renowned for. The story is very true to life and can offer all those confused young women out there a healthy role model, one based on my own life, which has been directly inspired by the characters on HBO's Sex in the City."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"I am a certified pharmacist and I am appalled at the bad medical advice given by the doctor in this book.

Don't ignore me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smugly Preening Autobiography","review":"Should be subtitled Little Golden Thoughts of ME! by Doctor Drew Pinsky.This book is a typical product of our Narcissistic Age. Rather than give us useful information about drug addiction and its psychology, the author focuses on his own feelings to a ridiculous, almost obsessive degree. So vain and self-absorbed is this Pinsky person that his patients don't even register in his mind as living, breathing human beings. No wonder he fails them so often.If you are as obsessed with Pinsky as Pinsky is, then you will love this book. If you are looking for genuine insights into the psychology and treatment of addiction, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"clueless \\"healer\\" harms patients","review":"I HATED this patronizing, pretentious book.Dr Pinsky obviously doesn't understand women. All through the book, he fetishizes them as beautiful, helpless fashion plates who desperately need a daddy figure like the the wise, all-powerful Doctor Drew, whom they must obey unquestioningly. Any patient who doesn't immediately submit to everything Drew says is labeled \\"borderline\\" and is dismissed (maybe not physically dismissed, but mentally). Like too many medical doctors, pinsky has a definite God Complex. This will be obvious to anyone who has listened to his ridiculous radio show. With that kind of mindset, I'm really not surprised most of his patients don't get better under his care. It is a wonder he doesn't end up killing even more of his unlucky patients than he already does. If I had a friend or family member who suffered from addiction, I'd keep them miles away from a quack like pinsky."},{"rating":"1","title":"ignorance is bliss?","review":"The author shows us addiction and recovery from a doctor's perspective. From reading this, I learned that doctors are people too. It was distrubing to read this doctor's thinly veiled description of his own erection while feeling up an attractive, female patient. Even more disturbing was the doctor's account of repeatedly switching a dying patient's life support machine on and off out of morbid curiosity. (I'm not making this up--it's in the book!)Even after years of professional training, the instinct to pulls wings off a fly is still there. Glad I'm not sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say it, but stick to radio, Drew.","review":"I wanted to love this book, I really did. Dr. Drew is something of an idol to me, but writing is just not his thing. The dialogue, true to life or not, is uninspired, the sytax is something out of a phonics book, and Dr. Drew's inner turmoil feels extremely artifical and forced. Dr. Drew is at his best when he's innately diagnosing the pathologies of callers on Loveline. Rehashed sloppily into something that reads like it were produced sans editor, this was a throughly lackluster read.That said, Dr. Drew is the man!

This is only a self-indulgent, poorly written book by some doctor with a radio show who wants to toot his own horn and describe in minute and tedious detail how kind and caring he is. Actually, he comes off like a complete egomaniac who can't see his patients as human beings. Everyone is a stereotype in this self-important twerp's eyes. There are hundreds of much better books on the subject of addiction.

Everyone see how it wasn't Drew who got to interview John Kerry and George W. Bush on international TV? There's a good reason Drew Pinsky can't be trusted to go on prime time and talk to important people. It's because he doesn't have the insight and dignity that Dr. Phil has and also because no one really respects Drew. Read these reviews and then go read the reviews for Dr. Phil. No comparison. People know a real healer like Dr. Phil when they see one, and they naturally respect him. And people also know a publicity hungry clown like Drew when they see one and they laugh at him when they hear him on a trash radio show smelling some idiot comedian's farts. How many fart jokes do you hear on Oprah? Can you hear anything BUT fart jokes on Loveline? That's why Drew \\"interviews\\" Pamela Anderson and Dr. Phil interviews the President. Simple as that.

I do not read many books, but this book sounded appealing, so I bought it, and I don't regret it.Dr. Drew Pinsky takes us into his life, beyond what we hear from him on Loveline with Adam Corolla, to experience the touching, the heart-breaking, stories from just some of the patients that visit his detox clinic everyday, what kind of pain they feel, the struggles they face, and the feelings they experience. I enjoyed reading what Dr. Drew's personal thoughts are about these patients, addicts, or even their visitors. This is really a life-changing book, and the story of Amber really peaked my interest, and tugged at my heart.This book is very well written about a subject that, over the last decade alone, has become part of many lives each day. Dr. Drew, this was an excellent book, and I would recommend it to everyone, as I have already recommended it to many."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book of the Year","review":"I love Dr. Drew for all the help that gives people.

He has inspired me to become and addiction medicine specialist."},{"rating":"2","title":"cracked","review":"Some people start reading this book thinking that it will be about addicted patients. These people will likely be disappointed. I have discovered that it is instead a book about Dr Pinsky... of how he aquired a need to save people, how he satisfies this need with his work, and how his needs may be evolving.I would strongly reccommend this book to people who care about Dr Drew, and want to see what's going on in that head of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honesty","review":"Profound book by a good human being.

This book is not just a book but a piece of art and I think people should respect the tremendous work Dr Drew does for people. If someone is a Loveline listener then I do not se ehow they could not like this book, it is one of my favorite and one of my friends favorites.

For openers, it is written so well that it is a marvel of English usage and will shame most of us that think we know the language. Secondly, it strikes a marvelous balance between pedagogy - for fundamentally this is a serious scholastic work - and the delight that the author takes in his subject.Dealing with Thoreau to great degree, it shows how punning was a significant part of romantic literature, and should not be dealt with contempt, but rather as a serious and significant part of our literary heritage.Plus the humor in both the the subject matter and Professor West's treatment thereof are incomparable. Highly recommended to both the scholar and the interested dilletante atracted to our language and its associated history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth time and money","review":"I used this for three months and didn't see ANY difference.

From what I have read, there is very little known about the causes of cellulite (aside from weight gain) or about what causes it to be more frequent in women than in menn. I also did an \\"anti cellulite\\" diet when using this that had high amounts of fresh fruit vegetables, low sodium fat and carbs and lost weight but did not see a marked difference in the reduction of cellulite. However, once I discontinued using the product my cellulite got worse even though I did not discontinue the diet.

After the first week I did not notice any less dimpling in the leg (thigh) area but did notice that my skin felt tighter as though I had been working out. It's now been about 4 weeks of using it usually only once a day but I have noticed probably a 25% reduction in the appearance of cellulite and the feeling of having more toned legs. Overall, I would recommend this product if you want a little help in the cellulite area but it won't eliminate it completely. Personally, I will continue to use this product on a daily basis. It's easy to apply and doesn't leave the skin oily or sticky and it's reasonably priced compared to other products. The only downfall is I can't find it in stores and have to buy it online."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I have been using this product for years and now can only find it here on line it must be discontinued because it is not sold in stores anymore.

The author needs to get the facts right. Obviously the airlift helped and facilitated the Israeli counterattack (allowing greater freedom to plan military strikes), but the reason for Israel surviving the war were: 1) poor strategic planning by the Arab armies AFTER the war had started (up til that point, they demonstrated brilliant planning) and a misreading of the situation on the battlefield 2) surprising tenacity on the part of the Israeli forces, although they were clearly ill-prepared for the well-coordinated attack and 3) Syria urging Egypt to abandon what, 'til then, was an effective battle plan. If it weren't for these three facts, then the war would have taken a very different course and surely the US airlift would have been a lifesaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book about October War!","review":"I read almost all what is in the market about Yom Kippur War and this book is childish than ex comunist propaganda books!Mr Boyne - leave tha tanks alone!

The authors really try to explain everything and often are successful in this. However the mathematics are difficult to grasp for undergraduate students that do not have a background in mathematics. There are many worked examples in the book. That always helps a lot!I have a few objections:- there are far too many boxed equations, so that students become confused. Unimportant equations, or equations that are just repeated to show that the are not valid anymore should be left out or printed nondescript instead of emphasized- there are many errors in the book. Did nobody see that even the Maxwell equations in Ch. 5 are wrong ??- in the problems, the use of units or the given solutions are often inconsistent"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent intro to electromagnetics","review":"this is a great book. it is written clearly with abundance of examples and problem sets that will help you to understand this rather gruesome topic.best thign about this book is its organization. it begins with a review of relevant topics in vector calculus then goes on to electrostatics, magnetics, electromagnetics, then various applications. topics are covered integrally so that you get a growing sense of a coherent whole as you get further into the book. its well suited for undergraduate text and for self-study alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"scary for kids","review":"This book is very scary for kids and will make them not want to go to the dentist.

Others on the video were Unchained Melody, My True Story, Ten Commandments of Love, Just To Be With You, Life Is But A Dream, and Lovers Never Say Goodbye.

Easier than a chandelier I did last year that caused me to be very creative in cursing. This Mika-Aire fan installed without one foul word emanating from my mouth. After the install went smoothly, I said to myself, now watch, it won't work, or it will be noisy and wobble. To my delight and surprise this fan is very quiet, does not wobble, and man, what a nice looking fan. Best of all, other than the light bulb (a not very green 100 watt halogen), the fan seems to be very efficient, moves a lot of air while only using 40 watts.I am a rough customer and I am very happy with this fan. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary Fan","review":"I chose this fan because of its contemporary look. Little did I know it came with a remote which controls both the light and the fan. This fan is reversible which means that it can be used in summer to cool and in winter to re-distribute the hot air. It also has a dimmer (operated from the control). This is a heavy fan so make sure it is properly mounted. A 2x4 in the ceiling won't do. So far I haven't been able to figure out how to control the fan without the remote which is why I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars. If you loose the remote, good luck I guess. Also if you turn the light off with the remote, you won't be able to turn it on at the wall switch, a bit annoying unless you can rig a three way switch.Other than that, this is a good fan and has a lower profile than other fans which makes it optimal for smaller spaces.I recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and gentle","review":"I love this fan because it is flush mounted on the ceiling. But, I mostly love it because it is very quiet while still doing a great job. Now that I have this one in my bedroom, I am considering purchasing another one for the living room.

Out of the four, two have needed new receivers just after the 1 year warranty ran out. For the 1st one, Minka was willing to send out a new receiver. Although it was a hassle to switch out and we were disappointed that it had to be replaced so soon, at least we were pleased that Minka stood behind their product. For the 2nd one, no such luck. Sorry, says Minka, you're past the 1 year mark. A new receiver is $50. Considering the fans themselves are about $250 each, that seems pretty steep for a part that obviously doesn't last. Plus we get to take the fan apart to hard wire the new receiver in. You decide. Personally, next time we buy a fan, we will look at other brands. A 50% failure rate for the receivers + a waste of our time is enough to send us elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor! (Buyer Beware!)","review":"I bought one of these and the unit failed completely within 5 months of its installation. I contacted Minka, who informed me that they would not honor their warranty because the unit was sold by Amazon. (They would, however, give me the repair part numbers so I could buy them. Nice of them, wasn't it?) Now Amazon tells me that they will not honor the warranty because it was sold more than 90 days ago! So I'm out the entire purchase price of this fan....I find it incredible that Amazon offers goods knowing that the manufacturer will not honor his warranties.Amazon's business has to be built on the trust of customers who are buying products sight-unseen, and I believe their action here is a violation of that trust.I'll certainly not be buying anything associated with the Minka name, and having been burned once I'll have to be more careful before buying anything from Amazon that involves a guarantee of any kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Quality; Easiest Fan To Install Ever!!!","review":"The quality of this fan is as good or better than any fan I've ever owned. I just put one up in my daughter's bedroom, and after installation of the baseplate I was done in less than 10 minutes. They've even made installation easier by pre-installing the remote control's receiver at the factory (although they haven't updated the instruction booklet to reflect this yet). All in all - unlike previous fan installation experiences - I actually ENJOYED putting this fan up!!! It looks great and works great - I couldn't be more pleased. I'm buying three more to replace the rest of the small fans in my house - the Minka-Aire F518-WH is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite nice","review":"Great fan, relatively easy to install -- even with the remote. The engine is extremely quiet, but the blades make quite a \\"whoosh\\" going through the air (presumably a function of the extremely wide blades or the fact that there are only three blades).Only complaint is that it does not seem to integrate with a wall switch already wired for a separate light and fan. Not a big deal, though, because the remote is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!","review":"Just having a remote control with no manual controls makes for tough troubleshooting.

She tells me that they'll call me back when they return. I still haven't received a call from them. When I called back I was placed on hold and heard my cue on line from 7 to zero, but they still won't pick me up. I had it at this time and decided to pack up the fan and return it for a full refund.

I've only had mine for about a week, but so far it operates well: the fan is silent and doesn't wiggle. a few things to consider: you have to use the remote control to change the fan speed and turn the light on/off. its a neat feature, but unnecessary in my book. and if you're prone to losing remote controls, beware! it does come with a little wall-mount though, which would reduce your chances of misplacing it. Also, FYI: the fan blades are plastic. they look just fine, and it doesn't bother me at all, i'm just pointing it out because they appear to be metal in the photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fan and great buy","review":"Comes complete: fan, light, remote.

Not sure if the fan is a lemon or if the distributor sent me a refurbished model, but if you like this fan, you should go to a lighting store to buy it-online is too risky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk...DO NOT BUY...lasted 4 months....","review":"Looks good, appears to be well-designed, but the fan suddenly quit working. The light works, but not the fan. Minka warranty says you must return it to original place of purchase for repair or replacement...So far Amazon does not have a way to honor this as it falls outside normal return procedure.After contacting Amazon, they offered a 25% credit and keep the fan or return it for a full refund...I opted for the refund and they sent a UPS shipping label..so hats off to Amazon customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but useless","review":"Great for a conversation piece.

At about year 4 I had lots of problems with the remote--could never change the direction of airflow and it always seemed to revert back to the wrong direction. Year 5 the fan stopped working and although the motor has a lifetime warranty I was happy to have an excuse to replace it.

Much sturdier, durable and professional-looking than big box fans. Nearly silent at the lowest speed. Excellence in materials, design, durability.

At first sometimes the fan would reverse, other times the light would come on, and at still other times the speed would go from fast to slow. These problems were manageable as they could be fixed using the remote. But now the fan speed stays on slow all the time and just won't budge. Ceiling fans should last years and years. I would absolutely never buy another Minka product."},{"rating":"2","title":"silent and works well","review":"The fan was easy to install. It looks awesome, does a nice job cooling the kitchen but a little disappointed with the light. It's a 100w bulb but the globe is frosted and reduces how bright it actually could be.

The photos of this Truss System looked like most other truss systems that sell for MUCH more money, so I decided to go for it.The system is made in China. Assembling the system was straight forward... no rocket science required here.... It takes 2 people to put the truss on the stands (duh). The truss is solid. In order to transport the system I ordered a $30 Truss bag (forget the boxes... they were never meant to be used to carry this system). With Amazon Prime the 2 day shipping of the 50lb system was free.All in all, a great bargain for the price. I took one star off the rating because one of the plastic handles for the Twist-knobs was broken when it arrived... nothing some Superglue couldn't handle... just cosmetic stuff.Again, considering the price, a good deal. I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truss extremely difficult to assemble, store, and maintain","review":"We purchased this because it was wide enough to fit over our sound table. Be aware that it is extremely difficult to assemble even with directions. The multiple cardboard storage boxes fall apart easily, so you will have to purchase additional storage or lots of duct tape and bungy cords. Also purchase several extra hex bolts, nuts and drivers because they will be easily lost every time it is assembled and disassembled. The best thing about this purchase is that we didn't have to pay shipping on the extremely heavy truss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good instructional DVD if you want to Lambada!","review":"I thought this DVD was excellent to learn the basic steps of Lambada.

When I configured the wireless card to hook up to my network, I did it using the XP wizard, since that what what appears first after the hardware was installed and recognized. The connection worked fine.However, I then rebooted and the software driver with the card is configured to autoload. It does so after the XP wireless manager. So initially the connection was there, but once the card software was loaded it lost it. I had to repeat the configurations I set up in XP under the Card software. I found no way to disable the card software, and it gives no option to sync with the xp network settings.Other than that hiccup, card has worked great and have had good quality connections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Money Counts","review":"The book was received in the promised time frame.

This is what the Co-Pastor at my church is using in her women's season bible study. Michelle is such an awesome author because she is so serious about being an instrument of righteousness for the Lord and she basically is saying in this book that if you want to be blessed and highly favored in the sight of our heavenly Father than you have to seek Him early, seek Him reverently, seek Him prayerfully and seek Him as if nothing else on earth really matters. This book lets you know that those of us who half step with the Lord as far as being in His will , will always be half blessed. I strongly recommend all of her books.

I am keeping my highlighted copy..and buying another copy to pass on. The thing we should do most often, but actually seem to do least is to look within ourselves and be painfully honest in dissecting our heart & mindset. This book is full of material that is provoking us to look within, to see how deeply we are seeking God & his will. I cant say enough of how great this book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hallelujah...finally!!!!","review":"This book is awesome. Michelle starts right off telling it like it is. She does not sugarcoat or tap dance around the fact that in order to truely be blessed in the things of God, that you must first...SEEK GOD. So many preachers, teachers, and the like are telling the body of Christ to come get your stuff, but not telling the body of Christ that there are some rules and regulations along with it. The Word of God says...Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added. Somehow we have gotten away from that.

The book is self-consistent in the sense that reader will not need to know any preliminary knowledge in this area even from physics and chemistry. You will not see any big formula. Readers who are quite femilar with basic concepts will probably find some parts boring but, to me, it is fine to hear them from another point of view emphasizing important phenomena in liquid crystals."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish!","review":"This really is one of the most inaccurate guides to HK I have ever seen.

Some inaccuracies from 1994 are still here and sections like entertainment are terrible - there is more to life than the local Hard Rock cafe.

I can't believe some of this [stuff] is even in here.I highly recommend the reader to learn card magic from great authors such as Jean Hugard, S.W. Erdnase, and Arthur H. Buckley.If you are a beginner, get the \\"Royal Road to Card Magic\\" By Hugard and Braue. It is of MUCH higher value and the tricks in this book will be 100x better than the stuff that's in Bob Longe's books.

I have had a look at the 2600+ games and there's as awful as I remember them. So that portion, whilst extensive, is only there for a nostalgia kick or if you absolutely have an old 2600 game you loved. The arcade parts are great though. My friend owns a real Asteroids machine and so I know how spot on the arcade version of Asteroids is. Plus the games store your high-scores - an important aspect I think.Everything is included - overlays, controls, side art and backgrounds are visible to give the true arcade look. They can even be toggled on and off if you'd rather play the arcade game fullscreen. Lots of background info is included as well as fun challenge modes and enhanced graphic options.If you want pure Atari arcade conversions this is the one to buy - the 2600 games and the background info and extra graphics are just the icing on the cake.For the price you can't go wrong. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its what I expected.","review":"The item arrive in good time and good shape. It's the games I remember from my childhood and they are great fun.

Like all of the Robinson's writing it is more character driven than plot driven as are his other works I've read - The Mars series and Years of Salt and Rice, and his climate change trilogy. This one was more enigmatic, but very provocative. It is the story of an amnesiac on an improbable world that allows the author to explore, but not answer, themes such as the nature of beauty, memory, relationships, the essence of being, and the perils or rewards of social interactions. It is as strange a story as I have ever read, but oddly satisfying, despite its abrupt ending.

Though I knew it would be different before reading, this short story was quite a shock.Dream-like in the way events transpire, the main character's journey seems to be a vehicle for the telling of many disparate ideas. The world and it's inhabitants are interesting as concepts, several of which are quite good, like the plant people, but the characters never reached the level of development that would have have made me believe or care about what was happening. I finished it unsatisfied.I can not recommend the book for fans of the work of Kim Stanley Robinson. Read The Years of Rice and Salt instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little Slow","review":"I have read the Mars Trilogy and Antarctica, and really enjoyed them. One of the author's best gifts is the interactions between characters- in all of the other books, I found the introspections a bit slow- this story doesn't show a lot of connections to others- and so feels much less real than his others- I won't pass this one on to my friends-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Here","review":"I'm a big Kim Stanley Robinson fan; this book is not the reason. No plot, no characters, no resolution. The reviewers who like the book claim that it has deep symbolic meaning.

The text is set up in four columns across a two-page spread which is great for comparison purposes. However, in this volume (Hardcover-ISBN-0310903335), the type (font) is so small and the pages are so thin that I find it difficult to read the text (the font is TINY and the words from the previous page show through) - and this coming from someone with 20/20 vision. I cannot imagine how it would be for someone of age or with less than perfect vision.I would recommend that you go to a brick and mortar store and see this Bible FIRST to decide if it is right for you. I wish I had actually seen the text before making an online purchase. I had planned to use this Bible as my main reading Bible but it will remain on the shelf, used only as a reference. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT Disappointed. . .","review":"Unlike a prior reviewer, I definitely don't have 20/20 vision. However, I found the layout of this Bible very amenable to Bible study. I particularly appreciate Zondervan's giving the Amplified translation more room in the NT so that the total Bible size can be held down. Certainly these pages are thin, and I probably wouldn't recommend a lot of marking on them, but again, this was done in the interest of holding the total size and weight to a reasonable level. And yes, I consider it reasonable; I've got other study Bibles as heavy as this one. I won't give 5 stars because I think construction quality should be better, but we'll just keep the bookbinders in business! All parallel Bibles have to necessarily be a compromise and I think this is a superb one.

I'm quite paranoid about SIDS but am also very concerned with my baby getting cold at night without a blanket, so this is the perfect solution. I dress my son in a regular weight long sleeve sleeper and socks, then zip him up in this sleep sack. This way, I don't have to put a potentially dangerous blanket in the crib. He stays warm and comfy, and we both sleep better because of it. The only caveat I can see with it is that the shoulder velcro is very strong stuff--i'm sure it needs to be, for the product to stay on a wiggly baby--but if you're trying to put it onto an already sleeping baby or change a diaper in the middle of the night, good luck doing so without waking the baby! The velcro is VERY loud when you undo it. Other than that, this product is worth every penny for the peace of mind it gives you. After all, what's worth more than your baby's safety?"},{"rating":"1","title":"velcro on shoulders!","review":"I bought this for my daughter because she needed larger sleep sacks and I like the zip around feature.

It took a while to realize that the scratches on her face were from the velcro on the shoulder straps. I stopped using these sleep sacks that day and bought new ones with snaps at the shoulders. There is a small warning on the tag that says to not put the velcro closure near your baby's face because it could scratch. How can you not put your baby's shoulder near her face?? I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone. I would recommend saving your money on this product and buying a better sleep sack without velcro closures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Velcro tabs a pain! :(","review":"I love the concepts of sleepsacks- and our son is very cozy in them. The Kiddopatamus brand is usually reliable- we couldn't have done w/o their swaddlers for his first 4 months. However, the design of this product is flawed- it was a good idea in theory to have a zip around sleepsack so could put a sleepy baby in it without having to deal with putting their arms through holes like the Halo sack, BUT the velcro tabs are horrible! They are at a level where they scratched my son's cheeks/chin whenever he'd sleep with his head turned to one side. I tried attaching them loosely and snugly to see if it was just the level where I had velcroed them in place- but no- it's definitely a design flaw. We stopped using this sack and purchased several of the Halo sleepsacks- spend the few extra bucks and save yourself the pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Sleep Sack","review":"I love this sleep sack.

Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of Kiddopotamus products but this one failed to impress.

It's a little big but isn't so big that it could cover her head or her arms could slip out of the armholes. I'm glad she can grow into it. There are Velcro fasteners at the shoulders and over the zipper tab. I wish there were snaps instead. I feel like with snaps you could get the same result, but without the noise of the Velcro. To do a diaper change with the sack on, I slide my fingers under the Velcro tab and pull down the zipper when I don't want to mess with the Velcro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try with Baby First","review":"There are so many sacks to choose from so I bought this because it was inexpensive. My son is in 6 month clothing so I bought a larger size. The neck was too big and the velcro - in order to be secure - are too loud when they need to be undone. I will be returning this and probably purchasing the Halo version - mostly due to the velcro being so loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratchy velcro","review":"I purchased this sleep sack because I liked the idea of the zip around the bottom, and I still do. the sleep sack unzips all the way around which means you can lay it down and zip a sleeping baby into it easily which has worked really well for us.One BIG negative is the hard scratchy velcro on the shoulder tabs. Although I am always very careful to cover the hard velcro when I do it up, my daughter has a habit of twisting her head all the way to one side and she has woken up with very angry looking scratch marks several time, once even in the middle of the night and it really was very red and scratched.The sleep sack is well designed with the zipper, but I am not fond of the velcro and plan to remove it and add snaps before I use this one again.I'm giving it two stars for the zip around design, it loses the rest because of the velcro."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"This is a fabulous sleep sack!It is soft, easy to get on and very cozy. Our son sleeps in these to keep him warm while minimizing the risk of SIDS, and I highly recommend it! He used the Kiddopotamus Swaddle Me wraps until he was 4 months old, and then we switched to these, and both products were GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this video the same day I received it","review":"I would not even give this video 1 star, but they dont give you any other options. It is clearly an amaturely produced video, probably using a home video camera. Editing was crudely done with brief blank pauses and random photos inserted. All this video consists of is an interview with an ex funeral director breifly explaining caskets,embalming and the like.

This product did horrible things to my skin. I have never had an allergic reaction in my life, but after using this product for 2 days, my face puffed out and grew red. I took a Claritin, which reduced the puffiness, but my skin continued to look as though I had overdid at the tanning salon. The product literally gave me a sunburn! I had to buy an over-the-counter medication to reduce the inflammation. I am horrified by this product,and hope it doesn't have long-term effects on my skin. Do NOT buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"YUCK! I am really starting to think many of these rave reviews are fake, because go on over to Makeupalley and everyone else hates this product as well. I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one. It was literally unusable. It made my face look muddy, not natural at all. And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn't use that much! It just looked so bad, I didn't feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I had hoped for","review":"I don't like to wear any makeup and was hoping that this would just feel like a moisturizer going on.

It \\"clumped\\" and \\"gummed\\" on my face after my shower. I used it on top of my normal regimen of face serum, etc., and it would peel and leave \\"pills\\" of gummed up brown goo [because its tinted], so I tried it on my bare face, because I need a moisturizer and SPF protection, and the same thing happened. I could not believe it!

I apply a light, even coating of moisturizer to my face and neck--right out of the shower--and it gives me a healthy glow without having to wear foundation. It does look dark coming out of the tube, but it lightens as you spread it over your skin, and I also appreciate that it is unscented. My daily makeup routine consists of this moisturizer, eye makeup, blush, and lipstick. Even on my wedding day I wore only this moisturizer as my foundation, with a dusting of Mineral Veil to reduce shine. I particularly appreciate the SPF 30 because I burn with very little exposure. I do add sunscreen if I'm going to be outside for a while (mountain biking, water park, picnic, etc.) but this is all I need for daily protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I am sorry to hear that this item has been discontinued.

It doesn't work any better than other moisturizers, in fact I prefer the texture of other moisturizers and this one also has an odd smell. You can buy Olay or even the generic brand moisturizers with SPF and they have the same ingredients and work great. I will not be buying this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slides off my face","review":"I bought the untinted moisturizer, because I was looking for just a lightweight product that I could use on my face as sunscreen. I was disappointed. As soon as my face began to sweat at all, it became slippery and very wet. I have tried using less lotion, with the same effect. I followed the directions, saying to apply directly after cleansing. I'll try something else now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite!","review":"This particular figure is the favorite \\"pirate.\\" Wonderful pirate play fueled by imagination!

This book is a terrific addition to anyone's recipe collection. There is such a wide variety of recipes here, and each is unique and delicious. I love that the recipes are separated by season. This allows me to thumb through and find a light bread (summer, spring) or a heavy one (winter, fall), depending on what I'm looking for. Also, I must mention that this book was my very first attempt at baking bread ever -- and it went off without a hitch! I think Hensperger's book is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice pictures, but.....","review":"Not a book I can recommend. Though it is filled with nice photographs of bread with interesting-sounding flavors and combinations of ingredients, many of the recipes just don't work for one reason or another. Anyone seriously interested in baking should consider The Bread Baker's Apprentice by Peter Reinhart. This book also has great photos of interesting breads, and they all work flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I like anything DK.

This is nothing more than a fold up pad that you can lay on. It's about an inch thick. It does not make sliding in and out easier, in fact it makes it harder because the pad sticks to the concrete or the asfault. A peice of thick cardboard works better than this does I think.

You can learn as much for free by looking at some of the preview samples that other Instructional Videos Providers have.

It is also a relatively recent work, published in 2004, and has a fresher, more modern perspective than some of the older books on the subject, such as those by Fulton Sheen and Arthur Pink.If you are familiar with other works by Hauerwas, this one has less humor by comparison (appropriately to the topic, I would say).Another excellent, longer book on the same subject is \\"Death on a Friday Afternoon,\\" by Richard John Neuhaus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Poetic","review":"Stanley Hauerwas writes with poetic passion that is moving and causes one to reflect deeply on the cross and God. This book is about the seven last sentences of Jesus from the cross. Hauerwas reflects on their meaning in a very deep, yet simple way. This is a short read, but not a shallow read. It is deeply devotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paint Shaker really shakes!!","review":"I didn't know exactly the mechanism used to shake the paint. I knew it was air driven, but with how much force. Well, I can say that if you plan on using it as a table top shaker, forget it. Even if you bolted it down to the top of your bench, it would shake everything off the table. With 100 psi of air driving the piston, this baby shakes, rattles and rolls, literally.I don't have the room in my shop to mount it to a stand that was bolted to the floor, so I opted to mount it to the bottom of my large drill press.

This right wing drivel lacks clarity and is horribly biased against our children and public schools. Public schools are the great equalizer of our society, allowing ALL children the right to an education.Peter comes across as unfair. He leaves out facts that make our schools look great.Everyone in the world wants an American education. Why is that if our schools are so poor? Our schools are overrun with applications from other countries, people paying to send their kids to our public schools instead of attending their private schools.The teacher's \\"unions\\" are the first to support teacher testing and support strong qualifications for teachers. Brimelow uses half truths to constantly support his message."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is time someone insert some facts into this discussion","review":"I have worked at both public and private schools.

I am personally familiar with Peter Brimelow although it took me awhile to getting around to purchasing this particular work. I just recently read it and have to recommend it due to its thoroughness and its exposure of the teacher unions' true nature. Two reviews in Education Next derided the text for its derisive and condescending tone. Certainly there are sentences that one can easily find which are overwrought, but overall, Brimelow's tone is dispassionate and informative. When one considers that each year the taxpayer throws more and more money into education in America (over 750 billion this year alone), and that so much of this lucre finds its way into the teacher unions, it is easy to see that Worm in the Apple is a valuable addition to the public square. Indeed, it is an absolute necessity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sneaker","review":"If you don't mind sneakers with laces, you will love these shoes. I got it for my 2 year old and he loves it.

She doesn't shut up!","review":"I have tried many DVDs for yoga from various instructors. Almost all of them are excellent...just to mention Rodney Yee, Barbara Benagh. This particular DVD I find completely annoying since she doesn't shut up! I couldn't get passed the first minute of it. She seems to have a DVD for everything but she is the master of nothing and certainly not yoga. Not professional, keeps talking beyond the necessary explanations.

I had read good things about Body Burn so I thought I'd give it a go. I honestly like Yoga Buns better, but I also enjoyed Body Burn. I like how it's split into sections- a 20 minute section on burning and all different poses, 10 minutes on legs, 10 minutes on abs, and 10 minutes on relaxation stretches. Some of the poses in this DVD are the same as in Yoga Buns, but I feel like this DVD is more fast paced with less instruction, which is fine for me, but for a beginner it might be hard. I think Denise is more peppy in Yoga Buns.

Denise Austin's cues were completely out of sequence and at times I didn't know what was going on or what to do next. I was wondering does she think I have eyes like a spider that I can see the TV while facing down on the floor mat. She also doesn't give you sufficent time to get into the yoga poses. Moves to quickly to enjoy yoga. I was extremely upset and ready to ditch the DVD. I thought yoga is suppose to be calming but not with Denise Austin. Oh and lets not forget her voice - annoying. I just started Yoga a year ago and watch Steve Ross on Oxygen at 6:00 am, and also brought Ellen Barrett super slimdown crunch: Pilates Yoga Blend and I can say now they know how to cue. I had purchased a Denise Austin video years ago and it was the same issue - her cueing, out of sequence or never called out. I was hoping she had taken the time to read her viewer comments and made some changes to her workouts. Guess not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray!

The DVD features YOGA BURN, which ignites the body's internal furnace with aerobic-paced yoga moves that burn calories for an incredible fat meltdown; YOGA LEGS, which sculpts leaner, longer legs with dynamic yoga poses that challenge balance, flexibility, and strength; YOGA ABS, which strengthens and shrinks your midsection using core-focused yoga moves to define a trimmer, tighter tummy; and YOGA RELAX, in which you quiet your mind with a series of gentle yoga stretches that rejuvenate and refresh the body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Yoga Workout!","review":"This is not a slow motion yoga stretch tape.

I'm very happy with it; it is easy to complete all four sequences within an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leary about doing yoga? Get this DVD.","review":"I have never taken or done yoga before. I was knew to it. This DVD is great for beginners. It has about 4 20-30 minute sessions along with a relaxation session at the end. Yoga is great for people suffering from anxiety and depression and is great for overall physical health. If you're a beginner, this DVD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Workout but More Explanation Needed","review":"I did this work-out for the first time today. I've never done any type of Yoga before but have done Denise's Hit the Spot Pilates. Although I enjoyed the work-out, I agree with the other reviewer who said that Denise does a poor job of cueing or explaining the moves/positions before she begins doing them. A few times I had to stop the DVD, because I was in plank pose with my head facing the floor, so that I could see what she was doing. I was unable to follow otherwise.This is a challenging work-out, but not so difficult that you won't be able to keep up if you sometimes pause to see what Denise is doing. I think that after doing this work-out a second or third time it will be easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known better","review":"I've tried Denise Austin's DVDs before and have always found them fast paced and advanced there is no beginner for her. She moves quite quickly and doesn't always cue what she's wanting you to do. She's great for someone who is very in shape and used to the quick. But she advertises this for beginner to intermediate and that is very misleading. The cooldown was more my pace and reminded me of correct position in some of the moves that I haven't used in a while.I'll come back to this once I've gotten back in to shape. For now I've ordered a Suzanne Deason DVD to help me. She's more instructive and allows you to learn the poses before rushing you throught to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAST ATTACK SEAWOLF","review":"READ IT FROM COVER TO COVER IN ONLY 10 MINS -WAS REALLY SURPRISED AND DISSAPOINTED.

I just listened to the whole album in the car and really liked 85% of it. The album is a compalation of 12 different songs, but they are all very club-trance-dancy. The lyrics are very simple but that is to be expected with a trance influenced album.All of songs on the album will be remixed by Paul and other Dj's and will sound totally different at the club.

It is very much in the pop-techno category- \\"Faster Kill Pussycat\\" sung by actress Brittany Murphy comes to mind. Even still, some of the individual tracks are exceptional. \\"Not Over\\" is one of my all-time favorite songs. Ryan Tedder (now famous as the singer from One Republic song \\"Apologize\\") has an amazing voice and is on 3 of the tracks. There are a few random songs on this CD that straight-up suck though: \\"No compromise\\" and \\"Feed Your Mind\\". Overall, I love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transition?","review":"I think that this is not what I am used to from Paul. I have followed his music for quite some time and this is a huge departure from his gentle, relaxing tracks that I love so much. More House-ish, in a cheap c.d. kinda way. My opinion. I bought and I would part with it easy. I long for transport!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still listening to Oakie?? You are missing out on OTHER good talent..","review":"Um..So, if you bought this and think it should be on the top 10 or 100 list for Billboard, then great, you are the audience that he is targeting. And, the audience he has sold out his profession too. I am not saying that the production is mediocre, because it is flawless, but he shunned his craft a long time ago, and for that, those who know him through the 8 hour live sets he used to spin, feel that it is time to move on.I am sorry, I lost respect when I saw him in Chicago at the Congress, and he only played an hour and a half, and albums like 'Bunkka' and 'A Lively Mind' did that to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oaken-WHAT?! Fold this disaster!","review":"I always thought Oakenfold's music required no review reading or music sampling prior to a purchase. He has greatly disappointed me, and I have no idea what he was trying to do with this CD. It has no classic Oakenfold theme and the music is all over the board, which would be fine if it sounded remotely good. All in all he represents everyone under the moon except for himself. You hear cheesy rock, lame hip hop (he and a rapper are just yelling each others name back and forth...????), and some gum popping Pop/Trance/House. What happened to the good old Bunkah Days where his music was inspiring. If you're considering this purchase forget about it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uber great Trance-Pop","review":"Oakenfold is a fantastic DJ, and fans of his usual material usually scoff at his artist colaberation albums, but I say bring on more! Oakie does a fantastic job mixing electro, trance and pop into a new and fantastic genre. Hell, the title track Faster Kill Pussycat featuring Brittany Murphy is worth the retail price alone.The tracks come at you in a frantic pace that should keep you dancing all night, or bobbing your head in the car until your neck cramps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Album and Great Performer Live!","review":"Just saw Paul Oakenfold in Seattle supporting his new album and I must say that he knows how to get a crowd going!..he also took the time to come over to me and sign my copy of A Lively Mind as well as the first single! After a quick handshake from this artist I stand by my review not only as a great album (I own almost all of his catalog!) but also him as a performer. I think this album should not be overlooked and deserves a listen many times over. You must also not overlook the fact that he has incredible connections in the music industry that come to him for remixes on their albums...Madonna, U2, Lopez...the list goes on! Keep em' coming Paul and THANK YOU for the experience and opportunity to meet you as well. Your #1 fan in Seattle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"What is going on with this guy these days? This CD is really bubble gum, and not the familiar Oakenfold we have come to love over the years. Want a good one? Try Creamfields or Great Wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LAME MIND....","review":"It's been hit-and-miss with Oakey, lately. I hope he reads reviews because he needs to get back on the mark. I almost bought this album without reservation until I listened to the clips on Amazon and read the reviews. Good thing I didn't; it would be collecting dust by now.I heard Faster Kill Pussycat on XM radio and it was awesome. However, I didn't realize it was the Nat Monday mixed version that XM was playing, and not the pathetic standard version on this album. If you want the Nat Monday version, buy the Faster Kill Pussycat single available on Amazon for under $8. It has several versions of that song mixed. Otherwise, I advise skipping A Lively Mind completely, especially if you're more into Oakenfold classics like Tranceport, Another World and Creamfields (my favorites). And I thought The Club was bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring, nondescript state of mind","review":"This is not a mix album, and that's ok. The problem is the songs on this CD are pretty forgettable. The only decent track that is worthy of more than one listen is track 10. \\"Not over\\". The lame attemtp to make fun of christians or believers in \\"praise the lord\\" is well, lame; and it's also a horrible song musically speaking.Really, I'm not trying to exaggerate or make a point by giving this a 1 star. Few if any \\"uplifting\\" moments typical of good trance/dance music are found in this disc. \\"Save the last trance for me\\" has a rather deceiving title. With that title you'll be thinking, oh this is gonna ba a bangin' anthem but it's just a rather nondescript and boring track.Paul Oakenfold sounds like he was trying to convert little kids who only dig top 40 hip up and rock, into a more \\"lively mind\\" by listening to this junk. If you're looking for a good dance/trance album or an album with good songs in it, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Trance Record","review":"I was so disappointed by this album. I've relied on Paul Oakenfold for good trance since the early days but this is not it. It is just more of the same stuff he did on Bunka -- only not as good. If you like trance music, do yourself a favor and try listening to DJ Tiesto instead of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full size is NOT sized for a full size bed","review":"This product would be excellent but runs fully 4\\" too narrow and 3\\" too short.

I bought it bc my 10 month old won't eat baby food anymore and I was hopeing for some better ideas for what to feed him now. All of the recepies for people under 12 months are either pures or contain egg. Almost all of the ones for children over 12 months contain lots of milk and cheese some even contain nuts.

What a mistake! I cannot stress how poor this software is. $30 is not much to pay for a basic product, but it is a lot to pay for nothing.Due to a raft of bugs it is virtually impossible to achieve anything productive. It's a struggle to even draw a set of walls. As for trying to get the software to show the wall dimensions....forget it! Walls start to mysteriously dissapear, text starts to collide on the design obscuring values, and some of the graphics don't print including the measurements. The design file becomes 'corrupted' preventing any new graphics being added...and I suspect it's .dxf export function doesn't produce valid .dxf files, which means the design/work is stuck in the software. Who ever developed this software needs to consider a career change. I won't mention the software test team because I'm assuming there isn't one. Amazon, dump this product!A professional software developer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff!!!!!","review":"Wanted a software program to help design my kitchen. This software was not the latest, therefore, the price reflected that. Fine print says to make sure your computer is compatible with the software as it is not returnable. I made sure it was compatible based on what the description said on the website. Unfortunately it was NOT compatible. Tried several times unsuccessfully. Even called tech support. They couldn't help me either. Since I can't return it I am throwing it away. At least I didn't spend a fortune on it. Sad when you can't even believe the claim that it will be compatible when they say it will be.

I gave up trying to set up a simple room plan using the wizard after half a dozen attempts, then drew the walls manually. It defaulted to the exterior dimensions (i.e. including a random wall thickness) so all my measurements were off. Then found I had to add a floor (which it doesn't default to the room size!).I was designing a bathroom and it does not include square or rectangular shower enclosures as options, nor is it possible to put in glass partitions.Pretty hopeless really.

Our house burned down so I bought it again to create a new plan. Can't believe I wasted my money on this junk. There are so many bugs and convolutions that I spend more time trying to get it to work right than I do designing. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when you are working on one floor, adding walls, doors and fixtures it mostly works. Anything beyond that and you better do some meditation 'cause your gonna get pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and quality.","review":"I'll just ADD to the other reviews, but I must complain about the harness buckles.1. Safety harness/belt buckles - my wife's finger was bleeding recently - that's how hard they are. Extremely hard to open and close.2. Reclining back rest. There are three positions and you need to pull up a locking handle behind the back rest, then recline. Almost impossible to adjust - it gets stuck, you need to use force, it then \\"snaps\\" into the new position. Don't even try to change the angle with baby in the seat - you may hurt the baby when it snaps.3. The removable plastic food tray. It arrived slightly deformed. It's not completely flat, so it wobbles in its base and makes noise.4. Static. Because the chair is entirely made of hollow plastic parts - it's like a static dust and hair magnet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Age Chair Rocks!","review":"We just adore this super cute Space Rockety chair.

His absence leaves his mother and wife vulnerable and they are attacked, raped and killed by samurai.Back from war, our young man -- now a hero -- is recruited to hunt down these women who are themselves hunting down our young man's fellow samurai.From such meager offerings Director Kaneto Shindo creates this 1968 movie.We can't outrun our misdeeds. This lesson is apparent not only impaled by the women but also our young hero himself. Is he not numbered among the guilty for what happened to his mother and wife? It is this film's answer to that question that in my humble opinion more than the movie's eerie graphics contributes to its powerful sense of mood and enduring appeal.I recommend this movie to Japanese officiandos interested in moving past Kurosawa, in lovers of good ghost stories and of course those who just enjoy a genuinely good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"If you are into 1960's-70's Japanese movies or cult films you will like this. The Blu-ray version is superior to normal dvd. Definetly worth renting first then decide to buy, as you have to be into this type of genre. Not scary like the ring and hair etc but entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Samurai Horror Movie","review":"I enjoyed this video very much and passed it on to friends to enjoy, too. Sure wish you carried more like movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Jackie Chan?","review":"Where is Jackie Chan? I cannot believe the guy playing this super lousy film is J.C. Whoever he is, he is sooooo uncomfortable with his role. The whole movie is absurd, with no connection between scenes, ridiculous dialogue, impossible situations. Funny? You mean grotesque. Melodramatic? You mean ludicrous. Action? You mean kicking and screaming like children. Female acting? You mean degrading women. In short, the worst movie by J.C. I have seen in a long, long time. And I will not go into considering the other guy playing J.C. sidekick. My goodness, what a miserable acting. And the rest of the players are pitiful, to say the least. In short, do yourself a big, big favor, and forget this movie was ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, at least its entertaining","review":"I love Jackie Chan, so it pains me to give this movie a mediocre at best review. There must be some contract with action stars that requires them to do a lame baby movie at least once in their carreer (I'm looking at you Vin Diesel). As to this one, its not per se a bad movie, the action is decent, but the story is fairly weak, following the usual, \\"I'm so cool I don't need kids around, but wait I reluctantly have to take care of a kid, and after some time really like the kid and eventually must save it\\" story. There are of course the standard poopy diaper and peeing in the face jokes one would expect as well. So why didn't I give it one star, well, the actors are pretty good, given what they have. And Jackie pulls off a few great action/comedy moments. So in all, the movie is not particularly great, but was watchable. Recomended if you're looking for another jackie chan film, or are really into cliche baby movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this mascara!","review":"I have been using this for a few days now and I love it!

Thats right only three strikes per player...1 2 3!!! Forget about doing an irish whip into the ropes because the person being whipped can get out of it everytime by press square and I mean everytime, attacking from outside the ring, forget that too because it never works.

I grew up watching wrestling and while I dont watch it much anymore, it is fun to play with all the guys I grew up watching.

The commentating gets a little old but you can turn it down and listen to music ( I have found that listening to 80s rock really takes you back.)I cant say much about the career modes or special features because I mainly play a few matches to break up the monotony of Ncaa and Madden football games.

I haven't played this newest version of this game but I did play Legends Of Wrestling 1 & 2 and they were both horrible in terms of gameplay.

Macho Man, Sid Vicious, Sting, DDP, Owen Hart, Nasty Boys, Steiner Bros, the list goes on. All of the above mentioned people are NOT IN the legends of wrestlemania game, though obviously some aren't in it for a reason. (Sting was never in WWE.)Unfortunately, the fun factor just doesn't exist. This game is really blande. I honestly enjoy legends of wrestling 2 more, gameplay wise, because of the special referee option, and it simply has a better fun factor. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the roster this one has.I wish there could be a modern next-gen game that had a roster like THIS, but had great gameplay.

The deceased wrestlers' memorial was touching and Bret Hart's how-to sections of the game were a real treat.

I got to admit I'm one, but this game just doesn't do it for me. The controls are not good. When you press a button and two seconds later, they do the move, it's not really good. I do like the Classic Matches mode where you control a certain wrestler at pivotal parts of the match and I also like the fact that there are so many wrestlers to choose from. Other than that, there's not really much to this game. If you got SmackDown: HCTP or Def Jam Vendetta, you're better off playing thoses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Names that pack a waek punch","review":"This game is full of some of the greatest wrestlers of all time. I was looking forward to its realease for some time. It of course is missing a few of the biggest names(like Ric Flair) but that is the least of this games problems. The game is not challenging on any level of difficulty and the career mode just plain sucks.

The wrestler seem smallcompared to SmackDown.Look I have been a wrestling fan for about 20 years now andThis game really disappointed me.

Not much story, too much dancing around. Kind of chilidish for grownups and hard for kids to understand some of it, as it's mostly about politics, so it kind of gets lost in the middle. Buddy Ebsen, though, gives his usual stellar performance, and Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn appear in the movie together and met on the set for the 1st time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as a child - Better as an adult","review":"I saw this movie frequently as a child. I used to sing along with the songs and dance along with the actors. For years i couldn't find it, finally it appeared on amazon, i bought it instantly. After watching it as an adult, i realized that i hadn't grasped the political issues as a child. But at that time it didn't matter; the music was fun, the clothes were interesting, the dancing was amazing, and that was all that mattered to me. Now I appreciate the movie even more. I am quite a picky person (when it comes to movies), and i adore this one. I would recommend it.SIDE NOTE: This was the last movie Walt Disney had input in; he passed away while the movie was being made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confusing for Kids","review":"Our kids (9, 8, 6, and 4) were very confused by the constant polictical rivalry between Democrats and Republicans during the 1890's.

The kids had great difficulty following what was going on.

Unfortunately, it didn't. We installed the canopy on our car seat, which is rear-facing right now due to our baby's small size, and it only provided a little bit of protection. The sun was still shining right in his face. Maybe it works on the smaller infant car seats but it didn't work for us. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertized","review":"I am a bit dissapointed. I bought this to protect my 4 month old from the sun. Having a 3-stage car seat, it is difficult to find a canopy to attach. It doesn't work very well for rear-facing since the top is shaped like a duck-bill. Fingers crossed that it works better when I switch her to forward facing. It does keep the sun off her from the side windows, and it was easy to connect to the car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell apart while in use","review":"After about 6 months in use it just fell apart. Very cheap and substandard welds. If you can your best bet (if you are on a budget like me) is to get a used OEM unit in good condition. That is what I ended up doing and it is working great.

Totally an introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great deception","review":"Lean is the biggest con game in the history of manufacturing. Everyone runs with this notion of a tool kit and boom they will be efficient. Really! Here is the kit; 5S (Elaborate cleaning process to shadow box everything), JIT (drive inventory to unsustainable operational levels), Kan-ban (manual paper or bins exchange of inventory to control inventory), and the infamous Kaizen teams (grouping of non-expert experience people waisting time with endless meetings), Visual line balancing and controls (I want begin to tell how much of a cluster-F you will be with that tool). Many companies have modified Lean to make it work since it does not work.If Lean and TPS is so great then why has Toyota abandon Lean for, once again, the American manufacturing process, precisely Ford motors process again?

Readers will find all qualities of the Jack Russell, good and bad, in this book. I will be sending a copy of this book home with each person that purchases one of our puppies. I highly recommend it to Jack Russell enthusiasts and to anyone even considering sharing their life with these \\"thugs in white clown suits.\\" It gives an excellent history of the development of this versatile hunting terrier, and provides wonderful insight into it's origins and purpose.

It's definitely not a program for beginners who's never worked out before. It's a good alternative to the book when you first start the program because it's not as intense as the book in that the number of reps are fewer and there are modifications to some of the exercises to make them easier. However, you must also follow the diet regiment in the book in order to see those quick results he promises."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works!","review":"I read the book, and then used it to see if I could lose any weight in 14 days, as promised. The book is written in such a way that each day for 14 days there is a testimony from someone who did the program, as well as David Kirsch encouraging you through that day, as if he is walking with you through the diet. There are recipes, and I just picked the ones I liked and made them over and over. The food tasted great,and I ordered the shakes, which were good if I added some fruit, which didn't seem to have a detrimental effect on my weight loss. I ended up losing 8 lbs. and inches off my waist and hips. I lost my craving for sugar, and I was really impressed. It is a diet one can go back to if you ever need to lose weight fast and feel great...but you have to give yourself a couple of days to get acclimated to what you can't have. By the way, it works after your metabolism has totally slowed down. So age isn't an issue with this diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything worth having takes hard work","review":"I have had the book of the same title for over a year however found the exercises very difficult to follow in a timely manner when trying to go by the book. The DVD was the perfect answer to my problem. It is very easy to follow along with David, he explains and demonstrates the exercises clearly. The scenery is beautiful and the time truly passes quite quickly. I warn you though, it is a very difficult workout but absolutely worth it. The changes you will see in your body in such a short amount of time are amazing. Don't give up, even if the first few times you attempt the DVD you are unable to complete it. Work up to it and you too will reap the benefits of having the body you have always wanted and have worked so hard to achieve.

While the Soul Stirrers are mostly famous as the group that featured Sam Cooke, I believe that they were more exciting with Harris. The opening song is an amazing 5 minute version of the classic \\"by and by\\". Paul Foster and Harris exchange the lead building up to a great emotional climax. The group shows its traditionl \\"old school\\" gospel capabilities with \\"Jesus hits like the atomic bomb\\" - they can sing in this harmony style as good as any other group - including the Golden Gate Quartet. But the Stirrers were the groundbreaking group for the hard gospel style, immediately followed by groups such as the Blind Boys of Alabama, the Detroiters, and others. All the songs here are great, so full of emotion and musical skill. I think it can be firmly stated that no gospel fan can afford to miss this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Sam, but....","review":"If you ever wondered, as I have, how Sam Cook(e) came so fully formed 'out of the box', this cd can help explain.

A must have if you already have the Cook stuff or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film has nothing to do with acting in Hollywood.","review":"This film is about a struggling actress about as much as Field of Dreams was about baseball. What is it about? Take a silver nail, hammer it into your toe. That may make you see dimension two. There are nine more after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, Naomi!","review":"The people who made this movie had their act together, so to speak. Cast and crew did a superb job, to the point where it's easy to forget that it is indeed a movie, not a documentary.Since a number of extensive reviews have already been written, rather than cover old ground, I'd just like to note (as a thus far undiscovered script writer myself) how the Ellie Parker screenplay manages to weave humor with some serious observations about Hollywood without resorting to low rent gags or bogging down with overt social messages. A brisk pace is maintained pretty much throughout, and even in scenes which essentially involve one on one dialogue, thought is given to add interest - an example being the art gallery where Ellie seeks consolation from her best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hollywood inside baseball","review":"Can't filmmakers think of anything else but how interesting their own lives are? Really, this is another spoof of how movies are made, how actors behave, how the film industry grinds up people etc etc. There must be dozens of these things. Movies about the movies. Zzzzzz. This one is shot on video and looks it. There's no plot. Just something about the trials of an actress and her life. It has its moments, and I did watch the whole thing. But, why, I'm not sure. Take your chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"If this had been made like six years ago when the writer/director made the original short film that this is based on it could have had some impact, but whatever value it has as a reality acting thing, a satire/mockumentary, or a raw intimate indie flick seems redundant and ineffectual in 2006.The trailer made it seem more entertaining and less mundane than it is. I was surprised by how long it took for any supporting characters to be established, and after the halfway point when it became apparent it was going nowhere I started fastforwarding bits, and when you reach that point you know you've wasted not only your money renting the movie, but your time watching it.The ten second montage of her twirling around with the videotape tape was one kinda kewl part. If you're expecting any more funny lines like \\"i was thinking about johnny depp\\" in the trailer, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one........","review":"From the blurbs and other things I had heard of this movie I sure expected to like it more. In fact I hated it. There were some interesting and \\"weird\\" moments. And Watts is very talented, so I got the feel she was doing someone low on the totem pole a payback favor by starring in this.It movies and meanders so slowly. Nothing much gets said or done. I saw none of this black comedy it promised except perhaps for the russian producers scene. I am sure I would have liked the 16 mintute short much more. Like another reviewer I found myself fast forwarding towards the middle when a scene just went on and on.

It looked more like it was produced by a 1st year film student who got lucky and was able to procure some name actors to appear in it.

I have moderate OCD. For what it is, the book is okay. It does describe OCD fairly well and probably for the very mild cases you can do what is suggested in the four steps and be \\"cured\\". This, however, was not the case for me. I was somewhat disheartened by Schwartz anti-medication slant. Medication has allowed me to fully function and literally gave me my life back from OCD. It's not a cop out, and it's very disturbing that he implies it is. Am I mindful of my actions when I'm having OCD thoughts? Yes. Is that the cure, no. There is no cure. Just coping and dealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This is a great book, which is written in a clear and simple language, and which offers a message of hope. OCD sufferers and their helpers will find it very valuable reading. I was led to it through a recommendation in the book 'Obsessive Compulsive Disorder' by Frederick Toates and Olga Coschug-Toates.

While I agree that I am the only one who can take control of my OCD , the authors reliance on constantly reiterating that you wont be in control if you \\"don't apply yourself\\" is less helpful than some of the explanations of the 4 step process in the book itself.The return to t he difficluties experienced by his private patients is quite simply boring, repetitive, and a monumental pain in the arse.Just read the section on the 4 step process, ignore the authors self aggrandizement, and practice the technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like stories this is your book","review":"I have been a psychotherapist for over 20 years. Treating OCD is quite difficult. The book made it sound as if it is easily fixable. The author didn't include some of the most simple interventions. Someone with severe OCD may be discouraged and \\"a failure\\" after reading this book.I was so hoping this would be a good adjunct to therapy, unfortunately, there was a paucity of behavioral techniques along with cognitive techniques that would help a patient.

It also repeats itself constantly and never really gives the reader an active program to fight their obsessions.

What I found most helpful about this book was really the simple steps that it lays out to help slowly ease yourself out of the obsessive thoughts or rituals. It's not an overnight fix by any means, but for those who suffer from the disorder, it's incredibly helpful. My favorite line in the book (which the author's used quite often as a slogan) is \\"It's not me - it's my OCD!\\" Immediately by making the realization that the thoughts are due to this disorder called OCD and not based on reality, they begin to diminish. With time, they'll begin to disappear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - 10 stars","review":"It's a cure. It works. It really works. Dr.Schwartz's technics lessen intrusive thoughts.

It will never ever disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain Lock","review":"Very good practical advice for anyone who wants to get insight into curbing obsessive thinking.I would recommend this to anyone as a valuable self-help book whether you have OCD or not .The value is that it helps you identify and deal with thought patterns that are counter to your mental well being.The message of the book is the development of mindfulness but it is very practical and I have taken the authors advice to my benefit.It does go on a bit too much about the world of OCD sufferers which I got a bit tired of, but other people probably wouldn't . This is an immensely practical and commonsense approach to helping people with OCD and their families .I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"The steps outlined by Schwartz are highly useful.

A more honest title would've been 'Raptors of Northeastern Hawkwatch Sites.' Even then, northeastern hawkwatchers won't find Harris' Hawk in the book. The raptors Liguori does cover are done well, by and large, and I was particularly impressed with the treatments of both Harlan's Hawk and the Northern Harrier. But if you live in the West, as I do, you'll find the book less useful than the title suggests. Get yourself a Clark and Wheeler--it'll serve you much better.

Abby Cooper is an \\"intuitive psychic\\" who reluctantly enters into a murder investigation. I loved the characters and the way they interacted. The plot moves as a good pace, with a couple little twists. Even when I'd figured most of the mystery out, the story kept me entertained.My only complaints are minor. First, Abby's occasional forgetfulness seems too convenient for the storyline. She claims to not always remember details of her readings, but the things she forgets are the most essential to either the mystery or her budding relationship with Dutch. Second, she knows her life is in danger, but fails to warn people who are close to her and, therefore, might also be in danger.Overall, this is a quick, enjoyable read. I'm looking forward to reading the others in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS WORSE---","review":"Actually, I don't know which was worse, the narrator or the main character. The \\"heroine\\" was so darn unlikable--bland, immature, self-consumed, and embarrassingly desperate just to name a few. And let's not overlook the gazillionth time the author wrote \\"Liar, liar, pants on fire\\" or the fact that the heroine's psychic abilities were extremely inconsistent. The story itself was quite drawn-out and very, very boring.Don't let the sample of the Audible narration fool you like it fooled me---In the sample, I thought the narrator wasn't that bad...but boy, I was wrong. My words can't express the torture, but think shades of Jean Stapleton/Edith Bunker with a scratchy throat and on helium. Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"This novel is pretty fun and has a plot that is actually unexpected. It's a good light read even though it is a murder mystery. Like some other reviewers have noted, the novel does weigh heavily on trying to get the reader to believe psychic powers are actually real. A little less of that would have been nice. I can say, however, that I ordered the 2nd book in the series before even finishing this one. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading, Suspense filled","review":"Finally! A novel about a psychic that's believable! I'm so tired of reading about intuitives that talk like robots, portending death and doom and then fall over in a dead faint after every reading! Abby Cooper is compelling as much for her normalcy as for her giftedness. I found myself fascinated by the description of what goes on in the mind of a psychic, and Dutch is the kind of guy any woman could fall head over heels for. I also loved the fact that I never knew who the real killer was until the end....even though the clues were all there. Real life professional psychic, Victoria Laurie, weaves a web of compelling suspense, fascinating descriptions, and one fantastic sense of humor!

I'm studying for the GRE and was looking for something I could listen to that would contribute to this goal/project. This was a waste of money, since I knew 98% of the words. Also, a few words I thought were not very well described, and the sentances were contrived. The way they use two words with the same root in a sentance seems to be a sure fire way in my book to help someone confuse the two words' meaning. On the plus side, buying this CD set has now made me see the futility of this method of studying for the GRE, and saved me from investing in a more expensive CD set. If like me, you're studying for the GRE, my advice to you is to set aside time to read scholarly journals or essay collections, dictionary in hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I bought this to study for the GRE.

Normally I like something that i can pop in, it will give me a decent cardio workout and at the end I feel as if I've accomplished something. If you feel the same, then this is not the video for you. There is no intructional portion to familiarize yourself with the moves before hand, you have to figure it out as you go. By the time I watch to see what foot they're starting on, the full body movement, and get the hang of that move, she's onto the next step, where again, I have to figure out what she's doing. I spend more time watching the video than actually moving. Definately not something you can just jump into and have fun. If all her videos are put together this way, I will definately not be buying another one"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun cardio workout","review":"After having some health issues in 2007, I tried to get back to exercising with advanced dvds right away. I was becoming very frustrated and a friend suggested I try some Denise Austin to get back in the swing of things. I used to love Denise but had advanced beyond her workouts. This dvd is perfect and I am so glad I tried it! I can do all the segments or just one, depending on how I feel. Denise's cueing leaves a bit to be desired, but if you like Denise you can look past that because this is really a lot of fun. She is lower key in this dvd than in some others but still friendly and motivating. Her personality and enthusiam is just what I needed at this time. I enjoy all the segments but am partial to the retro aerobics section...I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why doesn't she know how to cue?","review":"Why oh, why after over 20 years of aerobic workouts does Denise Austin not know how to cue? This dvd is a mess of her uncoordinated dance moves. It is truly hilarious watching her back-ups aerobizers try and keep up with her crazy moves. It almost appears as if she makes all these moves up as she goes along(like she did on her tv program). When she does cue, it is wrong. Denise is better at pilates and simple toning. Her Personal Training dvd and Hit the Spot Pilates are her two best dvds. Stay away from this one, you won't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD CARDIO!!!","review":"Having used previous Denise Austin videos, I bought this video for a change and was NOT disappointed. I love the different options (kickboxing, dance, retro aerobics, etc.) that this video offers and it really gets my heart beating.

I also like the fact that you can customize your work-outs so that you never get bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Austin: Burn Fat Fast - Cardio Blast","review":"Overall, this is a very well-done DVD. What I really like is that you can create your workout routine before you start the video, you move from one workout to the next without stopping. I like it a lot, I definitely recommend it...

I switch out my dvd's so I don't get bored and my body doesn't get used to the workouts.The dvd's has soem variety for the different dance styles which is nice. I agree with another viewer that the cueing is totally off. It took a couple times of using the dvd to know where I was going when. The moves are easy and the pace a bit slower than I would have imagined. You really have to put yourself into the workout to get what you need from it. I liked Denises attitude in the dvd. She is toned down but still perky. I need perky sometimes, especially in the morning when I'm try to get the bootie moving. I was somewhat unimpressed with the studio setup and the backup being out of synch. It seems to be a lower budget set, but it gets the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great purchase!","review":"I am a Denise Austin fan and have several of her work-out dvds.

I highly recommend this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"The picture quality is pretty terrible and the Denise Austin is really annoying LOL.

The book under review is easier to use (and more up to date) than Lambton's book, which most of us used in our studies. I also found the groupings of the various topics in Mace's book to be more convenient. What I would like next is a revised version of Mace's Teach Yourself Persian, which could link references to the present grammar for more detailed explanations.

Buy it and keep it handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Eye Opening","review":"I read this on a whim -- catchy title, you know? -- but it was actually really good. Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. The whole idea of trying to see if he could make more money killing trolls in Ultima Online than he could as a writer is a great hook not only for the publisher but for the reader as well. Such a weird thing to do, you know? But the whole concept of virtual reality is weird to those who don't partake, and it's a real eye opener to learn that millions of people spend more than 40 hours per week playing these MMOGs, week in and week out, and that some of them have actually made millions of dollars selling real estate that doesn't exist anywhere. And you thought Florida real estate agents were slippery!Dibbell used to write for Wired, and he's a fluent story-teller. Some of the book drags a bit, but the biographical part -- and the sheer strangeness of the intellectual property rights being discussed -- makes it a fascinating read overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-intellectual stuff ruins this book","review":"I had high hopes for this book to be informative and fun but it turned out to be a disappointment. I am not sure if the author had to justify the scholastic grant he received for writing about the topic so he felt he had to interject the fun topic with a lot of pseudo-intellectual analogies/comparisons or personal reflections. Who cares if this game reminds anyone of the Turing Test, or if this is work or play? Everything is work to someone but play to another. His relentless (but failed) attempt to attach significance to this work just makes the book boring and haphazard. Whenever he writes about the intellectual meanings of this \\"phenomenon\\", his writing style changes -- a bunch of words that don't really mean anything...just string them together so they sound smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"REVEALING HONEST PORTRAYAL OF MEN AT PLAY","review":"THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL GROUNDBREAKING WORKS THAT TREAT THE VIRTUAL WORLD OF GAMING WITH THE SERIOUSNESS THAT IT DESERVES.

The title misrepresents the book - he didn't quit his day job and he didn't even hit his fairly modest goal of a month's earnings exceeding his best as a writer, which is far short of the \\"millions\\" the subtitle advertises. I'd give him a pass if the title was obviously sarcastic, but it seems like a cheap ploy to up sales figures. The real slap comes about halfway through the book when blog posts are reproduced wholesale, which can easily be found on the internet on Dibbell's website.Dibbell is a good writer, but this book just doesn't come close to delivering. If you want a basic account of how you could have exploited Ultima Online five years ago, then by all means, this is the book for you. For everyone else, it's an extended blog post - a quick, basic read that doesn't have a whole lot of substance to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a pretty good mask that really cleans your skin.

Consulting with tech support, they sent me another firmware upgrade that killed the set. No picture, no audio. Their return policy does not favor the consumer in anyway.I had purchased the extended warranty, and I was told that the product is not even repairable, it is a return to vendor. I ended up trading in (and up) my set for a Samsung which looks great.

Instead the book follows the stories of both the senior, Kate Malone, and a school outcast, Teri Litch. By the middle of the book it is not even clear who the story is more about, kate or teri. the most disapointing thing for me is that there is no catalyst for kate.

This book is classified as 'young adult'. An adult is 18 and over so this is book is listed for readers 18-25 years old. The literary style is generally below that of that age group. However, the language and subject-matter is appropriate for that age group. Young adults should be able to appreciate and read Hemingway, Faulkner, Dickens. When compared to those, this is a poorly written book. As a literary style, it is more appropriate to 10-15 year olds, but the subject matter, and mostly the choice of language is not appropriate. If you want to write in an immatrue literary style and target an adolescent or pre-adolescent reader then the subject matter and choice of language should be more carefully crafted. Some young adult readers may be at this reading level given the type of books that make the NY Times bestseller lists so it is a fine book for those readers as a remedial book in order to learn to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where do I start?","review":"WOW...

If you don't read catalyst, you will never know what you have MISSED OUT ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anderson Rocks the World Again","review":"First, there was Speak, a life-changeing, thought-process-altering insightful novel about a believable character.Then there was Fever, another life-changing, incredible novel.Now Catalyst. (...). This book will rock the foundation of what you think is life and what you take for granted, if you let it. It is an emotional cleaner that will have you shouting \\"No no no no no no no\\" at Ms. Anderson and wondering if you can even finish the book. Take a long lunch, because you will not be able to put it down.I can recommend this to the geeks of the world, especially, the ones like me who got accepted to most of the colleges they applied for and graduted magna cum laude--or those people who want to understand us."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for Catalyst!","review":"The book {Catalyst was such an awesome book. The characters: Kate, Terri, Mikey, and Mitch were my favorites especially Mikey. Towards the end of the book is the best part of the whole thing. You don't want to put it down. It reminds me of my brother's life. He is a lot like Kate in so many ways. This book is about a typical teenagers life; the pressure of school, the pressure of friends, waiting for your college acceptance letter (hopefully), and just life at home. I would highly recommend this book to anyone especially those between 12-19. This book is in my top two. It's basically about an average 18-year-old girl named Kate whose mother died and her father is the town pastor, she has a 14-year-old brother and a boyfriend named Mitch. She's waiting for her acceptance letter to MIT, the school her mother went to, and a tragedy befalls the neighbors, which leads Kate from her normal happy life to a rude awakening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anderson does it again","review":"From Fever to Speak and now to Catalyst, Laurie Halse Anderson continues to amaze. This book is not speak, but it deals with the same issues. You get a book from a high school senior's perspective, so I definitely would not suggest it for younger than high school because of the strong sexual innuendo. Otherwise, I have nothing but praise for this book and Anderson's others. The writing may be choppy, but it is supposed to be Kate's thoughts. Most of the YA books seem to just be springboards for bringing up issues in the classroom, and Catalyst does that just fine. Speak is one of my favorites and that will be hard to top, but this book is still amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"The writing style is very good and gripping. However, I was disapointed by the end of the book. I felt too much hadn't been resolved -- I even turned the page expecting to see more or an epilog or something. I felt that the main character's story wasn't completed and that the lack of completion wasn't adequately resolved (you can have stories that don't quite end but reverberate)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catalyst","review":"Through \\"Catalyst\\" you get to experience the hardships Kate Malone goes through during this periosd in her life. She's a strait-A student hoping to get into her one and only college choice MIT. Not only is she responsible for keeping her rades up she's also responsible for keeping her family togethr. But when her father, the local misister, decides to give Kate the job of helping out their neighbors she's overwhelmed. She's forced to share her home with her known enemy, and dive into a world completely different from the one she knows. Everything is put into a different light, and you the reader get to experience all these changes she goes through with her. When things go from bad to worse, and she experiences heartbreak for the second time in her life ou're right there with her. All in all I really enjoyed this book. It was both realistic and entertaining, the perfect blend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catalyst","review":"Catalyst is a touching story of a high school girl with a minister father and how she learns to find the good in others while she struggles to find the good in herself. This book really connected to me and I could really relate to Kate, the protagonist, because we have a lot in common. I recommend this book to anyone that has a big heart and would enjoy a story about putting your own problems aside and reaching out to enemies. Catalyst helped me realize that anyone can change like Kate did and everything is possible. Kate changed from being afraid of ruining her reputation, to being a friendly person who makes friends with the one person she least expected, while gong through many tragedies in her life. This book moved me and helped me to look past what others appear to be, and to judge people by who they are.-Review by Lauren"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"I didn't think this book was that good. Laurie Halse Anderson has written many better books than this one.I found the main character, Kate Malone, was unrelatable. Okay, it seems she has the perfect life, but I just got really tired of reading about what she was thinking. For some reason, she really annoyed me. I mean, how stupid is it to apply to just one college. Then, she kept dwelling on this subject the entire book. It seemed like throughout the entire book, Kate was obsessed about herself.I also found it annoying that she thought badly of her life. She had good grades, a great boyfriend, nice friends, and a great family. I just feel that throughout the whole book, Kate never realized much of what she had, and how she should be glad of what she has, compared to Tracy.Also, I think the book was pretty unexciting. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to stomach, but well written","review":"It was a well written piece, albeit extremely depressing. It seemed like bittersweet truth, although purely fictional. The emotions of the characters oozed off the pages. I enjoyed it till the end, although there was one point where I just wanted to scream. Good book, and teaches the readers a thing or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Catalyst","review":"The main issue with this novel is that Anderson attempts to cover far, far too many motifs. Without giving too much away, this book reflects a halfhearted effort in exploring social and academic pressure, religion, parental issues, death, domestic abuse, teenage pregnancy, stress and overexertion, friendship, lust versus love, and much more. I believe that Anderson is a talented writer; however, her talent is spread too thin in this book. It's just impossible to cover that much in such a short novel. Because of this, the plot is scattered and chaotic. A single, major theme never emerges. It starts out focusing on academic pressure and perfectionism, but the plot soon meanders away. The novel leaves too many unanswered questions and loose ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anderson pulls off another emotional and extremely good read","review":"Laurie Halse Anderson was a preacher's daughter and a runner, so Kate Malone may start out as a bit of a reflection of herself. Hopefully, though, the likeness stops there.When we meet Kate, she is actually kind of hard to place your finger on. She is so multi-dimensional and she even talks about having a good and a bad side that fight inside of her. But as things in her life start to become less routine and other parts of her life begin to crumble, you actually see Kate start to figure herself out. It does take a couple tragedies (one that flips everyone's world upside down), but Kate gets there.I will say, much like Anderson's other books I've read, Catalyst becomes more and more extreme and emotional as you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Before I bought this, I made sure to read reviews and to follow the directions not only from reviews, but the ones that came with the shaver. After all that research, this product didn't work well for me. Trying to see if I can return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible merchant dont deal with him","review":"I wrote to the merchant saying that the product is defective.. The merchants response was \\"You are a liar and you want a free product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good shave","review":"I followed the directions to a T and didn't have good results. The shave wasn't close. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it at several different hair lengths to see what worked best and wasn't happy with any of the results. This is not a good substitute for a razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great!","review":"Works great! Charger works too, but the shaver doesn't fit it well. kind of crappy. Hoping to get some years out of it. We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH A SINGLE PENNY!!!","review":"This product does not leave you smooth at all, and it is cheaply made. The foil barrier between your skin and blades will crack exposing the blades. I only got a little cut up when this happened to me. I gave this product one star, because you can't give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap","review":"Remember back in the 80s there were these sweater shavers that could make your sweaters new again by shaving off all the little laundry fuzzballs after you pulled them out of the washer or dryer? This is EXACTLY like that, but with smaller holes. The holes are so dang small I couldn't get any hair shaved. This didn't even work for shaving the peach fuzz on my face. I don't care what the other reviewer said about 'delicate areas' because he obviously was too dumb to realize nothing got shaved. This was a total rip off. I wish I had time to return it, but life got in the way and it was too late to return it when I had the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"When I decided to go 'bare' my husband about flipped his lid! I used a razor in the shower for the first week and wound up with horrible bumps. I did a little research and found this shaver. I was skeptical but bought it anyway. I really like it. I use it every 2-3 days at least. Very smooth, no bumps. I have used it with and without the baby powder; I have to say it works better with. The one I bought requires C batteries so I'm going to get one of these rechargeable ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I am very disappointed with this product. I read all of the instructions & followed them step by step. The product didn't perform as advertised. The shaver left spotty patches & the areas that it did shave were not as close as I like it. I had to use a razor to finish the job. I returned the product but still had to pay for shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a close shave","review":"If I want a close shave, I reach for the razor in the shower. If I don't have time for a shower, this product is fine. I have received a couple of nicks though. It's really easy to use & I have never had trouble with the battery holding a charge. I'm not dissatisfied enough to return it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"It didn't shave as close as it claimed, even though I used it on \\"stubble\\". I had to shave with my usual razor afterwards to make it as smooth as I like, so I don't feel it was worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"I understand that many people may not find this release as good as the previous one because it is not as catchy, however, I believe it to be more than outstanding. I start playing and cannot stop. The lyrics are unbelievable. It talks to those of us in our early thirties. The mixing of rythms is so refined. I am very difficult to please, but this album has done it. A TRUE CLASSIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, a revealing look at the people of the Civil War","review":"I was first introduced to this documentary in a US History class. All too often history is portrayed in such a way as to be completely alien or so far out of touch with \\"today\\" that a search for relevancy proves futile. Not so with this documentary! The combination of David McCullough's voice, the background music native to the time, hundreds and hundreds of actual pictures taken on scene, and compelling stories that ranged from the strategic \\"macro\\" level of the war to the level of the individual soldier and their family absolutely captivated me! A MUST HAVE for all interested in the history of the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith's Tummy Trimmers","review":"I love, love, love this DVD! There are five different ab workouts, and each one is only ten minutes. You can do anything for ten minutes! Time is definitely an issue, and I can fit this into my exercise routine at least four times per week. The exercises are quick and challenging and each workout is different. I don't have a stability ball, so I usually skip that workout, but definitely recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a quick, challenging ab workout that will get results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and effective core workout","review":"The title is Tummy Trimmers but this dvd isn't just about abs. There's also a lot for the lower back too. It's a true core workout. I think this dvd is most effective if you use it as a stand-alone abs/core workout and combine at least three of the workouts together. My favorites are Core Abs, Boot Camp Abs and Stability Ball Abs. There are a lot of crunches but enough unique moves to keep my interest. This is my only Kathy Smith dvd and I think her coaching is motivating without being too chirpy or overly hyper. I also like that the exercisers come in all shapes, sizes and ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work out with Kathy","review":"Love this DVD; Kathy really works your butt. And she not as annoying as Denise Austin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Fun and Quick","review":"Great if you are short on time but you can also do several of the routines at one time. If you don't have much time to workout, you can also do a 10 minute segment. Some of the routines are tougher than others which you gives you a chance to improve yourself. Kathy Smith has some great workouts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I'm an old customer & fan of Kathy's,these exercises are why she is still in the business. Keep it up girl!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Beginner to Imtermediate","review":"If you're looking to combine great rubber stamping with another medium, off paper, then this is a great addition to your stamping art library. The book shows great ideas, and shows enuf material on technique that you can do it easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful projects and interesting techniques","review":"I realize that in the world of polymer clay, 2002, the publication date for this book, is an eon ago, but I encourage you to find a copy if it's not already in your library. Although this book is called Creative Stamping in Polymer Clay, I learned so much more than just stamping. There are interesting techniques for getting color onto the clay, techniques for making hand formed beads, and my favorite, making bangle bracelets without a blank. As always, Barbara McGuire has been generous with techniques and beautiful, professional projects. And the idea gallery at the back of the book provides insight into the techniques used to acheive the effects. I'm happy to have this book in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Choice But Freedom","review":"No Choice But Freedom is a wonderful historical piece dealing with the issues of slavery and a women's right to voice her opinion on the subject during a time when it was not appropriate to do so. A well-to-do English woman makes a journey by ship to colonial America to be with her husband, who is unfaithful and has his own reasons for the marriage. She soon finds that life in the colonies is not what she is used to in England, but prevails when faced with the unexpected challenges. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Historical Fiction, Women's Literature, or Slavery in early America."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work fine","review":"They work good on my micro current machine, the adhesive last long enough and the conductivity is good as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"unimpressed","review":"I'm not exactly a twenty something fashionista, but wow are the patterns in here dumpy. There have been a couple of OK technique articles, but three issues into my subscription I haven't gotten much from it. Many of the articles are rambling pointless nostalgia and many of the patterns are for striped v neck sweater vests. It's so hard to get new information on knitting machines now that it's sad one of the few remaining sources concentrates on shapeless granny sweaters in cheap acrylic. Knitting machines are capable of so much, why are they always presented in this light?"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's worth it","review":"I've purchased several of the past issues and find it's full of techniques that I might not otherwise be able to learn now that there aren't any teachers. I do find that some of the patterns are outdated, but then perhaps it's just me being an American and these are British designs. I've got enough practice using the techniques presented to be able to chart my own sweaters with my own yarn so that the items I make are well received. Sometimes I'll make an item just so I can learn the technique, then donate to the local women's shelter, they always need clothes. Besides, it's the only magazine on machine knitting left still in production so I'd like to support it and help make sure it's available for future generations. I'd say it's worth a years subscription, and worth seeking out some older issues as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gotta read book!!!","review":"I'd love to see this book come back out in print,it's high on my very favorite books list.This was the first book I have read by Nanci Little,and I have to say I'll be back to read more of her books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I really enjoy this workout. I have seen some good results, it's not too complicated or crazy, doesn't require too much equipment, and can be modified for varying fitness levels. Unfortunately, my copy sticks, which is frustrating, but it was not expensive. I actually rented it from Netflix before I purchased it, so I was confident about the workout before I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent calorie burn- good class substitute","review":"I enjoy this workout as a substitute for going to an exercise class. It's current- using weights to add challenge to a series of core-strengthening upright moves (lunges squats etc). There is little here that could cause injury (always a good thing)- it's not \\"boppy\\" as some step and other aerobic workouts can be. I give it only 4 stars because I find the \\"core\\" section (we used to call it ab work) is not as challenging as I would like- but your core WILL be challenged by the first section of leg work with hand weights. I suggest downloading Tracy Anderson's $10 ab series from her website instead- it's more challenging and won't add bulk.In general this is a good workout it won't bore you to death or irritate the heck out of you- and if you can't get to a gym, it's nice to be able to work a sweat up without using too much floor space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout DVD","review":"This one in my opinion is a good workout, I have been working outfor awhile and this one kicked my butt at first. Kathy hits allthe areas so when you are done you feel like you got a good allover body workout. I would recommend this DVD for someone that hasbeen working out for awhile. I also like Jackie Warner and KellyCoffey Meyer workouts theya are challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazon should advertise as re-release","review":"I am very disappointed that amazon does not have this product listed as a re-release. I am a huge kathy smith fan and have many of her dvd's. I was so excited to see the 3 new dvd's listed for release on dec 18th and ordered 2 of them. In getting the package at home and going to do the workout today I realized that it was a re-release of ultimate sculpt. I went directly to the kathy smith website to email her contact people and see that her website has clearly stated that this is a re-release. I blame amazon for not advertising this correctly. The original dvd is great, I love it, so for those of you who don't have it yet, this will be a great workout.

It was one of the few albums produced that didn't have a bad cut on it. The majority of the songs on this CD were on that album, but it just makes me miss the first album all the more.

My 3 year old wanted a digital camera so she could take some pictures to send to her dad, who is in the Army overseas right now, and so she spent her christmas money on this and she might as well have just thrown her money in the trash can. At first I was upset that there is no flash on this camera, even though the pictures on the package make it look like it flashes. Finally my computer had a problem downloading the software... once I fixed that I got the pictures to download and the pictures are horrible. I took pictures of my daughter and everything looks like dark fuzz. I went into rooms with better lighting, and the objects in the pictures still look like fuzz. Finally after continuous attempts to get better pictures, the software now locks up my computer!! I work with computers and digi cams often, the problem isn't a lack of knowledge in consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just awful.","review":"This is possibly the worst digital camera that I have ever used. In the late '90's I bought a webcam that took substantially better photos than this camera. The camera itself seems sturdy enough, but the picture quality is what destroys the functionality of this camera. Forget everything you ever knew about megapixels, this camera had a shockingly bad resolution of 352x288. That's not 1 megapixel, no, that 0.1 megapixels. Now, I understand that this is a kids camera and that it's not going to be of the finest quality and I could deal with small images that are at least clear, but these photos, even when viewed small, at 100% (which, believe me, makes them tiny on a modern monitor!) are grainy and blurred, even when taken in good lighting. To make things worse, the software is a joke and is far more complicated than it needs to be. Overall, it's truly an awful experience. This product clearly deserves negative stars it it were possible to give them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF CRAP TO THE Nth POWER","review":"I bought this hunk of junk for 16.99 from Marshalls with a gift card for my 4 year old so she can start practicing with pointing and shooting. I knew it would not be a Kodak DX6490, or a Canon, or a NIKON, but I didn't expect it to take pictures like the first digital camera phones in 1994. When I say this is a piece of crap I want to start out with the horrible codes for the modes: D8 somehow means rapid shot, and CL means delete. The quality can't be worse, I don't think... Anyway, the software is garbage; it looks like it can be downloaded for free on a pop up add. Whew, I am pissed off just writing this review as we are warming up the car ready to take it back to Marshalls for some panties or something else that I expect to be crapped in or on.

Very sad daughter, very unhappy parents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Buy It, You Will Be Returning It","review":"I think this is a good idea for a product, and the software worked ok for us, but all of our pictures came out blurry. It also has no flash, and no screen for viewing your photos. So it is zero fun for a child.

I will be sending this camera back even if I have to pay extra for shipping. Please, if nothing else read all the reviews before purchasing this camera and make an informed decision (not to buy this thing).

Otherwise there are a lot of interesting characters and a couple of stroy threads. A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I love book series. JA Jance keeps you interested in J.P.

Favorite characters from the past are there and I particularly like the way Jance handles the passage of time in their lives. The cases are interesting with good suspense and twists along the way. I would like the dialogue to have been a bit more crisp, but that's a small complaint. I've missed J.P. and am glad to see him back. If you've not read the series, definitely start with the first.

But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a \\"new\\" size for more comfortable reading. BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years. I doubt that the publishers will even notice. After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long.

Jance's \\"Long Time Gone\\". I have read all of her books and this one spent the first 200 pages taking about people from past books. I guess, if you have not read any of the past JP Beaumont books this helped you understand the Mysteries.

When I came across Long Time Gone and Justice Denied, I snatched them up immediately and read them both in a week. I was not disappointed either. Although as Beau gets older, I have a hard time picturing the handsome strapping man in my head. I still want him to be tall, dark, & handsome. But I guess I'll settle for Tall, salt & peppery, and handsome.The suspense is powerful and putting the books down is not an option.

I do like a good story though and enjoy and appreciate a good story teller, not matter what the subject or setting. J.A. Jance is one of those, a good, natural story teller and with this suspenseful offering has kept her string going. I am certainly not going to go into the story plot here, other reviewers have just just dandy in that area, so no need to worry about a spoiler. I will say though that if you like this authors work and like the Beaumont series, then you are bound to like this one. Her character development remains as acute and insightful as ever. As a personal note though, I am rather attached to another of her series and keep reading Beaumont as a female rather than a male. Perhaps I am just getting old. Anyway, I feel quite confident that you really cannot go wrong with this one and I do highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite powder foundation--and I've tried them all!","review":"After having tried several powder foundations (including the big name department store brands), this is my favorite.

The color stays true all day. For times when I want even more coverage, I use it as a powder over liquid foundation.

But that is not really Mr. Lanchester's style, is it? Like his characters, he highlights the fine details in the otherwise mundane. Another reveiwer stated that Lanchester had set out to write a serious book. I don't agree with that at all. I got the sense that he mearly wrote about what took his fancy at that time, be it statistics, pubilc transportation, or bodily functions. It's a unique style, and that's the most important thing.

An accountant let go from his position due to redundancy this book is a day in Mr. Phillips' new life. Filled with sexual commentary, calculations, and the occasional adventure, it's hard to say that this is a truly original work in plot, but Lanchester creates such a clear picture you can't help but be fascinated by the inner workings of a man whose life is thrown in such disarray."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day In The Life...","review":"The novel that John Lanchester has devised is an interesting snapshot of a man's life after he has been made redundant, yet he's afraid to tell his family and thus goes through the motions of going to work only to wander around London all day.

I have not felt this same yearning for the happiness of two frail beings, since, perhaps, my reading of Tess of the D'urbavilles. I have seldom had to pause and rewind so often, to notice the way the wind blew, or the flowers shivered, or the children played, or poetry sounded, or linen danced, or candle-wax spilled, or hands touched, or an emotion flickered across Fanny's face, or an octagon-shaped table with inkwells and quills looked like.

No the absolute worse thing is the acting - This Fanny Brawn couldn't be a convincing muse even for a limerick writer, and this John Keats could have been better played by Peewee Herman. No, the worse thing is the overall overbearing seriousness of the directing. There isn't a line of humor in the entire film! The only positive thing I saw was the performance of the cat. Remarkable!

However, I was greatly disappointed by this film. The chemistry between the two main actors, Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw, was very weak. The way that Fanny Brawne is portrayed makes her seem like a conceited, vain diva who thought mainly of her own emotions. Keats is portrayed as a rather spineless fellow.

There's even a song called \\"Gorilla,\\" which hints at a favorite topic of WZ's (think \\"Gorilla You're a Desperado\\" or \\"Leave My Monkey Alone\\"), the animal traits we hide in ourselves.But like John Mellencamp's \\"Chestnut Street Incident,\\" \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" trapped an artist with a record he probably wishes he could scorch from the face of the planet.

I did sweat a bit--not a lot, but I did get pretty warm. (Say a 6 1/2 out 10)The mat work was perfect for me. I liked the leg and ab section especially.

It's a good solid workout and is good for a pilates beginner (me) to intermediate.I found this very easy to follow and as always, Kathy is a great instructor who cues well and is great to listen to. You almost don't need to look at the screen to see what she's talking about because she describes in detail all the moves ahead of time. There is an aerobic segment to begin, and you engage your core throughout that. With the toning, there is classic dumbbell type exercises and pilates floorwork (use a mat). I really like how you can play this in any order. Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting.Overall, this workout is really quite good - I think it's perfect for beginners to intermediate and I'm sure that if done consistantly, then you'll see results.

Circuit Analysis I With MATLAB Applications is highly recommended as a scholarly text intended for (and appropriate to) undergraduate as well as advanced students in the field of electrical engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my 13 month old's favorites...","review":"My daughter adores this story about a little boy who shares his animal crackers with his friends and family. The illustrations are clear and engaging and introduce a wide variety of animals to your child. (How many toddlers can identify a pangolin?) Frankly, I don't know why this book hasn't been a bigger hit in the toddler market. It is a fabulous book for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay... weird blue beads","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I find that this lotion does make my skin smooth after it is absorbed, with only a slightly tacky/sticky feeling left behind, mostly on my hands.I rather like the scent, but it is very strong and lingers... it's floral, maybe like lilac?The main trouble is the weird blue liquid-filled beads that pop while you apply the lotion and leave tiny trails of blue until you rub it all in. And, hopefully you rub them all in... I've found some stray un-popped beads after applying. The beads don't make your skin blue, but I would hate to put this on while dressed and potentially stain my clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sample served its purpose...","review":"When I received a sample of the Jergens Skin Smoothing Cellular Renewal Moisturizer I threw it in my desk drawer and forgot all about it. About a month later, I came across it and decided to give it a try.WHO KNEW??? It was fantastic! I spent the next few weeks haunting every pharmacy and variety store looking for the cream. No one had it. I finally found it and bought every bottle on the shelf (unfortunately, there were only 3). My co-workers have tried it and they too are hooked. My only complaint is that it is very hard to find in stores. I now am ordering it online.It's definitely a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I tried this since I was looking for something to smooth my skin (ie the name of the product)..... it shot, and missed.....I moisturized fairly ok..... but it left my skin tacky tacky tacky....plus the little beads in the lotion were unnerving. If I want something to TRULY exfoliate, I want it in my body wash.... not my lotion.The smell was horrid. I couldn't stand it, and it radiates off of you LONG after you slather this on. I ended up throwing out my whole bottle after only using it twice I think. I'll stick with Vaseline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Is My Product ?????","review":"When am I going to get this product ??? This is the only item that has not shipped !!! Is this item on back order or what ?? Tell me something ........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is trash. Never heard any of the songs and they definitely were not hits. Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ole school music","review":"This Cd was good. Many of the songs I had not heard in years and as soon as I heard them my head began to move and I bagan to sing. I really enjoy old school music. I reccommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total paradox!","review":"This book is very interesting, it tells the voyage of Varka, while he searches for his dead love, 'following' the tarot's major arcana cards. It's very simple and at the same time very complicated, in a manner that shows Louise Cooper's talent and originality. The word paradox will follow you throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is about boys coming of age.","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. It is great. Every teenage boy should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for children - and with no words to read ...","review":"Wonderful book. I take it on trips if I need a gift for a wide range of children. With no words, the reading level is not a factor. Full of visual jokes, historical buildings, modern characters hidden in the crowds, famous art and buildings, childrens games, similarities from one page to another ...The parents love it even more than the kids. It takes days to spot all the interesting things hidden in this book and it's a painless way to talk about history and art with a child. PERFECT for babysitters to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparks the imagination!","review":"I am so glad I discovered this book. My children enjoy telling a different story every time we open it. The fact that there are no words in it makes the children invent a new story each time, and I believe it develops their imagination better in a way, than with a storybook with pictures. I also like the art involved in this book, the minute details that the author/artist had included are adorable! I enjoy reading it myself! Each page reveals several goings-on in a small town, it is so easy to imagine yourself walking among the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful, but boring","review":"Beautiful pictures, meticulously detailed. Clearly, a lot of research, thought, talent and hard work went into this book.Unfortunately, the book's excrutiatingly boring. I can imagine few adults, and fewer children, sitting through this almost scholarly study, of their own free will. There's virtually no plot, virtually no protagonist, no deliberate, purposeful action, no atmosphere, no moral, no fun. There's no one to identify with, nothing to reflect about, and, ultimately, nothing to remember, except the beautiful, impressionistic painting style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you crazy?","review":"This man is an absolute bigot, and should not be considered a reference able resource to the medical or public community. He has some serious issues with the way he presents himself, and is just plain annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Package Tour in Book Form","review":"If you are interested in seeing Istanbul beyond its tourist districts, buying Tom Brosnahan's book is a mistake. Although LP Istanbul covers Sultanahmet and its attractions in depth, the rest of the city is largely left out, and what is included is organized in a format that defies logic. If you are visiting Istanbul on a package tour you might find the book useful, but if your aim is to explore the nooks and crannies of the city I would suggest Eyewitness Guides' Istanbul. It's full of pictures and more expensive than LP Istanbul, but it is by far the most comprehensive guide to the city that I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real men drink tea","review":"It's more lively and entertaining (and cheaper) than the Blue Guide. Sometimes it tries too hard for laughs. I didn't notice any Turks amused at naive tourists drinking non-caffeinated apple tea instead of the hard stuff. Some of the penny-pinching Lonely Planet stuff doesn't make a lot of sense in country that is so cheap once you get there but so expensive to get to. It's full of interesting and practical information but the Blue Guide remains the standard reference for serious study (if serious study is what you travel for).I'd recommend reading this before you go but carrying the Blue Guide with you at the sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book!","review":"We found this book to be very useful before and during our first trip to Istanbul. It was a wonderful resource for hotels, museums, restaurants and other typical \\"touristy\\" stuff as well as cultural differences that we may encounter... maps were helpful as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"read in bookstore, but not impressed, LP Turkey better","review":"Evaluated this in bookstore, but the LP Turkey had a bigger section on Istanbul and seemed better to buy overall. LP Istanbul didn't attract me with its layout, when compared to DK Istanbul. I could get a much better \\"big picture\\" using DK. Tom is an authority on travel to Turkey, and I think his website does a much better job at showcasing his expertise than this book does--it's more dynamic, updated, has discussion forums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Even watching this now it's still more exciting than anything on TV these days. The documentary is great, the matches are awesome and the set is well done, it's far better than the single disc version released before. Very happy. I hope WWE releases a WCW complete boxset as it's far better to watch than their programming currently."},{"rating":"2","title":"nWo: Revolutionary Idea","review":"I purchased this for my 18 year old daughter. She has been an nWo fan since the beginning of their inception. She loved watching the group members in their prime and listening to the commentary. Very well done.P.S. Yes she knows it is Pre-Determined Entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major upgrade over previous NWO DVD","review":"No longer watch wrestling, just an old fan from my childhood, but the NWO was one of the best things in the history of wrestling. This DVD collection is a major upgrade over the only other previous wwf release which was a single dvd called back in black"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"It can damaged, broken plastic on the edges and plastic pieces inside but so far I think the DVD is fine though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"A very short 60 minute documentary with most of the material just old clips from previous WWE home video releases. Unless you just want this set for the matches it's not worth it. Very poor job by WWE on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Same gripe as everyone else; you get a documentary on one of the biggest and longest running angles in the history of modern wrestling that lasts 62 minutes. Just totally disappointing with no new information put forth. The only real highlight is a very honest Kevin Nash, but there is no mention of ANY of the true life backstage drama that let the nWo angle get totally out of control and eventually led to the downfall of WCW. In fact the documentary is very much in kayfabe at times, which at this point in time is just truly baffling. The match selection is OK, but just keep in mind that this was WCW in the late 90's, match quality was NOT a priority. After some truly incredible releases from WWE Home Video (Bret Hart's release, Rise and Fall of ECW, Monday Night Wars to name a few) this set is just a total disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"now The Revolution","review":"nWo The Revolution It was a Christmas for my grandson and he is really enjoying it. I'm glad I purchased it for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good telling of the NWO story","review":"This might as well be called, \\"What Dusty Rhodes and his son think of the NWO\\". About 70% of the interviews are from the perspective of Dusty Rhodes and his son. It's a lot of opinion with no behind the scenes footage and no solid match footage. What isn't interviews from the Rhodes family is out of date interviews and Kevin Nash continually pointing fingers for the fall of WCW and the NWO. Like all WWE licensed doc's on the WCW, it touches on nostalgia, but focuses a large amount of time on the company's demise.This overall is a bad buy. It doesn't have any good interviews from the wrestlers who mattered, it barely spends anytime talking about the NWO's storyline or chronology, all it does is shove opinion after opinion about the NWO down your throat while showing old WCW B roll. It's a cash in on nostalgia and nothing more."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},W={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-31982a42"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/13.md","filePath":"quotesmag/13.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/13.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
