This is just the opposite; the recording is so muddy that things you know are there are inaudible. I had to check my settings to make sure that the kids hadn't turned the treble and bass all the way down.This is no sizzle to the cymbals, no punch to the bass and no twang to the guitar.

The big hits were of course Sweet Emotion and Walk This Way, but this is one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through over and over again. I'm not going to bother talking about each song. You'll just have to get this classic if you don't have it already. As I write this review, Toys is only $7.97, what a bargain!

Aerosmith's \\"Sweet Emmotion\\" is on it. Without a doubt , this is what SACD's should sound like. Alot of SACD's sound like an entirely new mix. Many things are lost (like the bass) and others are too prominent in the mix. This one just kicks. When the bass comes in and the song starts to rock, your'e SO glad you have it in SACD!!!

Toys In The Attic has some well-remembered classics like Walk This Way and Sweet Emotion. The title song is like fire on a soundwave. It's energetic and has perfect guitar-playing to boot. Sadly these three songs cannot seem to lift the album any higher than 4 stars, even thought they clearly form its backbone. Still it's good solid Aerosmith so, of course, I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk This Way! Enuff for 4 stars alone!","review":"I'm a big fan of great guitar albums and this one is no exception. The guitar work on \\"Walk this Way\\" is just fabulous. Perry and Whitford's other work on the rest of the album is great too. \\"Sweet Emotion\\" is another classic track while the title track is a great opener to the album.Why just 4 stars? Well, other than the 3 songs just mentioned, I thought the album was pretty short at less than 40 minutes for one and the album didn't flow quite as well for my liking.Indeed, the dreaded word 'filler' comes to mind for at least a couple of the tracks. But this miniature LP cardboard case remastered version of the album is just great! The improvement on the sound is very obvious and I just love the cool look of the cover.I started years back with the cassette and then the cd but I've worn them all out. I'm glad I got this Japanese cardboard cover version though. You will too...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still sounds great...","review":"Many consider this to be Aerosmith's best and it is pretty good but I rank \\"Get Your Wings\\" as their best. The best tracks are the big hits \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" which still sound great even after 30 years of radio play but some songs just don't hold up to continuous airplay like \\"Big Ten Inch\\" which I hope never to hear ever again. Other strong cuts are \\"No More No More\\" and the ambitious \\"You See Me Crying\\" with the added touch of a string section with soaring guitars (Perry or Whitford?) which I think worked out surprisingly well for a down & dirty band just two years removed from opening for Sha Na Na.

Instead, this book has you saying: \\"Hesabi alabilir miyim lutfen.\\".When I tried that, the waiter gave me a confused look, and I said \\"hesap, lutfen\\", after which he nodded and brought me the bill.Another example: the usual way to say \\"where is\\" is \\"nerede\\".

However, while Rex Harrison was a personality to be reckoned with, he was no singer. Neither is Ian Richardson, but therein lies the difference. While Harrison premiered the role, Richardson goes it one better. Here is one of the great Shakespearean actors, a jobbing actor with years of experience in the many ways the inflection of a voice can shape a line, taking on the part. As an actor in full command of his natural vocal gifts (and they were immense), he manages to set aside anything an audience might have remembered about Rex Harrison; if not surpassing Sexy Rexy's portrayal in the minds of those wedded to it, giving it a very long run for its money. For those who admire the many ways in which Ian Richardson brought his roles to stinging life, this will be a recording to treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST!","review":"I saw this production on B'way twice, and it really was lover-ly.

Of course, Biondi's skill, as that of the ensemble, is also noteworthy. When I played the CD for my then teenage children all 3 understood why I liked it so much and, at the time, only one was very interested in classical music because he played viola in the school orchestra. He has since gone on to guitar in a post-rock band but recently downloaded the CD onto his new Mac and burned a copy for his car.

Gomez style is rich and varied, but with a definitive style running through their work. Guitar is dominant, but not to the point of tedium, and the rough formed harmony singing reminds me of The Band (albeit at their loosest.)

With it's demise, I've been waiting for a style that would offer something different and challenging. Liquid Skin has offered such a divergent style unheard since Supertramp ventured on the scene so many years ago. This is not Pearl Jam or Dave Matthews or anyone else, this is something unique and wonderful. I truly enjoy listening to the entire album, not just a song or two as with most alternative music today. Melodic and charming, challenging with exquisite style and grace. It is simply the most enjoyable CD I've heard this year. Are they masters of current music? I don't know. Only time will tell. Enjoy it while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the year, so far","review":"I can't remember the last time a voice like Ben Ottewell's gave me goosebumps.

Sure I think it's a rather cool band in their unique style of being. It's a mixture of old farts like Neil Young, The Band and such oldies with newcomers like Beck, Self, Arnold and hell know what else. Sure - cool - but still nothing that gets me real horny to hear more. \\"Hangover\\" is a good tune though...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average musicians making average music","review":"I first heard the song Rosalita from a friend's mix CD and thought it was a decent little song. I gave the album a listen after reading all the rave reviews here. Maybe my expectations were just too high after reading all the praise, but I found this album unimpressive. The music is trite and uninteresting; not that it's bad, but it just lacks anything really that original. The lyrics are too heavy-handed and recycled at times. There are a few decent tunes on this album, but overall, it's average at best, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my goodness....","review":"Instead of sacking the bloke with the nasty, hoarse, Cookie-Monster voice, the band members let him sing on just about every song!

What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST PROBABLY THE BEST ALBUM EVER (OR CLOSE TO)","review":"After being introduced to Gomez via a live at the wireless session I was instantly smitten. I rushed out and bought Liquid Skin straight away and 6 months later it has rarely left my CD player. Quite different to Bring it on - the album is perhaps more experimental than its predecessor and covers so many different music styles in one album. My favorites are Blue Moon Rising and Rhythm and Blues Alibi but it's really hard to pick favorites when the whole album is absolutely awesome and simply the best music ever to get totally hammered to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Space-tinged blues based US influenced British rootsoddesy","review":"Liquid Skin shows a more mature Gomez stretching on the success of their brilliant debut, Bring It On.

Although they're a British band they sound nothing like you'd expect. Many people will recognize them from their cover of the Beatles' \\"Getting Better\\" on a television ad. Although some may look down upon this type of commercialism, hey, if it gets them noticed... This is a prototypical late night album that is a perfect soundtrack following a long day. Songs like \\"Devil Will Ride\\" and \\"Hangover\\" have that almost ragged sound that fits like an comfortable old pair of shoes, and \\"We Haven't Turned Around\\" is a ballad in the best sense of the word. Do yourself a favor and pick up this album. I doubt you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than their debut","review":"I bought this one before the debut. I found Liquid Skin much better at first. Now, Bring it On is beginning to work on me. I know Gomez beg, steal and borrow from many that have come before, but they blend all their influences together in fascinating ways. The Pink Floyd meets the blues vibe on Revolutionary Kind is thrilling. Furthermore, I think dude yelling \\"Blue Moon Rising\\" at the top of his lungs is a great moment on the album. His voice has so much character. I think it is very genuine. We Haven't Turned Around is also a fantastic cut here. Anybody caught Gomez live? I am curious how they come off in person on stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put the book down.","review":"It has been a long time since I have read such an excellent fiction book.

So i bought this CD and it is exactly what i thought it would be: a mixed bag. To say it is bad would be completely unfair - this band is very good and they write nice songs.

Once again, an early death brings more fame than being in life.I find this also to have been the case with Randy Rhodes as well.

Aidan tries to tell the hidden story of Darcys return to his sister and London society. The story takes a turn through religious conversion and then veers off into intrigue and susperstition. Suddenly, readers will find themselves trapped in a gothic novel, where mysterious characters and events take over the storyline and Darcy takes on the mantle of \\"detective.\\" Not a bad thing if I was looking for a romance/mystery. However, this narrative is supposed to be Jane Austen, not Amanda Quick. I'd almost recommend skipping this book all together, but there are some characters that pop up in the final novel. Maybe read til the castle party and skip the rest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"May not be worth your time","review":"I loved the first book in this series, An Assembly Such asThis, but the second, Duty and Desire, was not as enjoyable to me. To put it succintly, the first was delightful and the second really dark. Read it if you want an interesting story, but it doesn't seem connected to the P&P; story we have grown to love. Unless you like that gothic touch, I'd suggest skipping it. You won't miss any of the plot line. I look forward to the last of the series.

She really pays a great tribute to Jane Austen. Enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a Disappointment","review":"What a letdown. After the sheer rightness of her portrayal of Mr. Darcy in the first book, I couldn't believe how completely Pamela Aidan switched gears on us. I accept that she's not Jane Austen and that it must be very hard to come up with plausible ways to fill in the unknowns. But she wrote the first book with such believable, Austen-like spirit, if not her actual writing style, that I don't know where this dull, preachy sequel came from. Was she in a hurry? Was her publisher pushing her too hard? To start the series in one style and to continue in such a completely different vein...well, let's just say that $14 for a paperback is hard enough to pay without feeling like you've been defrauded after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful parallel story","review":"Every Jane Austen fan wonders what \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" would look like from Mr. Darcy's point of view; Pamela Aidan does a beautiful job telling the story from Mr. Darcy's perspective while still maintaining the witty satirical voice of Austen (even while she makes that voice her own).

I look forward to the final installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Battle Rages On","review":"Heh. Between the dutiful sycophants from Aidan's mailing list who were actively solicited to write positive reviews here, and the intolerant and unjust reviewers who simply can't push the doors to their minds open far enough to admit that this book actually does have some merit, these reviews are turning out to be more entertaining than the book itself. My two stars say all they need to say, so I'll stay out of the fray. Instead, I'd simply like to let those who have never heard of Pamela Aidan but are considering buying this book know that it would be better to start with the first book in the series called, \\"An Assembly Such As This.\\" Both books are beautifully written forays into the mind of Mr. Darcy, and you're not likely to find a writer more capable or engaging than Ms. Aidan.

However, I feel she did her readers a big disservice with the second \\"filler\\" book. She would have done better to add a few chapters at the end of book one or the beginning of book three, providing us some BRIEF info about what Mr. Darcy was doing between meetings with Lizzie--after all the relationship between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie is what people love.And don't worry about things not making sense in book three without having read book two.

The first pages of the second continues the great intrigue with his sister, Georgiana. However, I would recommend that readers simply close the book once he sets out to the castle.

But after being hit over the head constantly with Aidan's brand new Sledgehammer of Religion, all I could comprehend was a headache. What happened to all the subtlety she displayed in the first book? And when did the story of Pride and Prejudice go from one of manners, wit, romance, absurdity, and restrained demonstration of principle to one of gothic overtones and Christian moralizing? Even the antics of Trafalgar the dog, Fletcher the valet, and a friskier-than-expected Colonel Fitzwilliam couldn't make up for the tediousness of the rest. What a depressing letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"hoping for better in book three","review":"I guess I'm one of the few who didn't like this book. Did Mr. Darcy really need an entire gothic storyline to make him realize that Elizabeth was a good person? Did Georgiana really need a conversion in order to get over having made a mistake? Maybe. But it just seemed like everything was taken to such extremes. Like the book was trying too hard to get its point across. Instead of feeling like I was reading a story about a man's internal struggles, I felt like I was being instructed. It left an unpleasant aftertaste that I hope the third book will dispel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...","review":"I really had to work to make myself finish this book.

But I had a gift certificate to spend, so with nothing to lose, and very low expectations, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the first volume, but this second volume is more what I thought I'd get. Ms. Aidan's story could easily have been told in two volumes, with this book left out of the series altogether. The plot is highly improbable, and there is no character development to speak of. Jane Austen might have gotten a laugh out of \\"An Assembly Such as This\\", but \\"Duty and Desire\\" surely must have her spinning in her grave.There's supposedly a third volume... if I could find it, I'd read it, in the hope that it would bear out the potential of the first volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"Gah, I paid too much for this book. It might have been worth it if it had lived up to the first one, but it didn't. With every well-written line, I was sure there was something just around the corner that would surprise and delight me. Nope, the corners brought nothing but more joyless text. Thank goodness for Darcy's valet, as he was the only thing that alleviated the boredom. Who knows, maybe the tedium was deliberate -- some attempt by the author to parallel the grayness of Darcy's world without Elizabeth. Whatever the case, it was, to me, a dissatisfying continuation."},{"rating":"1","title":"By All Means, Skip It","review":"If you skip this second book and just wait for the third, you won't miss a thing. After all, what's the reason we're all reading this series? We're reading it for Aidan's delightful speculation into Mr. Darcy's character and his feelings for Elizabeth. Sadly, the very few snippets of feeling we're allowed to see boil down to \\"Elizabeth is 'good'\\" and are buried beneath so much contrived nonsense that it becomes a slog to get at them. If you simply must read it, keep your expectations low. Aidan doles out Darcy's feelings for Elizabeth with a miserly hand, and this book doesn't deliver nearly the emotional impact or excitement of the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen would never!","review":"If this book were billed as anything but \\"in the style of Jane Austen,\\" I wouldn't have had such a problem with its style. But, Jane Austen writing about sacrificial fetal pigs, faked deaths and Darcy and his valet working as amatuer slueths? I don't think so. It entirely lacks Austen's wit, and delves off the deep end in subject matter. The first book in this series, \\"An Assembly Such as This,\\" was much more like Austen's writing, except that it didn't have her sly humor. I'm hoping that the upcoming third book is better than \\"Duty and Desire.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unnecessary Filler Novel","review":"Duty and Desire: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)This book would have been so much better without the tedious murder mystery that dominates the second half. Maybe if Scooby Doo and the gang had shown up I would have liked it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too 'gothic' for me","review":"I am not a big fan of the gothic novel which is probably why I didn't like this book. As far as gothic novels go, it was probably pretty good...it was weird and everything. But there were many things that Mr Darcy did or said that seemed too out of character to me. If you are reading this series simply to read Darcy's side of the P&P story then I think you could get away with not reading this book. Aidan does refer to some of the events and characters from this book in her third book but I don't think they are necessary for the continuing story in the third book, especially if you know the P&P story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"Although it was interesting in some chapters, it is so far away from who Darcy really is. The Story was nothing about his romance with Elizabeth and was about bizarre happenings that were so unreal pertaining to the P and P storyline. Book one and Book three were very enjoyable and I highly recommend reading just those. They jump right into eachother. Book two is completely on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with all the controversy?","review":"Ok, honestly a good book, and one that I would read again, but I did enjoy the first book more. Still overall, well written and enjoyable. For those who complain about the 'Christian moralizing' all I have to say is that it is Georgiana who has the change, not Darcy, but something other than just realizing he was a jerk needed to turn him around. Whether you believe in God or not, the people of that time did, so it is logical that this would be a focus in Darcy's life. Get over it. Maybe you're so hung up on it because it brought out something in your life that you didn't want to see. Deal with it. That's what great writing does, it makes you see a part of yourself in it, it does not guarantee you will like what you see.Ms.Aidan, Thank you, it's been a wonderful series and I cannot wait for the third book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip to the third book","review":"This book is filler nonsense. The only thing this book does adequately is explain the \\"Duty and Desire\\" title of the book. Darcy tries to make his duty to find a wife with money and rank to be the mistress of Pemberly override his desire for 'lesser' Elizabeth. This conundrum could have taken place in two chapters and spared us having to read this slow book about revenge and nonsense. Darcy would never have been caught in something so diabolical. I was also simply not in the mood for this book and storyline having recently read a similar nonsense P&P 'follow-up' called \\"Pride and Prescience\\" which was a silly, mystical mystery that I thought was stupid. This second in the trilogy could easily be skipped, as they aquaint you with what you missed in the third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little to do with Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's not a badly written book and does serve the limited purpose of explaining how Darcy comes to grips with his love for Elizabeth. However, there's lots of prose dealing with Georgiana and her new beliefs and an odd story about a several days in the country with an old classmate of Darcy's and his looking for an eligible wife that continues for way too long. This could have been condensed into a couple of chapters and suited the purpose adequately. If you are reading the series for the Darcy/Elizabeth interactions you can skip vol. 2 and move straight to the third installment since none of the Bennets make any appearance in the book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"British Isles Society, Peers, Intrigues, & Snobbery Insight","review":"As before, I love Ms. Aidan's writings showing us Darcy's view of Pride & Prejudice. This book takes you where Ms. Austen would never go, but that's ok; it's a great glimpse at the not so romatic realities of the upper class. I skimmed through this one the first time waiting for Darcy to get back to P&P which he does so hang in there. Darcy's relationship with his Valet comes much better to light in this book. I've skimmed, read, and re-read this volume very happily and await the third book! Thank you again Ms. Aidan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Missed Opportunity","review":"Pamela Aidan missed a great opportunity here. She had the chance to take us deeper into characters who are close to Darcy, like Bingley and Colonel Fitzwilliam, and she had a prime opportunity to display her wit with the London antics and \\"attentions\\" of the person who most wishes to be close to Darcy, Miss Bingley. Instead, we were introduced to an entirely new cast of characters. The only familiar character we learned more about was Georgianna. Too bad, really. If I can see myself picking up a book and reading it again, I consider it a good read. Since I can't see myself reading this one again, two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"Well, I will definitely buy the third volume when it comes out. But that's solely based on my admiration for the gifted Ms. Aidan. I'm unwilling to give up on her, even though I reluctantly have to agree with many of the negative reviews here. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a very different sort of third volume...."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as vols. 1 and 3","review":"This book is supposedly paying tribute to the gothic novel (like Northanger Abbey) and fleshing out Darcy's character, but it just comes off as too ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the language but not the plot","review":"I suggest you read the 1st and the 2rd and skip this one, I really mean it. Its a very boring one about Darcy trying to look for a wife in a new made up place full of new made up characters while Elizabeth is no where to be found. Its completely boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler novel - not worth your time","review":"I read the first book of the series and really enjoyed it, and quickly read through it. I was actually excited to read this book after the first, but was sorely disappointed!! It was long, drawn out, and boring. Some of the story line was interesting, like the relationship with Darcy and his sister, and his constant affections for Elizabeth. Otherwise, I thought the story was a little rediculous. It kind of takes a mystery turn where Darcy sort of plays a detective, and that really turned me off. I still am excited to read the third novel, for that is the parallel to the heart of Pride and Prejudice. Even if you enjoyed the first novel I would not waste your money or time reading this one. If I were to do it over again, I would just read the first and third books. I don't think you would miss anything by not reading this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Series should have been two parts, not three","review":"I definetly agree with the other reviewers who stated that this book was ther weakest of the three. The plot was very much like a Regency Romance Novel that just happened to have Darcy in it. Elizabeth was mentioned sporadically and never seen. The first and third book in the series are good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of Aidan's Three","review":"Over half this book is wasted in a Northanger Abbey diversion which is totally off tone from P&P. Miss Aidan's instincts are good - have Darcy look for a woman to replace Elizabeth. But the method of doing it was all wrong for a P&P wannabe. Harmless? No, because the wasted pages were needed later in book three of this series to beef up a too short chapter six (Under Transgression Bowed) on how Darcy changes his personality to be worthy of his beloved Elizabeth, even though he is sure he will never see her again. Even so, read this book to bridge between the first and third installments. You won't be sorry, because if you're a P&P fan you'll really enjoy book three, my comment above notwithstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Necessary!","review":"I gave this book two stars only because it was written well. It was COMPLETELY irrelevant to the story, and I could have read the first and the last without really missing anything. Elizabeth is not even in it once! That is what I love about Pride and Predjudice, the interactions between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. Or even Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley, who also wasn't in the book very much. I did love the first and last installments though, and couldn't put them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Mr. Darcy","review":"This dragged from cover to cover and I skipped over a lot of it. I'm sorry I read it. I've been in love with Fitzwilliam Darcy for years, but now I'm not so sure. It made him a prig and a fop. The first book didn't convince me that there were any true sparks between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth was only a lovely face with flashing eyes. She showed no profound wit to excuse such a fastidious man falling in love with her. During the second book I kept wanting to warn her to marry Mr. Collins."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can skip this one","review":"The first book of the 3 books is a must read, but this one goes way out of the way of a regular story...feel free to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked and disappointed","review":"I was very shocked and disappointed when I flipped through the pages and saw the topic, \\"How do they make crack from cocaine?\\" The telling of the whole process is even more shocking when it ends with saying how crack is a better alternative to cocaine because its street value is cheaper and the effects are quicker and more direct than using powder cocaine.Other topics of concern are about condoms and drug addiction therapy using acupuncture.

It's the only song I was familiar with from this group at all, and the only song I was seeking out by them in the first place. The album was literally being sold on Amazon for one cent (not including S&H), which was definitely within my budget. \\"Sleepwalking\\" is a great song, and IMHO actually eclipses Ben Lee's original version. Therefore, all 4 stars of my review are being assigned to \\"Sleepwalking\\" in and of itself. I've only given the rest of the album one listen since it arrived in my mailbox. Most of the other tracks sound dated and didn't wow me, but since Rocket has long since disbanded, I doubt my frank review will ruffle too many feathers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleanic memories","review":"This is a wonderful book for the person that loves military history and insightfulness"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why these things cost so much","review":"I would save ton of money buying a kit with 20 of these, but when you get 1 individual piece, you pay half the set value.Why is it like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I just purchased seven CDs by Biosphere (available at Amazon).

I found this medium an excellent way to continue reading about the characters. Forrest Carter does a splendid job of blending history with fiction. His historical research is top notch. I highly recommend this novel for the student of history, as well as the casual western reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"VENGEANCE AND SURVIVAL!!!","review":"Having just finished The Vengeance Trail of Josey Wales I will soon begin to read Gone To Texas. Carter portrays the Missouri Bushwackers and American Indians in a sympathetic light without the syrupy romanticism of Political Correctness. The Old West slang helps the reader get into the mindset of the previous Century. I strongly encourage this book -- and unlike the movie --the chess pieces do not fall into place with a tidy resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is absolutely fantastic western fiction. The struggle of a post-war confederate guerrilla moves with great speed and energy. It is easy to understand why Clint Eastwood tried to capture this on film, but (no surprise) the book is much better. Only one other western on my Top Ten Books list: The Virginian. Carter's book is THAT good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Western with a Different Slant on Post Civil War Times","review":"This book tells two consecutive stories about Josey Wales that take place right after the War for Southern Independence, a period of time about which I did not have a lot of previous information. The first is a story about individualism and government abuse of those individual who don't fit the mold or have no use for the \\"services\\" that a government longs to provide. The second is more of a pure western and a vengence tale after some of Josey's friends are murdered. Although he'll kill a man in a second if he's crossed, you can't help but admire his character and courage. I've lent this book to three of my friends and they all tell me that the book was great. Overall, a very enjoyable read, expecially if you're not a big government lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Greatest Western","review":"I'd rank this one right below Owen Wister's The Virginian on my own list of all-time greatest westerns.

Yeeeha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Western!","review":"If you enjoyed Robert Parker's multi-genre work in Gunslinger's Rhapsody, you will apreciate this fine novel. Carter uses a traditional approach with the classic recipe, but his narrative is powerful and authentic. The dialogue nearly jumps from the pages. While Clint Eastwood is a very talented actor, you will soon envision an entirely different man when you dig into these novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing, brutally honest, a must read","review":"It must have taken a great deal for a woman to imagine in such detail and put herself in the shoe of women all over the world who are being abused everyday. There are so many different types of abuse, emotional, psychologial, and even in minute subliminal ways that an uneducated, menial person would not understand.As a woman, I cry a ocean of tears for all the abuse that goes unpunished.It is time that the truth is brought out in the open, time to stop the cover up and the conspiracy. Time for women to stop blaming themselves for the wrong that have been done them by men. Time to take away the shame that eats away at a woman's soul, kill her confidence and self esteem.

The information in this book could have saved me much of the anxiety that I experienced in not knowing how, or from whom to get the direction that I needed. I was amazed to see how thorough Victoria Jaycox was. Her book deals with many, if not all of the same issues of starting over, that I was faced with. From grieving, supporting myself, moving, attaining legal and financial help,even up to starting a new relationship, Victoria covers it all. The commentary of the women who contributed their stories reinforces the message that we can get through this difficult time in our lives, and in many instances, emerge with new strength, and the courage to create happy fulfilling new futures for ourselves. Thank you Victoria!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a concert!!","review":"Being a fan of White Lion, I expected a concert according to the title. Not so.

Track 14 \\"Home Sweet Home\\" is one the illest songs to ever come out, this CD is not for the clubs or the radio it is for the streets. Switching over to Loud Records was an A-class move and hopefully they will get the props they so long deserved. If you consider yourself a fan of Hip-Hop than pick this up ASAP. Warning, this CD will bring the Warrior out of anyone who listens to it, that's how real it is......"},{"rating":"2","title":"The realest in the game","review":"Let me start off by saying that M.O.P. is the hottest rap group ever, Lil Fame and Billy Danz are the truth!! These cats have been in the game forever and they have never let us down it's always fire. Please do not call M.O.P. gangsta rappers that is a great dis-service they are hardcore rappers and if you know anything you know there is a huge difference. And for all you people saying they sold out, how dare you? M.O.P. has consistantly put out hits and have remained underground longer than most platinum artists have been in the game, signing with G-unit(50 cent) doesn't mean they've sold out it means that they would like more exposure for their music period. How long should they keep putting out great music without getting paid for it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama Lords Return","review":"Thumping and gun-busting for the 8th straight year, MOP never disappoint with this joint a single time.

Stealth, patience and situational awareness are the keys to this game. One must approach targets carefully and secretively to advance. In the higher difficulty levels, factors such as gravity and windage must be taken into account in order to achieve the \\"one shot, one kill\\" ratio. The backdrop is the burned out ruin of the once proud and beatiful Berlin, just days before the Nazi capitulation. It is a very eriery enviornment that adds greatly to the game's overall atmosphere.If you need a breather from mowing down hords of Nazi's in mass as with other WWII games, I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"SNIPER ELITE IS A CHALLENGE","review":"I LOVE THIS GAME.

It's a teriffic solo debut album by guitar phenomen Al Di Meola who not just shows his jaw dropping technique, but also great compositions and musicianship. The album dated very well and is an important landmark masterpiece of the wonderful 70s Fusion area - the album also features many other Fusion Gods at their prime time: Chick Corea, Jaco Pastorious, Alphonse Mouzon, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, Anthony Jackson, Mingo Lewis and Steve Gadd.\\"Wizard\\", \\"Land Of the Midnight Sun\\" and especially \\"Golden Dawn Suite\\" ( outstanding performance by Al Di Meola, Jaco Pastorious and Alphonse Mouzon) are Fusion classics.A must have for fusion fans and guitarists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to Al's impressive career","review":"Not quite as polished as Elegant Gypsy or Splendido Hotel, this is nonetheless and impressive debut album.One of the benefits of this album is that it features Jaco Pastorius on bass (his only album with Jaco)... it is true that Al played with Stanley Clarke with RTF but in my opinion Clarke is a distant 2nd to Jaco as far as fusion bassists go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is This Rock? Jazz? Progressive Rock?","review":"However you prefer to categorize this album, it is fantastic from all points of view - there is no need to talk about Al's guitar technique - everyone knows it is great - but what surprised me after hearing this CD a few times is the epic quality and complexity of the compositions, the imagination, the willingness to go wherever the muse leads... That is the real strength of this album. It is easily overlooked by progressive and classic rock fans, because Al comes from a \\"jazz\\" background. Yet his sound unmistakably embraces progressive rock, and even takes it into realms where not many rock artists dare to venture - improvization. This album is a nice blend of tightly and expertly composed music and improvizational wizardry. Call it fusion, call it rock, who cares? It has a special place in a fusion fan's as well as a progressive rock fan's collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more could you want?","review":"I just recently got into Al, but I can very definitely say that he is one of the most amazing artists I know of. This album has some of the most awesome guitar work, as well as some mind-blowing bass parts (performed by greats like Stanley Clarke and Jaco Pastorius!!!). The jazz/rock fusion instrumental styling is so groovy yet unafraid of being flashy and technical. It's sheer skill and talent combined with groove and melodic sensibility. For those of you seeking soothing or stunning jazz or lighter rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"1990 version","review":"This cd has not been made in 2008 as described above, but in 1990. Five stars for music! Great jazz fusion guitarrist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut solo record","review":"Land of the Midnight Sun is Al's first solo record. He displays some serious chops and some great songwriting. Jaco Pastorious plays on one of the tunes and plays an insane bassline that only Jaco could.Album worth that song alone. Get it!!! Especially if you are a guitar player.Older listeners should introduce Al to any aspiring guitar player that is not familiar with his playing.Highly recommended as is his other early solo records Casino and Elegant Gypsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al steps into the light","review":"It was 2005. I was at the tender age of 35 when I first heard Al's (okay we are not on a first name basis, yet I like to pretend) amazing solo debut. I prefer his work as a solo artist. In fact I was disappointed when Chick Corea seemed to take the lead in Suite - Golden Dawn:... Keep in mind piano lead fusion is NOT my preference. Corea is a great musician, just not my cup of tea. The rest of the supporting cast/ensemble make this album a must for a musican that focuses on anything, not just guitarists. Well, except if you believe the spotlight belongs on the triangle... then I suggest Ed Grimley's greatest hits. Mingo Lewis on percussion, Stanley Clarke, Anthony Jackson & Jaco Pastourious on bass, Lenny White and Steve Gadd on Drums are awe inspiring. Oops, focuing on Al's guitar virtuousness can leave one speeachless. Speaking of which, no lyrics/singing at all would have been ideal. Combined with the follow up, Elegant Gypsy, marked Al DiMeola is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors!","review":"I teach graduate level research courses and reviewed this book for the publisher.

The problem is that the housing cracked on me after the pump was dropped by accident from around 18\\" above ground. The crack was all over the bottom section of the housing. I didn't notice the cracks until I tried running the pump. It would not suck water out of the pool and notice the leak underneath it. Took the pump out, located the cracks and glued it. Tried agin, this time it developed suction, but still leaked water from underneath.Now, I am trying to find a housing for this pump to replace the one that came with it. I will contact Hayward and see if they sell parts for it.Another thing was not clear during the electrical connection is how to use the jumper between the 110V or 220V.I am sad to say, that my pump purchase turned out to be a disaster and I am still without a functioning pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Last.","review":"I bought and installed this pump two years ago after our other pump failed.

Patti, Sarah & Nona were so inventive and unique, they couldn't figure out what to do next, and broke up just months after this album was released.Amazing vocals, lyrics, & music way ahead of the rest of the pack. Labelle spread their messages out loud & clear that they could not be contained musically. This album is all over the map. Especially noteworthy is the expansion to a more rock sound with WHO'S WATCHING THE WATCHER? where Patti & Nona trade leads! And all of Side Two on the original album from CHAMELEON , GYPSY MOTHS, Nona's head trip epic A MAN IN A TRENCHCOAT , and the finale GOING DOWN MAKES ME SHIVER are mind and ear altering experiences. Amazing!This final album opened up the door to their solo careers. But think of what Labelle could have sounded like if they had continued."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need another Labelle album!!!!","review":"Patti, Sarah & Nona really left us wanting after Chameleon. What a superb album to end their collaboration. The mix between Chameleon and Gypsy Moths is brilliant, soon to be copied by everyone in the music industry. (Labelle was often copied, but never equalled.) Going Down Makes Me Shiver is a masterpiece. Patti outdoes herself vocally, and Sarah's soaring soprano gives you chills. Nona outdid herself writing these songs. The girls rock out on Who's Watching the Watcher. If you were lucky enough to ever attend their concerts, you never saw, or will see, anything like them.

I find that she tries to eliminate fatty ingredients so there is a lot of vegetable oil instead of ghee and nonfat yougurt.One of the things I do differently than the author is using canned tomatoes instead of fresh.

It runs 128 pages, has about 50 black-and-white photographs -- some fairly interesting ones at that -- and a brief history of the seven previous ships named Enterprise (including the Big E, of World War II fame).My guess is it was targeted at secondary school readers: grades 8 and up.

I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reference to start from.However, if you already own the original version of the book, be warned that this book is basically a reprint of the first edition. It's true that it comes with a new introduction and afterword from the authors - but the new material is only 4 (four) pages long, and can be found online for free in this very site under the \\"Look inside\\" link.

It is both a book to learn from and one to refer to later. It will eventually be outdated, but I don't see this as having happened yet. Although a large book, it is not bulked out like some, containing a lot of useful and relevant material. Perhaps not the text for those setting out from a 'cold start', but then a great follow up to 'The Quest for Quantum Computing\\" by Julian Brown. Not overtly rigorous, which is to its credit, as the concepts remain clear as a result. Certainly an essential text, where the prose does not get in the way.

The storyline and characters are as unplanned and under-develeoped as a day in the unpredictable reality we all call life. We choose not to be more than who we are, and with the humanity of our choice comes the antithetical inhumanity of the consequence of our choice. No mystery in the plot, just action and reaction, just life and death. Thinkers have an opportunity to fantasize about the before and the after, but effectively the message is neither morality not menace, neither fate nor fortune. Effectively, the message simply is whatever any one mind conceives. I'm a fan of the film's proposition.

It is an \\"arty\\" western, with lots of sunsets and a lovely sound track which mixes native traditional instrumentation and modern \\"Western\\" sounds to good effect. The acting is superb - lots of memorable faces, including a few Aborigines. The story is predictable, but nothing else is. But in the third act,it is not at all clear why the protagonist leaves himself wide open for attack. It is as if he had suddenly become incompetent, or had lost the will to fight. The fine dining scene just doesn't make sense to me. Why were there no guards, no dogs, no alarms.

There is not much of a plot in THE PROPOSITION: one brother is captured and another forced to hunt the third down. It is really rather boring and juvenile and the scenary is bleak unlike the stunning scenary in American westerns. The acting is okay but this is just another violent, humorless, dark and lifeless film.

First off, the cheap western version of A Thin Red Line meets the gore of a Terentino flick was pathetic at best. I could have filmed all the plot of this movie in a 30 minute episode.

It is a beatifully photographed film and it is also wonderfully acted by all involved. I do not think it will be remembered however with films like Unforgiven or the best of Sergio Leone. It is much more of a cult film. I would say its like a Pulp Fiction western. Modern, artistic but brutal. I recomend it to people who appreciate and study film and history.

It will definitely take either an extremely talented classical pianist and/or a strong reader in chords and feel for the songs to play a lot of these accompaniment parts, but they are some of the most enjoyable songs to play.

Peary is, as many have chronicled, very very fond of himself and loves to tell every reader how he singlehandedly saved the Inuit race, taught them so much, saved their souls and so on. This self-aggrandized spirit leaps from almost every page and quickly becomes muddling and frustrating.

The band has several vocalists; the instrumentation is mostly guitar, with an occasional song on kabosy (a small Malagasy guitar with a mandolin-like sound). The songs \\"Ramiaramila\\" and closer \\"Tongava Re\\" alone are worth the price of the album. This rendition of \\"Tongava Re\\" is much better than the one on the Dama & D'Gary \\"The Long Way Home\\" CD. The songs \\"Sambo de Gera\\" and \\"Ambahikily\\" are also highlights. Mahaleo is not a dance band, like Tarika or Jaojoby.

The first item, the \\"Pathetique\\" Sonata, sets the stage for Schnabel's unique music-making: a fierce, driving First Movement (with liberal accelerandi applied to the Coda); a meditative, rapt Slow Movement; and again, a charged Finale. Schnabel makes no attempt to smooth over or prettify the music; all the raw emotion is here. For those who have heard the \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata too often, Schnabel's deeply felt and yet totally unsentimental approach will be a revelation. The \\"Hammerklavier\\" Sonata will come as a shock at first, with a First Movement tempo so furious that the pianist's fingers occasionally derail.

CDB's best stuff never gets played on the radio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it blew","review":"this movie sucked wish i didnt have to write more. no sex poor nudity guys a wantabe girls are so so dont waste youre money"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, POWERPUFF GIRLS CD!!!!","review":"I have so much to say about this cd! And they are all good things. Each song PERFECTLY matches the character in the song. Blossom brags in hers, though, but I like her song. I like every song. No, I LOVE every song. Except for the last. The people who made these songs did a perfect job. I actually got scared when I listened to Him's song, and I'm 11! From the cute song of Bubbles, to the rock and roll of Buttercup, to the catchy pace of Blossom, each song is a treat to the ears. This is better than Heros and Villians. Some of my favorites include, in no particular order, the Ameboe Boys, Proffesor, all three girls, Boogie Man, Mrs. Keane, Mayor (its so funny when he says \\"this techno music is dope!\\") the new main title, Hearts and stars, oh, wait, I am listing all of them.

Frankly, I've had better times at the dentist. Mr. Raschke appears to sincerely believe the things he writes; that does not, however, make them true. I recommend \\"Satanic Panic\\" and \\"The Satan Seller\\" for a better-researched and more reliable description of the issue.For those who still believe in Mr. Raschke's version of history, I would remind them of the old Usenet saw: \\"The plural of anecdote is not data.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"HYSTERICAL!!!","review":"This is great for a laugh. Never have I read a book or \\"documentary\\" so misinformative. Usually authors like to research a subject thoroughly before writing a book on it. But not this guy. He figured he would just go at it and improvise. Well, it shows! It's the Geraldo of literature. Carl makes references to bands like Sultic Frost (???...Get the name right, it'll give you more credibility!) and other metal bands in a feeble attempt to prove his point; Satanism is bigger than disco. Stay away from this one if you are looking for anything factual. However, if you like books with countless references to \\"Chinese Communists,\\" then this is your pick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"c&k","review":"Love it! Greatest Hawaiian music I have ever heard.

The endings of all of the Brunetti novels I have read (most of them) are rather dark and unresolved. She has a very cynical (realistic?) view of the way the Italian world works - or doesn't work. Corruption is rampant and Commissario Brunetti struggles to maintain a commitment to justice amidst the corruption. He also has a wonderful relationship with Pauola, his wife, that is so nice. Donna Leon really makes you want to meet the characters. I think she's wonderful and hope she never stops writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"this book did not live up to the high expectations I have for her books.

To replace one of George's uncles as the taxman, a beautiful tax inspector, Caroline DeVille (Valerie Valois) shows up in this cold Canadian town. She soon discovers that no one, including George, has paid taxes in 50 years, and she brings in a bus load of auditors, which sends the townpeople into a panic.The premise is full of potential, but I found the characters one-sided and flat, and the love story undeveloped and unbelievable.If you like Billy Zane and quirky characters, you will enjoy this movie. If you're looking for a light, romantic comedy--the kind that you want to revisit over and over, keep looking. Putterton may not be worth visiting more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow but cute","review":"It was a kind of cute story.

I would have to say this toy met my expectations, but has a long way to go before it gets 5 stars from me. First, the inside of the carrying case is simply printed cardboard, thicker than your standard cereal box, but not as sturdy as a bisquick box. It is also stapled to the outer plastic case surprisingly. I can imagine MOST kids will pull that right out and then be left with nothing except a zippered case. Would I recommend this toy? No, I would step up to a better playset, and buy the 2 packs of pets seperately. Ours came with a frog and puppy. My daughters friend has the same puppy that was purchased seperately and it has a bow, but our puppy did not have a bow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carry case WITH PETS!!!","review":"The carry case comes with pets!!!

An excellent course for the beginner interested in Latvian per se or for the light it casts on aspects of the Baltic Family of languages,together with Lithuaninan. It is indeed with sorrow that one reads of the passing of this person. If you're interested in the language,get the book and cassettes from Audio-Forum."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Approach to a Difficult Language","review":"Latvian is one of the more difficult of modern languages to learn, both because of its case-oriented structure as well as its relative lack of cognates with the English language. Easy Way to Latvian combines a labor of love on the part of the author wih a touch of genius in guiding the beginner through the morass of Latvian grammar and vocabulary. The course comprises 24 lessons of graded difficulty which illustrate the use of the language in various social situations. Lesson dialogues are supplemented by a series of relevant exercises as well as interesting background commentary by the author. A set of crystal clear audio tapes accompany the text. Surely deserving of five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"actual proof","review":"this is a terrific 'get down get dirty' cd! the music gets hold of you and won't let you go! it's multi-layered because it's intellectual thoughtful sneaky and touches every level of your conscienciousness. actual prof is a sit back head back toe tappin' and a stand up foot stompin' good time... this cd will fill you up! after listening all i could say was 'whew!' and put it on play again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"I must admit that I bought this album because of Charlie Hunter's participation. I'm a big Hunter fan and I'd read and heard good things about clark. I must say though that the album is disapointing. Charlie Hunter only takes one solo, but that's not what bugs me. It's the artist that do solo that bug me. Clark and Hunter do fine on the album, but none of the horn players who take most of the solos are particularly exciting. If you want some good funky jazz, I recomend checking out the Charlie Hunter Trio or the original quartet or some of Scofield's latest efforts like A Go Go, Bump, & Uberjam (all of these artists' albums are quite good though, these are the funky ones). However, if you're used to the likes of Karl Denson, Stanton Moore, or any of those types, you might like this album, and I don't say this to dis' Denson or Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, it's Nora","review":"Promise Me Tomorrow is, without doubt, the only bad thing Nora Roberts has ever written. It is, however, essential for completing a Nora collection, which is why I don't regret paying over $100 for a copy in fair condition. There is a reason that Nora has said that this book is so bad that she will never allow it to be re-released. The characters are superficial in both senses - they are heartless and they are poorly fleshed out. Usually Nora is able to draw the reader into the story by offering characters that are instantly likeable and identifiable. You can see part of yourself in the protagonist. Not so here. All the lead characters are selfish, vain sex fiends. The only thing that identifies this as a work of the celebrated New York Times best-selling author is her name on the cover. But, that alone is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty dope","review":"This album was recommended to me through a friend. I have to say it was one of the more interesting choices I'd made in awhile. From the start Tim Lee crafts a soundscape that flows through the entire work. From start to finish the album swings upward, never gaining too much momentum, but simply progessing at the right pace. The songs drift together creating a sense of listening to a cheesy 70's lounge/swinger movie soundtrack. However, despite the odd arrangements and subtle humor, it makes for a beautiful piece of music. I have described a couple of the tracks as modern disco...definitely uplifting. The album's final track perfectly brings the elaborate journey to a peaceful close. I give this a solid recommendation to those interested in something \\"just a little different!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"Takes you along the milky way ride of sound and transplants you where you were hoping to land effortlessly!

Can't wait to hear more from this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning compilation","review":"This is truly an art book that invites you into the sensual, romantic and yes, dark, world created by the talented mind of Joseph Vargo. But it isn't only for those with an affinity for all things gothic. The artistry of his paintings along with a well written text make for a definitively inspiring read. The timeless appeal of his imagery is evocative and soulful. The stories inherent to each beautiful painting continuously unfold drawing the observer in ever deeper to the mysteries lurking within these lush and shadowy visions. This is not a book to be \\"reviewed\\", it is to be savored. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Rookie Readers!","review":"I gave this book 4 stars for the same reason the other reviewer did, there is something unclear in the text about the conclusion that the sun is always shining somewhere.

How can this book get such good reviews? If you are already a Jet Li fan and have been going on his websites and checking out bios on the internet from his official site and the Jet Lee Homepage, then this book will mean absolutely nothing to you. The main focus of the book is one review of his movies after another. And it always has to give away all the plot twists and endings of the movies, leaving the movies dreadfully boring to watch, except for the fight scenes which no one can ignore.

The novel tells the story of the beginnings of Israel right up through the end of the Six Day War in 1967. The one thing that I loved about this book, besides the stories being so vividly portrayed, was that all of the characters are so human.

What I got was a romance novel about 3 men's boring love lifes and their boring affairs with a little war thrown in for spice.The book starts out well but becomes hopelessly sappy. In addition, I was irritated that the story was told exclusively from the Israeli point of view (undoubtedly since I was hoping for the more-inclusive Michener-type approach). I stopped reading about halfway through.My grade: F"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Reference Book for \\"A bit of Everything\\"","review":"This is a fantastic book if you want to please everyone.From old classics to new Rock Anthems. Its got them all.Impress your granny and your teenage brother all at the same time.Good explanation of the notations in there aswell.Has both Tab and full music notation. So if you are trying to learn to read Bass music notation its great to have the tab there to help you out when you get confused with all those sharps and flats in some songs.I keep going back to it. People in the house pick it up, read the song list and say \\"Oh, play that one for me\\".(Why do they always pick the one haven't learnt?)A must-have for all those budding bassists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginners","review":"Kind of like a jazz fake book, but for beginning bass players, this book has a fairly wide range of well known rock songs. Each song is tabbed, along with the actual written music, so you can play along with different recorded rock hits, learning to read bass cleff notes and rhythm as you're going along. The selection of songs is kind of peculiar, (Allman Brother's Jessica is in here, but not Melissa), but the book encompasses a pretty wide swathe of styles (Everclear, Dishwalla, Sheryl Crow, and The Temptations each have one song each in here). The transcriptions are really solid. I'd recommend this book to any serious beginning bass player, if you're ever going to be good enough to get work as a musician, you'll need to be versatile. If you're content to play just one kind of narrow genre in a garage band, this book is probably a waste of time, becuase you'll only find one or two songs you'll ever use out of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good selection of songs.","review":"With 200 songs ranging from Chuck Berry & Elvis to Metallica & Filter, there's something for everyone. The tab seems to be accurate and easy to read. Great book for the beginner & intermediate bassist. You sure to run into some of these songs when playing around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bass Tab White Pages","review":"This plain covered white page book of music offers pretty much all levels of playing abilities. I like the fact that 2/3rds of the music is provided for both treble and bass instrumentalists. I have so far only found about 15% of the songs to be something I am interested in but that is just my personal taste. The remaining songs will allow me to expand my abilities and perhaps even find new tunes I enjoy and not be narrow minded in my likes and dislikes. Something can be gained from all types of music and I need to go there with it. It is a good book with many choices so I am thinking of getting another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bass Encyclopedia","review":"The best thing about this book is that the majority of the songs include the treble & bass clefs; as well as the tablature. For those of you that hope to learn how to read music, you'll not only learn what fret to play in from the get-go, but view the actual music notation immediately above the tablature.This book contains a vast array of popular classic rock songs. Easy to read and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost for fifteen years...found again thru amazon","review":"I was amazed to at last find at least one cd by Gary Myrick. I had looked high and low but with the advent of the internet, to me at least, I finally met with success. This cd has all the songs that the more expensive one listed. I wasn't sure when I ordered it because none of the songs were listed, I figured that I could return it but it's staying put right here. Hearts Pound and When Angels Kiss are still as good as they were in the 80's. I do wish his album with The Message is You would be re-released but this will have to suffice for now. Needless to say I am listening to the cd now while I type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myrick Fans Celebrate","review":"Myrick fans will agree that while \\"Stand for Love\\" is a fine example of Gary's work, there is a mountain of vintage material from his earlier efforts, \\"Gary Myrick and the Figures\\", \\"Living in a Movie\\", and especially, \\"Language\\". However, they have been extremely hard to find (GM web site). Look forward to Gary's new release of acoustic story telling titled, \\"Waltz of the Scarecrow King\\". It is superb. If you've grown with Gary...\\"Scarecrow King\\" is the next stop on the journey. Hope it is carried at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is an outstanding CD. I bought the album when it first came out way back when, and just now finally found a CD. Just great songs all the way around - Hearts Pound Like a Rhythm Machine is a perfect pop song."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was like finding gold in a discarded trunk","review":"I found a tape of Return to Forever seventeen years ago in a cutout bin. I had no idea who or what they were; I liked the cover and the price was cheap. I'm still listening, only updated on cd. You can't get better playing than on this album. Lenny White is worth the price alone. Stanley Clarke holds down the bottom end and intertwines with everyone. Chick Corea, who was the impetous for the band, keeps everything cohesive. Even Al DiMeola-who's solo projects and other band projects I do not like-maintains my interest unfledgingly. This is great instrumental fusion that is made better because of the remastered cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really dont get it....","review":"I first became interested in fusion the day my dad threw the mahavishnu record Visions of Emerald Beyond on his turntable. The sheer power and emotion of that record assaulted me completely. I then listened to RTF's Light as a Feather and the mellow chords and melodies entranced me. I then listened to Where Have I Known You Before by RTF and I was floored by the drive, the bass playing, the guitar playing, the drumming, and chick corea's synths and piano work. That album is a masterpiece. Later I went out and bought Romantic Warrior... just after 10 minutes of trying to cope with the cheesy synths and boring grooves, I had to turn it off. This is a landmark of the commercialization of fusion and nothing more. Ive been trying to understand why there was such a sudden turn from the previous album's energy and enthusiasm, and why this album is so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"KJhsfv","review":"This is album with no emotion, passion or sense at all!!!!!!!! It sounds like a computer midi file."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst sort of indulgence.","review":"Yes indeed, this album does owe more to Yes and ELP than to any jazz influences - it really is that ghastly. The nadir of jazz/rock - self-indulgence, pomposity and pretentiousness. Thank God the seventies are gone, a dreadful, dreadful record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I had truly forgotten how good this band was. This is without question the gratest fusion cd of alltime period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RTFs Romantic Warrior a Beautiful Jazz Mixture","review":"I have been a fan of Chick Corea for many many years. And, I must say that if you love \\"Fusion Jazz\\" then this album is a \\"must have.\\" Whether you like to sit quietly and listen or \\"get in the groove\\" get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A standard for all fusion artists!","review":"I used to play cuts from this on college radio some 20 years ago, and the grooves were white back then. There was nothing like this - nothing more inventive, trippy, or creative on the market. Now getting the CD (finally) some 20 years later, it sounds just as fresh as day 1 - this was serious jazz fusion, and paved the way for other artists like Jean Luc Ponty and Brand X to explore the outer ends of jazz/fusion. Thanks to classics like this, the roadmap was laid out and all fusion lovers lived off it!This CD was a true groundbreaker, and is hard to even classify this as 'jazz', as, even 20 yrs back, this crossed the barrier. If you want to hear where a lot of great non-traditional, jamming, off-meter session music came from, this is IT. But, heck, this CD simply is a wake-up call to all the dung that jazz has been buried under due to modern radio (smoooooooth jazz). If ya love hot instrumentals in a not metered tone, this CD is a MUST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of experimental jazz/rock fusion!","review":"Probably the most talented fusion group to come out of the seventies; each musician is a master in his own right. Clarke's \\"The Magician\\" is the craziest song I've ever heard and the rest of the album is a genuine masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly one of the greats","review":"Bought this album when it was released in '76 and it still sounds awesome after hundreds of listens. Never get tired of it. Like a great movie, kind of never want it to end. There is just so much here to digest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate RTF album","review":"This album is the most elaborate and mature of all the RTF albums, where each of these world class artists display their phenomenal qualities as musicians, composers and entertainers. This album is definitely more progressive rock than jazz in its project of fusion. Other RTF albums have more a latin influence, though there are moments here and there where it can be heard. This is one of my top five favorite albums, it is an exciting sonic experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jazz Fusion Masterpiece!","review":"This is Return To Forever's best album. I have all of them and have been a fan for a long time. Everything came together with this recording. Not only do I consider this their best, I consider it one of the best progressive jazz albums of all time! Iv'e listened to it so many times, and I still get excited when I hear it. BUY IT, and listen forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Prix","review":"I Had the chance to listen \\"Grand Prix\\" soundtrack before seeing the movie, and I loved it. Maurice Jarre is a great composer who has created beutiful music for many movies, remember Lara's Theme from Dr. Zhivago? or Lawrence from Arabia?The movie is a very good one, having great racing scenes and an entertaining script. I think is one of the best racing car movies ever made and along with the beautiful music you have a 5 star winner.I got it from MGM Home Video in VHS and I am stil expecting to get it on DVD. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for stuck valves!","review":"Got my hubby a used trumpet for Christmas, and the valves were completely STUCK. He even tried gently pounding them out w/ a dowel rod and rubber mallet. He used a few drops of this and let it sit for a couple of days, and voila! Now hubby doesn't play it, our 3 year old does and the house is filled with beautiful music............ NOT! Would recommend it if you want your valves unstuck. If you have a toddler, I'd just leave them stuck. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crab Tie","review":"This was exactly as I wanted. great purchase I was looking for the perfect tie for a function that is about crabs and this is exactly what I was looking for and a great price also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough and Well Written","review":"I read this a long time ago, and it still sticks in my mind.

How it ever won any awards amazes me. I could never tell what age he was in any paragraph let alone in any chapter. The best written and easiest chapter to read was the last chapter. Very depressing but you at least could follow the train of thought and what he was feeling. His editor should have been fired on this one and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone to read or waste their time. Frankly I would have stopped reading it after the first 50 pages (I give every book that much of a shot) if it hadn't been our book club reading choice.Barb S.Montana"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can almost physically feel the words of this book","review":"I found this book totally amazing. When I'm forced by my daily routine to put it down, I can't put it out of my mind. Phrases such as \\"I didn't want to die, but death seemed less than a lifetime away,\\" haunt me all day long. Spragg has an amazing ability to make the places and experiences, especially of his childhood, hyper-real in my mind. I can feel the cold river water, the stale-adrenalin fear, the deep emotional aches that he writes about. A wonderful book for anyone who relishes life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shared memories","review":"I have been to the places Mark Spragg wrote about. I spent summers at Rimrock Ranch and lived in Powell. I know the painter but not his son.(I knew the daughter) I was the daughter of one of the hunters from the east. I did not want his stories to end. The writing was descriptive, concise, from the heart and told of another side of life than what I knew. Yet there were some shared memories; the horse \\"bear baits\\", the rivers, the cold, the horses, the boys/men on the ranches. Thank you for these stories, these reaches into your life. I wanted to know more. I wanted to know if your pain ended. Thank you for these memories. I'm sending this book to my brother and to my male friends who know these rivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pentiacle/Pentagram Car Emblem","review":"This item is a beauty!

Let your imagination run free a little and you'll appreciate this item's versatility. It's far more than just a \\"car emblem\\".

The book is a collection of letters written by the author about her relationship with her father an alcoholic and her relationship with her mother the woman who married him. I don't know where you would find this book in a book store, it is not fiction, it is not a biography or a autobiography, and it certainly not a self help book. The subject of the book spiked my interest, the writing did not!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book on Concrete Design","review":"This is by far the best book on Reinforced Concrete Design. It is the most EFFICIENT way of learning the subject. It has theory, but it is also reinforced by plenty of examples and diagrams. For example if you want to learn rectangular footing design, it will take you less than 2 hrs for study, review and thorough understanding. The other plus of this book is it covers unusual but needed topics like stair design, balanced footing design and concrete pile caps methodology. Finally Dr. Hassoun also refers to the ACI code and blends it seamleesly with equations and examples and has SI problems as part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabe and Casey-SPOILERS","review":"Favorite scene with Casey-Cyrus telling her the truth about Gabe.Favorite scene with Gabe-His father's death scene.Together-At Gabe's father's burial site.What did you like about Casey-Her love for Sam and Jenny and Kate.

The pace was fast and furious but the devil is in the details. A plot cannot stand by itself but must have context. A 12-going-on-13-year-old boy in 1867 was almost an adult and Casey would be considered a woman grown - many girls were married at 15 and mothers by 16. And a \\"tall\\" Comanche would have been 5'7\\". If you want a tall Native American in the Plains states, you have to go to Pawnee or Osage. So I gave this book 2 stars. Less picky readers would rate it higher based on the innocent steamy sensuousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Farmer masterpiece","review":"Philip Jose Farmer was a tremendous writer, bursting with ideas; he had so many ideas that it's sometimes difficult to know how to enter his world. This book is a good entry point. It's fully self-contained, moves quickly, rubs lots of different ideas against each other and is very cleverly structured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antiquated, and sorta sad","review":"This book aims to conceive a new cosmology. That's interesting. Unfortunately, this laudatory ambition is thoroughly and completely undermined by the story--which is that of an unsympathetic, unbelievable protagonist who unhesitatingly follows arbitrary plot shifts through various universes while engaging in clumsy misogyny and trippy thoughts (\\"Whoa, dude...\\") and basically just making himself at home in a land of abandoned, unfinished plots and very bad writing.My, oh my.When someone says, \\"I stopped reading science fiction because it had no heart\\"---this is what they mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Albert...Poor DVD Release!","review":"'I Dismember Mama' (also known as 'Poor Albert And Little Annie') deserves a better release than what Substance Home Video delivers...a bare-bones, full screen version of the film, with nothing more than a wimpy photo gallery.

Where's the original theatrical trailer? I would have enjoyed watching a retrospective featurette on the making of this cult classic with interviews by actor Zooey Hall and actress Geri Reischl! Hopefully, a reputable DVD company like Subversive Cinema (who released the cult classic 'The Candy Snatchers' in a beautiful digitally-remastered package) or Code Red DVD (who did a wonderful job of releasing 'Girls In Chains') will give 'Poor Albert And Little Annie' the respect they rightfully deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"this game was not so good. it had a lack of wepons. only 4 or 5. it was very short. with 7 levels i beat it in an hour. the bosses were very easy and your statas advences to quickly. i don't see how this game has any connectionwith the movie. i wouldn't buy it if i were anybody"},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard side scroller with the Daywalker","review":"Blade for the GameBoy Color is yet another 2-D basic side scroller which would be practically generic were it not for the fact of the Blade license. Playing as Blade, you have control over a very small array of weaponry, and you run from side to side taking on a horde of vampires and beasts; all of which amounts to at least 45 minutes of gameplay. There's no replay value to Blade, and the bosses are easy to beat. The graphics are colorful and are standard GBC graphics, while the control is easy to get the hang of. This might be worth a rental at best for fans of Blade, but besides that this one belongs on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freud 1/4 sprial bit","review":"This is the first bad bit I have ever gotten from Freud, generally I consider them among the best.

REO is not a great cd. It has some good songs, but the production on this outing is horrible, killing most of the songs. Keep Pushin, and (I Believe) Our Time is Gonna Come, are to very good songs. Any Kind of Love, and Summer Love deserve mention, showing that they are heading toward the \\"big ballad\\" days to come. Rest of this disk is weak, and does not show the promise of the Speedwagon ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS!!","review":"I left something out of my last review-I meant to say the 3rd verse of the song \\"Keep Pushin'\\"-the brief guitar licks were left on on the CD!!

A parallel could be drawn between the continued importance of Albert Schweitzer's work on NT studies and the continued legacy of Goldziher.

Decent maps coincide with route descriptions and Kallan pinpoints his favourite campsites along the way. He touches on fishing here and there and adds humour in his text, making it a pleasant read. One of my favourite features of the book is the crisp and colourful pictures that accompany each of the route descriptions. Recent editions of Kallan's work went to black and white photos, which was a negative in my books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap photocopy","review":"A valuable title that could be very useful.

It provides hours of fun and imagination.I don't know how much fun the dragon would be on it's own, but with the castle it's absolutely great.The dragon is very durable, my son has put it through a lot already and it still looks great and nothing is broken on it.You can move it's wings and if you open it's mouth the flames that come with the castle will atach inside the dragons mouth so it looks like he's breathing fire. The knight can be easily attached on the dragons back so he can ride on it.This is definitely a great toy and I would highly recommend it for any child that loves dragons, knights and castles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Problem of Cultural Origins and Apt Metaphors","review":"This work is Nietzsche's first major publicaiton. In it, he is not yet the philosopher he would become a decade later. \\"The Birth of Tragedy\\" presents an interesting account of the tragedy of the Greeks--its origins and function. Nietzsche's contention seems to be that, in addition to being rational and rationalistic, the Greeks were strong enough to face the irrational, or Dyonisian, element of life. And they used tragedy to embrace that necessary element. As a powerful metaphor, Nietzsche's account of tragedy is compelling, but I do not know whether this can be regarded as the real cultural origin of the tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death of a Philologist","review":"Birth of Tragedy represents a crossroads for Nietzche, from the classical philologist to the philosopher. Pregnant with themes that will find expression in his later works, Nietzche makes clear his guiding purpose in this book as well, namely the overthrow of Platonism (no matter what Heidegger thinks). The analysis of the Apollolian and Dionesian that is the fulcrum of the analysis in The Birth of Tragedy is also a theme that will play out in Nietzche's more mature work.This book is a must for anyone interested in Nietzche's philosophy, as it provides a look into the genesis of his thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nietzsche's Best, in my opinion","review":"This is a slendor volume, yet it is my favorite of all of Nietzsche's works. So far as I can tell it is a fairly good translation, but obviously this book has not gotten the amount of attention that his other works have, so perhaps the definitive translation has not yet arrived.In my opinion, this book offers original and excellent insights in the area of classical scholarship. It also provides a good introduction for Nietzsche's later philosophy. I also feel that it is a must read for creative people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have - the DVD and the CD","review":"I have both of them and the DVD, which I bought later, reiterated what I had enjoyed in the CD.Collector's item.

Too many cook books are filled with pictures, and empty of information. This book is the opposite. Don't expect many photos, do expect lots of information.

After browsing through several cook books, I decided to purchase this one. I found the directions and recipes very well written and had no difficulty making a few of the simpler recipes for my family. However, after cooking the dishes a few times, I have adjusted some of the recipes to my family's tastes by making dishes less sweet in some cases, or using a bit less soy sauce than in the original recipes.Fortunately for us we live near an excellent Japanese market, so sourcing the ingredients was not difficult. A very helpful section of the book includes descriptions and names of various staple Japanese ingredients that you will need. The descriptions include the names are pronounced and written in Japanese. This is very helpful when going to a Japanese market where all the labels are in Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quintessential Japanese Cookbook","review":"Japanese Cooking A Simple Art was given to me when it first came out by my dear Japanese friend who is a master of cooking, design and well, just everything.

I saw the world through the eyes of others for the time I have dwelled inside the covers of this stimulating book, and was rewarded with some exciting insights into the younger generation.

I had to cut away additional tabs in order to get it to even bolt on, and even then it's slightly twisted.

Immediately on \\"Glue of the World,\\" there's that delicate combination of lo-fi acoustic guitar, backed by a casual trip-hop beat. \\"Twenty Three\\" continues this track, but \\"Parks\\" takes things in a slightly darker mood with a lonely mandolin and woodwinds. \\"Tangle\\" gets things perky again with a light house beat and a harp, while \\"No More Mosquitoes\\" gets into some deep twisty funk. There's an overall mellowness to the album which is perfectly appealing to a day of laziness (or, as Four Tet puts it, \\"You Could Ruin My Day\\"). Finally, the combination of a music box and the glitchy repetition of a tone on \\"Hilarious Movie of the 90s\\" brings PAUSE to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely gorgeous","review":"Captivating, organic, earthy, beautiful collaged music at its absolute best. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"ouch","review":"Four Tet performs his trademark mogwai-playing-squarepusher style trick with breathtaking results yet again. While perhaps lacking the immediate catchyness of tracks from Dialogue, his first album, Pause is still a fantastic album. The opening track, Glue of the World, with its floaty ambient sounds and sudden drumming sets the scene for this 45 minute journey into sound. But the standout tracks have to be TwentyThree and You could ruin my day with its harpsichord loops and the like. The sound of Post rock remixed and bleeping desperately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Dissapointed at all.","review":"After buying Pause only then did I decide to look at the reviews of it. Upon reading over some of the reviews I noticed that some people had other selections of artists that they said made this album look like a dissapointment. I thought to myself, \\"Damn was there something better than this out there\\"? After listening to the other reviewers selection of artists they thought might have been a better choice I came to the conclusion that me buying Pause was not a mistake at all. Its good music either way you put it. Buy it and when you do, listen to it for the music alone. Enjoy it for what it is and not for how it compares to other music in its genre"},{"rating":"2","title":"okay, okay- i was a little premature in my observations","review":"As my first one star review stated- i thought this album was a complete waste of time but i feel that i was a little premature in my verdict and that i deserved to give it another chance.I basically left it on play and repeat and after a few hours of relaxed, not to critical listening certain songs started to pop out and grab my attention. My verdict was further cemented when i heard one of the tracks on a advert which i thought was brilliant.This cd isn't perfect but their are at least 4 or 5 damn good tracks. The lesson i have learned form this experience- don't judge an album or song until you have had time to properly evaluate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"tries to be, falls short","review":"I bought this album purely on the reviews. I had never actually heard the sounds of Four Tet before. After listening to the album about a dozen times, I can hear bits and pieces of Arovane and other IDM labels, but Four Tet fails to develop any of these sounds to any meaningful capacity. I wouldn't buy this album again, now that I've heard it. Of course, YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAUSE TAKES ALL THE BAD PARTS FROM OTHER GENRE'S","review":"Man this is a poor effort, in this case minimalist means a minimalist result. On the cover, 4 magazines like Mojo etc. praised this album very highly. After track 6 had finished i had enough and was wondering how much the record company had paid the magazines, but you can't say an album is bad if you've only half heard it so i went on. Track 7 provided much welcome relief- a track that finally had some presence and feeling. Track 8 could have been good but the vocals said something stupid and repetitve which ruined it. After much hard work i managed to pluck out tracks 1, 4 and 10. They where nothing special as far as my collection goes but relative to this lame effort they where pretty decent.This is a worthy effort for a backing album for a restaurant or chill-out bar but consumers could do much better. Try artists like Cujo, Clifford Gilberto, Amon Tobin, Bent and Faze Action for a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neccessary Snideness","review":"Kenickie used to be a punk rock band who played cool punk rock songs. However, they considered punk rock to be smelly and beneath them, seeing pop music as the way forward. Trouble is, they're absolutely sh*xt at doing pop songs, as you will discover if you buy this record for what appears to be a grossly inflated price.

I don't think the author proved anything.But for family genealogists who have Rebecca Cornell in their lineage, the book is a must. The book provides good background and color of the time period, including many family facts that can be used in expanding your knowledge of the Cornell and related families. I was able to add lots of additional information to my Family Maker. So as a family genealogist, it provided a wealth of little known information and was worth the price---but as an analysis of a killing---I felt it was pure conjecture."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"I became interested in this book through my genealogy research.

However, she fails to convince me that this was an important event. If she had intended this book to be about trends in history, it might have lived up to its purpose. However, as a story of the death of Rebecca Cornnell, it fails to accomplish little. I learned nothing new from reading this book, and in fact found it irritating at times when the author guessed at what might have happened, with very little basis to back up her guesses. She also did little to convince me of the relevance of the connection with possible future generations that she tacked on at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"mind-blowing","review":"this cd is a must have for any accoustic guitar player/fan. i am a huge fan of fusion and indian music, and my favorite guitarsit is john mclaughlin. while all his work is good, and i have stuff he has done with miles davis, mahavishnu orchestra, carlos santana, and solo things, i think this is his best playing. i can discriminate since i am a guitar playing, and i feel that this is some of the most emotional and mind blowing guitar playing i have ever heard in my life. plus the guitar and violin compliment each other VERY nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good player, mine would not record","review":"I bought this from a competitor, wish I had bought from Amazon.We have had it for a few months, have never been able to get it to record.The book says 1 year warranty.

I went to 2 doctors who told me the nail bed was damaged forever and there was nothing I could do about it, and recommended acrylic or glue on nails, which I didn't want. I tried Nailtique, Nailtek you name it. I would buy Prolana by the case if I could. All my nails are strong, clear and healthy. NOTE: the reviewer who complained about no brush in the bottle - that's because you bought the refill bottle. The product also comes in a smaller size with a brush. Thank you Prolana, please don't ever change this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best base coat ever","review":"I bit my nails for years, and credit this product for making me finally quit. It gave me the strongest, nicest nails that I still get compliments on. It's not goopy, it doesn't yellow like other clear nail polishes, and it works great alone or as a base for color. It's a bit pricey, but it lasts a long time and is worth every penny. I recommend it to any friends to have thin, weak nails that won't grow. Truly great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good! Does not stand up to regular use!","review":"When started using the product found out that it does not really fit a laptop as big as it's claimed. After a days of use the zipper on the side pocket stopped working. After a few months the fabric where the rear pocket attaches using velcro teared apart. Also the fabric where the hook for the shoulder strap attaches teared. I bought it thinking that it will be the perfect fit for my laptop and daily use I will give it, but it is not adequately assembled or materials are of poor quality! Do not buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Received in tip top shape","review":"My daughter was very happy at Christmas. Great item. I will buy me a pair very soon.

Very boring book too. It doesn't really contribute much to discussions on the Soviet Union or Post-Socialism. Excellent book layout and graphic design, but terrible content. Avoid unless you want to be bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"big book- dissapointing content","review":"I was puzzled by much of the content of this book- probably based in part on the high expectations I had after reading some reviews here. Coaching as I know it focuses on the client's values and the agenda comes from the client rather than the coach. This book is full of exercises and \\"good ideas\\", but it seems to be infused with many of the writers' own personal opinions, agenda, and biases.I am concerned that those who are new to coaching will be tempted to \\"lead\\", \\"know\\", analyze or attempt to \\"fix\\" their clients, rather than partner with clients with genuine curiousity to create what they want based on their own (the clients) values and agenda. Granted there are many effective syles of \\"coaching\\" and modalities. As a CTI trained life coach I admit I have a bias towards a more co-active, and less therapeutic model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content did not live up to its introduction","review":"Unfortunately I purchased 7 copies of this book for a coaching program I was doing before I had read it. The cover information and introduction were intriguing.However, I found the content thin and failing to deliver on the promises laid out in the introduction of the book as well as the introduction of each chapter.

This, however, is her best. I feel better reading about Regency or Middle Ages periods, but the timeline works for this novel. Luke, who is reluctant to assume his ducal responsibilities due to severe emotional trauma, Anna who is afraid to hope, their sheming enemies and their scheming relatives are all dynamic and brightly colored. Both Anna and Luke carry secrets around with them, and they are not the ones you would expect from the hints either. Buy it. Read it.

This just goes on and on and on, and no, that's NOT a good thing.

This game is a bit monotonaous. basically you go around and train, fight a boss. The plot is weak and the game grows boring after a while.

I'm a die-hard RPG fan so this one is just plain disapointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a good rpg...er...no","review":"After having played such greats as Chrono cross/trigger and final fantasy, this game just doesn't compare. The story line is really slow, with battles taking too much time. The gameplay is fun with big towns to explore and many buildings to enter and so forth, but it doesn't make up for the fact that this is a very slow game. I bought this game 2 weeks ago and started playing it for awhile, and then set it down and forgot about it. I am very dissapointed in it as an rpg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Having played other Lufia games and numerous RPGs I must say that I'm disappointed. The game is of little challenge and has few surprises. You basically walk down a path, find a problem, fight a monster, go to a new city. Normally, I'm a person who sits and plays a game until I defeat it, but less than 1/3 of the way through the game I totally lost interest.The only interesting part is that you can capture and train monsters, but training them can be quite annoying when some love running away in battle and have late evolutions.I gave the game two stars because the whole capturing monsters gave a bit of variety, but the plot is weak, and the game is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Gaia' is a depressing journey","review":"Highly over-rated, self-penned and self-conscious album by the lovely Olivia. The making of this album was more therapeutic for her, written and recorded during a rough period in her life, than as an artistic success. She just doesn't have enough songwriting talent to fill an entire album. That's not to say she can't compose a gem or two, which she does nicely with \\"No Matter What You Do\\" and \\"The Way of Love.\\" Still, this dreary album is a downer in tone. She's a talented lady but, unfortunately, \\"Gaia\\" too closely reflects her bad times. This is a trip that only die-hard fans will want to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Channeling Kira from Xanadu","review":"Olivia missed the mark here!

I sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful book","review":"Don't buy this book expecting to see all of the parts of the songs transcribed. This is a fake book and is meant for musicians to pull off a reasonable facsimile of the song quickly. It doesn't have detailed information on the fills or solos of the songs. What it does have is the main riffs (mostly) and lyrics. It's very useful as a starting point for learning songs off CD and also to refresh your memory on songs that you have a passing familiarity with. My only problems with the book are: the chords and lyrics are printed so small that they are impossible to read from a music stand while playing, there are a lot of inconsistancies in what is transcribed, some songs have much more detailed solo information, others don't even have all of the signature riffs to the song, the binding is pretty weak, the pages started coming out of the book within a few weeks of buying it. Overall it is a very useful book to own if you read tab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"Mr. Begg has recorded under a number of aliases and projects,most recently S.I. Futures. This marks his first proper album under his own name, and is fantastic. This is what Kraftwerk might sound like now if they were as interested in creating innovative music as they are cycling.But while the Kraftwerk influence is huge, Begg also mixes up the styles: breakbeat, UK garage, and, most notably,dancehall on \\"Moveup\\".

I doubt the Alpha version is any better, judging from dozens of their discs that I have seen. The movie is not a tenth as sexy as the still photos that were published in Playboy (in which you can see why they probably did opt to release it in B&W), and whenever the girls actually start to strip, the film abruptly cuts away. However, European films of this era were frequently censored for US release and this is probably an intact version of an American print. It's a cheap film, but interesting for the number of real talents seen early in their careers. If you want to see why Jayne Mansfield was provocative (in her non-studio films), better to get Promises, Promises, the stills for which got even Playboy in trouble (and the stills are mostly from the film, which isn't true in THTH)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a little heavier than Jayne's usual stuff.","review":"In this movie Jayne plays a showgirl who's boyfriend/boss is in trouble with the mob.

The unbridaled energy, originality, and fresh takes on classic and alternative rock are replaced by what sounds like an attempt to gain mainstream acceptance. While the self-titled debut and Whacko albums rock out in a manner comparable to Jane's Addiction meets Joan Jett, Wonderland reminds me more of the corporate written-for-radio produced by The Matrix songwriting team. That's not to say that Wonderland Park is without merits, because Ednaswap is a very good band and they make great music and songs. However, this is quite a bit removed from their previous releases and a letdown after such an incredible album as Whacko. I'll keep this CD in my collection, but I recommend making this the final CD you buy by this band after you've worn out the other two. My favorite tracks are: 747, Back on the Sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD -- period.","review":"Hands down the best rock CD I've heard in a good long while.

Needless to say, it is quite unlike any of those albums. This was a bit troubling at first, but I must admit that once I considered this album as an entity unto itself, it amazed me! This is a very likeable and listenable album, and features the same sort of emotional purity of expression found on Shepp's more \\"out\\" blowing albums: That purity is captured here through plaintive lyricism, a heady mix of musical styles, and quaint use of dramatic effects (screamed choruses in the opening track, naively pure child singing on the closer, snippets of poetry and yearning lyrics). This album is fascinating in that it succeeds (imho) at capturing the emotional openness and purity of the free jazz idiom, by totally different means. Appraised on it's own terms, this is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"All over the map, but always on track.","review":"Attica Blues, tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp's response to the Attica uprising, is a much more sobering retort than one would expect from the 1960's firebrand. Vocal ballads dominate the album, which also includes early 70's funk, rock rhythms and some big band swing. It is a peculiarly mixed album, especially in it's vocal performances. The opening title track is one of the most furious free form funk cuts one could imagine, sort of a cross between Sly and the Family Stone and late period Coltrane. Whereas the final cut \\"Quiet Dawn\\" is a tentative ballad sung by a child. Spoken word interludes between tracks unfortunately date the album even further than the instrumentation does. Uneven in spots, but not without a certain strange charm; Attica Blues is one of Shepp's most diverse albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not digging it","review":"I'm a huge fan of Archie Shepp. His albums \\"The Magic of Ju-Ju,\\" \\"Mama Too Tight\\" and \\"Fire Music\\" are all classics, and I was hoping this would be more of the same--wild, free jazz of the spheres.Unfortunately, this album is more like Albert Ayler's \\"New Grass,\\" where vocalists (bad ones) really just ruin the album. I hate to say anything bad about anything by Archie Shepp, because I think he's one of America's great treasures, totally underexposed and underappreciated. But \\"Attica Blues\\" is not where I would start my exploration of his genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defining document","review":"This is soul, jazz, gospel and rock all wrapped up in one document. Everybody should own this album and learn from the messages inside the remarkable music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but useless","review":"Bought these for my son's computer and was completely unhappy with them. The sound was scratchy, the volume low, and the sound would cut in and out.

The original lectures set the foundation for any student. Joel asked all students to begin with the 1955 Kailua series and then follow with the '59 Hawaiian Healing tapes. The major principles of The Nature of God, The Nature of Prayer and The Nature of Error are presented completely. These are the keys to understanding The Infinite Way principles and eventually experiencing healing and communion. For original work see [..]and the Joel's audio tapes and cds at [.....]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accessible and full of deep spiritual principle!","review":"Goldsmith can be so very rich in content that he is difficult to digest without a class and great teacher to guide through it .... but this book is intended to enter the Infinite Way material as a student of his teachings, and so everything is spelled out and simplified. Taken from recordings of a instructional course for his students as he walked them step by step through spiritual principles and what to expect as a practitioner of truth, I found it full of insights and AHA moments. I underlined and highlighted a lot! Highly recommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic","review":"I too, like many other reviewers, saw this program on PBS. Outstanding! I was glued to the set. Seeing how Les Paul evolved; inventing and creating trends of sound for and with the likes of other great artists, is just amazing. Truly an American icon, one of our nations greatest ambassador to music. Not just every guitarist should want to watch this dvd, every musician, artist, oh heck, everyone should watch this. It's a great look at early radio, electronics, jazz, American culture and history. It provides a great window into the past to witness this man's contribution to music. A must have documentary for music lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great DVD","review":"I saw part of this production on PBS and wanted to see the whole thing. I was not dissapointed at all.

What he did for the world of music recording is also impressive, and anyone who records a note of pop or rock music is indebted to Les Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing Sound a WXXI Radio /TV/ NPR presentation.","review":"If you love the guitar get this DVD. Les Paul is one of the very best. You will get more than you will pay. Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed and learned a lot about Les Paul life","review":"I bought this DVD because I wanted to know more about how the Les Paul guitar was designed. It didn't accomplished my objective, but it inspired me. He's a man that had worked too much. And it's admirable that to this day he still plays the guitar very well. He invented things that today doesn't marvel, but that we live with them and makes posible so sophisticated music arrangements seem easy. A great documentary. If you live in New York don't fail and go to see him play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Paul at his best","review":"Since I was a boy I liked Les Paul, I always loved his sound without knowing he was the inventor of the multitrack recording, the solid electric guitar, the delay, an other stuff you use as natural things for your guitar.

Strongest recommendation to avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a beck wannabe","review":"Elwood is cleary just trying to cash in on Beck's groundbreaking work which is now already a few years past. The songs (particularly the first track) sound like out-takes from Beck's Odelay. Save your money, don't pay for a clear (bad) attempt to rip off what has already been done (better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"over hyped","review":"There was considerable hype preceeding the publication of this book. The attention was fueled by Richardson's political career as a fixer, shaker and head kicker. There was prmise that the book would 'reveal all'. However, the hype was just that hype. Richardson joins the dots on his career, and mentions all the right names and his contact withthem. There certainly wasn't anything controversial in the book. Oh, Richardson does admit that politicians do occasionally lie. I think that was obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark yet full of hope","review":"Emotionally gripping, theatrical, heartfelt. This book takes the structure of a teen thriller -- as overheated sometimes as \\"like\\" (Neihart needs to watch the \\"like\\" addiction) \\"Dawson's Creek\\" -- and turns it on its head. The \\"hero\\" gets stronger as the book progresses BECAUSE he ministers to the VILLAINS. You might only grudgingly respect \\"hero\\" by the end of the book, but he seems more REAL as a character. I want to read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lurid book jacket leaves you hoping for more","review":"BURNING GIRL opens with a fast-paced and illuminating characterization of the main character. Neihart relied heavily on dialogue here, and he was definitely \\"trying too hard.\\" Gen X cool should be anything but contrived, and that was not the case here. Furthermore, the attempt at suspense unravels and becomes a trite \\"only the truth will set you free\\" Aesop Fable..... Was hoping for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I couldn't get past the first few chapters. Two guys screwing in a car in the parking lot of a rock concert? Unless the headliner was George Michael, these two would have been killed. Get real. But I decided to give the book a fair shot and continued reading. Bad idea. The dialogue in the car between the main character and the sister was so laughable (and endless) I had to put it down. It made me cringe really hard. Does ANYONE talk like that? I think not. It's always sad when an older writer tries too hard to sound young and hip. Dialogue that is this lame couldn't even pass for a bad sitcom. Truly insulting stuff. It's a shame because the premise (and the cover) was intriguing. Don't waste a single moment of your precious time on this inane crud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked so promising, but...","review":"This is a case of the trailer being far better than the movie. Sounds interesting and I'm even from the Baltimore area this book takes place in. While there are some interesting elements, the clunky dialogue made it almost impossible to finish. Every other paragraph you have to re-read to try and understand. Luckily, I stopped caring and gave up. Worst dialogue I've read in a looong while and I'm a dramatic writing freshman so I've seen a lot of bad dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, Sexy, Crazy, Cool","review":"In equal parts I love and hate this book. I can't quite tell how serious the author is. Some parts, I swear, are so purple and breathless, but other, blacker, sadder parts caught me off guard, made me cry. The three main characters are shallow, Dawson Leery-like \\"kids\\" who don't talk at all like kids, but then again Peanuts never talked like real kids either.The murder mystery at the center reveals a strong, harsh, judgemental moral code. The settings are as gorgeously described as anything in Myst. I really tried to guess whodunnit and I failed.The sex scenes, boy-boy and boy-girl, were sort of overdone, yet I still was aroused. The violence in some scenes made me queasy and in other parts sort of made me laugh. I wished there had been more sex scenes with Jewel music because I really get crazy when I hear \\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\" while I'm in bed with my boyfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, humorless and no suspense","review":"This has to be one of the most pretentious novels by a brat pack type author that I've ever had the misfortune of reading. The characters are meant to be shallow, but nothing in the prose or plot is any better. Very slow and empty and unsatisfying. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast, sexy thriller","review":"I read Burning Girl in one night. Couldn't put it down. It's a thriller written by someone who's in touch with the hip, smart youth of today. The characters are all completely original, but totally realistic.

Incorrect, exaggerated or just plain ridiculous accounts.After reading it, I began to wonder if it was researched on the internet.The mercenaries who fought in Angola in 1976 are almost nonexistent in this book, even though most of what the public knows about soldiers of fortune is a direct result of this debacle.The accounts of Bob Denards actions in the Comoro Islands is extremely inaccurate, as if the author lifted it verbatum from some pulp magazine.When the author discusses \\"Mad Mike\\" Hoare, he begins by lauding him highly, but in the end depicts him as a pitiable has-been. And his account of the Seychelles operation is ridiculous in its recounting.I could go on and on, but the more I write this review, the angrier I become.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phife Dawg is lackin'","review":"Phife and Tip kept it real with the tribe.

When I first popped it in my ears started to bleed when I first heard \\"Flawless\\". To my horror Phife was spittin more curses then in all other TCQ albums combined. I don't mind them, but obviously this is not Phife's style. Its obvious that Phife completely sold out and doesn't give a damn about hip hop or TCQ anymore.

Instead, the two questers Q-Tip and Phife(we'll leave Ali out of this, props to Lucy Pearl)should have just stated that they felt they deserved some of the spotlight away from the group as a whole. To sum it all up, both attempts are utter failures. Phife's claim of 'Flawlessness' is total shame in this deservedley underrated and poorly produced piece of string."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"Other than \\"flawless\\", this album is embarrassing.

The album is all Phife Diggy. Less jazzy, more soul, and most importantly, more hip-hop. This whole album is more raw than ATCQ ever was.

A classic of Americana that I'd highly recommend to the Custer buff and the general reader alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best celtic music in France","review":"En effet, c'est tres certainement le meilleur groupe de musique celtique en France.

Much love to all three!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true third stream effort.","review":"Besides the odd album by Gil Evans in the mid-60's, one does not normally expect to stumble across a third stream classical-jazz experiment on the Impulse! label. Arranger and composer Gary McFarland's collaboration with introspective pianist Steve Kuhn The October Suite is one such exception. Most of the pieces were written specifically for Kuhn to improvise on, utilizing a piano trio accompanied by a small chamber music group. The first half of the album finds the trio enhanced by a string quartet. The second half features a woodwind quartet and harpist. While the first half of the disc is more tentative and searching, the second half has freer elements that border on an almost Tristano-esque kind of dissonant formalism. Not a typical album for either the label or the artist, but still a fascinating gem in it's own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAH!","review":"Just to clarify: this is NOT Self, Matt Mahaffey's project of pop rock genius.

This book is packed with everything the author deems necessary for ensuring you have an action-packed SP. He uses small chapters that are easy to follow and provides lots of examples from films and fragments from actual scripts (his own as well as others). This is not a how-to, more a what-others-do-that works. Actually, even if you're not a writer, this book is a great read for an insight into what analytically makes an action-flic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Writer Should Own a Copy","review":"Like many other reviews have said, don't let the title fool you. \\"The Secrets of Action Screenwriting\\" covers car chases, shoot-outs, and exploding bombs, but it also explores the protagonist's internal struggle, theme & voice, and everything else needed for a satisfying story.

Recently, while watching the HBO series Green Light Project, I couldn't help thinking that many of the difficulties the neophyte film director experienced could have been avoided if he had read this book. Rarely does a screenwriting book handle the essential elements of structure and production considerations so adeptly as this book does. The real secret provided in this book is how to give a producer more bang for his buck in both production and story. If you are serious about writing and selling your screenplay, then this is definitely a book you must have in your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"All 4 failed within one year!","review":"I bought my first two last year for two of the cars I dont use often.

This gives us back the choice of how we want to deal with the perceived problem, which is often diminished in severity just by being realistically and objectively regarded. The book goes on to present various excercises, such as the full body scan, to examine the physical effects/affects of our pain and ways to see it differently.

This revolution of the Parisian letters of the 1970s has now become a powerful wing of what is euphemistically called Cultural Studies, but which is actually a branch of Mao's Cultural Revolution, being played out today in almost every institution of higher education in America.This book is the purest Orientalism of the kind that Edward Said complains about. She actually argues that because the future is so bright after the Cultural Revolution that the possibilities are unlimited.It shows the left's prophetic powers in retrospect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have read better books","review":"I just think that there are better books about the haunts in Charleston.

The authors, Macy and Buxton, create incredibly believable storylines throught the seventeen chapter book. However, not all accounts are documented in history.

You can even breed them! in catz 2 you can't do any of that stuff. the only complaints i've heard were from people who uploaded they're catz from 1 or 2, and say that they're catz used to be friendly and do tricks, but refuse to in 3. otherwise this is a great game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totaly Cool and Asome","review":"I don't have catz 3 but my Friend has dogz 3 I asume that catz would be more fun bucause I'm more into catz than dogz.dogz #1 is fun but you can't do as much as you can in this one I would say that this game is the bomb. you would defenetly want to get it unfortunetly there out of cds probobly cause it's so. popular my brother who's 9 and my sister who's 5 even like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this game but it doesnt work for XP!","review":"I love this game so much but when i got a windows XP the computer wont work with it so if you have and XP dont get this game otherwize this game rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds fun......but it's not really","review":"I purchased this game after reading raving reviews about it...and I must say I was THOUROUGHLY dissapointed. I was bored with the game after a half an hour of playing it. There's really not that much you can actually do in the game. Your catz just wander around a setting looking cute and fighting with the other catz. You can dress up the pets with a few outfits or try to play with them; they don't usually want to play with the toys. I did not have any luck with my cats having babies like I wanted them to, and it was very hard to train them. All in all, this game is NOT worth the money.

This one has a different quality than anything by them I've heard before. Admittedly, I'm not good at understanding the Spanish language, but the whole tone and sound to this song speaks for itself as a strong heart felt statement for freedom.The title cut, \\"Somos Gitanos\\", gets the album off to a great start, and the second one, a ballad, has a great instrumental break which keeps it going. And of course, \\"Mi Fandango\\" is representative of the groups best of the upbeat songs. I was quite impressed with the instrumental, \\"Felices Dias\\", and felt it blended well as a lead in to \\"Poquito a Poco\\".This album does not present the group at their very best, but it still is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice work......","review":"I have the greatest hits CD, which I loved.

This makes for a lighter product , but with the same size box. The original box weighs 32 ounces, compared to 21 ounces for this new product.

Why is it that director loser needs to spew out garbage like this. The movie has no plot, no credible acting, bad effects etc. In fact, the movie spoiled my evening. 3 hours wasted. I am offering this so that you will not waste your time unless you like pre teen fart jokes, bad humor and no plot. If this is the kind of stuff you like, then it is possible you will like this movie. This assumes you are under the age of 4 years old. Son of the Mask is clear and positive proof that Hollywood will just keep cranking out crap as long as we will buy thickets. However, we won't. The director should never work again.

I was sure my kids had made a mistake after we watched it. I can deal with wasting an evening on a so-so movie, but this was bad and worse, parts of it were really offensive. How they can parallel The Exorcist having a baby's head twist around completely, then vomit green stuff and rate it PG is beyond me.

They could've used the pantheon just as it is and added the mask, without turning Loki into Odin's son and taking away all the fun of his trickery and replacing it with 100 % bad cheese.For a few cheap laughs it might be entertaining, but I'd recommend just watching the original over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"gut(t)erman is the common man's toilet paper","review":"son of the mask is the worst movie of the last 10-15 years. the movie is not funny and the effects lame. to make it worse, the director larry guterman has solicited friends and associates to write positive reviews in order to try to sell dvds. don't believe this bogus hype. parents protect your children from this disaster and guterman. he lost new line 10's of millions and deservedly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"So awful it feels like a Paul W. S. Anderson/Uwe Boll flick.","review":"Most of recent films that were so wretchedly bad as to cause physical pain usually bore one of two warnings: \\"Directed by Paul W. S.

If there were liquid badness, this \\"film\\" would have consisted of it: there is literally nothing even mediocre in it. Even Randy Edelman's score appears to have been written on a used handkerchief in five minutes - but can anyone blame him?

But I thought he was great in this movie playing the Mask guy. It's about a cartoonist ( Jamie Kennedy) who's afraid of being a father but he has a baby after he puts on the Mask. The baby has Mask powers and he teaches Jamie and lesson or two in fatherhood. The scenes between Jamie Kenndy and the baby are so sweet!! And also really funny and bizarre. The other great character in this movie is the dog. It's insane!

I bet if God saw this he would strike the producers with lighting strikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 mins of excitement, 70 mins of horrible","review":"In my opinion, the movie was dead-styled and hardly funny. The dog was probably the spotlight for me and I'll give Loki and Kal Penn some credit too, but all the other characters were absolutely horrible. The mother just practically abandoned the dad and son almost the whole way, and the dad was finally using his brain at the end of the movie. When the baby is not in CGI and is just a normal baby he's alright, but when he uses his powers he's one of the most ugliest things I ever saw.

I have the DVD \\"The Mask\\" and enjoyed it with my children because we LOVE movies with Jim Carey. So, I thought that this sequel could be some-what funny because of the theme and that the cast includes a baby with the power of the \\"mask\\". Again, this movie is ridiculously DUMB and I wanted to erase the memory from my brain, however, my children kept asking when it will come on the television again!

NOT funny, sure, a few chuckles, but nothing to write home to Momma about!! I hope to GOD that they do not decide to do another Mask film anytime soon, but I think it is too late, one of the last scenes, shows that Avery's mother is pregnant again!!

Rick Springfield was and still is an amazing songwriter/guitarist and added much of his own style and songwriting abilities to this CD. Rick's rendition of Eleanor Rigby is better than the original.Being a huge fan of Rick's music, I was really happy to hear some of his early songwriting and guitar playing. Although he wasn't the front man in The Zoot, he stood out even then.The Zoot was a good band, but when Rick Springfield joined, they became a GREAT band.

While serving as an English language intertreter, our hero meets and falls in love with the son of a major political family. Their love story is one of the most poignant and beautifully realized I've read in a very long time. This is a brilliant, multi-layered novel, rich in mystery, history and political detail. Twice nominated for the Booker Prize, Colm Toibin is a master storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book made me cry. Toibin is an amazingly elegant writer.

Richard Garay lives with his ailing mother in Buenos Aires, where he cruises for sex with other men and works at a loathsome job. After the Falkland War, he comes into contact with two American diplomats who become the catalysts for Richard's own changes and growth. He finds better work, becomes more connected with the world at large, and later finds a man to love. But even in Argentina, the far-reaching tendrils of AIDS touch everyone. The last third of the novel becomes an eloquent testament to the power of love and hope, against all odds. In Tóibín's capable hands, what could have been a tedious story about politics becomes a wondrous journey of a man into the world at large through to the other side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed persistence","review":"Even though I read the whole book, the main character's homosexuality did not interest me at all. I was hoping that it would be relevant to the story. I was thinking that Donald and his wife would try to use this feature of his character to achieve something through him for the US State Dept; but it turned out as far as I could determine that the American characters were not needed for the story. In other words, if there had been an aspect of intrigue in the story due to his homosexuality, I would have found it interesting and perhaps well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"betrayal, love, life and death","review":"What a very gripping tale.

From the beginning of the novel you were anxious because you did not know what was going to happen. Then through out the novel you were able to get clues to solve the mystery. Kind of like CSI! Tonya's unique writing skills make you want to follow her through out her novel. For example, in Jay's Mansion her writing tone changed in a way that made you experience what she was going through.I have had the pleasure and honor of meeting Tonya Blount at a book signing in Oxon Hill, Md. When she read a couple of pages from her novel and stopped the audience was practically begging her to read more.If I could rate this novel from a 1 to 5; with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best, I would give Tonya Blount & Jay's Mansion a 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"Jordan Baez is a successful writer free from her ex-husband's abuse and raising her three children.

And yet he does not explain how slavery could have been eliminated from our own culture without people who questioned their own cultural values. Questioning cultural values is how we improve society.

Thank you, Raven Records, please bring back some more of Michaels early albums. Too many people know him only from his recent cowboy work and songs like Wildfire and Whats Forever For. These are great songs but he had so many wonderful pure, bare, and uncluttered songs from his early years that deserve hearing. To me, he is to the southwest what John Denver was to the Rockies, only a little less polished.

They both went through it twice on the most difficult level (there are only three) and after that they didn't want to play it at all.

Every song on this mesmerizing album bears repeated plays. But don't think that this record is merely an exercise in retroactivity; the Lighthouse Family sound is indeed contemporaneous to Seal and especially the Christians (why does it seem there is no reference to that immensely talented combo anywhere on Amazon?) not to mention Jai and the late Ephraim Lewis. One day the Nineties will be rightfully looked upon as a golden era for British soul, and the Lighthouse Family will be as worthy a representative of that revival as any.

This album is so careless it makes one wonder if she has learned nothing from working with some of the top people in the industry. The inclusion of the song \\"Ring the Living Bell\\" only showcases how much range her voice has lost over the years.

It starts with \\"Emotional Step\\", a ballad with a chorus that builds to a soaring finale. \\"You Are\\" is an uptempo R&B groove with a vocal performance destined to rank as one of her finest. There is a beautiful cover of \\"Natural Woman\\" with a gospel feel to it. And \\"Little Children\\" includes haunting lyrics and another classic vocal performance. Also check out \\"I've Got This Feeling\\" which is the kind of song you listen to when you're driving in the springtime with the top down and no cares in the world.

It was probably recorded before any of the other albums. Remember: Eva's only goal was to be a session singer. This grouping is to showcase the songs by 2 songwriters, not Eva herself, --with Natural Woman thrown in for credibility. On every song she is reduced to SCREECHING and only her own background vocals are worth it--another kind of singer she only wanted to be. Notice the instruments are mainly synthesizers and sax. Leave producing Eva to Chris Biondo. Tony Taylor & David Christopher should be kicked out of the music business for trying to cash in--I think many of the other reviewers here feel the same.

No offense to anyone, but this sounds like a \\"demo\\" tape recorded in someone's garage. The recording quality is poor, as are the arrangements, the synth programming and the songs. I understand that Eva was hired as a session singer in this situation, and to the producer's discredit, this CD does not begin to touch one iota of her amazing artistry!

It's a travesty to the memory of the artist. It was not authorized by the late artist's estate (i.e. her parents), and would almost certainly not have been approved by Eva. This is a case of an opportunistic record company (NOT the company that has put out all of her \\"good stuff\\") buying the rights to some early demo recordings she did for a local songwriter, and trying to make a few (thousand) bucks on her posthumous popularity.The music is undeniably Eva, but it's far from her best. Buy all her other CDs first....then, if you MUST have this CD, steal it via Napster. Don't worry about the theft, the original ripoff ocurred when this CD was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have checked here first","review":"How disappointing. I snapped this up at the store because I hadn't seen it before. Should've realized that it was suspect, since there won't be any more recordings from this incredible artist.

Those who knew her personally all say she only sang songs that \\"spoke\\" to her. That is why her music is so wonderful....in every song it sounds as if she is singing the words from her heart. With the exception of this album, that is. Anyone can hear that the sincerity in her voice is not present in these songs. This sounds like studio work that she never intended for anyone to hear. It seems with this particular CD, others are now cashing in on her success, and it is a real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible voice wasted on trashy compositions","review":"It's hard to believe that such an incredibl voice was wasted on such trashy songs. To put this side by side with Eva's other CD's is just for the purpose of cashing in on her recent popularity. No shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancing with Vacuum Cleaners","review":"It is unfortunate that this album is being marketed as an Eva Cassidy album. It's her voice, and that's it. My opinion is that the producers of this album have done the musical equivalent of what the creators of commercials featuring Fred Astaire dancing with a vacuum cleaner and John Wayne selling beer have done. They've bastardized someone's talent and name to sell a product that person never would have endorsed if they were alive. It may be legal, their \\"right\\", and a form of art, but 'No Boundaries' serves only to illustrate how talented, soulful, and devoted to perfection Eva Cassidy was, and how the producers of this album are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice muffled in the tribute","review":"As a dedicated fan of Eva Cassidy's music (my wife and I own all of her CD's), it is amazing to me that this batch of songs was released at all, especially under the title \\"No Boundaries.\\" This tribute saddened me. The recordings on the CD (not a single good track) place her spiraling voice against a wall in an overcrowded room. Her \\"boundless\\" talent is treated as a secondary instrument; she deserved so much better. I implore people who have never experienced Eva's amazing vocal abilities to leave this CD alone and purchase one that puts Eva on center stage. For example, this CD has none of the intimacy, energy and improvisational surprise of \\"Live at Blue's Alley.\\" If the uninitiatied find Eva through another avenue, they'll fall in love with her spirit, and with jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unauthorized release of her music","review":"I recently read that this album was released over \\"strenuous objections\\" from Eva Cassidy's family. As someone previously commented, she never would have released these cuts to the public. I suppose there is always a market for unauthorized biographies and disc's, but it seems a shame that listeners \\"blame\\" Eva for poor quality of an album she had nothing to do with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Telling it straight: DON'T buy it; save your money!","review":"If I could give this CD zero stars, I would. I own all but one of Eva's other releases and treasure them all. \\"No Boundaries\\" is overproduced pop drivel that Eva surely would not have wanted released were she still with us today. Trust me and the other reviewers who say they love Eva's other work but have been profoundly disappointed by this one. It's just not the Eva that we know and love.In short, if you're new to Eva, start with SONGBIRD or LIVE AT BLUES ALLEY. You can't go wrong with either of those. If you're an Eva fan who has her other releases, do your wallet a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the eva i love","review":"this collection of her early session tapes seems like eva doing a parody of whitney houston. i've loved eva's work from the first time i heard her sing \\"i know you by heart\\" on christmas day of 1999. since then, i've acquired all of her discs, this one being the most recent. it's nice to have, the photographs are wonderful, but i won't listen to it often. it just isn't the eva that she wanted to be and did so well on songbird, eva by heart, blues alley and time after time. this one, i'm afraid, would have been better off unreleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eva does easy listening","review":"I am a massive Eva Cassidy fan. I have bought all her CD's (beginning after a chance encounter seeing her perform live in an Annapolis tavern [in 1996?]). As everybody observes, she was an extremely versatile performer, bravely applying her vocal talent to a wide range of music genres.On this CD, however, the result does not at all work for me. It sounds a bit like the background track to a banal teen romantic comedy. Comes complete with the Kenny-G-esque sax treatment.Eva cannot reach the sublime plane with this kind of junk food style music the way she can with her remarkable Jazz, Blues and Gospel numbers. My guess is that if she were alive she never would have let this one get released. It probably shouldn't have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"please listen before buying, it's awful!","review":"after listening to this cd a couple of times i still can't understand why anyone should recommend it. it has nothing to do with eva's voice and talent as i've come to know and love it. i have a very broad musical taste and i am always interested when an artist tries to explore new musical areas, so it wouldn't bother me to hear eva sing more poppy or mainstream songs. but on this cd she simply sounds terrible. just listen for yourself and decide. don't just order it because it has eva's name on it, like i did. i couln't get rid of it fast enough....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a true disappointment","review":"I fell in love with Eva Cassidy and her voice. After listening to Songbird, I had to go out and buy more of Eva's CD's. Unfortunately, I bought 'no boundaries'. What a waste of money! She said herself that she wanted to do any kind of music except that \\"pop junk\\". That is exactly what this is. I felt like I went back in time to 1985! This is not something she would have wanted to come out as a CD. Don't waste your time and money like I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"it seems suspicious that reviews for this album consist almost entirely of 1's or 5's...no matter how much you love eva, it would be hard to argue that this is her best work. i have no issue that these songs are more \\"pop\\" oriented. in fact, given her talent for revisiting other pop songs such as fields of gold, my interest was only peaked. but she clearly sounds as if she is singing someone else's songs here, rather than reinterpreting them in her own way. the arrangements are mediocre, as is her vocal quality. while some may enjoy this one, most will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Wanted to Like This One","review":"I have the other 4 main Eva CD's and really like her style and the way she gave her own meaning and depth to songs. That didn't show thru in this CD. It was all just loud without the great vocal quality evidenced in her other work. Buy the other four instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Eva, you are still my favorite","review":"I can probably understand why this CD was released. Eva's short life has left her biggest fans missing her and her wonderful sounds. This recording does not have the songs that give Miss Cassidy's gift its due. They are very sentimental and never do not develop the groove Eva fans are so used to.Anyways, everything else she has done to date is a five star act. Note, her 'Songbird' cd is a compilation of her first 3 recordings..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice Of An Angel!!!","review":"Eva had the voice of an angel!!! She had a clarity few have. She was soulful & bluesy all rolled up into one. On this album, she did her own version as well as a cover of Carole King's version of \\"Natural Woman\\" Her life was cut way too short & it saddens me that she won't be able to continue to bless us with her passion!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting to slide into soap opera","review":"I loved the first two seasons, but in this season the show is starting to slide into soap opera. Several of the plot twists are pretty obvious devices to maintain romantic tension. People get over one another pretty quickly and move on to their next relationships, in ways that no longer seem credible and real. Although there are still some humorous episodes to keep the series interesting, it's a real shame that the writers focused so heavily on the romance at the expense of the bigger stories of these interesting women coping with ranch life in the Australian outback."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCleods addict","review":"I got hooked whatching the show when it was on WE. I love that I can watch all the episodes with no intruptions now and on my time. I love the fact that its about these women running a property in Australia and you see all the hard work, challenges they encounter, and the love they have for each other.

If I am able to return it I would.Regards Harry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous music","review":"This has been one of my favourite Christmas albums for years. Perhaps because it has none of the usual suspects from a Christmas album...no horn concertos, no Jingle Bell Rock, so it forms a welcome break from the Christmas radio monotony. However, the album is so good that I find myself listening to it all year round as well. The songs chosen are excellent (my favorite is Riu Riu Chiu, a song from Renaissance Spain), the singers spirited, the voices clear, piercing (in some portions) and well balanced. Sometimes with Renaissance albums or concerts, all the pieces seem to run together with a samey-ness that gets a bit tired, but the songs on this album were thoughtfully ordered for maximum pleasure and I can happily listen to this album again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A promising first book","review":"A classic high fantasy tale complete with maidens, dragons, and wizards. Characters have respectable emotional draw and are consistent/well developed. Theme has a Christian backdrop without painful moralistic implications...as usual more thematic details would give away half of the book. And don't worry....don't care about Christian themes?...still an enjoyable read (insert true love, battles, swordplay) Although consistent, the language is maddeningly riddled with prepositions (reminiscent of older, classic prose). A promising first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mogul Skiing Booklet","review":"This was a very well written book about skiing moguls. It was encouraging and insightful (especially about those \\"professionals\\" on many ski hills in the Midwest who don't really ski moguls). This is coming from someone who started skiing moguls at age 30 and still enjoys them at 45. Advice for those just starting out--no matter what your age: don't be afraid to ask anyone who skis the bumps well, for some tips. Also, ignore most of the advice you receive from \\"professional\\" ski instructors, even those that are PSIA III certified."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and sweet review of mogul skiing fundamentals","review":"Nothing prepares you as much for mogul skiing as being on the hill. Nevertheless, this short book reiterates many of the lessons I learned on the way to being a better mogul skier. Hand and pole placement, weight distribution, spilling speed between bumps and pre-hopping are all covered very well. Illustrations in a book like this are never as helpful as video, but they certainly add."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Cracks the Code","review":"At last, there is a book that de-mystifies mogul skiing. Dan Diprio's book simplifies a rather complex form of skiing that plagued me for years. I must have taken 3 lessons on mogul skiing, and they were all a waste given that all 3 emphasized short radius turns (i.e., slalom carving) over and thru the bumps. What a waste of money and energy !!Dan has it right. DO NOT listen to those carving experts who wrongly think that carving skills on the groomed and hard pack apply on the bumps. Bumps require a far different skill most expert carvers lack or don't appreciate (e.g., less round turns and edging, steering the skis, reduced hip angulation, weighting both skiis equally, etc).Just returned from a Winter Park Colorado trip, and can now do moderate sized bumps on intermediate trails thanks to Dan's book.Thanks Dan for a well written book that is easy to understand and will allow skiiers to venture beyond the groomed !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own no other ski book ... this is the book you want.","review":"If you are a dedicated skier wanting to improve it is merely a matter of time until groomed trails are too easy and real skill and flow are to be found in the bumps.But effective bump skiing is somewhat different from groomed slope skiing. If you take the techniques (striving for carving long edge set turns) into the bumps you will be stalled immediately. The problem is that you do not know this .. This is the only book I have ever read that deals directly with skiing bumps. It is superbAs an aside, I live 30 miles northwest of Aspen and ski perhaps 80 times a year. Aspen prides itself on the highest number of skier/instructor days of any resort. Yet the vast majority of these (somewhat to very good) groomed trail teachers avoid the bumps like the plague ... Why? They can't ski them. Why? They are clueless as to the techniques required and so neatly explained in Dipiro's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"They scanned the pages and then compressed them into JPEGs.

Finally the problem of not being able to see the tabs on the hanging file folders has been solved! This product is the REFILL labels. When you begin using Smead Viewables, you need the starter pack (has the plastic tabs)...but for refills you need these labels along with theSMD67600 - File Folder Label Protectors.

For that price, I have no complaints. The bike arrived in good shape, and the design is amusing if you're an Elvis fan. The down side is that it's hard to keep the seat adjusted (it slowly slides down as you ride it so you have to readjust it every few miles) and it makes a noise that suggests the tire is rubbing on the frame (which it isn't). I'm also not sure it passes the \\"too cheap to be worth stealing\\" test, because it is rather eye-catching. Also, it's heavy, which is fine with me because I'm riding to get exercise. However, the average woman would probably not want to have to carry it up a flight of stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I was looking for a book on Christian Education and this book was referred to me.

I don't think so!","review":"These books have the most misleading titles! Unless you are teaching Sunday school bible classes, this book is mostly useless, because the only examples it gives you are about how to better teach the bible. The title says 'teach almost anything to pratically anyone'. That is so NOT TRUE. Sure, it gives you some pointers, but I feel I have to squeeze the text really hard to get some juice.I bought this book and 'Almost Every Answer for Practically Any Teacher' hoping to learn how to teach better, and to get in touch with modern teaching skills. What a disappointment and a waste of money! The other book went straight to the garbage can.Another thing: if all the examples of bible teaching were stripped out of the book, it would be half the size and, perhaps, a much more pleasurable read. Maybe it would even earn another star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise the Lord!

As a fellow OCD sufferer, I totally understand that bizarre feeling of noticing that a new \\"ritual\\" has arisen, seemingly out of nowhere and getting inadvertently \\"caught\\" by other people while you're doing something that seems odd to the outside world. Reading this book might make you think twice before you judge someone who does strange things. Unlike most of the self-pitying memoirs which abound on today's bookshelves, \\"Passing for Normal\\" honestly describes the struggles of living with OCD and Tourette's in a world not very willing to accept differences.This book has a fascinating footnote which I've never seen before in books on Tourette's/OCD. Apparently, children who develop Tourette's (which is often accompanied by OCD) have had a higher-than-normal incidence of strep throat and penicillin allergy. Since this is true for me---I can't wait to hear about more medical research on this particular issue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cool -- I have a friend with TS and OCD.","review":"I have a friend with TS and OCd, and he told me about this new book. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much because most of what's been written on the subject is so bad, so I was especially pleased by Wilensky's take. Like my friend, she views TS and OCD as obstacles to be tackled and lived with, not as excuses. Plus, she's funny and smart. If you know someone with Tourette's or obsessive-compulsive disorder this book will really help you know what it's like to live with tics and compulsions.

And unlike many another light lyric soprano, Elly Ameling was possessed of a very high standard of musicianship, considerable intelligence, and a sort of immediate charm that captivates the listener.So many of her recordings have still to be released on CD, but this 5CD-set goes some way towards remedying the situation. The repertoire spans a wide variety - French mèlodies, Lieder, light-hearted \\"sentimental\\" songs, Bach, etc. - and in each piece, Ms Ameling shows that quality of pearl-like beauty. It is a beauty which is also extremely pretty - a beauty of voice that is never overbearing and over-ripe, but perfectly blossoming upon the tree of inspiration.I recommend this set unequivocally. It truly is sheer delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, informative book!","review":"This is one of the few books that honestly tells how families survived on \\"family values\\" and determination during a most difficult time of our country's history.

This is a great book to let this generation know just how people survived with much, much less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of pet lover","review":"As a mother of a seven year old pet lover, this book was a great purchase. My son is dyslexic, so reading is tough for him, therefore, it is important to find reading material that interests him. Some of the stories he can read on his own, and some I read to him. Great book for cuddle/bed time! The more humorous stories such as Fudge by Judy Blume make falling asleep much more pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"not interesting","review":"Not nearly as inspiring at it sounds on paper. The only decent tracks are the Steve Roach and Robert Rich ones, and they're certainly not their best work. Others on the record are just guys seemingly randomly screwing around with their keyboards in perfect, expensive studios; not very interesting to me. A real wasted opportunity, IMO, I mean, Dali's stuff is crazy great! But I didn't get an impression of his works from any of this music. The liner notes were the best part, aside from the concept of the album itself. Pass...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the value","review":"This book was written by and for academics.

It is focused in the Paranthropus robustus specimens from South Africa. The text is pure narrative. The conclusions are interesting and display awesome pictures from the fossils.

I can remember really laughing out loud even though I probably didn't understand the comedy. When I found this DVD available I jumped at the chance to add it to my library and am very happy that I did.

I always walk away from these cartoons feeling magically transformed and energized.In the realm of vintage cartoons made on minimal budgets, Jay Ward rules! Peabody & Sherman, along with Rocky & Bullwinkle, etc, were very much like sly, fast-talking radio plays staged by smartly stylized cartoon characters. This DVD also contains rare Bullwinkle puppet segments that were used in the early broadcasts. They too underline how WAY ahead of the curve Ward was in terms of getting sophisticated and sometimes subversive humor in under the radar.By the way, Peabody's \\"boy\\" Sherman was voiced by a man in his 40's named Robert Tetley. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love a dog with his pet boy.

Mr. Peabody's complete self-confidence never wavered and was completely believable. His boy, Sherman, was delightfully inquisitive on their adventures. I watched this religiously as a kid, and was thrilled to find it on DVD to give to my history-major daughter. It's a great break from the mundane, and reminds us that history is still relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Adults & Kids","review":"Kids and adults will love these cartoons.

It's full of advices and recommendations for succeding in this job. But as it is a relative old book, many things in the music business have changed and it doesn't cover digital photography and dedicates more than 60 pages discussing films, lenses and bodies.

I read it very quickly and learnt nothing from it although I believe first time concert photographers will gain something with this book. I gave it 2 stars for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! This game makes up for X-Men ROA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Why in the heck can't we have an X-Men game like this one?????This game should be labeled as hypnotic by the ratings board. It's so submersive that time blows by while you are playing it. It took what I liked from Spider Man 2 and jacked it up to the tenth degree, like you're actually playing a comic book. The only way that they can top this game is to plant a VR chip right into my brain.Oh, one other thing. I got the limited edition. It's really the only way to go, since Big Daddy Venom is on the cover of it. This game makes me wonder; why not just a Venom: Lethal Enforcer game with this kind of action?This makes my third favorite game of the year; along with Revenge of the Sith and Marvel Nemesis. Luckily, I got somebody that's willing to buy X-Men ROA off of me. Lucky me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I coulda played Spidey","review":"This game disc never played & still doesn't play even to this day in my PS3 game console.

Its an OK game, definitely rental material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great game ruined by bugs","review":"The game continuously freezes up in boss battles. This could just be the PS2 version, but it occured with multiple discs. After researching this online I've found it is a very common problem.

Unless your into doing the same thing over and over and over again then go ahead and waste your money. but all you do is be spider man, chase a guy, the guy hurts civilians, save the civilians, chase some more, than fight the guy. Thats all you do as spiderman. and as venom you chase, run away, and fight. Nothing more to it. sure there are the city events and races but those are boring. Not to mention the game can be beat within an hour. The only thing remotely fun is swingin around the city, and even that gets old after 15 minutes. I do have to give credit to the graphics though, they're pretty good. But if you wanna spend 50 dollars on a game that takes an hour to play go ahead, otherwise I suggest waiting until the price drops down to 10 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and horrifying.","review":"PARENTS--KEEP YOUR CHILDREN AWAY! Unless of course your children like seeing kids their own age slaughtered. That's what Venom does. Plus all the bad language. Oh, and the jogger who get pulled into the bushes by Venom's tentacles and killed by him, all the while screaming. Even Spidey himself has his bad points by frequently using the word \\"suck.\\" I have always personally hated the Ultimate Spider-man comics for thier gore and violence, and the game is just as bad, if not worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"This is a game for kids under the age of 13. It has cool comic book style cut scenes but the actual gameplay is short, simplistic, and either way too hard or way too easy. And no you don't get to freeroam with Venom. You can only use him as part of storymode. I've been a huge spidey fan for well over 10 years but this game was a total letdown. If you're still in middle school you might like it. Anyone else should stick with Spiderman 2 or get the new X-Men Legends instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juvenile has a Great Flow","review":"The reason I gave this album 5 stars is because Juvenile doesn't just talk nonsense over good beats like 50 cent, he really raps, old-school rap. His lyrics are somewhat substantial but I like the fact that he has a cohesive flow, the beats are mostly good. In my opinion, Slow Motion, In My Life, Bounce Back, and about 5 others are the best tracks, the rest are just good."},{"rating":"1","title":"mmm....to much hype","review":"This album was NOT that good....I know that he's gotten older now and his lyrics are different, but hey, it could be so much better...i dont know what happend?

Juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album. He was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one. If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you \\"this is a good comeback album\\" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing--skip this","review":"juve is one of my fave rappers, but this sounds eclectic, unneccersarily violent and does not have any hits. the songs just aren't strong enough. it seems like he rushed this album and didn't know what he wanted to do musically. the only thing listenable is definitely \\"slow motion.\\" it has a soft, melodic sound that you wouldn't expect from Juve or a rapper, but it works (seems like genius only struck them once in the studio when they came up with this song), and \\"it ain't mines.\\" it is an interesting song. other than those 2, everything else sounds tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely One Of His Classics","review":"Juvie Almost fell off the map when he left cashmoney and i even like the fact that he left cashmoney, but all Juvie needs is Mannie Fresh beats and he will be successful in what ever he does.

I garentee it, a platinium record says it for itself...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is BANGIN","review":"Juvenile's best CD yet. Slow Motion could be the hit of the summer. #9 and #15 are hard.

Only a child will make her feel complete and give Tracey the cemented relationship she desires, and Jon has had a vasectomy. Tracey is unlike any woman Jon has met, a prize he cannot lose. He promises to be her knight in shining armor. Tightly written and fast-paced, the story deals with serious issues every modern woman must face.

While the book notes that he holds an M.A. and Ph.D in the life sciences, he also has a M.A. in New Testament Studies, which leads the reader to assume that all his conclusions are due to his scientific expertise. However, many of his arguments are weak, although they are accompanied by bizarre, incoherent diagrams.

First, it's obvious the writer is no more than casually familiar with the theological, philisophical, archaeological and even scientific literature.2nd, I'd be ashamed to be a scientist and publish something that is obviously so one sided. As correctly pointed out by other reviewers, the philosphical arguments (e.g., First Cause) have been addressed and debunked over the past 2-hundred years. The archaeological evidence that he claims shows that the bible is historically accurate have been soundly criticized. the text itself contains many internal inconsistencies, etc. This is a book of blind faith and salesmanship, not a scholarly work.

But I'd been told it had a hi-tech cave-diving theme, and it did turn out to mention several cave-divers I know. (But the scene is really a flooded mine.) It's not a mystery; you find out whodunit on the first page of the first chapter. I guess it's a suspense thriller.

The English version starts \\"blue hat, green hat...\\" The Spanish version starts \\"azul el sombrero, verde el sombrero...\\" which is WRONG it should be \\"el sombrero azul, el sombrero verde....\\"Anyone who actually speaks Spanish should know just by looking at the title- unless (like me) they made a quick decision based on the cuteness and enjoyment of the English versionso...if you want to just label colors or items in Spanish I guess it is fine, but if you actually want to read a story that makes sense or has appropriate word order- SKIP IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"ay carumba!","review":"Even though the translation from english to spanish isn't the best this book is more enjoyable than the english version.

It's both a work of art and a luridly entertaining exploitation shocker. Moctezuma was a collaborator of Jodorowsky's and fans of that filmmaker's work will likely enjoy this. You can also sense the influence of Mario Bava and Jean Rollin on Alucarda, the former in the rich use of color and the latter in the stylized erotic images. The Mondo Macabro DVD looks fantastic and comes with some nice extras including a british doc about the director and an interview with filmmaker and Alucarda fan Guillermo Del Toro.

I was very disappointed with this book, I could tell the horror parts written with Michael Scott's influence. Cannibalism, incest, monsters, people turning into jelly, after a while the shock loses its influence, and the reader becomes inured to the violence. I agree with those who say that Morgan Llywelyn should do her own thing from now on. That, and the fact that there will be no book 3, probably means this book is not worth the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh, if there isn't anything else to read...","review":"This is definitley not Llywelyn's best stuff. It is a passable fantasy/scifi read, but it seems written in fairly cliche form, and thus may seem suited for younger readers. However, the bits with the incest would have to be blacked out.In conclusion: Silverhand is a fairly easy read, and, while it does have some twists on the basic storyline, once the twists are past the plot becomes fairly easy to guess, with the only random element being which of the secondary characters will die next, and in what manner. If you don't have anything better to read, go ahead, but you'd be much better off with another Llywelyn title."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Nonsense Book!","review":"Hesitated getting this book at first as I've already seen countless books on the ABS issue.

Not only that, but the only other 4 wheeled stroller with the larger wheels (Jeep Wrangler) was discontinued. There is now no 4 wheeled stroller for pets with wheels larger than 6.5\\". As stroller people know, the larger the wheel, the easier to push and 4 wheels are much easier than the 3 wheels to control, not to mention more compact. I am very disappointed in Pet Gear for not producing a replacement for either the Jeep Wrangler nor the larger Happy Trail model.....The Pink Plus is also not as big.

For one, he is tall, broad, and even has a slight paunch, where as all of his other characters are shorter and slight of figure. I think this is what made me like this character in the first place, his solidness.

It ties all characters together like a bow on a present, but with frayed edges and bloodstained blotches. The glue of the film was the single-mindedness of a father, who is chased by both gang members, and members of his station through a nightclub.

An entire night the man is chased after and he is also chasing. The \\"plot twists\\" another reviewer mentioned I had already predicted long before they were revealed, and they were not even that great.All in all, almost the entire movie is about the man being chased in the club and him chasing his son.

Every song but one (Side Of The Hill) was done as a later Simon/Garfunkel effort and it sounds much cleaner and purer compared to the American productions. I found I Am A Rock a significant improvement over the Simon/Garfunkel version as well as Patterns.I recently had the great fortune of seeing the duo in Concert and had to agree they sounded best with a simple guitar as does this CD. My Simon collection is now ALMOST complete as I wish a release of the Concert in Central Park (COMPLETE instead of the heavily cut version that's out now) would be issued as well as a DVD reissue of Paul's only film and a DVD of the latest concert series. Anyway, for any Simon fan this is a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minstrel","review":"Paul Simon promised that he would never read his liner notes for the 1965 British solo album, THE PAUL SIMON SONGBOOK. It's understandable why-- Simon might have felt they were a too-awkward attempt at a conversation of one. Perhaps he had doubts about their oddly hallucinogenic imagery, as well.Maybe not the greatest of self-promoters, there's no question that Mr. Simon clearly was, by 1965, already a songwriter of the first rank-- the man's talents shine brightly on all of these tracks. That this earliest solo work wasn't released in the USA until decades later is as much a mystery as the true meaning of Paul's liner note chat with the Poppy Tender.What a delight it is to examine the sonic building blocks that two future Simon & Garfunkel albums would draw upon. And what a privilege too, to hear the master minstrel, in voice and guitar alone, telling his stories and baring his soul.

Even if you aren't a fan of Country music, you should see this movie...it's funny and has a cast of some great actors/actresses. I hope that this film someday sees the light of day (i.e. major distribution). It was originally only available as a rental (or as a purchase on VHS) from Blockbuster.

I just wanted to breakdown and cry over Summer and Ruark's stupidity. But when I got to the end all was forgiven.

I was totally shocked by some of the actions both characters took, but it made for a pleasant change from the typical historical novel.

The first time he fully and sneakily makes love to her as Rory (in the dark) she thinks he is Ruark and says \\"I love you Ruark\\". He could have just said \\"I love you too\\" but no it somehow makes more sense to deceive her anyway and say \\"No, I'm Rory\\" They could have been happy after that but rather than reunite honestly, he screws her and leaves!

We were quickly disappointed after 3 weeks when one of the chairs begain to wobble and we were unable to tighten the bolt as it wobbled in a location without a bolt. Wood glue helped temporarily, so we removed the chair and were down to 1 chair. At 8 weeks the table leg snapped and splintered while my son was leaning against it. My son is active but was not rough with it. We would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Sizes, Mis-Matched Wood","review":"I have been looking for a good table and chairs for my two children for over a year and really loved the idea of having some style... alas what this table & chair set has in style, it lacks in decent proportions. The chairs are TINY, better for toy bears than small children, and the table is really quite tall for such small chairs. The wood is also not as 'woody' as I would have preferred, more 'plastic' looking and the chair colour does not match the table colour at all. If I read this (my own) review, I'd think what a picky old housewife, but honestly I'm not all that picky... just disappointed.Assembly was easy. The items appear to be pretty strong and not wobbly at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality-huge disappointment","review":"While setting up the product tonight, one of the screws was set wrong and loose, the glue came apart on the two chairs, and as my husband gently placed a chair down for the first time, a chunk of wood split off the chair.

On the pro side, I will say that it is a nice looking table. Unfortunately there are more cons. The screws are constantly loose, and the chairs often feel \\"rickety\\" because of it. Even when all the screws are tightened the chairs still feel unstable. The table is the same way. The major con for me though is how small this table is. There is enough room for two children at it to eat and that is all. Forget about trying to color at the table with two children. There is not enough room for a box of crayons and two coloring books. When we first got this I actually thought it would be better as a desk with only one chair. If you are looking for a table for use by more than one child, I do not recommend this table at all. We will be purchasing a new table and chairs set this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good product at all","review":"I bought this product for my two little boys expecting that a childrens table and chairs could take a little bit of abuse, especially since the reviews I read on it said that it was sturdy and durable. This is not the case. This product is not great from the beginning. The back of the chair and the seat are connected by no more than wooden dowels which come apart whenever my 2 year old tries to sit in the chair. Also the screws used to not tighten all the way so the chairs are constantly loose and only get looser as time goes by and the product gets used. You can tighten it but they are never FULLY tight... same thing with the table. Today I was trying to move the table simply to clean underneath it and one of the legs splintered and snapped off. The whole set is, unfortunately, not of good quality! Don't waste your money. The boys liked to sit at it and color but it is not worth the money for the quality!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Boogie Rockin","review":"I love this CD.

Also the events in Jesus's life were all out of order, If you are going to tell the story of this man please atleast be accurate of when the events took place. Also he was treated as a tormented soul that needed more advice from his followers then what he knew about himself. Sorry the son of GOD had many years to figure it out before his ministry and his disciples were barely figuring out what he was all about let alone giving him any advice. A divine soul would have graduated past alot of these problems, even the enlightened Budda is treated better then that. The sound track is the best part of the movie. P.S.

Intriguing.","review":"Let's be honest. We don't know a whole lot about Jesus. We have a few words that he spoke (allegedly) written down decades after his death. So historical speculation is natural, people have been doing it for centuries, so let's just drop the whole blasphemy angle. Hell, if it's truly a sin to create a movie like this, Martin Scorcese would have been subject to a whole lotta holy wrath by now. Then again, those eyebrows surely are a holy terror, so who knows.This is a good movie. It humanizes Jesus (and wasn't that the whole point of Jesus anyway?). I have to say that I think casting Harvey Keitel as Judas might have been the single error in this film. But honestly, have we ever taken him seriously in a role? Naw, he's pretty much a mockery of himself and that's why we love him so much.DVD is great, a little pricey though. Cinematography is expressive as hell. Maybe a little overindulgent at times but the DVD will allow you to bathe in that overindulgence. Soundtrack is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"I saw this movie years ago, after searching high and low for a video store that carreid it.

But this movie is way wrong on portraying Jesus as how he was really. The movie however has great music but the script and the direction of a director like Scorsese are just plain dull. The only thing that can save the movie is the music from Peter Gabriel and that's about it. Mel Gibson at least was honest portraying Jesus.

HOW IN THE WORLD CAN JESUS, THE SON OF GOD BE A BAD SON!!!!???? I also recently saw all of the passion of the christ which was a masterpeice! The crucifixion scene in that movie was much more moving than this one. Go see the passion of the christ, a movie that understands and respects Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemous movie....","review":"This movie is pure filth and blasphemy against our Lord, Jesus Christ. It's an attempt to bring Jesus Christ down to a level of a sinner and a sinner is what he was not. Would it make any more sense to make a movie about any other historical figure and conjure up a life that never occurred, especially in this case, where scriptures state He was blameless. To read some of the reviews praising this movie and labeling the faithful Christians as \\"narrow minded\\" is narrowmindedness in it's own right. There's no room to speculate when it comes to spiritual mindset of Jesus Christ. He is God, blameless and died for the sins of all mankind. The movie and book is a work of satan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"I watched the first 15 minutes, watched the next 30 minutes on fast forward, then turned it off. I couldn't see what relevence one scene had to the next or even what relevence one characters' line had to the other character's line he was responding to. The guy playing Jesus acted the role with the childlike innocence of an 18 year old and the score sounds like it was recorded on some overused analog tape in a really cheap studio, reminiscent of the b-grade horror films of the time. I guess it's the kind of movie you keep screaming at to convey something coherent but if you manage to make it to the end the few pieces that fit together will seem all the more important for the way in which they were presented. Defintely not a film for someone with a short attention span or anyone who has a need to understand what they're watching as if unfolds. Or maybe you just need to have read the bible to be able to follow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is BAD","review":"The acting is bad.The special effects are bad; the \\"devil flame\\" blows in the wind, the river Jordan is a ravine with a foot of water in it.The concept is bad, it's like saying Winston Churchill was a Russian soldier fighting on the eastern front.There is so much that could be explored and written about in the Scriptures, I don't know why people have to make up fairy tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad transfer","review":"I completely agree with the reviewer who said that the transfer for this movie is bad. I waited a long time to buy that film, it was always too expensive on DVD (Criterion) so when I saw it on B-Ray for around 25$, I went for it. Bad decision, I was very disapointed to say the least. The picture quality is awful, it seems that all the colors are gray and the picture definition is equal to an ordinary DVD. I have a pretty good sound system (5.1) and the D.T.S was okay but not great, I've seen better. Criterion is usually very good but not this time, I praised them often but once in a while they slip one, this is one of those time. Another example will be The Scarlett empress by Josef Von Sternberg, it's one of the worse transfer of all time. So believe me, avoid The Last temptation of Christ in Criterion cause you will lose your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Temptation Of Christ","review":"I thought this was a very well produced video. It gives you things to think about. Something to ponder and consider if it could have been a possibility and if so what would the world be like today if it had happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"It misses the point","review":"The controvercy surrounding this film is actually silly. The novel by Kazanstakis mrerly uses the life of Christ as a starting-point for the exploration of the human psyche in terms of predestination. It is a philosophical work which is here given soap-opera treatment. It was a novel never meant to be filmed and as such the film is a terrible disappointment, despite some great scenes. Barbara Hershey is superb as the Magdalene and her performance alone makes the rest of the mess worth wathcing (for a while). David Bowie's brief appearance is also a gem, but all in all the film falters on its own pretentions. It cannot decide what it wants to be and Scorcese's good intentions merely pave the road to hell even further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the controversy--this movie is just painfully boring","review":"If it weren't for the controversy surrounding the original theatrical release of \\"Last Temptation\\", I don't think many would've seen it. Those who boycotted gave this movie the kind of press you just can't buy...and much more attention than it deserved. The bottom line is, the movie shouldn't have been boycotted for being blasphemous by those who didn't see it. It should've been panned by those who DID see it for being PAINFULLY BORING. See the \\"Jesus\\" film instead. It doesn't attempt to make an art movie about a God made in man's image and is far more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies ever...","review":"Forget about the controversy surrounding this film. Yes, from a historical and Biblical perspective, it's trash. However, the real tragedy is the film itself. It is just outright boring and the acting is atroucious. I expected more from the a-list actors invovled in this project. Especially Dafoe. What was he thinking?! The only redeeming value of this film is the soundtrack (Peter Gabriel's \\"Passion\\"). Peter Gabriel has created one of the most beautiful and provocative music scapes ever recorded for a film.Do yourself a favor if you've never seen this film... don't waste your time. Instead, just buy Peter Gabriel's soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judas from Brooklyn","review":"The Movie is extremely boring and too long. However, you will never see Judas as he is portrayed, or at least how he talks, as in this film. As he usually does, Harvey Keitel takes over every scene he is in, and he is Hilarious as Judas who sounds and acts as if he just got off the subway in Brooklyn. No matter what he is in , he is great and to see him in this role and spouting words like a New Yorker is a hoot. See the movie for his scene stealing alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross display of humanity","review":"The creators/writers of this film are obviously braindead idiots.

With all the books published, recently, about the Gnostic Gospels, the Nag Hammadi texts, Mary Magdalene, Freemasonry and other previously hidden material...now is the Tyme.

Unfortunately, Martin Scorsese's adaptation just isn't up to the level of the book. His greatest mistake was in casting Willem Dafoe in the lead role (Christ). Clearly, Dafoe was in way over his head. His acting is so bland and weak, there isn't much to admire in his performance of perhaps the most famous person in the history of the world. Supposedly, Scorsese first offered the role of Christ to Robert DeNiro, who turned it down. Now, this movie with DeNiro as Christ would have been worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves Better Recognition....","review":"Martin Scorsce's somewhat vilified and very misunderstood film definetly deserves to be watched with an opened mind.

The last temptation is a good idea, but it could have been integrated into the film much more effectively. As it is, it is contrived, convoluted, and worst of all, anticlimactic. That said, there are genuinely strong segments and intriguing concepts here. But for a much more fulfilling experience, I suggest just listening to Peter Gabriel's brilliant soundtrack in a dark room with a lot of volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worship this movie","review":"This movie is a direct portrayal of what happened in the bible. word for word, spoken by god himself. he mostly talked to the author of the book and then talked to scorcese just to help him out to make this movie as authentic as possible. since this is god's word, all of you must hail to this historical piece and light candles with the image of the virgin mary imprinted upon them.thou shall watch temptation of christ should be the 11th commandment. watch it or go to hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scorcese should stick to gratuitous violence","review":"With all the hype, I started this movie expecting to be offended.

I honestly don't understand why so many Christians are upset about it. Here in Sweden, some fundamentalist group always cry \\"Provocation\\" and \\"Conspiracy\\" whenever the movie is re-run on television, especially if it's close to Easter. I don't see the movie as anti-Christ or anti-Christian. Rather, I see it as a allegory of man's spiritual seekership. The \\"Jesus\\" of the movie is a symbol for each of us. Jesus is called by God. He has doubts. He even refuses. On the cross, he feels abandoned, perhaps betrayed, by God: \\"Why hast thou forsaken me?\\". The Devil sees his chance and tempts him. But, finally, Jesus sees through the temptations, \\"returns\\" to the cross, and dies victoriously, as the true Son of God: \\"It is accomplished\\".I'm not a practicing Christian myself, bur honestly, is this anti-Christian?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let This Be Your Last Temptation...","review":"I first bought this movie at a flea market here in Polk County. A lady saw me buy it and told me I was going to HELL if I ever watched it. Well, I just couldn't wait to watch it then, but I couldn't figure out why was I going to HELL if I watched a movie about Jesus? I was releived to see that I didn't go to HELL the next day, and I had scene this movie. It was a wonderfully made, beautifully told story that wasn't sugar coated like most \\"religious\\" pictures are. At first I was a little disappointed because there was SOOOOO much hype about this movie, but then I watched it and listened to it and fell in love with the story and characters. Remember kids, this paved the way for \\"Passion of the Christ\\" to come to pass. Willem Dafoe is fantastic as Jesus. He is believable and carries the film very well. Wonderful all around.

The cartoon stories were supposed to relate to parables in the Bible, but the link to the actual parables was obscure at best. Fortunately, the titles of the parables were displayed on screen at the beginning of each story, otherwise I may not have even been able to tell what parable they were trying to illustrate. The physical violence was higher than what I prefer to let my boys watch (think Bugs Bunny style cartoon violence). There are many secular cartoons that are less violent and have a better story and more redeeming or educational messages. Overall, the cartoons were forgettable as a secular cartoon which makes it downright disappointing as a Christian one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonflyh finger puppet","review":"Great little fingerpuppet.

I have fond memories or watching this on PPV and just simply being captivated. The Royce/Sakuraba fight was absolutely brilliant.

Plus he tapped twice, you need to tap thre times by PRIDE rules soooooo. . . .you all be quiet.Back to the DVD: Excellent action. Yes, Mark Coleman was good, but I find many GnP fighters to be kinda boring, and his fights were no different here. The show stopper is Sakuraba/Igor V. I have never seen more heart from a fighter. After fighting an almost two-hour battle with Royce Gracie, Sakuraba returns to the ring less than an hour later to face Igor, a tough opponent for anyone. Igor had a thirty pound weight advantage against him too, but Saku was awsome. Great DVD.

On multiple occasions, I've played this concert for friends and neighbors at parties for background ambiance. It routinely takes center stage around the third or fourth song.

My first song was \\"Free Falin\\" and that just led me to become an instant John Mayer fan! besides the technical mumbo jumbo on this blu-ray, its the HEART felth riff with which John Mayer plays is what really stands out. This album as a whole is just heart moving and a nice breath of fresh air to any collection,if you are sort of dead tired of all the clutter in your musical collection, get this album!

Only complaint is that the tripod legs rattle inside the pole when hiking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item!!!!","review":"I have an older, silver version of this monopod (from about 2000) and I love it. It is easier to carry around than a tripod, and when you need the extra stability you can always unscrew the base and let out the \\"feet\\". Just make sure you never let the monopod free stand or you may find yourself looking to purchase a new camera\\\\lens. And for those of us who have found ourselves in some less than ideal environments with expensive camera equipment, the monopod makes an excellent \\"deterrent\\" or club. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the base can become difficult to screw\\\\unscrew if it is used in an extremely sandy area, such as at the beach. I had to then take the garden hose and thouroughly rinse the base and feet of mine of for several minutes, dry them with a rag, then apply a light coating of grease to the threads. A minor inconvience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Monopod I have ever owned!","review":"This Pod is well built and will last a lifetime. A bit heavy but so is my gear and the weight helps me in steadying my Nikon D700 with a Nikon 200mm or longer telephoto lens and that includes a battery pack ta-boot. Truly a great Pod for better shots on the go! The fold out legs rattle a bit when stored inside the Pod but I fixed that with a very thin velcro strip wrapped around them. If you want the best, just get it!!V/RKMW"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manfrotto for that price is good....","review":"Well to start with, if you need a tripod, buy a tripod. Dont expect the legs to help much. Yes they do support the camera well, even with a heavy lens (total weight was around 4 pounds). But as you take the tripod higher the sway increases. So you wouldnt want to regret with your costly gear. Use this as a monopod and theres nothing in the world to compare with. Of course carbon fiber would have made it lighter, but then its great to have it beside you even for your treks. Strong and sturdy and even with the 500mm Nikon primes, there so much stability when you hold the cam. I have still to use it for my macro, but then holding a 1.8 pounds lens with a equally heavy body with bare hands and that too still, I guess this will be a much better choice...4 marks for construction quality, 5 would have needed carbon fiber4 for ease of use (self standing), 5 needed a free head with this at least as a starter kit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent monopod/tripod","review":"The handle is too wide if you have small hands it might be uncomfortable. Also when traveling, it does not fit in a carry-on, but you can bring it in with you in the cabin as an additional item, no one will object. What others have mentioned the sticks that form the tripod part are noisy. To fix that, use 2 rubber bands: one to keep them together, the other at the bottom to help them from moving up and down. Finally, and this is true for any monopod, fairly useless without some ball head at the top to fix the camera angle, so plan on getting one and the additional weight/bulk and $ it implies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little heavy","review":"Overall I am pleased with the monopod. Very sturdy and well made although it is a mite on the heavy side. It does double very wall as a walking stick and has gone on several wanders with me already."},{"rating":"2","title":"60's girl group pop meets 70's metal !","review":"A weird combination isn't it? Yes, this album does mark BOC's selling out point, but that's what I love about this album. They even \\"out-Boston\\" Boston.Godzilla was the hit, but it's really out of sync with the rest of the album material, which, underneath the thin metal sheath, is pure pop.Some of the music is so over the top that it's almost as if BOC took Ronnie Spector hostage and didn't let her go until she taught them her best melodies! I mean, just try listening to \\"Goin thru the motions\\" without imagining a trio of go-go girl in shiny skirts jiggling alongside a menacing Buck Darhma.This album is a fun listen, and a wonderful re-living of the golden age of 70's pop metal. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has it's ups and downs","review":"\\"Spectres\\" has it's high and low points; \\"Godzilla\\" is a classic, and \\"Death Valley Nights\\" is also one of BOC's finer moments. There are a few other good songs, such as \\"Golden Age of Leather\\" and the catchy \\"R U Ready 2 Rock\\" (although the lyrics on the latter song leave much to be desired). Unfortunately \\"Spectres\\" also contains \\"Fireworks\\" and the appropriately titled \\"Goin Through the Motions\\", which are absolutely awful, almost unlistenable pop music songs. I suppose this album is still worth purchasing, though, especially since it is very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior to \\"Agents of Fortune\\" over-all","review":"\\"Agents of Fortune\\" to me was a let-down because I had high expectations for it given the massive and classic song featured on it. \\"Spectres\\" was a breath of fresh air over all as an album. To me, it sounds like a mix of their early sound fused with the sound they were going for on \\"Agents\\" but now that sound is perfected on this.Before I popped in the album, the song titles made me think this would be a really cheesey album. The musical craftmanship, the vocal harmonies, the guitar work, and overall composition of the music crushed any notion of this being a joke of an album; this is a force to be reckoned with.The bonus tracks are ok on this; Night Flyer and Be My Baby were probably the most successful ones.Anyway, buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless pop replaces hard rock","review":"That's the problem with this album. The music seems to be tired. \\"Godzilla\\" at least sounds like fun despite the fact that it is not a huge hit in my opinion. One and only really good song on this one is so NOT metal... it is a slow pop ballad \\"I Love the Night\\". Others are either very uninspired hard rock wannabes or pseudo-rock popsy tracks which were supposed to capture new audience. What did the BOC guys think? that they were going to enthrall and win over fans of The Carpenters or Boston or Peter Frampton? A very misguided experiment is what I think of this album whose issue didn't change anything in 1977 except perhaps put a couple of bucks into the pockets of music industry... but barely enough to cover a dinner for the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID SCI-FI ROCK","review":"Satisfying even to the pickiest of BOC aficiandos. \\"Godzilla\\" (the weakest piece), was re-mixed for Stephen King's mini-series The Stand; and that re-mix is infinetly wiser. \\"The Golden Age of Leather\\" is classique BOC - a genuine must hear! This is the cd NASA should've sent to outer space on V'ger (instead of the hokey UN thing). Love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly improved sound","review":"Spectres is not my favorite BOC album, or even top three favorite but, I was so pleased with the previous BOC remasters I had to get it. For $10.99 it was money well spent.The remaster slightly improves the overall sound and clarity of the album and while the packaging is slightly less robust than the remasters of the first 4 BOC albums, it certainly has more to offer than the original cd release.The bonus tracks are leftovers from the same recording sessions that yielded the album so I wasn't expecting anything fantastic. That said, I actually think Night Flyer is a stonger track than one or two of the tracks that made the original Spectres. Also, M For Murder is decent as is their cover of Be My Baby (surprisingly).Overall a very solid remaster. I have already ordered the Legacy Edition of Some Enchanted Evening and as someone mentioned earlier...Where is the remaster of On Your Feet Or On Your Knees???"},{"rating":"2","title":"amusing childhood book","review":"Of all the childhood books that I can recall, \\"Jerome\\" sticks out as my favorite. It is a simple but comic story about a frog who is tricked into thinking he is a prince, and thus performs 'princely deeds'. Perhaps I liked it because Jerome remained a frog but overcame all his challenges through changing the basic thought concepts of his 'foes'. For example, the destructive dragon realizes through Jerome he can burn garbage (on alternate Wednesdays I recall) rather than maidens, and still be content.

I think Li Xiangting's guqin music touchs people's soul.I totally disagree with stephen c. walker's review. I think this person doesn't understand guqin music and just see some translated guqin books in English and had a bad influce from some non-qin scholars or players but posted some stupid thougts on their web sites and I guess this guy never seen real guqin before.

It appeared to me that it might be one of Mr. Li's early productions. The finger techniques, the excessive heavy touch on the strings, the unwanted metallic string echos, and the qin sound quality. None of it is up to his current level. Some of his other CDs are much better than this one. I enjoy Mr. Li's concert - his left hand movement is very mature,smooth, and impeccable. His right hand (finger flickings) is still a bit FORTE. The majority of guqin songs/music are for express yearning and to convey emotion and inspiration. If guqin music is delivered forte, it might not be able to convey and express the balance of ancient Chinese Philosophy - everything in balance and median, not too Yin (soft) or too Yang (hard). There is another well known profound guqin player in US, Mr. Wu Ziying. I have one of his CDs - I enjoy it very much.I am going to request Amazon.com to carry Mr. Wu ZiYing's CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Vampires, Lots of Plot Twists","review":"This one is different.

It heated my 8 x 15 office quickly. It did have some unpleasant smell at first, as noted by others, but it didn't take long to dissipate. However, it has progressively been much less effective in heating this room. What I really don't like is the way the heat is dispersed. The pics look like half of the front is a grill for the heat to come from. This is not correct. All of the heat comes out of the top, and the top of the BACK! There is no way that this heater can be placed next to a wall, or even under anything. Any object directly behind or above will be subjected to constant, intense heat whenever the heater is turned on.

Although those were great products as well, there was always a small hum. The newer, shorter, and longer version seems to be putting out more heat, and is almost deadly quiet. My only criticism is that the previous version had a spot in the back that had a \\"hand cup\\" in order to grasp the unit and move it, without touching the hot surface. This version does not have any place for a \\"handle\\" or someplace to pick it up. You have to grab both ends and lift up, and be really careful not to touch the hot spots.

The book classifies medical marriages into 8 categories (male physician married to at-home wife, female physician married to non-physician, two married physicians, etc.) I was surprised at how closely our category tagged our relationship's problems, strengths, needs.

Or judging nations that \\"claim\\" to be Christians still needing the gospel versus a revival? You may agree with the authors viewpoint, but Christians evangelizing other Christians and judging the state of salvation of other Christians is something I am very against and do not want to instill in my children. It's too bad because I really do love the idea of exposing my kids to the varied nations of the world and praying for each of them.

However, the story is captivating enough to make a fairly quick read for me, even as I was trying to be a student of the style of Spanish of the narrator and all the characters.

My toes curl when I hear intelligent people gush praise over this schlock.Of course, as with all negative reviews on Amazon, this one will be judged \\"unhelpful\\" by those wishing to confirm their conformist hunch.

There is way too much Retinol & Salicylic acid (acne drying agents) in the formula -- trust me, this will over-dry your skin.

All of these books are very self-serving and self-righteous, showing the authors in the best possible light while ridiculing those members of the groups they left. Also, Mr. Davis in his book praises Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League, who was in my opinion a pretty horrible person. That lowered his credibility with me to almost zero. The book has some passing interest for those interested in the Noahite movement, but I found it a pain to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but flawed","review":"J.

There is no way that she could take the tray off and put it back on, even I have trouble doing that. The back keeps falling off (the seat is actually 2 pieces, the back of the chair snaps on) and the leg design makes this toy very flimsy.She does enjoy playing with it still, but I definately would have shoped around for a better, sturdier play highchair.

Granted - I am by no means overweight - I gained about 15 pounds since I quit competing in dance and wanted to get my old body back. I can't speak for people who are actually trying to lose a large amount of weight - but I CAN say no matter who you are that you will enjoy this video and every bit of physical activity helps!

When I am watching an exercise video I want to be watching someone that I would love to have her body. I want to believe that if I keep with this video that my body will look the same way. That is way I didn't get past the first five minutes with this workout DVD. The instructor is NOT the girl pictured on the front of the cover. The instructor has a really cute face, and the body of a sixteen year old boy. Honestly, she wasn't feminine at all with any curves or lean muscle. It was bizarre to watch, it looked like you put a girl's head on top of a high school boy's body, there was a complete disconnect. I can't comment on the quality of the exercises because once she started doing the rowing exercises 5 minutes into it I was so grossed out I had to turn it off and switch to another DVD.

If you already have a moderate or regular workout plan in action you will enjoy this DVD. It's balanced for cardio and flexibility, and includes two workouts, one for upper, one for lower body. I'm a fan of working the total body so this wasn't really for me, and I also think it is tailored more for women in general. It IS a good workout though, you will sweat and be blowing hard by the end of it, so if you are an average couch potato looking for a quick fix, this will probably be too much, too soon.The cover pictures and claims on these discs always make me smile, and are pretty shameless with a bikini clad beauty, and the promise to lose 8 ponds in bold print.

Sadly this product doesn't come with a warning that it can't slice every cheese. Cheddar slices extremely well, for instance....however bleu cheese just crumbles it seems. Don't even try cottage cheese, as the results are entirely lackluster.Bonus: Can slice vegetables and cured meats, even though it doesn't suggest to do such on the package. Though I would strongly advise people to buy a vegetable or cured meat slicer instead as one doesn't know what ill effects the cheese slicer has with such products, for if a cheese slicer gets the taste for meat it can be quite dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought this cheese slicer when the Prodyne 805B Thick Beech wood Cheese Slicer I had tried turned out to be a poor choice.

I've even sliced through pepperoni and summer sausage effortlessly. Softer cheeses such as, mozzarella were no problem. The trick is to tighten the wire on the handle to make sure it's nice and taut. It comes very slightly loose, maybe for shipping purposes, but a few turns and your in business. It cleans up beautifully. And it also comes with an extra wire with installation instructions. I couldn't be happier with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"Fox Run Marble Cheese SlicerBought 4 of this item as Christmas gifts and was very pleased with them.

You will however need to cut the seat post down which can be simply done with a hacksaw. I use this uni for polo so I can keep up with the fixed gear bikes, but I also use it for commuting around town. If you do anything longer than 10 miles I would suggest buying an air pillow for the saddle which can be bought online however it is not a necessity. Also, after roughly 6 games of bike polo the pedal stripped out of the crank however replacements are about $20 ad they will be a great improvement...I personally ride 152mm cranks, but it's all about what you want to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulsar Watch","review":"This product was exactly as it was presented.

I found the narrative very condescending and prejudiced, and actually skipped or censored several parts. The author obviously preferred and defended Roman culture/politics over all others from that time, even when Rome was clearly in the wrong. The text also lacks footnotes, so it is impossible to differentiate the author's opinion from fact.Frankly, I am surprised to see this book recommended in so many Charlotte Mason circles, as it is as far as one can get from a living book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Good book.

I personally do not and couldn't stand her page on Columbus and the Arawak Indians. Here are some examples:Described Columbus' clothes as outlandishThe Indians taught Columbus how to extract poison. Nothing on what the Europeans taught the Indians.The Indians made cones for 100 people, Columbus' ships only 40. The author left out all of the provisions and at that time Europeans had ships that held over 1300 people.Canoes could go a \\"good speed.\\" How about the sailboats?The Indians settled their problems playing a game. Implying that the Europeans only fought. She must have forgotten about the wars between Indians and the judicial system in Europe (as well as wars).The Indians didn't have metal items such as knives and guns. Was that all the Europeans used metal for? How about plows for the past 3000 years?Her writing is nothing more than an apology. Very shameful writing geared toward children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Unfortunately, Ms Browne puts her biases toward astrology making those of us who work hard to use astrology for self awareness work a little harder. It's not that the book is all that harmful, anyone with an ounce of commone sense can see her prejudices oozing through, it's that the book is not helpful. There is no real understanding of the motivations of the signs and the tone is really self-indulgent and clearly a marketing sell-out. I'm sure Ms Browne is a nice person (libra sun) with good intentions (Aquarius rising) but her Sagittarius moon has definitely made her mouth big enough to put her foot in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am A Fan Of Sylvia's But . . . . ,","review":"I found that this book was quite inaccurate, as well as conflicting, in its assessments of the sun signs. For example, I am a Libra so of course I read my sign first. At the end of the chapter it gave a short rundown of physical characteristics for Libra. One of them was that \\"true\\" Libras have light eyes. However, in the beginning of her book, she listed *twice* that Libras are known for their dark eyes. This really grated on my nerves. Also, I found that her information conflicted with not only what I have read previously, but also with what I have observed myself to be true about the particular signs. To make matters worse, reading the book gave me a headache.....not a good sign.In summary, I would not recommend reading this book because I feel it is inaccurate and will confuse the beginning astrologer. I would heartily recommend Linda Goodman's Sun Signs instead for her humor, sensitivity, and insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too good","review":"I am a big Sylvia fan but she should stick to writing about subjects that she has knowledge of. There is so much more to astrology than this and this book certainly will do nothing to educate people about a very complex science. If this book was written to amuse, I am not laughing. But then again, what would I know? I am a Taurus, so therefore I am stupid, boring and I stalk my former lovers. Save your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Setting astrology back 400 years","review":"As a practicing astrologer for 30 years I was appalled at Ms. Browne's latest book. Her theories and thoughts not only eliminate a good deal of valid information available in the world it also brings back a notion that we are not creatures of free will...but ones who have so thoroughly chosen our paths that we are unable to change them. Don't waste your money....buy a subscription to a local paper that carries Joyce Jillson's horoscopes....you'll learn more and come away far more enlightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth reading","review":"I have never given a negative review about a book but I have to say I am very disappointed with this one. I found her descriptions of each sign rather prejudiced and not really fact based. Some of her comments about one sign were repeated for another... a lucky guess maybe? Miss Browne should stick to things she knows as opposed to writing about things she perhaps has amibiguous feelings about. A waste of paper and time for those who want to learn more about astrology as opposed to reading an author's scathing personal opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all!","review":"This is also the first time I took the time to review a book. I was not impressed at all. Studying astrology part time for years, I was downright disturbed by some of her statements. She seems to contradict many things through the years I have read over and over again, and found to be true. She should have called this book \\"How she see other signs\\", period. It seems to be her personal opinion mainly. Humor I honestly can say I never laugh out loud once. Want a funny book on astrology that also is accurate, \\"Born on a rotten day\\" by Hazel Dixon-Cooper. In my opinion, Sylvia is on an extreme prolific writing kick where she will publish just about anything to make more money. This is the last book I will buy from hers for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan of Sylvia's...But Not of This Book","review":"I have to say that Sylvia Browne is a great author and a blessing to the literary community. But, her work \\"Astrology Through a Psychic's Eyes\\" fails to do justice to her writing abilities. The book is interesting, but I wouldn't say that it's a must-have. It's extremely short, offering an overview on the personalities of the different sun signs. Browne's sense of humor gives energy to the book, but even that isn't enough to pull it through. I read it in about an hour (probably less) and never looked at it again. I'd say that her assessment of an Aries (my sign) is only partially true to my personality, and I was disappointed that Sylvia couldn't come any closer to the truth than the sun sign profiles I've found on the internet. My recommendation: borrow the book from a friend or from the library; buying it definitely isn't worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Got Burned By A Taurus","review":"If I could have I wouldn't have given this book any stars. I looked through this book in a bookstore and the only thing I could gather from her descriptions of people of the different signs is that Sylvia must have gotten seriously burned by a Taurus. I looked through a few of the different signs and she obviously holds quite a bit of resentment towards Taureans. Furthermore, the \\"valid\\" or \\"well-known\\" descriptions that she offers for the various signs are the same descriptions you could find in ANY OTHER ASTROLOGY book. I wouldn't waste your time or money for there is NOTHING PROFOUND OR ENLIGHTENING about her book. I also think Sylvia needs to seek guidance from her spirit guides on releasing her anger and resentment towards Taureans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"She may be a psychic, but she misses on some basic fundamentals of astrology, like knowing the elements of each Sun Sign. . . Not for serious students of astrology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"I'm a big Sylvia Browne fan, and most of the things she writes about really hit home with me, but I could not identify with anything in this book. Usually, you can pull something out and say \\"that's me!\\" but that didn't happen for me, and I consider myself to by a very open-minded person. I don't think that astrology is really one of Sylvia's strong points. Additionally, the book was a lot smaller than I had expected. In comparison to her other books, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sylvia, stick to what you know","review":"Sylvia's other books have helped contribute to understanding the intuitive world. But here, she strays into territory she'd do better leaving to professional astrologers. It's books like these (not even on a par with a good beginner book written by a practicing astrologer) that mislead people about what kind of information is available to them through the use of astrology. Astrology can offer a breath and depth of information and insight that is staggering. You're not going to find either depth or breath in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Astrology advice here","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It should have been entitled \\" A humourous view of astrology through a psychic's eyes\\" She clearly is poking fun but I found it rather mean-spirited.

She promises you will not read any of this information in any other astrology book which is definitely a promise that is broken.

For the price, I feel this book is outstanding and one of the best of the Dover reprints.

The product did not fit me correctly due to the bridge area being far too narrow, and the glasses made to fit a wider face.

This purchase was not a total loss as I heavily modified the glasses with a dremel tool to correct the bridge problem, and heated the middle in order to bend the glasses inward slightly for a decent fit.

On the other hand, if you're looking for a thought provoking strangely realistic character driven story that happens to have some familiar DCU faces (and capes) in it then you'll be happy with your purchase.Animal Man Book One is composed of several short stand alone stories spread out the first 9 issues of Grant Morrison's brilliant spearheading of the Animal Man mythos. They're all brilliantly written and illustrated. Any true comic fan will love this book. There really isn't much else to say about it. You need to read it. It's filled with surreal and funny moments.

Also, while there is a wealth of material concerning basic and intermediate practical issues, the detail peters out just when the most practical issues are raised - such as delta hedging of credit derivatives by maturity buckets rather than with a single maturity CDS.

But when I got around to playing it I was addicted, I haven't played any game since!! Buy it you won't regret it. The story mode is awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Folk Space Rock","review":"I don't know who they are but Limestone and Joy are far-out. Most groups do one thing but L&J do it all. There's ballads but they aren't serious, there is hard rock, warped blues, space music and Dylanesque. They use guitars and drums but there is also keyboard playing which sounds like the musings of a very intelligent monkey, and that is a compliment since I never liked Herbie Hancock very much although his singing is good. That's a joke, and in the spirit of what is going on here. It's cool music for a hot day in the Colorado mountains. I guess Nashville is a pretty rockin' place after all. I want to see them live. The bass playing and drumming is all good too. Someone do as Todd Rundgren suggested long ago and \\"throw money\\" at these folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music interesting but bad disc/packaging","review":"You can get a sense of the music on this disc by reading the earlier reviews, but the quality of the package leaves much to be desired. First, it's a CD-R, complete with homemade label and injet printed inserts. Secondly, many of the tracks have excessive hiss or other sonic problems. The first disc I received wouldn't play past track 7, the replacement (swiftly done by Amazon - thanks!) still had problems in some players, but I could listen to it. Well... most of it, some of the time. Possibly some of these problems might be caused by degradation of the CDR in the now 5 year old release."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is TINY","review":"This product appears to be much bigger in the picture and there is no indication of it being so small.

It not only gives actual recipes, but really explores the depths of parties and what could go wrong. There is some sarcasm in the book and it's def not the book you want to give to your grandmother. This isn't your classical cookbook, more of a humurous read that does have some recipes and party ideas mixed in.

It is SO FUNNY!...and practical. Let me tell you, there is a party on every page!! When I got home, I ordered four more to give to friends who might invite me to their house's or something. Now, I'm going to go make an eye burrito to help relax my eyeballs so I can sleep because I'm so excited! I am going to have visions of heavyset cheeseballs dancing in my head all night long!!

I didn't have time to look over the cookbook until the weekend before Christmas (after I had wrapped and mailed my gifts) and was shocked to find vulgar language, discussion on feminine hygiene, and other offensive (when not expected--especially in a cookbook!)content. Even though the intent was probably humor when the book was written, I had to make a lot of apologies and was embarassed to have purchased such an item for my mothers!

My adopted son is part Roma (or the preferred and less predjudiced term for this longstanding oppressed and impoverished group)and so I am highly sensitized to the stereotypes that follow this ethnic group (having traveled out of northern India centuries ago). Most people know little of the actual history of this group or understand that they represent a distinct group with a very difficult history. In a time when disparaging remarks against identified cultural or racial groups are poorly tolerated, I ask that the same consideration be given to the Roma people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"I received this book as a gift and I'm still thinking of taking it back. I feel bad that my friend wasted her money on it for me. If you have just arrived on Earth and have no idea what or how to entertain then this book will be helpful. There is not alot of new or helpful info. The receipes listed or ones you probably already have if you own any stadard cookbook. (i.e. Better Homes and Garden, Fannie Farmer). It is all very basic entertaing with some receipes and silly craft ideas. Would anyone really waste their time making a plant hanger made out of panty hose???

I do not understand the humor in this book. I thought this was to be an entertaining and helpful book for persons interested in learning the art of hospitality. There is very little useful information in the book and the oddly inserted humor is distracting. The author has a thing about teeth (or one tooth)- I don't understand how this relates to the topic at hand. Also the pictures are from a different era and not inviting nor do they enhance the message. I find dirty recipe cards unappealing - I don't want to make the food when I have to look at a stained recipe card. The vagina information has no place in this type of book and detracts from the hospitality message. I really don't understand the purpose of putting it into this book. The book is not useful as an entertaining guide and not funny as a comedy piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hostess With The Mostess","review":"If you like parties - big parties, small parties or blanket parties, this book is for you. It offers everything that you need to host or attend a party. And then some. Learn how to cook popular dishes, make little crafts and be the perfect host/hostess/attendee.Even if you have no friends to invite to a party or no hope of ever being invited to one, you still ought to read this book because it will help lift the dark clouds of depression. Amy Sedaris is a very talented and gifted writer with a terrific sense of humor. Although I don't know her I am hoping to one day receive an invitation to somewhere she might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining book, but may not be for everyone","review":"Some of the previous negative reviews touched on the the following issues:A. The photography is garrish. The reader is reminded of all the reasons why the 60s/70s went out of style.B. Some of the food looks fake and/or inedible.C. There are references to drugs and sex that make a reader wonder, \\"Is she for real??\\"D. There are many, many pictures of Amy throughout the book.E. The illustrations are pretty elementary.Having said all of those things, I still found the book to be entertaining and informative. Amy's quirky style works for me as well as her brother David's does. I did not buy the book on Amazon, rather I purchased it my friendly neighborhood independent book store. It took me three trips to the store to decide to purchase it after looking it over carefully. If the issues noted above are of concern to you, you might want to look at the book in person or skip this one altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too crazy for me.","review":"Amy Sedaris is a funny lady and the book has some good recipes in it but the combination of funny lady and good food recipes doesn't work for me.

The description said it was the hardcover version but neglected to mention that it was not the normal full size one with photos. The version I received was small & had no photos.

I don't get it.","review":"I bought the audio CD version of this book... and I can't wait for it to end! Ok, there are \\"some\\" funny parts in it (hence the 2 stars), but for the most part... it's just not funny!!?? trust me, I love good humor, but this is just not it. You want funny? read anything by Christopher Moore - \\"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff\\" or \\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\" (same author), or even \\"You Suck\\"! now THAT stuff is funny!! \\"Amy Sedaris\\"?? ...sorry, not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like you: Hospitality Under the Influence","review":"Enjoyed the format and the down-to-earth commentary. There were a few areas of which I found offensive. With the thought of young people (actually anyoen who believes in taking care of themselves), I would not want them reading this book which rationalizes poor behaviors, ie: showing a picture of the author choosing between alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. The author says that when she has parties, she caters to all her guests, not judging their choice of DRUGS - meaning it's ok for them to use drugs in her home. There were several other areas of concern but after I read the rationalizing of behaviors that hurt people, it wasn't for me and it wouldn't be for my friends. I'm not a fuddy duddy but see No value in OKing drug use. I sent the book back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT a good audiobook; not really a good book at all!","review":"First, I bought this as an audiobook to get me thru a cross-country drive.This is not a good choice for audio format - maybe you need the klitchy recipes and photos to make it as cutesy as it is billed to be. Still, I thought the content was not funny at all, just condescending, childish hostess advice most everyone has heard already. Marbles in your med chest? Oldest trick in the book, but as someone who really has entertained company (and actually cares about their comfort, also known as \\"hospitality\\") more helpful is to place items guests might be embarrased to ask for in your med chest - like aspirin, Tums, tampons, etc. Yeah, I get that it is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek but it never quite gets there. Overall, this book - audio or not - sucked. I made it to disc 3 and gave up. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hospitality Under the Influence","review":"I returned the book.

When I feel down, I can open to any page and feel better. I gave a copy to my mother, my son and my daughter-in-law and if I could afford to I would give a copy to everyone I love.

If you're a fan of Amy Sedaris, it's absolutely perfect and her humor.I found the 1 star reviews here pretty hilarious. If you read the reviews and descriptions, or even google Amy Sedaris you're going to know immediately the kind of humor in a book like this. Who buys a cookbook online for friends without at least looking into the style of cook the author is? I think Amy would have found the review with the woman who bought several copies hilarious, as I did. :-)This book is very funny and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Amy or that style of humor. It's politically incorrect, occasionally offensive and nothing you want the kids to see. Perfect!It is called Hospitality Under the Influence Folks. Pay Attention. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna see me get hilarious?","review":"This is so funny, I can't stop listening to it. It also really DOES have good tips as a hostess or partygoer.

I've been a long-time fan of David Sedaris's work, and was delighted to see that his sister had come out with a book - and she did not disappoint! I read through this book within a few days (quite a feat, since I'm a college student who has plenty of other things to read!), and as I just recently moved out on my own, found many of her household tips to be wonderfully helpful, and her recipes to be delicious and simple - I can't wait to try them out!If you are looking for some fabulous recipes mixed with some Sedaris humor (please be aware that this is not EVERYONE's cup of tea), \\"I Like You\\" is perfect for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bless her freaking hilarious heart.","review":"Amy Sedaris is a genius. I especially loved the photos. Buy, buy, buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book without an audience","review":"I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I got this book. From the title, it could have been a compendium of funny anecdotes about throwing house parties with lessons to be learned from each. That would have probably better satisfied the apparent intention behind I Like You, as well as have been much more accessible. But instead, I Like You is exactly the opposite: a book of party advice with tongue-in-cheek humor thrown directly and often imperceptibly into each paragraph or list. The result leaves one wondering if this is a humor book or a book about party planning. Knowing Amy Sedaris as a comedienne, and not being of a party planning slant, this book certainly felt to me a lot more like the latter than the former. To a novice party planner looking for some hip modern advice, it will probably feel the opposite. Which leaves me wondering: who is supposed to like this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Comes across as lamely stupid...kind of like a drunk telling jokes. Maybe I needed to be \\"under the influence\\" to find the humor in it. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't funny enough","review":"I loved \\"Strangers with Candy\\" and I also love anything written by David Sedaris, so I figured a book by his sister Amy would be a stitch. It had some funny moments but for the most part this book was confusing. I'm afraid to try any of the recipes because I can't tell if she is being serious or not. I think maybe the recipes are real but the photos and things are DISGUSTING. I get that she intended for the book to be weird and gross because well... that's Amy Sedaris. But I just didn't find it very funny. It was too serious to be truly funny and too weird to be truly serious, if that makes any sense.I did get a tickle out of her descriptions of what to do for children's parties. That was kind of funny. The photos of the plastic food were just odd. I spent a good amount of money on the book and I threw it into my \\"books to donate\\" box as soon as I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"Having enjoyed her brother's writing I thought I might be amused by this book.

Amy Sedaris' comments are witty, insightful, and most importantly, very funny; it's almost like she has wiretapped your inner thoughts and picked out all of your twisted neuroses to share with the public at large. A friend commented that every time she reads the book, she feels that Amy's looking over her shoulder and taking notes on all the crazy little thoughts that are going through her head. So if you are looking for the perfect gift to get for a friend who loves to laugh and enjoyed watching \\"Strangers with Candy\\", your search is over. Pick up a copy of this book, I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"If you like Amy Sedaris you will enjoy this book. Very funny to read with quirky diy projects and ideas for home entertaining. I enjoyed the book, but as far as far as the recopies go they don't look all that appetizing in the pictures.

It also had its own cheap rubber handle already attached, something that I cannot take off the item. It was also covered in big black and yellow brand stickers which I will have to peal off and then sand over the whole bat just so that it won't be sticky with adhesive residue.

It makes your face so slick the razor just glides over it with little or no pressure. I will try the rest of the line even though it is a little expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I really like this shaving cream. It's definitely worth spending a little extra money for a nice product. This was especially clear when I went on a business trip and packed a travel size can of standard shave cream. Awful stuff. In the past I have used Anthony products, which I also enjoyed. Not sure if this bottle should be priced so high, but it does provide a nice smooth shave, doesn't smell strongly, and rinses off easily. Now, if my Fusion blades would last longer than two weeks, things would be fantastic! Only reason four stars and not five is the price is a bit high. Would like to see it in the $15-18 range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only need a little bit!","review":"I recently switched to a Panasonic electric wet/dry razor and this product was recommended. I took a chance on it and I'm glad I did. It's amazing how slick this shave cream makes your skin-and you only need a little bit. I've been able to get very close results to my old Gillette Fusion razor (which I had to replace the cartridge weekly) with using the Panasonic electric razor-no ingrown hairs, no bumps and no burn. I highly recommend this shave cream. It's worth the money-it lasts a long time. You just use about the amount of a size of a quarter-maybe even a little less for great results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"I've never tried a \\"premium\\" shaving cream and got this on a lightening deal. Overall I'm not that impressed. If you want it to work effectively you need A LOT, way more than you'd use for the standard foaming cream. I also don't notice any improvement in how my skin feels, I'd say it feels about the same as when I use the foam. Basically what I'm saying is it costs more, and for me, doesn't add any benefit over a can of 99 cent barbasol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shave, great product!","review":"I wish that I knew about this product years ago!

I used it once and threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a gimmick. No better than products costing a third of the price","review":"I was given a container of this product as a gift. I am glad that I didn't pay for it because I would have felt like a sucker. As far as the performance of the product, it's okay, but I did not find it to be as good as other high-end shaving gels I've used. I have found King of Shaves Alpha Gel to be the best of these non-lathering shave products; it's available in many drug stores, Target, etc., for $5-$7. Billy Jealousy costs three times that amount and in my opinion wasn't as good. I guess they're marketing the funky name...but I don't know why someone would pay $20 for this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I bought a new electric shaver and needed a thin type of shaving cream to use when shaving. There are not many creams on the market that are thin, so I was happy when I came across the Billy Jealousy Hydoplane Shave Cream. I liked what I saw and felt as soon as I squeezed a little into my hand. I put it on my face and it was thin and wet, BUT it felt like it got dry almost immediately. The best word to describe it getting dry would be tacky (my face was a little wet like the directions suggest). I tried shaving and it felt rough. I tried washing the cream off the shaver and the cream seemed gooey.I stopped, washed up, and just put on some regular shick shaving cream. I ended up using an 1/8\\" drop to make the cream as thin as possible after lathering, and it worked great! My face was not all foamy because of the 1/8\\" size and I got a great shave with my my electric shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really good at 1 thing for sure!","review":"One thing that this shaving cream is superb at is... Are you ready for it??? Clogging up my razor over, and over, and over again! I had to beat the living crap out of my blade to get billies Jealousy out from between the blades. With regular shaving cream, I never had any problems, just a quick swish through the water and voila! Hair and shaving cream gone. NOT THIS STUFF! It is like glue between the blades. Just regular old Walgreen's shave gel is superior to this overpriced razor glue, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not contain \\"menthol\\" but contains peppermint..same thing.","review":"This product contains too many irritants to consider lime, ginger, orange and grapefruit are all volatile fragrance oils with NO benefit to skin, especially the peppermint!!! at least they list the ingredients so you can know the truth and make your own decision...because what they tell you is misleading! yes it does provide for a smooth shave, but there are cheaper and better formulations out there that OMIT the irritants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shaving Cream","review":"Bought this shaving cream four days ago.

Well, it really is good stuff -- it has made shaving much easier on my skin, and I will be using it from now on.Also, this was about as much as I was willing to pay for shaving cream - I saw some other brands available at high end stores (selling for as much as $65, and I'm not spending that much on shaving cream), and they were basically the same as some \\"all-natural\\" products I had tried from the health food store for arount $7.00.Billy Jealousy is really a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Very happy with this product. Produces a smooth and close shave without irritation and seems as if the product will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Improvement Over Drugstore Gels","review":"This \\"cream\\" does not lather well, it's too liquidy or something. I tried it a several times and was could not help getting cut. While the scent was pleasant, it is definitely not one of the better creams out there. I have a tough beard as well and this did nothing to make the shave easier. I even used their hot towel treatment, but nothing. To be frank, it is not much better than a canned shaving gel at a drugstore. Overall, it is overrated and should only be used if you want to pay a lot of money for under performing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"THis product was touted to be the best lubricant available. Sorry, not even close. I use Lush Razorantium and it is far superior. It is a better lubricant, odorless, virtually nick-proof and efficient.I have tried virtually every brand available from luxury to inexpensive and Lush tops them all. It is a lotion style cream...not foaming.My beard is tough and my skin is somewhat sensitive if that helps for informational purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great until...","review":"It's good but completely overpriced! I thought it was really good until one day I didn't have it with me and needed to shave and used my Nivea body wash instead and that worked surprisingly well. Now I use the Nivea Active 3 and it works much better than the hydroplane; it produces less friction, giving me a less irritated shave (I use a Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver). The hydroplane feels really smooth when you first put it on, but after a few passes with my electric shaver, it starts producing friction and I have to reapply another layer; I don't have that problem with the Active 3 plus it's dirt cheap compared to the hydroplane."},{"rating":"1","title":"This shave cream is mediocre, at best.","review":"I bought this product, based on the recommendation of a few reviews, when I bought my Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men's Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver on Amazon. It does no better than Gillette's gel foam and costs five times more. The bottle is made of such thick plastic that it is very difficult to squeeze even a \\"quarter size\\" blob into your hand. Stick with your grocery store favorite, Billy J. is no improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I agree with all of the other 1 and 2 star reviews here. This stuff is sticky/gooey as hell, clogs your razor, dries out if you take more than 30 seconds to shave, and simply does not work any better than Edge gel. Honestly I would not buy this product if it was $4 per bottle, let alone $14."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy and overpriced","review":"I read a review on this product, and am always looking for new shaving products to help with irritation, ingrown hairs, etc. I rotate shaving creams, soaps,etc. which seems to have some benefit for me, so I bought a tube. It wasn't as slick as Creamo, which I really like, and left me with several new ingrown hair problems. Additionally, the gooey stuff clogged both of my double edge razors, making them difficult to rinse between strokes, and adding a lot of time to my morning shave. Don't let the catchy name fool you. Don't waste your money on this stuff. There are plenty of good products out there at 1/2 the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best out there so far","review":"I have sensitive skin and I use differin which is for Acne. I have tried over 20 similar products. Nothing even comes close or worth the money as this product. You have to at least try it to see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade hydroplanes over thick goo","review":"Hydroplane is disappointing and expensive. I started DE shaving a few months ago and wish i tried it sooner. I refuse to use a lather brush and have tried a few creams/foams and gels. A good razor with a feather blade and Nivea foam treats my sensitive skin way better than cartridge razors. With this combination i rarely encounter any irritation. Hydroplane = expensive gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really do like this stuff","review":"Yeah, it seems stupid expensive, but it really does seem to work better than cheaper ones. And I get about five months of daily shaves out of one bottle, so maybe it's not so bad. It rinses easily out of the razor and the odd very slight granularity (maybe due to the Teflon?) doesn't translate to my skin surface at all. My next favorite is a lot cheaper, but isn't quite as smooth shaving and tends to clog the razor (I use a 5-blade Schick), so I'll stick with this one for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shave Product and Value","review":"I have used Jack Black for a while and wanted to check out some more economically alternatives. Also, the Supreme Cream does not come in a large tube and I did not want a jar with lid in the shower. Althought the name is a little goofy, I love the shave gel and you actually use less that I used of the other product. So far it compares with a much more expensive alternative and is much cheaper to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shaving Cream - Worth the $$","review":"This is a great product. Really keeps nicks to a minimum while providing a super close shave. Also, I don't get any of those red bumps a day or two after shaving using this product, nor any ingrown hairs. Highly, highly recommend; you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This product makes shaving sooo much more comfortable than shaving within regular shaving cream. If you have a rough beard like I do, you should absolutely try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy cow, this stuff is amazing.","review":"Read some of the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.When I started my first shave with this product I actually had to make sure there was a blade in the razor--and I'm not joking. Right from the first stroke it was THE most comfortable shave I ever had. And every shave since then has been just as comfortable. It's so outstanding that I'm confident saying I will never, ever use \\"regular\\" shaving cream again.I cannot recommend this product highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"First day I used this product, it did seem to work as it said. But whether it's just my skin type or what, I could not comfortably shave with this everyday without irritation, I used this product exactly as it said and I still had a lot of irritation."},{"rating":"2","title":"He loves this","review":"Bought as an xmas gift after he read about it in a mens magazine.

This product is superior to the average shave cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Product .... Not worth the money!!!!","review":"I bought this product when I purchased a Panasonic Electric shaver. I typically use Aveeno shaving gels; however, in a momentary lapse of judgment, I splurged on this product. The Billy Jealously shave cream is extremely slick, but this does not translate into a closer or more comfortable shave. The product costs 4 times the price of an already premium Aveeno product without any clear benefits. I personally believe the Aveeno product provides a closer and more comfortable shave. Do not waste your money on this product unless you have a personal trust fund and prefer a designer name to a premium product (Aveeno)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again","review":"I was swayed by the great reviews.

I pay almost the same price at Walmart for so-so slippers. And these Bronco slippers are made by Reebok to boot!! You can not go wrong with these slippers......They are soooo comfortable, the soles are very thick for a slipper. I walk outside with them all the time and they are barely worn down and I am very hard on my slippers!

The verses themselves are filled with conviction that forces you to think about your present salvation and relationship with God and with others.The music on this album transcends all previous boundaries placed on Gospel music: there are key changes within the same measure and the musicianship is flawless. Kim sings what is in her heart and in her spirit. That is what singing should be about - it should cause a reaction in the life of every listener.

I'm beginning to really wonder if anyone besides Ann Rule can write a true crime book well.Apparently the author has the beginnings of Alzheimer's, because she repeats and repeats the same material to the point that it is work reading this book.The author has good intentions, wanting to fill the read in on background material of the victims' lives and the murderer's life, but as a reader, one has to wonder how she knows what all of these various people have said in their lives. Did she attach a tape recorder to each of them prior to the murders?On top of her repetitiveness, by the time I got to page 199 (yes, page 199!) and the background material was finally over, I was exhausted from reading the book and had no interest in finishing it.It's certainly admirable to give some background information, which is often lacking in true crime books.

Over the past few years, I have noticed the increasing popularity in \\"Tribute\\" albums for cult classic artists. Example:Depeche Mode, The Cure, Duran Duran etc. The one profound similarity in all of these, is how really BAD they are! This new installment for regergitated trash proves the point that, perfection should not be tampered with. Not only are half of the vocalists on it sound like drunken karaoke singers, but who ever mastered the CD forgot to mix each track down on some what the same level, leaving you adjusting your volume control for each song... That's CHEAP! Oh well, I'm still holding on for a new album which I hope is in the works. Erasure is truly one of the greatest bands of all time.

Awful!","review":"I really wished there was at least one band on this album who spoke English as a first language, but there wasn't. This made for some really bad vocals. The vocalists emphasize the wrong syllables in words, sing really off key and off beat to the music, and get lyrics totally wrong. You would think anyone wishing to cover a song, especially with the added challenge of it being in a foreign language, would look at sheet music to get the notes and lyrics right. I would give it no stars if not for the presence of Equatronic. I like their other stuff, and they do a pretty decent cover of \\"Siren Song.\\" It's a shame that it's not one of my favorite Erasure songs.

Bands like Erasure and Depeche Mode (and PSB, NO, etc) have influenced a whole generation of new synthpop bands. Just cuz they're not on VH1 or MTV doesn't mean they aren't talented, just that the scene went underground. (And let me also just say that some of these bands are BETTER than Erasure (whom I love very much)).

But it's hard to find any examples of independent automotive manufacturing. Not many people seem to care about Packard, Studebaker, Hudson, Nash, and, of course, American Motors or AMC. They seem to seen as junk, not worth the steel they're made of. Patrick R. Foster in \\"American Motors : The Last Independent\\" does a wonderful job of informing the public of what effort and talent went into creating these fine cars that were a good portion of time as good, if not better, as anything the Big Three put out. You learn that AMC's demise wasn't sudden, but gradual, starting in the early 1960's. There are detailed facts about the cars that were shipped out of the Kenosha, Wisconson factory. \\"American Motors : The Last Independent\\" is all in all a good read. One of the few things it lacks is an index which I miss dearly. Even though, I would recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I never really LIKED AMC......","review":"....But I found this book to be fascinating.AMC, over the years has produced some very unusual cars, some very UGLY cars and some very successful cars.This book chronicles them all, and tells the story of the rising AMC under George Romney, its near death under Roy Abernethy, and all the ups and downs of the seventies and eighties. Even if you never felt compelled to buy an AMC car, you have to come away with a profound respect for the survival instinct of this underdog company."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best AMC History Ever","review":"This is the authoritative history of American Motors. The author is the world's authority on the company and this is his best book. The book is like the cars made by the company it covers - plain, practical, and a good value for the money. The text is large and easy to read. The photographs are large and all are black and white. There is no excess white space or stylized graphics.The book tells a complete story and doesn't pull any punches or deflect blame from the people who deserve it - the top management of the company. It needs a few appendices to consolidate the fragmentary financial and production data scattered through the book. A graphic showing models for each year would also be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Years of Automobiles","review":"This book was a gift and it exceeded my expectations.

On the road, they carried their own brandy, cloves, and tea\\" [page. 297-8]. The moment-to-moment of this trip fills ten pages, including so much emphasis re the facial grooming habits of the three men concerned, and the qualities of the various beds they slept in, that it's tempting to describe the text as voyeuristic. Follwed by just three pages re Bleak House, perhaps Dickens' most adventurous and anomalous work (two narrators). To me, a quirky choice of priorities, at best.Perhaps the intention of the author was to present \\"the human side of Dickens\\" as a supplement to the literary biographies which already exist. If so, a more appropriate title might be \\"Not By Literature Alone\\", or etc. Readers interested in Dickens' writing as opposed to his leisure might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse then boring","review":"two stars due to the tons of information, but way too much that is strangely disconnected from Dickens' vibrant writing and his nearly frantic appreciation of life. Reading this (many passages you have to skip through they are so deadly), it's as though Kaplan waded through all of Dickens' writings even though not one of the novels struck a chord and really got to him. And there's that deadly present tense, i.e. Dickens goes here instead of went, writes to Forster instead of wrote; only makes it all more artificial, distant, bloodless, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many details, not enough emotion!","review":"This book seems to have been written by a business man and not a man of literature. I felt as though I were reading Charles Dicken's family budget diary rather than a life-history. This biography is lengthy with details that are indescribably boring. I found myself longing for more of the emotional aspects of this marvelous man's life. Kaplan writes in a dry, uninspiring style. I had 'great expectations' for this book but found those expectations dashed to pieces on the rock of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out pretty good, but leaves you wishing it would just","review":"This books starts out fairly good and then picks up steam in its description of Dickens' youth. But somewhere near the middle it seems to get lost in endless facts which might be called useless. I personally don't care about every single item in Dickens business affairs.

I contacted the manufacturer Dorman after waiting a week to recieve and found that they (Dorman) do not make a transfer case motor with the correct 15 pin rectangular connector.

I've been doing this for about 3-4 weeks and I workout 5 days a week, alternating this DVD with the \\"10 days to a better body\\" workout.

The instructor doesn't take the time to show you the move before launching into it -- she just calls out the move and expects you to follow. Also, I have to agree with another reviewer who noted that proper form is not clearly demonstrated, especially for weights and cardio. I think that makes it much too easy to get hurt. It would have also been helpful to have another person with her demonstrating level one, while she did level two. It's a good workout, but wasn't fun for me because I worried about injury and it wasn't easy to follow in certain portions. I would not recommend buying this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great interval training","review":"This dvd turned out to be an excellent buy. I am 17 years old and would consider myself to be just on the brink of an intermediate exerciser and I found this dvd to be easy to follow and get through. Not once did I think that I couldn't get through the exercises. The instructor has very good cuing (but I did watch it one time through before actually doing it) and if you are a beginner she shows the moves in a lower level, level one, before she increases the intensity of the moves. Don't be swayed and think that you can't do this dvd because you are a beginner because I found it very beginner friendly. I do have to say that while you are doing the moves you can definitly feel the burn. I suggest doing this 2 or 3 times a week and doing more of a cardio based dvd in between the days."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WAY TO START OFF THE NEW YEAR!","review":"Most people have at one time or another wanted to lose a few pounds!

Modifications and accommodations are not shown or explained. Many moves involve jumping up and down or side to side. Weights are used, but the instructor does not discuss how to use them safely. The transitions between exercises are quick.If you are experienced at working out, this is a good DVD. It's good to have for those times when you cannot get to the health club.

I think more focus should be on the \\"we\\" instead of \\"me\\" and what we can accomplish together.

There were a few interesting stories, but not enough to make this book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song and Dance Man","review":"Ms. Johnson has done a wonderful job in illustrating the fanatic nature of Dylan's fans combined with the reclusive nature of their hero. As the lights have burned ever brightly on Dylan in the latter stages of his career, Bob has increasingly receded into the shadows, content to let his son Jabob bask in the spotlight for the family. This book, though, shows the connection that Dylan's fans still feel towards him, whether they have met him or just been touched by him in some small way. I especially enjoyed the story of the young man who had Dylan autograph his tattoo of Bob's likeness.Whether you are a Dylan fanatic or just a reader who enjoys touching anecdotes, this book is for you.

Although the hot towel treatment cleverly creates a burst of exothermic heat on my face, the sensation is fleeting and unfortunately not worth anything near what I paid for it. If you get your face wet enough, and you put enough of the cream in your hand, and you get the cream to your wet face, you will feel two to five seconds of heat. Not a chemical kind of burn, but genuine heat. I found that it is almost identical to splashing hot water on my face. Now, the second aspect of this product is that it feels like a clean, lightweight lotion. I've tried shaving with it and without it, with dull blades, with sharp blades.

With a few clicks and clacks thrown in for good measure. There's no variation, no theme, no escalating moments. Just mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm for a full hour. I guess it's not bad if you need some background noise for something, but even that there's better albums out there. Tim Hecker's \\"Harmony in Ultraviolet \\" is a really good example of that. It's \\"ambient noise\\", but it really flows well and just sounds great. It seems like Steve Roach could take some lessons from him, as this album is pure boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by...description","review":"This is NOT LIVE.

It is, by far, the best release of Art Garfunkel's solo career. It's one of those overlooked musical gems that never got the attention or recognition it deserved.Unfortunately, a lot of Art Garfunkel's subsequent work was, well, mediocre. But in 2002, Art released an excellent collaboration with Maia Sharp and Buddy Mondlock entitled \\"Everything Needs To Be Noticed\\" which, quite deservedly, seems to have brought him a lot of very favourable attention.Check out \\"Everything Needs To Be Noticed.\\" It's excellent. And if you like it, check out \\"Watermark\\". It's excellent as well. If you like one, you'll like the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad to see it finally on cd!","review":"Beautiful songs, Jimmy Webb's words and Art Garfunkle always unique voice what a pair these two make.

Watermark is an obscure tune on the richard harris album (excellent) \\"the yard went on forever\\". But I learned it because I thought my band the bottomfeeders could play it and MAN do they play it well, and quite differently from richard harris, and very differently from artie. And it's not in our usual style at all! We drive it hard, especially avery mr bassman. All that said, jimmy webb's compositions are well-served in artie's hands. I will be ordering the record now.. which i passed up on then.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Art has always had a very difficult time choosing quality songs for his great voice and this album is no exception. Most of these songs are BAD! Watermark has no great songs (most of Art's albums have at least 1 or 2) and a couple of ok songs (Crying in My Sleep, Saturday Suit, All My Love's Laughter) but the rest are very forgettable and VERY boring. That is the risk you take with singing all Jummy Webb tunes -- they are usually very boring in general with little melody to differentiate any of them. And I always thought the version of Wonderful World here (the only non-Jimmy Webb tune) was HORRIBLE! His rendition of She Moves Through the Fair is TERRIBLE too!! Get \\"Breakaway\\" first, and then if you like that pick up Fate for Breakfast or a Best of collection -- \\"Garfunkel\\" or \\"Simply the Best\\" (Import) are the best choices available. His new collection \\"The Singer\\" has way way way too many poor selections and drags. Better yet get a Simon & Garfunkel album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it","review":"It works great (although I had to close the chain end with some pliers a little to fit through my weights) I love pull-ups even more because of this product.Another note: some may need to hook the chain on the cloth to fit large amounts of certain weights, depending on their volume, but it still works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, cheap, it works.","review":"This is a simple no nonsense product.

But with the flows, topics and beats these guys pump out, I could see this album on the Billboard charts with no problem.Definitely some of the best underground Hip-Hop I've come across. If you love Hip-Hop, do yourself a favor and buy the Blind Craftsmen's album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Produced Latin Music","review":"I was disappointed with this CD compared to the reviews it received from Amazon and others. The music sounds tin-y and small as if from one synth keyboard. The music evokes little more than imagining what the recording studio looked like where it was produced.Melodies sound too similar from song to song and the entire effort is undermined by a lack of excitement in the rhythm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical design weaknesses","review":"Like a previous reviewer, my initial impression was that these were well made. Upon closer examination though, I found that the slides are solidly built but the design of the mounting rail is very flimsy. There are two tiny tabs that hold the entire weight of the drawer and slide to the mounting rail. My slides are the 22\\" model. The first pair I installed (replacing the slides in a pantry cabinet) immediately bent the tab and collapsed. I too am now in the midst of figuring out how to modify the mounting mechanism to be able to use the other four pair of slides I had bought for this cabinet. They might work if I turn the slides upside down and swap the left and right sides. That would put the mounting rail underneath the slide so that there is much more support area, not just the suppport of the tiny tabs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seasoned Vet","review":"This CD is maybe Waylon's best.

Not to say Jennings is or ever was a nobody, but somewhere along the way, and in the day of \\"young country\\", he was forgotten about. But now he is back. A little older, a little wiser, and more sensitive and exposed then ever. Waylon has always had this way with his deep masculine yet vulnerable voice of sounding like he could kick your rear all the way to Littlefeild Texas or he could break down in tears watching Bambi for the teenth time.

Feels like cheap polyester not like costly 600 thread count Egyptian cotton as advertised! After wash/dry they still smell like super glue. Once you open the package you cannot return the product. There goes $120 I should have stuffed into a pillow to lay on it would have been more comfortable. Touch test before you buy! I cannot stress that you should actually touch sheets before buying.

If you are an infertility patient you probably already know most of what is in it - for example it covers the testing that is done to determine causes of infertility.If you are looking for a really good explanation of how your body works, and how you can maximize your chances of getting pregnant, get Toni Weschler's \\"Taking Charge of Your Fertility\\". It's much more thorough and complete description of how you can increase your chances of getting pregnant.The section on mind/body is really stress reduction techniques, which are available in many other places.

This community was afflicted with discrimination, poverty and disease, but, in spite of everything survived intact until 1948. After the Jordanian takeover in the Israeli War of Independance, this community was driven out. The ancient synagogues were looted and destroyed, or occupied by squatters, as were the houses of the Jewish refugees.

The selection of bird songs is quite varied and will give you a broad spectrum of this beautiful gift of nature. I am VERY pleased that ALL the sounds on this CD are nature's music. There is no annoying instrumentation to bore you and render the work banal. The segment on Smoky (sic) Mountain Meadow is fantastic. The quality is so good that occasionally I will get a couple of birds (don't know type!), on my patio querying about! My one quibble is that the length is only 58 minutes.

Two hours later, I had a much better understanding as to why this family had such an impact on my own and the nation. Not only is this book informative and interesting, but give great credit to the author who writes brilliantly. His tone and tales glide you thru the chapters and I felt compelled to read on and on. My biggest disappointment is that I wasn't aware of the book sooner, and that I personnaly never heard the Carters. Read this book if you want a greater understanding of the Depression Era and the workings of the early radio and record business."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful story of a Great American Music Family","review":"A truly great book! The Carter Family left a tremendous legacy in American Music, and the author tells the complete story of it all. Wonderfully written, and very difficult to put book down once I started reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"This book covers an enormously important group in American music, and for that the authors deserve our thanks. It's a decent read and has plenty of fun and interesting information and anecdotes that people will no doubt enjoy. But as a serious (which is not to say scholarly) biography, it falls short. There are gaps in information, little real insightful analysis of what it is that makes the Carters' music so special, and some rather poor writing. Compare this to something like Nolan Porterfield's outstanding biography of Jimmie Rodgers, and the weaknesses in this book become startlingly apparent. Until a better study of the Carter Family comes along, there's no real alternative to recommend (there is Charles Wolfe's extensive liner notes to the Carter Family box set on Bear Family Records, but that's not easily accessible). If you're interested in the Carters, read this, but prepare to be underwhelmed--not by the story of the Carter Family, but by the way it's told here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the other one!","review":"This book is probably the worst of all of the Five Star Workout Books. It had (in my opinion) too much history of the Academy (not necessary for a Workout book) and it didn't cover anything I couldn't learn from the \\"Navy SEAL Workout Book\\" (also by Andrew Flach). Buy that one for the same price! It has far more information and Workout routines and exercises. The only good thing about this book was the 6-week Naval Academy P.E.P. (but I must admit it isn't that good either!). So buy the SEAL Book or just download the \\"BUD/S Warning Order\\" for free form any SEAL site and get a GREAT 15-week workout routine that is challenging!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on me!","review":"You've heard the saying: \\"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\\" Shame on me, then, because after writing a lukewarm review for Boot Camp Workout, also by Five Star, I have the same to say about this one. While the workouts presented are credible, the book is very poorly done. Explanations of the exercises are imprecise, and the accompanying photographs sometimes contradict the text. Some exercises in the workout plan are not explained; for example, the workouts often call for you to perform a \\"Dirty Dog\\", yet nowhere in the book will you find an explanation of what a dirty dog is.The workouts are VERY intense. I'm 36 and in pretty good shape. But after 1 week of following this plan, I was too sore to move. If you are not already in excellent condition, then I can't even recommend this book for its workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-READ BOOK FOR INVOLVED PARENTS!","review":"As an educator, many time parents want to know what to do while they read with their children.

The only problem I have with them, is there isn't a guide or any instructions on how many spacers to use when you adjust the bits for different size wood. I've been doing woodworking for years, so you would think it would be straightforward, but it isn't. The spacers are not the same on both bits, so it's not like you can simply add the same number of spacers to both bits, to get a proper fit. What you have to do, is use several test pieces until you get the desired fit. It's a pain, but it works.

When a vampire attacks a women walking in a long hallway and the woman stabs the vampire it has this eerie singing like nuns in the cathedral on LSD singing latin (or maybe Spanish) but it has a medieval sound to it.This has been one of my favorite horror films.

Trying to prove that environmental lobbies are biased, probably not entirely correct, is still tolerable. Linking people who care about the environment to terrorism is carrying things too far.Crichton appears to have made his transition from a great author to a rabid anti-environment activist.I finished this book two days before the tsunami hit. The coincidence didn't help. I felt much worse about the message Crichton is spreading.A very avoidable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Fear","review":"This book is truly awful. It is hundreds of pages of diatribe against environmentalists and the MYTH (according to Mr. Crichton) of global warming.

Too much murder and mayhem for a political essay, too much preaching for a novel.

I used to be such a huge fan of his, buying every new book as it was released, but recently I've grown more and more disappointed.The last 150 pages were a complete chore to read. I *dreaded* picking up the book, but felt that I needed to finish it anyway. Gone are the imaginitive and carefully planned plots and interesting technical storylines from previous books.He's got a political agenda. I won't even take sides as to whether he's right or wrong, since that's not my reason for writing this review. The problem is, the book is *just* that. There's a thin shell of a plot to support what seems like it could be condensed to a single journal article. And for that matter, *already has been*.I really wanted to like this book, but Mr. Crichton has lost his touch. I will not be picking up his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton Sinks to All-Time Low: Intelligent Readers Beware","review":"I'm appalled and ashamed that someone of Crichton's supposed intelligence would write a book like this. If the monotony of the writing and the annoying hollowness of the characters doesn't turn you off immediately, then the ridiculousness of the premise will. He himself points out how persuasive mass media can be in shaping global opinions and here, in this era where we have to fight to have valid scientific theories like evolution taught in our schools, he is seeding ridiculous scientific conspiracy ideas into the minds of his less-educated readers.This is an empty, poorly written, sell-out of a book that is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Michael Crichton?","review":"I have been a major fan of Michael Crichton's since his first publication. His current book, \\"State of Fear\\", I am chagrined to say, is not up to his usual standards. What is he trying to say here? OK, so the earth's climate is naturally evolving and changing. But the basic points and the plot line of this book are not engaging, enlightening or uplifting. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I myself would think twice about reading another Crichton book. It seems to me that he has lost his touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment that defies the PC agenda","review":"First and foremost, the book is good entertainment.It also makes you think. The bibliography at the end supports Cricton's views interspersed in the book.

Lacking developed characters, a plausible storyline, and no crisis, the story is no more than an opportunity for Crichton to espouse his opinion regarding the global warming theory.I do not begrudge him to having an opinion, merely his choice of forum. Write a thesis, a blog, an essay, submit a research paper, or properly term your research, graphs, and bibliography for what they are - an argument against the global warming theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"um, wow","review":"not that good.

But this audio version is simply not very well done. The male reader attempts to \\"female\\" versions of his voice as well as several different dialects and accents without success. It really detracts from the story itself. I found the female voices that he does to be very patronizing and inappropriate for the character. It was a prolonged agony to try to get through this particular book, but since I kept hoping it would get better - I stuck it out to the bitter end. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring sequence of science babble","review":"I'm very dissapointed with Mr.Crichton. This book reads like one of the newer patriotic flag waving books that Tom Clancy has pestered us with lately. In fact the style was so similar I continually checked the cover to make sure it wasn't a Tom Clancy book.The story is very simple and boring. The fact bashing about Global Warming being a con is repetitive and very irritating. Characters are stereotyped and plain. I can't recommend this book at all.

Although it isn't stated, I assume he's extremely attractive as well.Ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"An irresponsible piece of garbage","review":"I couldn't help but wonder, while I was reading this dribble, who paid Crichton off? To insist most emphatically that there is no such thing as global warming occurring during these times is just fooilsh. He either has some peculiar motivation for writing this book, or he has had his head buried in the sand. The tragedy is, thousands probably actually believe him. Try living through a few of the recent hurricanes if you don't believe me. And then check the data for hurricane predictions for the next seven years. That global warming is a fact is no fallacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I've been a fan of Michael Crichton for years, but this is a very disappointing read. The plot is overdone, the characters underdone, and the political statement of the book incredible (see the author's note stating that environmentalists, government and big business have EQUALLY bad track records at protecting the environment (page 573). Universities are also to blame, as these institutions are busy creating a state of fear about environmental or health dangers. Suffice it to say that this is the last Crichton book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Flubber","review":"What a waste of money and trees. Crichton has always subtly (and not so subtly) distorted scientific fact to create his science fiction (with the emphasis on \\"fiction\\") novels, but in his latest he appears to have completely forgotten what little science he learned back in pre-med. What will he do for an encore, write a novel with the basic theme that gravity does not exist, the Earth is flat, and Republicans are honest? His point of view in \\"State of Fear\\" would be easier to understand if the novel were at all entertaining, but it reads like a rushed polemic, with cardboard characters and a contrived plot. Perhaps if it seemed like he understood climatology and meteorology even a small bit it would be more believable. At least he has set a benchmark for himself; this is definitely his worst book to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"I have read everything Crichton has written and grabbed this book without knowing anything about it, and boy was that a mistake.One dimensional, boring, forgettable characters.

Crichton is great at creating characters you love to hate. The facts and figures alone are worth the price of the book. I checked it out from the library and wound up ordering two copies. One for me to keep as a reference and one for a friend.I've lost all respect for the Nobel people for rewarding Al Gore for his misinformed rants about the end of the world. This book is full of 'Al Gore' types. The conversations between Kenner and anyone who dares to bring up global warming within earshot of him are priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and dangerous","review":"A warning to anyone planning to read this book: Crichton is just WRONG on the science and the facts. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that human-caused global warming exists and is a problem. It is a threat to world security and prosperity, and no purpose is served by denying it.

Hopefully anyone reading this is reasonable enough to know that this book is FICTION. Unfortunately, not everyone who picks it up is able to make that distinction. Perhaps Mr. Crichton should check out the latest CDC reports regarding the rise of Asthma rates, or other pollution-related ills. Didn't he realize that the causes of global warming ALSO effect the atmosphere NOW? IE; polution and smog? This is purely irresponsible writing just to make a buck. Doesn't he have enough of those by now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Nevermind the \\"truth\\" about global warming. Crichton quoted a bunch of studies that say what he thinks, and the other side can quote just as many for their point of view. The problem is that he could have subtly made his point while crafting a exciting thriller, but his sledgehammer-to-the-head method of getting his agenda across sucks all the fun out of the book. No sooner would I be gripped by an action sequence then he would go into a multipage diatribe about scientists with agendas (who are bad, as opposed to fiction writers with agendas, who are apparently good) and I'd lose interest and put the book down for days. It took me almost a month to slog my way through this one, when his books are usually a weekend rush for me. It was just DULL. As bad as the movie for Timeline was, I hope and pray no one tries to make a film version of this snoozefest. Unless you can get Ted Nugent to play Kenner, and then at least you'd get the right-wingers to go see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as it ever was","review":"Crichton handles the subject matter the way you would expect and the same way he has treated science in his past books: hamfistedly. Shame on Crichton for presenting what should be a valid scientific argument the way a 12-year-old on a playground would. Pop novelists shouldn't presume to be scientists and vice versa. It feels like like he read all about global warming in an in-flight magazine article written by Rush Limbaugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Think Global Warming is Real, Don't Buy This Book.","review":"If the dust jacket had told me this book was essentially a diatribe AGAINST the existence of global warming, I would never have bought it.

Given Crichton's popularity, and people's gullibility in believing the \\"realistic\\" scenarious he uses to plot his novels, this book makes Crichton one of the most dangerous people on the planet.

Though I see reason to believe that global warming exists, this book made me think which is what I love about Crichton. There are so many unknowns in the world of environmental science and he chose a very controversial subject to discuss. Good for him! There are people I know who used to call themselves Crichton fans, but because they disagree with this book they now claim they will never read anything of his again. I want to remind anyone thinking of not reading this book based on its topic that it is a novel! It is a work of fiction and though much of the information is based of fact you have to remember, this is not a text book. Enjoy the book for what it is, a suspense thriller based on a topic found in the news.

Well-done Michael, this book was thrilling and education for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring ride on Crichton's hobbyhorse","review":"This novel is about 600 pp in length - perhaps 450 pp too long since a lot of it is taken up with Crichton's eclectic compilation of \\"data\\" purporting to show that global warming & climate change don't exist. The plot is based on the premise that global warming & climate change don't exist but their effects -- e.g., glaciers melting & calving or unseasonal floods in the desert SW -- are actually caused by eco-terrorists who stand to gain financially from a public that believes in these phenomena. When the characters appear, in between the reams of spurious data, they are barely two-dimensional and move through improbable sometimes silly adventures in trying to best the eco-terrorists. The library is your friend here - don't waste a cent on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, practical, well researched book.","review":"I have been riding a wave of boredom between vapid books and scare tactic multi-media sources.

Except me.\\". In the guise of an action adventure story mixed with malevolent politicians (what a novel idea!), Crichton selects \\"data\\" to bash global warming and mixes it in with some of the worst dialog I've read. While I thoroughly enjoyed the Jurassic books, Rising Sun and Disclosure, this was a complete disappointment. In Disclosure, he turns the table on sexual harassment and makes it credible. In this book, turning environmentalists into evil, money grubbing terrorists is just silly. It's not even good enough for a bad made for TV movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads too much like a screenplay","review":"the plot is mediocre at best. remember when mc use to write intelligent books that were also entertaining. wow. that was a long time ago. now the books seem so formulaic.this book reads like a screenplay. i mean you can almost hear the audience laughing at the cheap silly parts put in. its no novel just a screenplay for mc's next bomb of a movie.i realize that its difficult to write quality novel after novel but i think that mc should take a risk. write something good that read like a novel not a hollywood movie. honestly this book is junk. sorry, but i have read all mc's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Crichton thinking?","review":"I know, I know...

The story line is thin, the characters totally unbelievable, and the science distorted (and worse, the distortion is one-sided).

As usual, he uses obnoxious know-it-alls to expound the technical aspects and views of the central subject matter. In this case, the concept of global warming. Crichton always does massive thesis-level of research for his books, but this one may be the most yet.Some aspects of the plot are rather ridiculous: lawyers and old men literally battling (with guns & knives) evildoers to save the world (where's the US Army??).It's still a fun read. At the very least, you'll have a much better understanding about our ecology (is global warming a scientific fact or merely biased rantings?). Especially with the current Tsunami crisis, it's rather uncanny."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking fact based fiction...","review":"Interesting book but I am not suprised by what Crichton found in his three years of research. My wife worked for a nationally recognised 'scientist' before we were married and had told me that he regularly disregarded and discarded findings in his research that did not support his 'views', and that his results always seemed to find new questions that would justify new research.The one couple in our circle of friends who are both 'professional greens' (paychecks from environmental organisations) become absolutely frothy at the mouth at the mention of this book. They insist 'it's all not true'. When I asked them to specify a particular part that's untrue they seem utterly incapable of rational discourse continueing with shouts of 'all of it, all of it! Crichton's sold out! Open your mind, he's sold out!' Personally I'm glad they set me straight. For a second I thought they were the one's with the closed mind...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Michael Crichton?","review":"I read this long book over a couple days this past spring. I read through the whole book and was really disappointed by the end. My hope is that Michael Crichton turns around and renews his great novel writing of the past. \\"State of Fear\\" did have a sometimes fast-paced story, but the author's personal politics in regard to the legitimacy of global warming was overwhelming and simply too heavy-handed. For those readers who love conspiracy theory and for those who do not value the current warnings by the scientific community concerning global warming, this book will be a great addition to your library. If, however, you have been a Crichton fan in the past with his wonderful science-flavored novels like \\"Andromeda Strain\\" and \\"Jurrasic Park\\", don't purchase this book--it's the first failure that this great author has produced. I'll have to be a bit more discerning as to which future Crichton novels I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my opinion","review":"This book was fascinating, not because of the prose or displayed literary acumen (not a lot here) and not because Crichton avoided preaching (he didn't and he didn't and he didn't), but simply because he successfully debunked myths that I did not know were myths.

Only very good books do this to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and well researched","review":"From the creepy opening to the action-packed ending, this is a trademark Michael Crichton thriller.

Something I have to say about the content is that it's right up my alley since I am a geologist! I understood all of the terms he used and he fit together his story very nicely. He mixes plenty of fact in with the tale to make it all believable as well.Great book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful fortelling","review":"This book is a parable of sorts. It was published in 2004, when the current ecological disaster scenarios were in their early stages. It tells the story of fear mongering cloaked in science. In a powerful Afterward, Crichton made clear what his parable was really about. Michael Crichton was a brilliant and creative man. This lesser-know book reminds me of that, and makes me sad about his life cut short too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book to total rubbish. Apart from trying to seriously bias readers by allegedly offering a balanced arguement against the Greenhouse Effect, the story is dull, ill thought out and boring. Beware of novelists presenting fiction claiming it is fact or with a factual basis. They let you see what they want you to see. But the picture is much more than that, and Crichton conveniently leaves most of it out. I refuse to waste any more time dealing with this book, inclsuing extending this review. Throw it away if you have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy","review":"Crichton gets a bit preachy in this one. He's still a fine writter of course and there are some bright moments, but all the incorrect added maths make the story more than a bit awkward and dated. He would have been better off by sticking to the story. Instead, this novel seems to indicate the writer's urge to snigger in on an issue that he clearly fails to comprehend, at least beyond the immediate economic ramnifications benefiting the American upper classes ... particularly those with investments in fossil fuels. Taken as a whole, the book reads more like a petroleum company's manual for the indoctrination of executive management, rather than an interesting or exciting novel. This book provides little in the way of comparison to the drama of Jurassic Park or the intense experience of reading the Andromeda Strain. I must say that I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader for life","review":"This book is terrible. It is short on plot, character development and even on thrills. As one reviewer wrote of another very popular book, it is one improbable chase scene after another. The \\"science\\" overwhelms the story line to the point where it becomes a propaganda rant rather than a good novel. Whatever your views on the environmental movement or global warming it is still a ridiculous premise and poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you believe the science when the proofread is so bad?","review":"My comment about this book is possibly regarding an editorial error, however -- when someone wants to debunk science that is so unanimously interpreted as correct (i.e. - global warming is an unfolding reality) -- they should probably get all the mundane facts straight.Example: Pismo Beach, California is not north of San Francisco, California."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great change of pace.","review":"This book is a must read for all who consider enironmental science a \\"pure\\" science. Many have known for a long time that there is a dangerous mix of politics in the scientific community and it has reached critical mass in the environmental wing. Although this is just a fictional novel, it is well referenced and has a more solid footing in science than any environmental group's \\"factual\\" literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice try, but, well...","review":"In State of Fear, Michael Crichton thoroughly explodes the global warming mythology with his footnotes which, as he pointed out in the book's preface, aren't fiction.

And a power author such as Crichton, should have been able to convey that passion and make us feel something about the subject and/or the characters. Unfortunately, there are long lectures about global warming and the politicization of science amidst a story that could have been told in half the pages. The characters are cardboard, moving, but not feeling; acting but not thinking: perfect for a another special-effects movie that is sure to follow. The real plus? The bibliography!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Story That Made Me Think","review":"As always, a well written thriller.

I think that is a sign of a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start to no place","review":"While I have enjoyed many of Chriton's books (inspite of the fact that he does not know how to plausibly end a good story) this one holds little enjoyment. A ten page essay on the misunderstandings of global warning would have saved me the many hours it took to plow through this book. The story takes 250 pages to get going and constantly wanders through lectures on the ignorance of environmentalists. While the point may be valid in some ways the plot seems to be simply a guise to preach this point. There is no tension, no spark, no reason to care about any of the characters in the story or in fact in the world they are supposedly trying to save. The State of Fear is never developed. As a thriller it is empty and thrilless. As an environmental statement it is 550 pages to long. I won't give up on him for this book but it was a waste of $8.00 and 15 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a seriously bad story","review":"Forget it. All you one-star ratings hit the nail on the head. This is a terrible novel. Man, I skipped whole chapters sometimes. I didn't want any re-education on global warming issues.

The reason I stopped was the excruciatingly inept reading of George Wilson. I managed to get through the first CD but when I looked at how many more I would have to endure, I just couldn't do it. I packed it away and tried to forget about how much money I'd spent on something so awful.George Wilson reads with all the enthusiasm of a coma patient on Quaaludes. Add to that his incongruous accents, and it's simply more than one should have to face. I've listened to hundreds of books and I know I've never heard his voice before. It's so shockingly bad that his name will forever be the scarlet letter to mark audiobooks to pass by. I'm still stunned that a major publishing company would allow this to be released. It would be the equivalent of releasing the printed version with no punctuation. You might be able to slog through it, but would it really be worth the effort?"},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting","review":"When I pick up a Crichton novel I don't question that I will enjoy it. I have loved his books. However, this is the first time I have read one of his books and felt insulted. There isn't a character in the book who is sympathetic... or anyone that I care what happens to them. The main guy, Kenner, is arrogant, snobby and hateful. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it never does. The only way I can get through this is to ignore the politics and try and pretend it is just a mindless adventure novel instead of a right wing scree. Even if he is right about the science, which I admit is a possibility, the tone of this book makes me want him to be wrong... which is just silly. The whole book has a condescending attitude.. \\"boy aren't my readers stupid\\" There is no respect for his readers. We aren't stupid.

Crichton's State of Fear is the absolute antithesis of these qualities. The only possible way I can imagine that ANYONE could ever find this piece of drivel entertaining at all is if they just want to be preached at about Climate Politics. This is the worst of Crichton's novels that I've read, bar none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous","review":"I've been a Crichton fan for many years. The plots have always been out there but his characters and writing combined with the kernel of science made for a good read. A few years ago I struggled through Timeline and should have realized then that MC had jumped the shark. This latest book is full of it - cartoon characters, plot twists that confound belief and ham-fisted pedagogery regarding the scientific issues.

This was not the case with State of Fear. It was a shoddy attempt to preach an anti-environmentalist theme using very shallowly developed characters.

It had his usual fast moving thiller plot which I enjoy. However, this is offset with with a one sided debate on global warming theory. On one side are environmental proponents of the global warning theory. They are depicted as politically correct knee-jerk morons with no facts to back up their case. On the other side are the brilliant opponents of the notion of global warning. They have all the facts.This book presents in detail the case made by one opponent of the global warming theory. I expect the real proponents of this theory have an informed and detailed defense. We do not get to hear that defense in this book. I do not profess to know which side is right in this debate, but I expect that the \\"correct\\" answer to the debate question falls somewhere in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Disappointment","review":"I love Michael Crichton books and was quite eager to read this one but was terribly disappointed.

For that matter, he's not a scientist at all, he's an M.D. Crichton is credential mongering by using his medical credentials to push his absurd right wing agenda about climate change. If you want climate information, visit some university web sites to learn what real scientists have to say about climate change. For every Crichton-type book filled with misinformation, there are thousands of peer-reviewed, scientific journal articles that indicate (with data) that global warming is very real.

The agenda is real, but probably accurate. Modern day environmentalism is a scam. It is lawfirms seeking deep pockets, anti-capitalist politicians, extremists immorally doing the dirty work, empty-headed celebrities latching on to \\"causes\\" to validate their good fortune, duped and used philanthropists, scientist/professors in need of grant money, media bias and public brainwashing. The large amount of hysterical, venomous negative reviews here and elsewhere is evidence of the desperation to keep this kind of truth from becoming widely known.

This book shows that the truth is more important than good intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Did Crichton Become a Preacher?","review":"I've read almost all of Crichton's books and they are always entertaining and sometimes informative. He mixes science and technology with some great page-turning plots.However, \\"State of Fear\\" was neither entertaining or informative. It was excruciating to finish this 670-page book but I kept going because I wanted to give Crichton a chance to redeem himself.I've never seen such a blatant and horrendous cover for preachy propaganda. He claims \\"Everybody has an agenda. Except me.\\" Then, what the heck were you doing using a character (Keller) to lecture throughout the book, putting pages worth of useless graphs and a pathetic \\"Author's Message\\" section, hopelessly defending this unpersuasive NON-fiction?I'm not even going to discuss the merits of his science or this highly controversial political topic of global warming but this book just stinks.I hope next time Crichton wants to force-feed his views on others, it's not in the thriller section of the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, this book really did kinda suck","review":"Ok, I'm really a big fan of this author...but...This book was terrible.

If he was liberal writing about how more school children need to be having sex he would be applauded as a risk taking innovator who must be read. But take on the left and one of their holy grails, the global warming theory, and you become someone with bad science who is a tool of the left.Remember liberals, just becuase your biggest adovactes like Mr. Franken and Mr. Moore use lies and deciet to support their positions, doesn't mean everybody else does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Chriton comes across as preachy, patronizing and condescending in this book. He has a political viewpoint to push, and he pushes it hard, losing his audience in the process. The data he uses to support his viewpoint is mostly outdated. He is basically telling his audience that if they believe global warming to be real, they are uneducated fools and he has the data to prove it.Let's not forget that Chriton is an MD, not a climatologist. His take on global warming is no more relevant than that of any other educated person who reads journals and compilations of data: It's an opinion.

This book is Michael Crichton's Tom-Cruise-\\"I-know-all-about-Psychiatry\\", moment and he's not looking to be challenged or disputed.I won't argue the science or the validity of his commentary on the corruption within the environmental movement. I don't doubt that most of it is true. But for Crichton to include an \\"Authors Message\\" at the end of his book where he states that \\"everybody has an agenda...except me\\" it the most absurd thing I've ever read in a work of fiction.

It is merly a topic that author Michael Crichton researched and explored. The plot of this novel is exciting and fast action paced. I would not say it is the best thing that he wrote, but it deserves more recongition.When reading this book, it is better to be open minded. Do not reject ideas presented in this book just because it contradicts your previous knowledge.I find this a great novel and a worthwhile read. I am not a political right-wingist (in fact im more the opposite). It is interesting how MC challenged the widely accepted idea of global warming.

The result is a forced, boring plot, and a substandard, preachy novel.Strangely enough within this novel is an excellent political essay - Crichton's chapter on the \\"state of fear\\". Clearly it was applied inappropriately - we are not in a state of fear about global warming or we would not be driving round our \\"axles of evil\\" SUVs, and using up resources like there was no tomorrow. But if you look around you can see places where this essay fits like a glove. This alone is worth one star.Though his science is totally unbalanced, Crichton deserves a little merit for bringing the contrarian evidence on global warming to our attention. I wonder if his next novel will be about Intelligent Design?"},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Confusion","review":"What I loved about the old Crichton was that he would subtly pad his novels with science, technology, and interesting theories all the while focusing on a thrilling narrative. I can see that he feels strongly about the subject matter of this book and he made a lot of excellent points. But in an attempt to get his ideas widespread attention, he threw them into a poorly written (although fast-paced), half-hearted thriller. The awful story and pathetic characters just serve to cheapen his overall message.

Throughout the book, Crichton hammers the reader over and over again with artificial dialogue from experts that seem to serve as voicepieces for Crichton's own opinions. I have always gotten the impression that Crichton was a strongly opinionated man and it comes through in his books. If you have read Rising Sun or Disclosure, he makes his opinion on the Japanese and woman pretty clear. But this book is just way over the top. The book would make a good collegiate argumentative essay on global warming but as a novel, especially from a writer of such high caliber, it stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great romp and a courageous point-of-view!","review":"Loved this book!

While Crichton deplores the level of certainty in the world today, he often seems to be far too certain himself.

He makes a distinction between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" science.

What is clear is that 10000 years ago, or even 1 million years ago, there were not 5 billion people on the planet, especially those who drive a big ass car/truck 2 miles to get a doughnut..there also appears to be a few more hurricanes than normal..

I cannot recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment!","review":"I would have paid twice what the price was to read a book by the author of Jurrasic Park and Timeline, but I'm glad I didn't. The characters were shallow, all of them, and the sub-plots underdeveloped and mixed in without much forethought. I felt like I was being preached to the entire time- the graphs were totally unnecessary and excessive. Mr. Crichton should have just written a non-fiction book about his views on global warming and spared his reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!!","review":"Sorry Heather, but Michael Crichton crossed a line here that he shouldn't have. This book is worthless from every angle. Bad story. Bad attempt at public manipulation. It stands out from his others which I enjoyed immensely. But this one was different. With this one he didn't intend to entertain or educate the public. I believe his intentions here were sinister, and it turned me totally off this author. I will never pick up another Michael Crichton book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree/save time- don't bother buying/reading this book","review":"As I read this book I wondered, has Martin Sheen insulted Michael Crichton? Was it some sort of narcissistic injury?An obnoxious character in this novel is obviously patterned after Martin Sheen and this character does meet a (deliciously)dreadful(though absurd)end. And the Hollywood crowd celebs are presented as shallow hypocritical fools. Gee, who knew?But really, this book just isn't that interesting. The plot and characters are tedious, unconvincing and uneven.This felt like a first draft of a book that should have been polished, rewritten and revised and revised and revised and rewritten and polished before unleashing it on the public.No more Crichton for me. Waste of time; waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Crichton uses this book to convey the reader his ideas on environmental policies and argues that the public is in a \\"state of fear\\" that makes them believe whatever the policymakers want them to believe. He tries to make it look like the book is on a general \\"state of fear\\" - not just linked to environmental policies but political and social policies in general. However, it is very clear that he simply wants to express his disbelieve of global warming and other environmental issues. He conveniently uses scientific data that supports his views and neglects to mention publications which would counter them.Don't waste your money and your time. This book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - a poor novel as well as a lost opportunity.","review":"State of Fear was very disappointing. Crichton had some important points to make regarding global warming, and he tries to illustrate them by means of a wild tale of adventure and intrigue, but the novel is so poorly written that it's unlikely that many people will think seriously about the issues that he raises. The character development has the depth of a Superman Comic Book, and the plot line is just about as believable.Having some professional experience in related fields, I happen to share his opinion that the public policy discussions regarding global warming have so far failed to adequately reflect our current state of scientific knowledge. Because of this, I'm particularly saddened that he lost the opportunity to contribute to the debate by producing such a shockingly poor novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science and Bad Writing","review":"Are we still having this worn-out debate after all these years? My God, even when strong-armed by the Bush administration, his own science advisors had to tell him the truth that global warming is a fact.

The \\"dumb\\" environmentalists are laughable as succumbing to \\"fear.\\" I listened to the audiobook version, and the narrator made both scientists and their benefactors sound like buffoons.

State of Fear is a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass on this one","review":"A disjointed anti-environmental rant. With the riviting plot line of a porno movie, Chichton strings together a series of unrelated events to keep you reading what essentially is his thesis disproving global warming complete with graphs and footnotes to source material.

Something a little longer than half a line would be good.As for me: I love Crichton. I was a bit dissapointed with this one. No adventure man! Where are the jungles, crazy apes, uncooperative airplanes? And I did find the eco garble a bit much. So, one start from me. Even so, he remains one of my favourites.

It damn sure aint gonna get told here. I just get furious when folks write propaganda for a bunch of lard butts who wouldn't have enough money even if they had every copper penny in the world.

Stay in the creek, mate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Didactic","review":"I have never read a book by Michael Crichton. I have heard that his books tend to be hit or miss. Well, this was a tremendous miss. In the authors comments he admits that the book's subject was a pet cause for him. He goes off on numerous unnecessary tangents in nearly every chapter. There is very little action, and you never identify with the characters. Kenner is the only character with any redeeming qualities, and he is an arrogant jackass.State of Fear is a waste of your time. 99% of the book is build up, and it never pays off. The villains are not vanquished, nor are they even punished. There is no resolution to this story, and after all the lecturing Crichton does, readers deserve better. Pick up The Talisman by Stephen King. It is a much more satisfying read, with many of the same moral undertones.I am not sure I will read another book by Crichton. Perhaps I will pick up Jurassic Park, just to see if that book lives up to his reputation as a best selling author."},{"rating":"1","title":"New study destroys Crichton theory","review":"Crichton bases his global warming is a hoax theory on Antarctica cooling and glacier growth. The new Jan 2009 NOAA study in Journal 'Nature' shows that Antactica is warming like the rest of the earth. And the big Wilkins Ice Shelf is about to head seaward.State of Fear is really a non-fiction report which attempts to prove that global warming theories are nonsense. Sprinkled over the charts, graphs, and footnotes is a bit of fiction in which evil environmental activists are portrayed as going to any length to create fear of global warming. In the book, Crichton has scheming environmentalists lure families to riverside parks, douse the rivers upstream with artifically enhanced storms, and then film the hapless children as they are swept away. The evil environmentalists then provide the films to the media to scare the public about the horrors of the impending warmup.Overall this is silly scientific nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever from Crichton","review":"This is undoubtedly the worst book by Michael Crichton so far. So, it is unfortunate that it is also his fattest book so far?I must confess Crichton lost my sympathy completely, when I noticed that he was trying to preach that most environmentalists fake their data to support their argument. Other than the incumbent US president, I doubt whether this point of view has any buyers.May be the data with which environmentalists are soothsaying doomsday are not conclusive. But then, Crichton and his protogonists have equally inconclusive data to prove other wise.Do not waste your time reading this book, unless you are a SUV user who needs some therapy to overcome the guilt of burning so much gas every time you get your donut."},{"rating":"1","title":"My advice ? don't bother buying this book...","review":"...unless you enjoy being preached at while reading a novel. For my part, if I wanted preaching I would have bought one of those Christian novels - at least you know what you're getting when you buy one of those. Wether or not you agree with the message being so clumsily and painfully driven into you, it's the way that i'ts done that I find insulting. The overall message may be thought provoking, but the story stalls so many times just so Mr. Crichton can make his point that it makes for a very boring and annoying book. I reallly enjoyed his previous novels but I'm extremely disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keyword: Controversial!","review":"Balk all you want, say it ain't so, completely deny everything you can't get your brain around but you'll have to admit, this book makes you re-think everything you thought you knew about environmental issues. Is it a beautifully written classic? No. Are the characters unforgettable icons of modern literature? Absolutely not. Though sometimes predictable, it's a page-turning-techno-thriller backed by 'the other side' of facts that, agree or not, cannot be denied. It WILL make you think. If you are environmentally conscious, it might change your mind about the issues you hold dear. One thing is certain, even if you don't ascribe to a single thing presented in the book, you'll be looking up those things you thought you knew were facts just to make sure they still are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"OK-so maybe I'm the only one who didn't like the book. I felt the characters were one-dimensional, not to mention basically unbelievable. The woman (Jennifer and Sarah) are lovely and athletic. Both are ready to tackle any object placed in their path. The attorney, Peter Evans, is occasionally too simple minded to be believed. He does manage to evolve from a total crybaby to a partial crybaby. Kenner is perfectThroughout the book, I had the feeling I was being talked down to. The language was simplistic. The book appeared to be a place for Chrichton to vent his personal frustration about the current state of the environment.I adored most of Crichton's books. I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone over the age of 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Fear","review":"Both sides of Global Warming convincingly stated.

However the overlong book becomes silly and preachy with a less than subtle anti-global warming agenda, with cardboard characters and predictable outcomes. The last 300 pages are painfully boring as the lead characters avert near death over and over again in ridiculous, unbelievable situations (no one would be that stupid to keep coming back for more!). I ended up feeling cheated of the time I spent reading when I was done. I used to be a Chricton fan, but this may have been my last book of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"state of fear review","review":"not his best, a little slow at the beggining but a good payoff.

As always there is lots of interesting scientific ideas and theories thrown about. a good book, not his best, but still an exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Fear - a exciting novel - an important message","review":"This is one of Michael Crichton's best books to date.It is not only a fascinating perspective on global warming, but it is more importantly a message \\"beware the manipulation of science\\".State of Fear should be read as a vital wake-up call to the overwhelming crisis facing society today: namely, that truth in science, medicine, climatology (pick any area of research) is for sale. This is the real State of Fear.Crichton's books are alway timely. I was saddened to see it quickly come off the Best Seller lists. If the public wasn't given a chance to evaluate what it was saying, was its value also being manipulated?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment!","review":"I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for years and bought his latest book as soon as it hit the bookstore. Big mistake! Next time I will wait to read the reviews before purchasing one of his books.In \\"State of Fear\\" Crichton was so preoccupied with espousing his point of view regarding global warming that he neglected to construct a story around his theme. His characters were flat and boring, their dialogue redundant, the action sequences were devoid of any real suspense, and the promised \\"roller coaster thrill ride\\" stalled shortly after takeoff.Perhaps my expectations were too high having recently read all four of Dan Brown's suspenseful novels, but the writer who gave us Jurassic Park should have been able to craft a more interesting and suspenseful tale.This is a book that will surely wind up in the used books stores soon so hold off before you pay full price for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable!","review":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Crichton's incessant sermon on the evils of the environmental movement and global warming, in particular, is interrupted only briefly by an unbelievable group of individuals experiencing a preposterous series of events. Recommended for those who believe that that the earth would be better off if it were covered with asphalt. Read between the lines of the Publishers Weekly review that described the book as \\"smart and robust, albeit preachy,\\" or the Booklist review that \\"thrills in Crichton's latest are interspersed with fascinating but occasionally dense ecological facts and data.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I can think of nothing good to say, so I will keep this short. I've often, but not always, enjoyed the novels of Michael Crichton. State of Fear turns out to be one of those novels I disliked. I'm no tree-hugger, but even I can see Crichton is trying to push an agenda here. He's no better than the tree-huggers in his selective cherry-picking of facts. Skip this book. If you're a Crichton lover, wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast to read and fun to ponder","review":"This book is a fast read, like all his other books. He does a good job of presenting a contrarian view which is well documented and he encourages the readers to do their own research before they form strong opinions on global warming.I am glad that a writer of his stature went to the trouble to take the contrarian view and challenge the mass media's blanket acceptance of a climatic process which very few of them really have a sound understanding of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazingly fast read! Exhilarating book!","review":"I was astounded at how fast I read through this book. This is one heck of a fast paced action packed thriller! Something I notice about Crichton is he seems able to appeal to a broad audience with his books. Many of the subject matters he writes about many people would find uninteresting, but Crichton has a way of making things interesting that, at face glance, might not seem so at first. I am not usually into novels of this type, but Crichton seems able to make ones of quality good enough to keep me coming back for more. This easily gets five stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talky and disappointing","review":"This could have been a good 150-page thriller. Most of Crichton's novels have a nice dose of intellectual stimulation, but this is basically a political broadside with occasional lapses into exciting action. Characters become points of view, dialogue degenerates into speeches... Make it 2 parts action to 1 part discourse and I could hang in there, but by the 17th extended lecture making EXACTLY the same point in virtually the same language and phrasing (with line graphs!), I had to close the book. From the writer who gave us Rising Sun and Jurassic Park, this is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to let down Chricton drowned in statistics and preaching","review":"This novel is a typical \\"hard to let down\\" Chricton novel. There's a lot of action and intrigue, but I found most of the intrigue quite predictable.About the global warming conspiracy preaching in this novel it really makes you wonder. Drowning the reader in statistics do not hide the fact that Chricton resorts to the same techniques he accuses his characters by carefully selecting information that adheres to his points and forgetting what's damageable to his views."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but felt that Crichton went a little overboard with explanations, inserting conversations that had little or no relevence to the story into the plot. I felt like I was reading a good fiction novel that had the occational essay squeesed in. The essay-like sections were interesting, and made valid points (with references and footnotes), but the novel could lose about half of them without having the story lose anything. Overall this was a good novel with an interesting plot. It presents some interesting points about public interpretation of science(i'm still trying to decide where I stand on his points), and states a few facts that made me do a double take and some research.<u>State of Fear</u> is worth the read. This book makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long on Technical, Short on Character","review":"To be a fan of Michael Crichton, you have to turn a blind eye to character development and appreciate his thouroughly researched technical points that he makes in his books. In \\"State of Fear\\" his points on the false prophecy of \\"global warming\\" ring true but his character development does not. Evans and Sarah are superheroes who survive a fall in an ice crevass, staying alive in sub-zero temperatures, live through individual lightening strikes, he through a bite from a poisonous octopus and last but not least, a tsunami. All from October 6th through October 23rd, no less. But still I like Critchton because I always know what I am getting---long on technical but short on character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic plot","review":"The novel's plot is close to absurd. An MIT professor gathers an environmentalist's secretary and the environmentalist's lawyer to form a world savior brigade. The MIT professor actually works for the US government but instead of getting some swat team or delta force team to help him he uses these two ridiculous sidekicks (sidekicks in terms since the lawyer is the main character in the book). Each of these two sidekicks, who are really average citizens, face death more than once in a matter of a few hours (one of them actually dies and then resurrects) and continue to act as if they had just gone to have their hair done or something. Pathetic. They even avoid been eaten by cannibals (yes, it's true)."},{"rating":"1","title":"unexpectedly boring","review":"Having read Crichton's other books e.g. \\"Prey\\", I started this book with great anticipation.But only the first few chapters were capturing, then it starts to get quiet boring. The plot is sort of unclear and less than convincing,for almost 600 pages. It just goes on and on and on mixed with too much information on climate change covering up for a poor story, until it comes to an aprupt and unconvincing end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed all of Crichton's books in the past, but this was a real departure. I found this alleged \\"novel\\" to be little more than a moralistic lecture on Crichton's views of the evils of global warming advocates. The plot was absurd. Only if you enjoy moralizing in your novels AND you believe warnings of global warming are overblown, might you enjoy this. I was amazed at how many words the author wasted lecturing us, as well as the one-dimensional characters (all advocates of global warming are depicted as evildoers, fools, or both). On top of this, the audio version was terrible. The reading was melodramatic and the reader used a soft \\"feminine?\\" voice for the female characters, even when they were angry, excited, etc. Poor marks all around, unless you are looking for a diatribe against global warming (in which case, buy the book, not the audio)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"This book was a suprise to me. Most of the time i like micheal crichton novels. This one bored me with too much time spent talking to lawers and environmentalists. There was not enough action and suspense.

Read sphere or prey instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacrifices for a misleading Message","review":"This is a remarkably poorly written best seller. In his zeal for selling the reader on his message (that there is no good evidence for global warming), Crichton sacrifices his story telling skills. The main characters in this book are cartoons with only one purpose - to either express Crichton's views on global warming with complete confidence - or to listen to those views with growing awareness. And, they are such trashy cartoon characters! Is there suspense? Only if you think that the main cartoon characters are in danger of being killed by mere lightning bolts or bullets. Beyond the remarkably badly told story, the science itself is unfortunately misleading. But that would take more than a few lines to address in any detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"It was one of those typical Chricton books you can't put down... but it turned out to be so darn preachy. He had me, he really had me with the whole environmental conspiracy theory. He had me in that you have to question common beliefs and the main stream media. But the book tried so hard to preach these ideas that it got annoying and he LOST ME. And Michael Chricton really has a mean streak. I loved Timeline but I thought the ending with the black plague was a bit harsh... this one was even worse! Cannibals no less consuming a very unlikeable character! It was a bit too much even for me, one who likes conspiracies and high body counts in books! I hope I never get on Chrictons bad side."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth reading.

A dull read with a boring and unsatisfying plot interspersed with random graphs and \\"facts\\" about global climate change.If Crichton had any balls the \\"state of fear\\" would have been referring to the way the US mass media manipulates the populace into supporting war.

The characters are shallow, no emotion at all, they are in the book just to provide some resemblance of \\"novel\\". This is a book that could have been ordered by the GOP and the big polluting industries, oil, gas, etc. Don't waste your money in the book, it will just try to brainwash you to be in favor of pollution, destruction of the environment, and to convince you that environmentalists are crazy, or corrupt, or stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this book","review":"I could not get past the first 40 pages.

So with that said, I'm a fan of Michael Crichton and found that this book lived up to the standard for thoroughly researched and believable content. His ability to boil complex subjects down to an interesting storyline is one of things that keeps brining me back to his books. I will admit that the overall plot of this novel was rather predictable - I was never \\"surprised\\" by what was going to happen.

For credible insights into the impact of global warming on our world watch Al Gore's film and/or read the Stern report.However the author's overriding theory of governments creating a state of fear to enslave the population - is without doubt, as the war on terror enters its 6th year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton's worst work ever","review":"I've enjoyed most of Crichton's work, but State of Fear is an annoying waste of time for anyone with more than two brain cells to rub together. This is the book that Exxon/Mobil (and their loyal employee in the Oval Office) has been praying someone would write. Crichton was so wrapped up in creating propaganda to advance his pet belief--that the environmental movement is an evil conspiracy--that the book lost most of its entertainment value. No one likes to be lectured by an idealogue, but Crichton mixes his arrogance and willful ignorance on the subject of global climate change into an irritating, ultra-conservative, anti-green polemic. If you want see what happens when a writer decides that his popular success entitles him to share his embarassingly-paranoid delusions with his readers, State of Fear is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not typical Crichton","review":"I thought I was studying for a test.

I hope his next book is an improvement over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If you're looking for a typical creative, exciting Micheal Crichton novel, this is not it. He seems to use this non-fiction as a vehicle to tell us that the green house effect is a bunch of hogwash. The story is very predicable and the characters spend way too much time arguing about whether the ozone depletion is real or not. I'm not an environmentalist, I just think that he over does it to make his point.

It is not balanced at all, but puts together an over the top riduculous plot with one sided science \\"footnotes\\" to convince the ignorant and greedy that it is just fine to use up the earth to make a quick buck. For every piece of \\"science\\" that he has in this book, there is many times more evidence to the contrary. Good, hard, Science Fiction is supposed to be based on solid science, not fantasy. Michael Crichton usually writes good hard science fiction. This one is not in that category but is paraded to be, which is why he felt that he had to add all of the \\"footnotes\\" to get anyone to believe it. It is clear that this is a situation of \\"The Ringworld being unstable.\\" He should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book in Ten Years","review":"I gave this book five stars because it is the only novel I've been able to finish since I read \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" in 1993.

However, if you're passionate about Global Warming, then you might come away feeling disappointed, disillusioned, angered, or betrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too preachy","review":"This is my first Michael Crichton novel, and likely my last. I have an interest in climate change so I found it interesting for the most part, but if you didn't have this interest I think you wouldn't like the book. Lots of stats and quite preachy.

Michael Crichton is the greatest science fiction author of our time. This is another page turning techno thriller.I've read some reviewer complaints about the sci-fi premise of the book; man made changes in climate are not well understood. Crichton plays his sci-fi premise against the Global Warming paranoia paradigm. Crichton pulls it off perfectly; it's a fast paced science fiction story with wonderful verisimilitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring, no dramatic finale","review":"This book started out interestingly enough, so I thought I was in for a good ride. The characters are pretty well formed, and I actually like learning about all this global warming stuff. However, after a couple chapters the book started to bog down for me. It's waaaay too long, and the ending was ultimately a let down. All that build up should have come to a more exciting end. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book...a Must Read!","review":"This book should be required reading in every high school in America...at least as an alternative to watching al gore's global warming scam film (although the language is harsh at times in the book for H.S. reading). I found the book enjoyable and enlightening. They'll never make a movie out of it because they probably couldn't find any actors in hollywood willing to portray anti-global warming characters...they'll do murderers and rapists, but to possibly portray someone who exposes the global warming sham? THAT would be against their environmentalist religion. I wonder if Leonardo DiCaprio would be available for the lead role? He might could finally learn something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted, Inane and a waste of time","review":"I've read and enjoyed most of Crichton's work, but \\"State of Fear\\" is an exception. I don't expect everything in a thriller to make sense for narrative purposes, but the author seems to have written this one on autopilot. Chapters run no more than 5 pages each and there is little coherency from one part of the book to the next. I won't give away the plot, but it pales next to Jurassic Park, Congo, Airframe, Prey and even Sphere. I would not be surprised if MC wrote this one in a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thought Provoking!","review":"Wow! This one really makes you think! Everyday we hear about global warming and climate change -- especially now with all the hurricanes -- well, this book might well make you question your beliefs. I think the main message I got from this book is not to simply accept what you see, hear or read -- for me, that means not only examining my long held beliefs that humans are harming the environment and that that harm is resulting in environmental changes, but also examining the theories this book puts forward. You may not agree with the author's interpretation of the facts and the conclusions he puts forth -- but it is a fun and very thought provoking read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Fiction","review":"There is no question Michael Chricton can write, but much like his earlier diatribe against Japan, this book contains Chrichton's biases and opinions which are in many cases are preachy and way off base. And I'd like to see Chrichton defend his theories that the earth is not warming in BC, Canada, where there hasn't been a significantly cold winter for years and pine beetles are decimating the forests because of it. But as a work of fiction, it is okay--a little more work developing the personalities and relationships would have been more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enviro-Nazis Would Burn This Book","review":"Just as the Social-Democrats (aka Nazis) burned the piles of books during Krystalnacht, so too would environmental extremists demand that this book be burned and those who read it crucified. With unarguable attention to facts, MC paints a totally different picture from the one that has the whole world hand-wringing over global warming. America has taken much international abuse for refusal to sign the Kyoto Accords. Checking the facts, America has shown strength and patience where, it seems, the rest of the world has entered the State of Fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really wanted to love this book","review":"Ever since my fiance made me read Al Gore's \\"Earth in the Balance\\", I've been sceptical of the science behind global warming. \\"State of Fear\\" does a remarkable job in illuminating the political agendas of those who manipulate scientific data for their own purposes.What the novel does NOT do, however, is entertain. The characters are one dimensional and dull, the dialogue tedious and the story line so linear and predictable that it's as if Mr. Crichton concocted it solely for the purpose of making the larger point about Global Warming.Mr. Crichton is a real novelist and I view this as a lapse of good judgment on his part in the service of a larger cause. It reminds one of what politically motivated Soviet era and Nazi era \\"art\\" must have been like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and not believable","review":"I bought this book when it was first published and only now got around to reading it. I thought it would be good airplane reading. Although aspects of the plot were interesting it did not make any sense that the fate of the world would be left at the hands of a mysterious scientist/soldier/spy accompanied by an attorney or two and someone else's executive assistant. And about those cannibals...really? really?"},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Accuracy","review":"Michael Crichton knows how to use brilliant science that is easy to understand. This book gives more than just interesting characters, suspense, and tough situations; it gives you the facts about environmental science.

That's what reading this book was like.Over and over Crichton tells us that Global Warming isn't really happening. He presents information (including footnotes and charts) that support that hypothesis again and again and again. And again, in case the reader missed it the first fifteen times it was presented.This book reads like a doctoral student's last-chance thesis, except that there are a few totally uninteresting characters put in to present information in the form of fictional dialogue in case the reader gets bored looking at charts and reading footnotes.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"environmentalist damage control","review":"Characters fly around the world trying to prevent catastrophes planned by an environmentalist who wants more money. I love the scene where a tree-hugging actor comes face to face with the 'noble savages' he admires. Lots of lawyers, some nice, some nasty. Lectures scattered throughout: reminds me of \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" The appendix has loads of pro/con references so you check out the 'not politically correct' arguments for yourself. Crichton's underlying complaint here is similar to that of Pinker in \\"The Blank Slate\\" i.e., mainstream science has abandoned the scientific method. He's basically saying he's tired of all the nonsense. It's fun to read his characters saying the same thing as they save the world from the 'do-gooders.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed fan","review":"For years, I have been an avid reader of Michael Crichton's books. I always enjoyed the way that he interweaves various scientific and technological facts into a thrilling fictional work. However, this book has been a great disappointment. All of the subtlety of previous works is gone. He seems to take a very clearly biased, one-sided stance against Global Warming - a controversial issue with valid scientific arguments on both sides - presenting us with shallow, cardboard characters that are either fools or scoundrels. For the first time, I found myself actually bored. I hope that, in future novels, he will return to his old approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Counterpoint via Novel","review":"State of Fear is an important book. It is not the best book Michael Crighton has ever written. It is a bit preachy, especially when he is de-bunking the data upon which the theory of global warming is based. Its preachiness, though, is where the true value of the book is found. The theory of global warming is just that - a theory. Yet our society and societies has accepted it as truth. This book is important because it will challenge readers to do their own research and make their own conclusions regarding this theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science, Bad Fiction","review":"Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denial....","review":"All I can say after reading this book is - complete denial.So... the author thinks that pumping 6 billon tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year, does absolutly nothing!The author is right, in effect, we should just go on buring fossil fuels (a finite resource that we use to make tons of useful items) and pretend everything happening around us is an illusion.The author should stick to writing fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous action, interrupted by right-wing lectures","review":"Oh, dear -- whatever happened to the wonderful storyteller, Michael Crichton? This book has the main characters flying over the world, having near-death experiences every day or so, all the while being lectured by know-it-all scientists about the lack of evidence for global warming. If you're looking for an action thriller, look elsewhere. If you're looking for interesting characters, look elsewhere. But, if you want your worst suspicions about \\"tree huggers\\" and eco-terrorists confirmed, read on. And on. And on."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute FICTION","review":"When a writer of science or social fictionstarts ignoring NASA scientists, accredited climatologists,and even the bush administrations' own scientists, it is time forme to realise what a wonderful writer of FICTION dr.mike is.I just wonder who he wrote this for? Bored oil company executives?The lunatic fringe of the right wing? Too bad he didn't put in footnotes that do not actually go anywhere, much like all of annecoulters fiction does. It is pathetic to see an author whose work was once respected start using his fiction as right-wing political screed.Oh well, you know what they say \\"money talks, bull......\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting","review":"I won't bother with the premise of the book as its already been done.I don't really like or hate Crichton. However, this book is extremely boring and long winded. Also, although the author does attempt to explain the scientific stuff, it bored me.This is supposed to be a thriller, but it really missed its mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both fiction AND misinformed propaganda","review":"I have to assume the author of State of Fear didn't have the courage to present his propaganda as \\"non-fiction\\", but then he clearly must know that it IS fiction, and not believable. If you really want to know the truth about global warming, read Joseph Romm's new book, \\"Hell and High Water\\".Romm has his facts straight, but Crichton is right about one thing, the truth is scary and it SHOULD make us all fearful...fearful about what we've done and are doing to future generations, around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disappointment","review":"For the first 450 pages you are not involved in a novel, but the author's views, not well disguised, on global warming. Graphs, statistics, and scientific presentation do no mix well in a novel format. Great disappointment. Not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diversionary slants","review":"600 plus pages of tap-dancing around an issue without hitting the mark, this novel is packed with diversionary action and totally nondescript character profiling.The last 15 pages of author's message and appendix delivered the tomes slanted half-truths.If you truly have time to kill, read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual Crichton novel","review":"I usually can't put a book by Crichton down once I start. This was not the case with this book. It was too long, and became boring at times. It could have used a lot more editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Anti Global-Warming Diatribe","review":"There was plenty of material here to make a decent thriller worthy of reading. Would even have been fine to make environmental terrorists the bad guys.Crichton, however, spent endless pages blasting the reader with his personal anti global-warming message. On and on and on it goes. I saw Mitchner and Heinlein go bad. I hope Crichton comes around and returns to simply writing good thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please!!","review":"I picked this book up at O'Hare, figuring it would be an entertaining read for a long flight. Wrong. Crichton has apparently bought into the Bush/Cheney mantra that anyone who disagrees with \\"prevailing thought\\" (as the right wing nutcases present it) is by definition a Terrorist! He paints the entire environmental movement (barely disguising real life, important organizations with his invented names)as frothing-at-the-mouth lunatics bent on destroying the world in order to save it. No, Michael, that would be YOUR buddies in the \\"global warming is bunk\\" bed. And it's not even well written!! Geeeez, can't he get anything right? The characters are totally unbelievable, one-dimensional with absolutely no nuance. Every woman is gorgeous, sexy, athletic and either GOOD (blonde) or EVIL (Asian and exotic). Give me a break! I left it on the plane, lamenting the $8 (EIGHT BUCKS?? Was I nuts??) spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Crichton - pseudo science + bad writing","review":"State of Fear suffers from the same malaise that infects Crichton's other novels - one-dimensional characters that pull out a soapbox and bleat their pseudo-scientific opinions for 50 pages. Whenever I hit this point in his stories, I practice some advanced book-flinging.With State of Fear, Crichton warms the cockles of the anti-global warming crowd's heart. If you're in need of some bogus \\"science\\" denying the connection between fossil fuels and climate change in order to drive your Hummer guilt-free, this POS is for you.It's depressing (but typical) that Bush lapped up this crapola and considered Crichton such an expert that he invited him to the White House to discuss global warming. This is who's determining our country's energy and environmental policy, people: oil company executives and \\"scientists\\" like Michael Crichton."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of rubbish","review":"The combo didn't work. Either write nice fiction, or write nice non-fiction. But using a fictitious story to air your views on a topical issue. Well, MC certainly didn't get this mixture right. And Mike Smith is right: this was the wrong forum for MC to have this debate. My vote: don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Crichton","review":"If the writing was interested in alienating people, he certainly succeeded with me. How dare he try an pass off this garbage as a novel in the first place. And then use his novel: bought with my money and taking my time to read, to issue a monologue on how he doesn't see eye-to-eye with the global warming campaign. I resent him using his previously good name to see this kind of rubbish. I certainly will never read another book from him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgraceful","review":"It was bad enough when Crichton penned the misguided, xenophobic Rising Sun, but the dangers of global warming are so accute, the author has truly disgraced himself this time. Just this month New Scientist magazine published an article on the disappearance of the Carteret Islands, which are literally being swallowed by the rising sea. And this quack has the audacity to question the near-unanimity of the scientific community with his half-baked reactionary polemic. Why exactly does he think the 10 hottest years on record have been in the last 14 years?The very idea that global warming is some kind of mass movement is utterly preposterous. If Crichton spent any length of time around climatologists not in the employ of the oil industry, he would learn the difference between belief based on a mountain of evidence and paranoia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I am a long time fan of Michael Crichton, but I have to say that State of fear is his worst work. In my opinion it is a collection of papers, researches etc taken from the internet, built into a unexiting plot but the worst thing is that many of these \\"researches\\" Crichton is using are totally wrong, I share Crichtons views on the subject in the book, but I think he should have researched this book better and come up with a more exiting story around these issues.And the part in the book that takes place in Iceland, Oh my god, what a load of crock, FYI Crichton, Per is not a icelandic name, has never been and is even not allowed in the icelandic name register, and talking about the countries renewable energy, check out Iceland, no oil and no coals are used for heating houses f.x. all our energy comes from thermal boreholes and our electricity from waterplants, and we are even using hydrogen busses... check your facts please..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unreadable","review":"Fought a lot to reach the end of the book, but managed to accomplish it! This is the worst book by Crichton I've ever read. It's simply boring, no memorable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"I purchsed this book thinking that it was another formulaic Crichton thriller which I enjoy. Turns out that it was nothing more than a vehicle to promote the anti-global warming views of Mr. Crichton. The views were so favorable to the current Republican administration, Mr. Crichton was invited to meet with Mr. Bush to discuss this serious matter better left in the hands of real scientists not novelists, even with an M.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point, already!","review":"Given my relatively positive experiences with some of Crichton's novel's, I thought I'd tackle his take on current environmental controversies. I recall seeing a TV new show interview where a pro-global warming pundit was concerned that people would read \\"State of Fear\\" (2004), and become absolutely convinced that global warming was a hoax. As is the case with so many issues, the jury's still out on exactly what to do to effectively make a real-world difference.While the novel's narrative logs more than 600 paperback pages, I gave up less than halfway through. Crichton's dialogue kept covering the same ground over and over again, and he kept shoving his characters down extraneous rabbit trails that seemed designed to simply drag the story out.If this book is ever adapted as a movie, Crichton will have to streamline the story's structure, and just get to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive to be used properly: as toilet paper","review":"I've never liked Crichton's work, but not until this book was I actually offended by it. I wouldn't have read it at all, had I not been stranded away from my personal library. At least I didn't pay for it. This is a piece of irresponsible hackery, meant solely to cash in on reactionary climate change denial, and Limbaugh-like hate sentiment toward environmental concerns. Certainly it's fiction, but his use (misuse, in point of fact) of actual scientific sources opens it to criticism beyond that usually applied to novels. Even a number of the authors of the very papers he cites say he's intentionally misrepresenting their work. Talk about credibility issues; this novel (by definition a work of fiction) receiving a \\"journalism award\\" from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists is like NAMBLA naming Jerry Sandusky Man of the Year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rev. Crichton","review":"I don't mind that Michael Crichton believes Global Warming is a myth. I don't mind that he turns environmental activists into demons. I don't even mind that he gets his science wrong at times.I do mind when a novel is one part story and two parts preaching. This book is simply not interesting to read, and this is first time I have said that about a Michael Crichton novel.If wants to take on the scientific community about Global Warming, he should step outside the world of fiction to do it. I suspect he would be about as a successful at that as he was with State of Fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Fear reviewed","review":"Do you recall the hype of all that made you nervous like El Nino, Anthrax, Bird Flu and Y2K? Read this book and it can explain the latest wave of created fear, Global warming? I have not been a big believer in this \\"theory\\" This book explains why better then any one persons opinion, if you have doubts then read the book and take it for what it's worth, nothing will change if you don't, you'll just have a better insight of what we have been exposed to.Very well researched and written books with good data but read and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting fiction with a bibliography...","review":"This exciting plot reminescent to Clive Cussler is backed up with an impressive bibliography to rival most research thesis. Definitely a must read for those not satisfied with being fed half-truths by the media because you can check out the documentation.

In the words of Paul Harvey \\"...and that's the other side of the story...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Libertarian Novel","review":"I usually have a very hard time reading fiction. I even dropped trying to read Ayn Rand, although as a pupil of libertarianism I know I should.Nevertheless, I had heard that Crichton presented evidence to challenge some of the \\"doomsday\\" claims used by anticapitalists in the guise of \\"environmentalism\\" of late in this novel; and Crichton's reputation as a writer, obviously, attracted me further.I was happy to say I was riveted. The actual plot was somewhat fantastic....but after all, so was Jurassic Park. It did serve, however, as a great device for the characters to discuss ideas such as global warming, celebrity spokespersons for scientific matters, and most of all, the freedom to think and live the way one wants, within boundaries of lack of harm to others.At the end of the book, Crichton lists several pages of statements about his own thoughts. While a bit arrogant in tone, it does serve as an entertaining disclaimer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I have never been so disgusted in my life. In this age of propoganda, and the way lies and propoganda have catapulted us into an absolutely groundless war, I am shocked that one of my favourite authors has so enthusiastically embraced the same strategy. Apart from the terrible plot and storyline, the way that he has tried to use this novel to air his political views is a disgrace. I probably would not have minded so much had this rubbish actually been worth reading, but the characters are plastic, the storyline non-existant, and rhetoric boring, one-sided and foolishly unconvincing. I will never ever pick up another Michael Crichton novel again. He has lost this fan forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forwarding a faulty premise to backup a dangerous environmen","review":"It is bad enough that the powers that be in the government have done their level best to reverse the good work done by environmental agencies and groups throughout the country, but Crichton adds insult to injury by forwarding a faulty premise of nervous researchers vying for grant dollars. The research has already been done folks. And the numbers issued by government agencies are now showing that the current administration's policies are undoing years of work. People are going to read this work of FICTION and interpret it as FACT. Simply put: State of Fear is pure hogwash. For a better perspective on what is happening with the environment, read Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jared Diamond's new book, Collapse."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Politics","review":"I saw Michael Crichton on CSPAN as the guest speaker for the Heritage Foundation, a right wing think tank. I have no problem with the Right or Left trying to influence the culture. But the way Mr. Chrichton did it was sneaky! I enjoy his books. But this was a political right wing commercial. He should have written a non-fiction book with his arguments.His apperance with the Heritage Foundation also made me wonder if he was hired to sell a point of view?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Novel As A Front For Social Commentary","review":"I enjoy Crichton as an author, he has a varied and exciting body of work... and that makes this effort all the more disappointing.He uses this novel as a means of sharing his commentary on the state of environmentalism. It comes through as 80% commentary and 20% fiction. It causes his normally engrossing characters and storylines to become shallow, predictable, and tied together by a very disjointed storyline.If Crichton has valid concerns and facts he feels a need to share, he should write a non-fiction book on the topic. His name would still help it sell many copies.Hopefully he will return to true non-fiction writing for us fans of the stories that brought him credibility as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo: irresponsible writing!","review":"This book is a sad, sad excuse for entertainment and/or science. Yes, there ARE doubts as to the veracity of global warming, but these are raised by a very very small minority of scientists. The majority of scientists, politicians, and plain ol' citizens agree: our world is getting hotter due to our intervention. Even if you don't agree with this, the plot was terrible, the women were all beautiful and athletic and yet still fell for the dopey lawyers, and the dialogue was stilted.

To those who won't bother to check the facts, they may be influenced by Chrichton's approach. Many Nevadans were told by the U.S. government that it is safe to store tons of nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain, and the United Nations was told by Colin Powell that the aluminum tubes that Saddam's government procured were for nuclear centrifuges -- meanwhile, in both of these cases many respected scientists disagreed. In the latter, it was finally proven that the aluminum tubes were not what our government told us they were.Read Chrichton in the same vein -- as if he were doing the bidding of politicians instead of scientists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audubon Weighs In","review":"For those of you who want a detailed and in-depth review of the shameful pseudo-science behind this book would do well to read the article in the May 2005 issue of Audubon.http://magazine.audubon.org/profile/profile0505.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"About as BORING as a one-sided lecture can be !!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this guy and his best-selling talents.

And make no mistake, environmentalism is a religion to many people. #2 is legitimate criticism. Some of the stuff that happens in the book is far-fetched to the point of silliness. Overall, though, I think Crichton's two aims were to write a reasonably entertaining story, and to cast suitable doubt on the idea that the earth is turning into a deadly, hot greenhouse and we have to do something NOW!I believe he succeeded in both aims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and great seller","review":"This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it for everyone. The Amazon seller was also great and provided an excellent service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and entertaining to boot","review":"This is a very fast-paced, action packed novel and a enjoyable read. The book deals with global warming and Crichton does for the environmental movement what Dan Brown does for the Catholic Church in \\"The DaVinci Code\\". It is extremely well researched, as Crichton novels are, and very informative. I found myself googling references, organizations, and scientific findings. You are sure to learn a few things through this book. The only drawback is that it went just a little too long and a couple of characters go through so many near-fatal experiences that you have to roll your eyes that they survived it all.

I've just been bludgeoned to a bloody pulp with political haranguing when what I wanted was to sit down and spend a few hours with a good Crichton story.

That's unfortunate because the environmental information presented, the idea that the environment is naturally in a continual state of change, and the information about what research has actually proven in relation to climate change (almost nothing) as opposed to what has been speculated, was very interesting.

Ten out of ten times, I love me a Michael Crichton book.However, this book falls well short of the mark he has set for himself with such classic titles as Jurassic Park, Timeline and Prey. There is just nothing fun about State of Fear whatsoever. The characters are paper thin, the story is slow and boring and the writing style just doesn't feel like Michael Crichton at all. I don't understand.If you're looking for a fun read, this is not it. If you're looking for a well-written Michael Crichton book, this is not it. I love Michael Crichton books, but I wouldn't recommend State of Fear to anyone. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -","review":"If you must read this book, wait until it is available in your local library.I was disappointed with this book, and do not consider it typical of Crichton's previous novels. I did not find the storyline to be gripping, or even plausible in some spots. It appears to me that Crichton merely wrote the story as a vehicle through which he could express his opinion about the misuse of information and research to create a state of fear in the general populace.I was reminded of Ayn Rand's book, Atlas Shrugged, except I did not think that Crichton's story provided as enjoyable a backdrop for his philosophical diatribe, as Rand's story did.I have come to expect Crichton to provide a clever story, with interesting surprises, delivered at a fast-pace. This story provided none of those features. There are even a number of typographical errors to add to your annoyance.Sadly, I feel that both Crichton and his publisher took advantage of his reputation in producing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is true science","review":"Don't let anyone in the liberal mainstream media try to fool you into listening to what \\"real\\" scientists have to say about global warming.

And if you don't believe me, just listen to Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh - they'll never lead you astray!I am giving this book 1 star only to symbolize how unlikely it is that humans are having any impact on global climate."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Tedium","review":"One of the worst books I've ever suffered through. I should have tossed it after 30 pages but my prior respect for Crichton and the marginally intriguing story line suckered me into sitting through all the tedious lectures from cardboard characters. Reaching the last chapter brought a sense of relief and a sense of having been manipulated. Don't waste your time on this global-warming-anti-theories-diatribe cloaking itself as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out boring, and","review":"Got better as I read; but so much of it was not believable. People trapped in a crevasse in Antarctica almost dying of frostbite then just bopping around a few days later as if nothing had happened??Please! And octopi in baggies ??? Please! Never really explained who Kenner was. Too much lecturing...this is supposed to be a novel. But I admit I was glad that noxious character got eaten by the cannibals!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"fiction\\" effort to date","review":"This was an extremely disappointing effort from Michael Crichton. It was like reading a college lecture from an ill-informed professor with an agenda -- with a bit of action & plot thrown in (maybe 200 of the 600+ pages were devoted to the actual story). The characters were weak, the plot unbelievable, and the climate \\"facts\\" distorted. I have always enjoyed Crichton in the past, but this effort missed the marked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really terrible","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read in a very, very long time. Implausible, disorganized, preachy. I loved Jurrasic Park, but State of Fear should have stayed in the file cabinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new low for Crichton","review":"Despite their popularity, Chrichton's novels and their dramatizations have often had a mean spirited and often biased agenda. Look at \\"Disclosure\\", which tells us all that it's really those predatory women who harass those poor innocent male executives, or \\"Sphere\\", which contains a nasty and thinly disguised character assassination of Carl Sagan, or \\"Airframe\\", with its portrayal of innocent airplane manufacturers at the mercy of those evil reporters who have the nerve to investigate whether a manufacturer might make mistakes and not report them (Challenger, anyone?).In this novel, he misunderstands and misquotes environmental science to convince everyone that there's not only not an issue there, but that we're all being manipulated by evil environmentalists. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic propoganda book masquerading as fiction","review":"I have read almost all of Crichton's book and used to quote him as one of my fav author. But, this book has been the biggest let down. I have no idea what the author was trying to accomplish writing this book and selling it as fiction. The characters are just some half baked pin ups .. so that he can link this huge bibliography, yes that's right this book is just a bibliography of all publications which are anti-global warming. I just quoted what author said, becuase I myself haven't read any of the publications he listed. Well if I had to do that, I won't be reading a fiction at first place. Also, the ridiculous point author's makes in the end of this book that he is not taking sides . Michael must really think that reader's are stupid because if you have enough patience to finish this boring book, you won't have any doubt left as to which side of arugument, author belongs. He does not have to give a lame excuse about his impartiality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iconoclastic technothriller","review":"A mass market vehicle with an anti-establishment viewpoint. Honestly, I shouldn't have been surprised at its entertainment value--Crichton is an old hand at pleasing the reader. One caveat: this is a fictional work-- don't expect it to be otherwise. If you want non-fiction about global warming, it seems that every week a new theory bursts on the scene. I absolutely enjoyed Crichton's version, neither fact nor purporting to be. No fifth star because I compare all science fiction to Ray Bradbury--interpret that however it best helps you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical Thinking isn't Criminal...So Far","review":"In State of Fear, Crichton faces up to issues that are now entrenched in a dogma matching the religiosity of the abortion debate. You can expect the reviews to be hypercharged by political leanings. As a novel, State of Fear reads well enough. It's a suspense story that presents the problem that occurs when science becomes political. The distortion of research would be a challenge for any dramitist, but Chrichton brings the issues and data into a realm of discourse, making it possible to consider issues and the flaws behind the agendas. I enjoyed reading State of Fear and commend Chrichton for his critical thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing...","review":"I started reading this book and I've read the first 50 pages. Sadly, I am dissapointed because I never got into the story and the characters change very rapidly and it's difficult to keep track who is who in this book.Bottom line is this:Very difficult to understand the story and what is actually going on from the beginning of the book. Characters change from \\"destination\\" to \\"destination\\" and they never come back so you're starting from zero every time.---I read three of Crichton's books before and they were good, but this one is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Boredom","review":"I am a big Michael Crichton fan and have read all of his books. Unfortunately, this book as a novel just bores me. It would have been great written as a non-fiction book on the theory of climate change -- but can only give it two stars. Too many of the characters were two-dimensional, the action scenes were not thrilling, and the plot was mostly lame and unbelieveable. The information provided in the book about climate change was pretty interesting, but didn't go far enough to convince me either way. When I pick up a novel to read I want to be entertained; with a factual book I want to be informed. This attempt falls short in both categoies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait for the Movie!","review":"Very enjoyable book. Amazing display of politically incorrect and inconvenient facts and research data, skillfully crafted into an exciting story. A must for Crichton fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed","review":"I used to be a big fan of Michael Crichton, but after reading this book I am a little disappointed. First off, too many things happen to the main character in three days, almost dying in the South Pole, then, back to the US, then getting poisoned in his own apartment (stung by a sea creature) getting out of the hospital a few hours later to attend a conference and the story goes on.. too unbelievable- But what makes me sad is that Michael Crichton is selling the idea that man is not damaging the environment, that global warming doesn't exist - I liked his other books because they seemed accurate to me - but after reading State of Fear, I wonder if all the facts in his other books, are just facts of fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy To The Extreme","review":"Dont' waste your money on this one...huge sections of the book are nothing but diatribes against environmental organizations, the data they use to support their claims and the all to easily manipulated media. He may even be correct in some of his anti global-warming messages but that's not the point.If Crichton wanted to express his viewpoints, then he should have done so outside a fictional book that is promoted on the front cover as \\"edge of your seat storytelling\\" when in fact it's drop dead boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"instructive; dogmatic; preachy; educational - not a novel","review":"State of Fear is neither fish nor fowl and Crichton's conflicted goals make for a poor novel and lousy characterization. I am listening to the audiobook, and the preachier parts are downright agonizing and drag the action down. The characters are more like caricatures; Peter Evans is the central mouthpiece, but who can identify with his passive voice? It's obvious he's simply a mechanism. The action scenes are good, but not good enough to overcome the reams of techical babble that rightly deserves to be addressed in a non-fiction setting. I agree with much of the premise of the book, but if you're looking for entertainment, or just good writing, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science aside -- plot made no sense","review":"All the reviews here argue for or against MC's scientific position. Personally, while I think it's good to question conventional wisdom, I think global warming is as accepted as the Earth going around the Sun. That aside, I suspended my disbelief in the scientific argument in the book in order to enjoy the story. That's where the problem lies.The story is ridiculous. I won't give any spoilers that aren't in the book's description, but if you were a federal agent trying to stop eco-terrorists, with thousands of lives at stake, would you call in a) the Delta Force, b) the Marines, or c) a young lawyer and a secretary?That said, with disbelief in the science and the ridiculousness of the plot suspended, it was a fun page-turner. But there are better books out there to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"DyNANOmite!!!","review":"Hi-tech sci-fi thriller based on nano-technology gone awry. A good read for a techie/science mind. If you don't enjoy technology or don't understand it, this book will probably not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Much for a Big Name...","review":"I have read several Crichton novels and found out that State of Fear is slightly better compared to Prey. Thus, a 2 star.It started quite convincing. But the remaining three quarters just a mix of airplane flights all over the world, a lawyer adventures and bunch of Global Warming data churned out for mass market. Though the information provided by Crichton is in top-form as usual, it just doesn't fit trying to smuggle so many technical charts and information into this novel. The book becomes somewhat \\"too non-fictional.\\" Credit still must be given for his extensive research showing mostly that Global Warming trend is nonetheless a \\"fiction\\" itself.Well, for people thinking this will be another Jurassic Park, Sphere or Timeline, you will find it disappointingly wrong. Sorry, I don't like this book at all. Not worth reading to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If Michael Crichton wants me to enrich him by spending money for his hardcover \\"novel,\\" he can at least give me a the kind of good story I expect from someone of his caliber. He says everyone has an ulterior motive except himself - as he laughs all the way to the bank! How much better it would have been for him to be up front and write a non-fiction book on the subject. Shame on you Mr. Crichton....you owe us."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Before this, I had been a big fan of Crichton. I loved Airframe and Sphere, despite the fact that the science in them was a bit off. I couldn't stand this book. Suddenly, the environmentalists want to kill everyone. This book is a slap in the face to everyone working in the field of environmental science-myself included. Mr. Crichton needs to wake up and smell the scientific coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Fear","review":"Very, very disappointing, Michael seams to be trying to both make a statement about his view of some environmentalists, and citing references about realities in a fiction Novel ??? We all understand that there is real science backing the general theme of his other novels, but this is 774 pages of ridiculous material that is non entertaining at all. I think he may be losing his step to over sensationalist Dan Brown. Anyhow, I did not think it merited the cost or the length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on Inaccurate Premise","review":"The premise of this book is false, misleading and inaccurate. And that is saying it nicely. It is hard to take the story seriously when it is founded on such poor interpretation of the facts and science. I am very disappointed in his foray into espousing political beliefs instead of telling a good story. And I just can't get over the premise... beware the evil conspiring environmentalists!!! Give me a break... I advise Crichton fans and everyone else to pass on this subpar book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glowingly promoted book","review":"Generally I like Michael Crichton books and style of writing, but this story is very boring and long winded. I didn't mind his overwhelming lecturing if the characters were not predictable. The characters seemed like robots, not something you will expect out of human beings. Everyone in this book is one dimensional, forgettable, and unconvincing. I wonder if some wealthy Republican paid to have this book published and be glowingly promoted?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost written by Bush administration???","review":"I have liked Crichton's previous books but this one was a major disappointment and extremely irritating, since I consider myself a person who cares deeply about the environment. The further I got into the story, the more obvious Crichton's conservative political agenda became. I kept trying to remind myself that it was only a story but the insulting, thinly-disguised references to Martin Sheen (environmental activist actor who plays the president on television -- let me guess who he means) infuriated me and I couldn't continue reading it. The story isn't even very interesting. This is not the same skill exhibited in 'Prey' or 'Timeline'. It's obvious this book was written for a reason -- to try and deny that global warming exists and to demonize the environmentalists who are trying to preserve existing clean air and water protections. I think I could be considered a former fan of Crichton."},{"rating":"1","title":"603 Pages of Bad Fiction and Claptrap","review":"The author's \\"message\\" pretty much says it all.

I was on a road trip and picked up the audiobook version at a Wal Mart. I truly regret contributing any money toward this book's cause. The story is formulaic and cheesy -- it's only there to act as a thin veil for the book's message. The message, believe it or not, is: global warming isn't real; to the extent global warming is real, we don't need to worry about it; the planet naturally changes all the time and can cope with any stress humans put on it; and it's okay to cut down sequoia trees because they didn't exist until a few thousand years ago. Impressively stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thousands of climate scientists *could* be wrong, but...","review":"I have no problem with works of fiction, but Crichton's claim that this book is grounded in demonstrable science (and that everyone worried about global warming is misinformed, deluded or worse) leaves me amazed. Even major oil and coal companies are now admitting that global warming is real and that they have a responsibility to do something about it.URLS can't be listed in these reviews, but the climate scientists at RealClimate (search on that) have posted a couple of articles thoroughly debunking pretty much everything Crichton has to say. If you have the time and inclination, the rest of the site will give you a thorough grounding in current climate science issues, and will place the critique of Crichton in a broader context. The writing is pitched to the educated public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Crichton's State of Confusion","review":"With a title like this and having enjoyed some of Mr Crichton's earlier books I thought I might be in for something interesting.How wrong I was.Lame plot, bad characterisation, boring and monotonous lectures thinly disguised as dialogue - is there anything to like about this book ?As for the disinformation about global warming not being real - please spare us this propaganda.Have a look at this for an examination of the conspiracy theories Mr Crichton would like to have us believe:http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=74"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a good $2.99 special","review":"Scientific data (including references) + (poor plot and badly written characters) = one confusing NOVEL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I've ever read","review":"Was this book an elaborate joke? Was this book ghostwritten by Dick Cheney? Almost every character is an offensive shallow stereotype of those \\"wacko liberals\\" that are just straw men waiting to be knocked down by the cool, paramilitary \\"genius\\". Every couple pages he goes into a lecture about how those \\"do-gooders\\" don't know what they are talking about, how global warming is a myth and no one can back it up with science, and/or how the corrupt environmental organizations are just preaching chicken little nonsense to raise money or control the population... or something along those lines. It's really awful. The plot is awful, the science is awful, the characters are awful, the logic used to \\"debunk\\" global warming is awful. This book is insultingly stupid.To paraphrase a famous quote: If you can't convince them of your brilliance, baffle them with bull****. This book is the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Fear? More like State of boredom.","review":"I am a big Michael Crichton fan and quickly scooped up this book at the local library in hopes of another thriller, but was disappointed by this overly technical, long-winded book. Typically Crichton uses technology as a backbone to the story but gives us characters to tell the story. In State of Fear he is so intent on bombarding us with ecological data, usually presented in a \\"I know what I'm talking about and you don't\\" tone by Kenner that the book reads more like a Save the World brochure from WWF. After being entertained and riveted by his previous books I only finished this one in hopes of seeing the pace pick up and the story get exciting. I was let down on both fronts.Pass on this Crichton book and hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PAGE TURNER WITH FOOTNOTES","review":"Mr. Crichton has produced a very important work given the vast amounts of falsity issuing from the media concerning global warming. He has diligently researched the subject and supports his position with a large volume of substantiation.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who would like to hear the truth about global climate change."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"First let me say that I am in Crichton's corner when he criticizes the radical environmentalist movement. And that is why I was quite excited to read this book. I haven't read many of Crichton's, but thought that \\"Rising Sun\\" was superb, and \\"Sphere\\" was better than average. But \\"State of Fear\\" was just simply awful. The characters were cartoonish at best. The primary \\"hero\\" was an amalgamation of Alan Quartermain, Indiana Jones, and James Bond, but we learn virtually nothing about him. Also, the reasons why the millionaire benefactor acts are never explained. And boy, the plot is just down right silly.Crichton does provide much useful information, but the reader would be better served by reading, as I have, Bjorn Lumborg's \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist.\\" Crichton references Lumborg's text, which is more of an academic textbook but is a more enjoyable read than this hack job."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I've ever read!","review":"This was a real page turner and I couldn't wait to finish it-only because I was on vacation on a remote island and that was the only book I had. having picked it up at the airport. More unbelievable than any Dirk Pitt. The main character a Jr. BH estate atty finds himself in the middle of ecoterrorists conspiring to wreak havoc and finds himself trapped in a remote arctic ice crevass only to survive and face death in other remote parts of the planet in the space of 3 days. The science is spurious at best more so in regards to human culture than global warming. He uses statistics to disclaim global warming in the slickest of ways that would make Mark Twain blush. It's just so implausible and shallow why did he bother writing it? Michael get some spirituality please-we are human beings not robots."},{"rating":"1","title":"98% Science, and 2% story","review":"Im not a scientist and dont pressume to know anything about global warming beyond what I read in the news, but Michael Crichton clearly has a passion for debunking it. Fine, but is that why someone would buy his book? I was hoping for some sci-fi adventure, and instead picked up a several hundered page research paper. The story itself was loosely thrown in, and not very believable. Not that the cloning of Dinosaurs in Jurrasic park was believable, but it was alot more interesting then this book about a secret agent and a couple of lawyers trying to thrwart a coorperation of Eco Terrorists. Seriously, why not send in the Marines instead? It wasnt horrible and gave a new perspective on global warming that I'm not used to hearing, but again, thats not why someone would buy a fiction book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Michael Crichton's latest works have been far below the standard he set with books such as Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Stain, and Sphere. His most recent effort was hugely disappointing and frustrating to read because he got so overwhelmed with the science he forgot about the plot.The book barely held my attention for the first 250 pages or so - I kept reading in hopes of finding something that would. The characters are poorly developed and seem to slide in and out of character traits. I especially got confused with the relationship between Evans and Sarah versus the relationship between Evans and Jennifer. Which one was Evans supposed to be chasing?Mr. Crichton got so fact-happy that he relied on very technical information, data, and graphs to keep us hooked on the barely-existent story. It was a poor tactic and should not be repeated.If you're looking for a good Crichton novel, don't pick this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of propaganda and name dropping","review":"The story is mildly entertaining but the name dropping and propaganda has to go. Not the type of thing I would expect from the writer of such groundbreaking and interesting novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"While it's not unknown for Chrichton's books to offer up stilted dialog from one dimensional characters, the plots are usually entertaining enough to keep one's interest. Sadly, that's not the case with State of Fear, which offers up not only bland, utterly forgettable characters, but a plot that is just absolutely mind-numbingly stupid. Throw in his 10,000 citations and the \\"Kenner\\" character that comes across as little more than a bully pulpit from which the author spouts opinions and I can guarantee that this will be the last Crichton book I read.Don't waste your time... Life is way too short to spend your time reading this drek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept... But","review":"MC explores many interesting concepts here, global warming, social fear, etc. However outside of the concepts the characters that compose this book are at points near laughable. An NSA agent who has trouble getting a gun or even enlisting a commando squad to take out extreme environmentalists? Please. A sexy LA assistant who's good with a gun. Ick. Really I think I could get more mileage out of 1940's gumshoe novel.While the concept is engaging, the story is not. Pound for Pound I think I would of gotten more out of reading one of the reference materials MC listed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best thing about this book are the essays and bibliography","review":"Even though I agree with a lot of Crichton's political views (and this book is highly political), the book's world is a bit silly: All the \\"pro\\" global warming characters are steel jawed action heroes who kill without hesitation and can survive lightning strikes and multiple gunshots, and the \\"anti\\" global warming characters are simpering, lying, cheating wussies and scoundrels. Well, you don't read a Crichton novel for character development and introspective dialog, and like other Crichton novels this one does have an interesting back story, good background research, and will make a profitable Hollywood action movie. The best part is the bibliography and the essays/talks in the appendix included the E-Book edition I read - if those are not included in the print editions look for Crichton on C-Span. He's an interesting speaker, and not as politicized as this novel would have you believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"BORING! Annoying pseudo-analysis sections that drag on and on and on throughout.

He has jumped the track. There is little or no plot...very poor timing and unlikable superficial characters. He fills the pages with paragraph after paragraph of propaganda, lecturing and sermonizing. He creates characters just to preach his view of the world. This is a cheap trick, Michael. Shame on you. I understand you have a point of view, but don't put this out as a work of fiction. This is an opinion piece and disguising it as a novel is a poor way to pay back your loyal fans. I had to wade through page after page of your agenda to get to the story...and it really wasn't worth it once I got there. You lost your way."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Screwed Up Science","review":"In honesty I haven't finished this book. I think I got close to the end but it got more and more boring as I went further in. Like previous Crichton books, you should not read this if you have any type of science background. Crichton is guilty of using the same flawed logic and irresponsible conclusions he criticizes environmentalists of using. I am a pretty much to the center of the political spectrum and often get more tired of enviromentalists grossly exaggerating certain dangers more than I get tired of those to the right completely ignoring the dangers. That was why I was first interested in reading this book, however Crichton does not address what the radical left is trully guilty of, rather he uses spurious claims of the minority of experts in an effort to dismiss what is by any serious scienctist's account, one of the greatest dangers facing the planet. Simply put, Crichton has not gotten any better, and has in fact, gotten worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Fear is that this book will never end","review":"I've been a huge Crichton fan - reading all his books and enjoyed all. Even this book starts off with really exciting beginning, however the story tends to drag on for hundreds of pages of anti-global warming boring scientific discussion matched with a level of unrealistic story turns that don't really tie together by the end of the book. It also has a morbid sense about it given its untimely topic of tsunamis.Unlike other Crichton novels, I will not be saving this one to read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst work yet","review":"Oh come on. Michael Crichton has written his worst book yet, if you want to call it that. I don't mind author's using their books to promote their personal agenda. If I agree with Mr. Crichton's views are not is not the point. THIS BOOK WAS BORING! The action was dull, the preaching was monotonous and the characters that didn't agree with the hero were all pretreated as pompous idiots. Mike, you can do a lot better!Bryan"},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprisingly naive effort","review":"In nearly every previous book - from \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" to \\"Jurassic Park\\" - Crichton has struck me as being a true erudite... a learned man. And yet, in this book I was shocked, quite frankly, by how one-sided his argument was AGAINST the theory of global warming. As a trained physician with a clear curiosity about all things science, Crichton seems to have put forward a work of fiction based on fictional evidence. I've always enjoyed turning to his books for their escapist qualities that seemed grounded in the latest thinking. It's just too bad he's abandoned his roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"There are a lot of strong opinions on the book and for good reason. The book covers some controversial issues: I.E. validity in the globaly warming theory. I thought that the story was excellently paced and exciting while scattered with carefully selected pieces of information regarding global warming.Regardless of your stance on the -theory- of global warming it should be emphasized that people are profitting, GREATLY, from the concept. Even if you are a die hard advocate of the theory I'd recommend the book because it does lead one to wonder about the organizations with which they choose to associate."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Message Than Plot","review":"Michael Crichton has a talent for combining high tech info with old fashioned fun and excitement such as in Timeline and Prey.Sometimes however the details overwhelm the story(Airframe) and this book despite plenty of entertaining close calls is pretty much a mess.The goofy mishmash of a plot is probalbly the first in history to have environmental terrorists shooting lightning bolts at cub scouts and features more graphs than any book I've read since high school.Crichton asserts that global warming is a myth and uses every character,graph, and factoid that he can to prove his point bringing the flow of the book to a grinding halt every 20 pages.It's a thoughtprovoking topic worthy of discussion but it's poorly incorporated into a sloppy plot.At least it's ambitious but I kept expecting to find a test at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. However, it was a Christmas gift for my son in law.

It is the author's sytle to take an uncommon but often times correct view of current events in the world. This one is one of his masterpieces.

The story is interesting and the research he uses is vastly undervalued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Critchon","review":"If you are an ignorant-tree-hugging-hippie-liberal you will probably hate this book; I loved it. A book such as this is long overdue and I am glad Critchon was the one to write it. Once again he masterfully makes science easy and tells a gripping, entertaining story in the process. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Crighton's Best","review":"This book tells a fascinating story of environmentalism gone extreme. Crighton uses a multitude of facts, fully sourced, which shows that much of the conventional wisdom on global warming is just plain wrong. Unfortunately, the belief system of global warming has so much inertia that it is difficult to present the opposing viewpoint. This book attempts to do that. If you're close minded on this topic, you probably won't enjoy the read. It takes guts to go against those who are pushing global warming and for that Crighton deserves a lot of credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Fear","review":"Before reading this book I had gone along with the mainstream thoughts on global warming. That being, that we as a whole, have created a situation by our use of fossil fuels, that has changed the earths' environment. Crichton exposes some of the fallacies and thinly documented \\"proofs\\" that we have created an irreversible apocalyptic situation. Through his use of scientific documentation and exquisite storytelling, I now believe that most of global warming is a natural process that has been ocurring and recurring for eons. By no stretch of the imagination am I an \\"anti-environmentalist\\". Facts sometimes speak louder than emotions. This book is a wakeup call to look at known realities before jumping to conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"For anyone who reads Michael Crichton for his wonderful play of mind on the \\"what-ifs\\" of science and technology, you'll be sadly disappointed with this one. Nothing exceeds the bounds of human capability in this story.As usual, Crichton did his research. If this were a textbook, I'm sure it would be quite a page-turner. And based on my education in environmental studies, I agree with most of what he says. But please, eco-terrorism and dry environmental debates (supported with pages of charts and footnotes) do not a thriller make. Add to that a main character who is led by the nose, a know-it-all abrasive genius/law enforcement agent who does all the talking, typical eye-candy female characters with no important role in the story, and the political-correct minority character (again with no important role), and you get \\"State of Fear.\\"The plot and characters simply cannot support all the scientific data that Crichton throws at you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged/DaVinci Code-ish","review":"Kenner's frequent diatribes on the faulty environmental movement remind me of John Gault's on objectivism in Atlas Shrugged. And, Crichton has shaken up people's scientific and environmental beliefs much like Brown did for people's religious beliefs in the DaVinci Code.I appreciated the wealth of research Crichton put into this book. I read the book in 4 days so it was definitely a page-turner. However, I couldn't give it 5 stars because the ending was weak. I wanted resolution between Morton and Drake. I wanted something to happen between Sarah and Peter. I wanted somebody to be arrested for the many crimes committed. Crichton laid too much groundwork and spent too much time developing so many characters (even though I admit some stereotyping occurred) to just end with Morton's idealistic dreams about re-inventing the environmental movement. Overall, I'm glad I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well well...","review":"Well, if one is inclined to believe in conspiracy theories that say that scientific researches conducted by scientists have a final report against or favorable to global warmimg, depending solely in who is paying the reasearch (ambientalists or corporations), we could conclude that Crichton was handsomely paid by the corporations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the plot?","review":"I had only read Prey before this, so maybe I don't get Chrichton. Where Prey was fast paced, and gripping throughout, I found this book to get boring real fast. Initially, I found the debates on global warming to be intriguing. But just when things are getting interesting (despite the flimsy plot) we have to muddle through pages and pages of more debates that grind things to a halt. By page 250 I think I get the point.The characters are so 2-dimensional. Half the time, I don't know how Evans, the main character, feels about what's happening around him. He's written mostly as an opportunistic wimp. We just get all this dialogue back and forth. Why doesn't Chrichton just call this a screenplay and sell the movie rights. I'm sure the movie will suck, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I first read this book in Mandarin over a friend's house. I was so hooked that I decided to read the book in its original language. The story was great and the ending seemed realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Fear","review":"The book is too wordy; a 1/3 or more could have been edited out. I almost decided not to finish it, the first part read like a soap opera. The last 1/6 of the book is good, but it's obvious the author is preaching about the media, politics, and the environment. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"started out pretty good,had great potential if not for that environmental teacher on every page.what i am saying, more story ,less envirofact , woiuld have made a bad book alot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative thriller","review":"Crichton has done it again! Another deeper read than most thrillers of the same genre, and yet it moves right along.I found it to be thought provoking as well. My hat's off to Crichton for another fabulous work of fact/fiction! I hope we won't have to wait so long for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual standards...","review":"I just finished reading this book and it is a huge disappointment for a Crichton novel. It is basically a forum for him to show off how much research he has done on the issue of global warming. When he begins to drone on too long, he suddenly puts in a chapter or so of page-turning action. But it does not work. The characters never grabbed me, the action was completely lacking, and it seemed the characters' actions never really amounted to anything. There were many useless characters, or characters introduced early on that never came back to have their storylines resolved. The climax scene was a cop-out. Crichton should have just written a review article for a trade journal summarizing all the publications he read regarding global warming. Skip this book, it is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forum for Crichton's personal bias","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas gift and, having enjoyed many of Crichton's books in the past, was looking forward to reading it. The plot was confusing at first and the more I read the more I realized that this book was really just a platform for Crichton to smear environmentalists in general, and to convince people that Global Warming is not a serious concern (or at least not caused by man, or......)The plot suffered greatly by his desire to convince people of his view point. It was not well-balanced at all.I am no expert on Global Warming, but I can sense when someone is trying to manipulate me. While complaining about environmental groups not being objective, this book has the same problem.The characters were not well developed and were very stereotypical.I can not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"In my opinion, the \\"reviewers\\" are right to rant. First of all, the novel is utterly bad! Anyway you look it. From a novel perspective, it is downright horrible. And there are more than enough accurate reviews here for me to have to re-review anything about this... well, I would say \\"novel\\", but that would be stretching it. Second, the \\"scientific arguments\\" are so one-sided that they themselves become dull and boring, making for an even worse read. If Crichton (and that's Crichton with an \\"r\\", Leonard) wanted to to make us, the public, think about Global Warming, there are plenty of forums in the popular science literature for that: and there his comments would have got the proper place, and proper review, and proper forum for rebuttal. Like a bad scientist, Crichton presented biased, over-inflated arguments to a naieve audience. This action borders on criminal, and flies in the face of peer-review, something of value to the responsible scientists amongst us. This IS a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A screen play, not a novel","review":"The characters are not even cardboard cut outs, the plot so implausible it makes the head swim, the action duller than dull but the six hundred page rebuttal to global warming interesting. Why couldn't this book be summarized in three pages? The world could have saved some trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott this book","review":"from Jamie Wilson, Guardian:\\"Michael Crichton's latest novel, State of Fear, is an action-packed thriller in which the hero is a scientist who discovers that climate change is all a fraud. The novel has sold well, but it was still something of a shock yesterday to find its author as an expert witness testifying on global warming in front of the United States Senate. Crichton had been summoned to give evidence by Senator James Inhofe, a Republican senator from Oklahoma, who recently called global warming 'the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people'. Some scientists speculated that Crichton might be the best witness Senator Inhofe could find. A 2004 survey of 900 peer-reviewed and published scientific papers on climate change failed to find a single one who went against the belief that man-made change is happening and is dangerous.\\"Boycott this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"I think I picked this book up expecting more. Instead, I got a sermon on the author's reality of global warming. And man, talk about dull. I'm sure that crichton did his research, but this book blew. Wooden characters, a plot line that was completely transparent and sermons in the middle. Avoid this one at all costs. Consider this.... This is from the man that inflicted Jurassic Park on us..."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Fear","review":"It's a decent thriller. But, anything that helps dispel the myth of human created global warming is a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I have read Michael Crichton's Great Train Robbery, Prey, Lost World etc. I read the Prey before I decided to buy the State of Fear, excited that this would be a page turner too like Prey. However I was extremely disappointed with this novel, after spending x amount of hours reading 500 pages book, I feel cheated. The book has no character development, there is science too it, but that too is questionable. The facts about global warming are often repititive. Its almost that you can predict the story in first 100 pages. The character of Evans and Sarah only stands out, and the only thing you could look forward too is them falling in love, but that doesnt happen too. Lastly, the end is soo abrupt, that you feel like CRYING... its just OVER. I was so disappointed with this novel that I have decided never to read a Michael Crichton's novel again."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG book, BIG issues.","review":"I like Crichton's work. I start to read his books and I can't stop. This one was no different. His pacing is perfect. His thinking and arguments offered (even in fiction) are meticulous, very well thought out and often take your mind places it's never been. Global warming is currently a hot (excuse me for that one) issue. Whether pro or con on the issue you'll rethink your stance based on what you read. It's not meant to sway you either way but the wealth of information and, as I mentioned, the arguments put forth will have you thinking a little. I found the ending a bit rushed to say the least but the story, the writing, the pacing and the subject matter are pure Crichton and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, Fiction, but a Little Too Close to the Truth.","review":"Another gripping suspense filled book by Michael Chrichton. It does indeed contain facts here and there and is in a fictional way a reflection of the power grabbing aspects of the \\"religion\\" known as global warming."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book","review":"I have been a great fan of Michael Crichton but of all his books,this one has really disappointed me.It looks like he hastily thought of some plot so that he could give lengthy preachings and include unnecessary discussions on weather ,environment and global warming.The book starts well and Crichton manages to get the reader interested when John Kenner meets with George Morton and later with the suspense surrounding the death of Morton but the plot keeps getting interrupted by lengthy and often boring discussions and graphs about the environment and Carbon Dioxide levels.The plot ultimately gets too predictable and a bit childish.Most of us who are great fans of Mr Crichton are used to his style of putting discussions and preachings in his work but this one is a bit too much.I eagerly await his next book and hope that he will once again write something on the lines of his other great books like Sphere,Prey,Airframe,Timeline or Jurassic Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for it to be over!","review":"Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite books. But this one was just a snooze fest. Three quarters through the book there were still all these loose threads that didn't add up. Despite a couple of good thrills, nothing really came together at all. When you have to ask yourself when your 10 pages from the end \\"what the **** is going on here?\\" it is not a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you'd come to expect","review":"State of Fear by Michael Crichton is a good read but doesn't rise to the top as his previous books. It's like reading prey from the nanobug's point of view with a super arrogant nanobug. I recommend you buy the paperback specially if you are a die hard Crichton fan like I am. That way you can enjoy tossing this book accross the room occassionaly as you read the erroneous one sided statements that are made throughout the book, and not put a hole in the wall. It did get my blood boiling a bit. I kept on wondering wether Crichton was being funded by the Bush administration. I still like the writing style...true to form. My first dissappointment with a Chrichton book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"Crichton immerses himself in polemics and forgets he is a storyteller. This book had me screaming, \\"Pick a genre!\\" This was a poorly written anti-environmentalist manifesto combined with a sketchy, weak suspense yarn. The result is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah!","review":"We seem to either love or hate this book, and I throw my lot in with the latter group. But come on guys, we don't have to go to war with each other. Play nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of preaching","review":"No story. A lot of preaching. I was getting really tired of the Kenner guy telling everyone he met how to they should think...Whether you agree with Crichton's view of global warming or not...give me a story, not a book with a lot of footnotes. One more thing...where was ending?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientists from 113 countries vs one science fiction novel","review":"Scientists from 113 countries issued a landmark report Friday saying they have little doubt global warming is caused by man. But it takes just ONE popular science fiction author, in this book and in interviews, to instill doubt in the minds of many. Crichton's criticism of climate research is an insult to top scientists in the US and in the world and a great disservice to mankind.Environmental campaigners urged the United States and other industrial nations to significantly cut their emissions of greenhouse gases in response to the long-awaited report by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 300-page lecture","review":"News flash for those who haven't read this book -- Michael Crichton doesn't believe in global warming. And, he makes it clear that he thinks anyone who does believe in it, has fallen \`Prey' to media hype and unsound science. He compares concern over global warming to the hype about killer bees and Y2K. Yes, the media loves to scare us, but somehow I don't think the public is quite as gullible as Crichton makes us out to be. I generally love Crichton's books, but this time he has climbed onto a soap box and presented a 300-page, one-sided lecture and I for one wish I hadn't bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Boredom!","review":"** possible Spoiler **BORING BORING BORING! OMG this had to be one of the most excruciating books I've ever read! This was less of a \\"general fiction thriller book\\" as it was an over blown triad. While some of the author's arguments are good ones (and I may or may nor agree that's not important!) who cares?! The action sequences are a great if you can make it though Environmental De-brainwashing 101. So much time is wasted with pages and pages of boring graphs and countless triads debunking commonly held environmental believes. The author's views on celebrities and their environmental causes are pointedly clear. I'm guessing his opinion of Martin Sheen is not very high either. I would say maybe 1/8 th of this book in \\"Crichton Worthy\\" the rest of it is pointless drivel. When this is made into a movie (and we all know the book was optioned before it was even finished) it will make a much better movie than book. Wait for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like being in school","review":"If you're looking for hours worth of lectures on the dangers of not being ecologically conscious, this is the book for you.

I just don't look for this sort of \\"information\\" from my fiction reading, nor do I want to be repeatedly beaten over the head with it. And that is how this felt. I enjoy Mr. Crichton's book, but this one was WAY too preachy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short on story, long on science","review":"State of Fear won't be remembered as Michael Crichton's best story but it seems to me he wanted to get his views on the junk science behind the environmentalist movement out there and decided to write a novel to hang his arguments on. Although I wish he had spent more time on the story I have to admit that I still found it a compelling read, primarily because he was so dead-on about junk science. If you want a bit of an education about the environmentalist movement, global warming and the fake science behind them and don't want to bury yourself in dry science papers -- with a bit of a story wrapped around it, I would recommend State of Fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"state of fear","review":"An excellent read...fiction but could be non-fiction...should be required reading for all interested in environmental concerns! Crichton spins a page turning story full of suspence and serves much food for thought at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Fear by Michael Crichton","review":"It is nothing wrong with being a contrarian about Global Warming, and especially pointing out all the special interests that play on the public fear to enrich themselves. Michael Crichton made a good point about that, and that's the best part about this book. The story however is most contrived, incomplete, and amateurish. I was shocked that this book ever saw the light of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It's hard to believe this was written by the same author of some edge of your seat page turners. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Crichton work ever","review":"I don't give a pea on climate change, so I won't be a biased reviewer like the anti-climate change reviewers say. This book is so bad, so terribly written, it's a shame they sell it. Crichton has always provided me with great reading time. This book however, seems to be written without a reason, and with no interest at all. It is boring, the characters are so flat, the plot is so inverosimile, in short it is the worst I've read in a long long time.Do not by this book, really. You'll be very dissapointed. Instead find a friend or a library to borrow it if you really have the urge to read it, if you feel the need to check for yourself it is a bad bad book. It's not even worth the price you might pay at a flea market or a closeout sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Fear Book Review","review":"The book arrived in excellent condition and was well worth the money, and arrived in good time. Michael Crichton makes an indisbutable case that global warming does not exist --- I never believed that it did. He backs up his statements with many references from scientific journals, getting his point across with an exciting story line and believable characters, exposing the prejudices of many in the so-called envionmental movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay story, good facts","review":"Most of Michael Crichton's (RIP) stories deal with real world controversies, and 'State of Fear' is no different in that it deals with the so called \\"global warming\\" controversy. The story itself is not one of Dr. Crichton's best, but the facts presented (and documented) by the author are of great interest and typically not being given by the main stream media. But even though it may not be his best, the story is still a good read and well worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling theme.","review":"Not Mr Crichton's best book in terms of the fiction, interesting, but the heroes are a little too unbelievable for my taste. But it is undeniably his most important book in terms of the message. It should be apparent that the crazed environmental left is alarmed at this book. All you have to do is look at their hysterical reviews of it. Duh. Mr Crichton provides a bibliography and documents sources for all of his data that disproves or calls into questions all of the radical left's sacred enviro-cows, especially global warming. Unless you are a black helicopter type you should read this book, check out the data, and decide for yourself. It will alarm you if you are not already clued in to what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortal","review":"This was my first venture into Michael Crichton works. Quite an impressive coverage of research done by the author. This book has some strong arguments of the general perceptions among the people. If you are an environmentalist and if you think you know a lot about global warming, try this book. The main characters in the book were all \\"immortal\\" and some of the actions were a little bit surreal. Generally, it's fun read and the most interesting part was the discussion of the \\"State of Fear\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"If suddenly there were no airports, Crighton would never sell another book.","review":"Man, this is garbage.

The plot is implausible and full of holes the size of Grand Canyon. All main characters are cartoonish. If I say their motivations are oversimplified this will be a huge understatement.Nevertheless, this book deserves one star rating. Why? Because it brings interesting information and factual data about global warming and human attempts to \\"preserve\\" environment. It will be especially useful for those whose opinion on the subject was formed by the mass media and baseless \\"beliefs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdity","review":"One of the worst novels I have read in a long time. I stayed with it to see if perhaps it may somehow redeem itself. It did not. The scientific discussions and data are boring, the characters are not believable and the numerous escapes from death parallel the grade B movie serials I remember from the late 40s and early 50s. In fact they are as absurd as the premise that a trained specialist would ally himself with two amateurs to thwart a well equipped, well financed and dedicated group of eco-terrorists intent on creating mayhem for profit. It is not even a good adventure story. Crichton missed on this one; badly. If he had a message, it got lost in the garbage. Save your money and your time, buy a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad!! Hard to believe Crichton wrote this!!","review":"This was a really bad story. Or I should say \\"what story?\\" Did Crichton really write this? Apparently he feels the need to \\"educate\\" his readers with pages and pages of irritating arguements and lecturing between his characters. I got this book to be entertained, not to feel like I'm in the middle of a liberal vs. republican debate. If I want to be educated about a topic, I'll go find a book written by someone actually qualified to write about the topic. This book is a waste of money. Read one of Crichton's earlier books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this no stars...","review":"This was an awful, awful book - bad science, bad story, absoloute trash.

The plot is loosely supported by some minor intrigue, which never really interfere's with the long dialogs about the environment.I kept reading in hopes, Crichton would infuse his normallytaught situations and actions.I finished the book only to realize this is nothing more than a diatribe about the environment.He even goes so far as to take the time to \\"explain\\" his research and beliefs in the \\"author's statement\\".Give us a break, Mr. Crichton !!!For what it's worth, I share this authors beliefs that not enough is known about our environment to accuse the inhabitants of killing our world, BUT, I bought this book to be entertained, Not to be lectured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed Catholic Mom","review":"I bought this book with high hopes because of various reviews I had read about it.

Even if you didn't like the first book in the series, 1632, I would recommend that you read this one, as I thought in this one the characters' motivations were much better defined.

The pieces fit so well that you can pick up the entire puzzle when complete. There is considerable variety in piece shapes, although each piece (except edge pieces) connects with four neighbors. The cardboard is thicker and more durable than cheaper puzzles, but it wouldn't like getting wet or being chewed. This puzzle is moderately difficult because the art is low contrast. The art is very interesting. I worked it without looking at the picture and was continually surprised at what the various patterns and colors turned out to be. I have about 150 jigsaws of various brands and always have one in progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Value, but poor quality control","review":"Brought the combo, great tools, powerful, lighter than the 18v, good feels. It's not loud under operation. But the quality control was terrrible. The Jacob chuch is somehow wobbles, or off center. I can see the driv bit wobbles. when attach to long drill bit, or long masonry bit, you can see it wobbles 1/4\\". Still trying to determine why by talking to HOmeDeport and Dewalt. Exchange it once, but same problem with Impact driver. I think there's quality control problem with the latest batch from the factory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combo pack for the price","review":"This deal combines the Drill/Driver with an Impact and a charger, all together in a tough, heavy duty bag that you can throw in drill bits and accesories.

I make my living by writing. I really enjoyed the first couple books in this series, but I couldn't get past the first couple hundred pages of this one. The writing is just bad -- awkward with a capital AWKWARD. This is partly the result of the extreme, over-the-top, knock you upside the head heavy-handedness of the political philosophy that dominates the book's pages. It doesn't matter what political perspective the author is coming from; when a book reads like a spin room one-pager (stretched way, way too far), that's bad. Ayn Rand, who made no attempt to disguise her point of view, looks like a master obfuscation by comparison.Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesson in Gov't","review":"What a BIG dissappointment this book was. This was more like a lesson in socialism/communism than about \\"fantasy epics.\\" What happened to the sorcery? The Dragons?

Sorry Mr. Goodkind, this book STINKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book of the Series is Book 6","review":"I will keep this brief. This book made the entire series worth wild. Many fantasy writers focus on all the characters walking great distances and fighting impossible battles and winning. I was tired of this!! It gets old, quick. I must compliment Goodkind for telling a story. It is rare to see an author explore the people we read today in fantasy writing. Only George R.R. Martin has done it better in recent years. Worth reading more then once!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Inspiring","review":"Can't imagine how anyone could give this less than 5 stars. The beginning is a little slow but the rest of the book makes up for it tenfold. It is a wonderful and inspiring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad disappointmemt","review":"I think Terry should have changed richard's name to John while he was at it. Ann Rand already wrote this story we didn't need a knock off copy of it. I have faithfully read all the books in this series I think The author should of stopped about three books ago.I do not reccommend this book as good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--Get to the ending!","review":"This was the most disappointing book of the series. The author spends page after page trying to move the story from the previous book to the next book. Also, some of the lesser character's motivations are not very well explored. At one point, more than one of the characters are moved to completely change their outlook on life based on seeing a statue. Why? Are they that shallow, or was it not properly explained?I kept wanting to shout at the author: \\"Get on with it!\\" If he really respected his readers, he would put more of the story into each volume, and go for a shorter series. Instead, he and the publisher will milk his fans' support to a long-awaited ending. For me, that is fine for this series, but I will never start another Goodkind series again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite from Terry","review":"Faith of the fallen is easily one of the best Goodkind books in the series. Although in some ways, it's underlying theme could be considered rudimentary, it is satisfying on many levels for the reader. At this stage, Goodkind has mastered his balance of the slow burn while meeting our desire for blood. The novel builds to a delightful crescendo, which in my opinion is not matched until perhaps the last novel in the series. It's a must read for fans, and a worthwhile standalone book for anyone who enjoys a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Terry Goodkind's writing style is unique and only serves to make the plot of Faith of the Fallen more intriguing. Morals and lessons are colorfully woven into the plot and characters throughout the novel. We're introduced to the weaknesses of human nature and even the strengths! We see Nicci, a sister of the Dark, show that anyone can change and doesn't have to follow conformity. The plot, characters, the SOUL of the book was touching, intriging and full of lessons. Another fantastic literature piece for Terry Goodkind"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end ?","review":"I really enjoyed the first few volumes on the series. The Pace was fast and the story was excellent. Now, it seems that Mr. Goodkind has caught the Jordan's virus and that the serius will drag on and on and on. It always surprises me that people with such vivid imagination will get stuck within one story and never move on.I really think that Mr. Goodkind is good. But the series should finish and he should move on to something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination in its finest","review":"The Sword of Truth series has brought up the fantasy world into higher levels regarding the plot and its complexity.

Terry Goodkind has certainly proven that he's THE (!!) Master of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent inspiring book!","review":"So good! All of the liberal obama worshipers might not like it.

I just got a kindel for my birthday and have started to get the series on the kindel. I love this series, but there is some sick stuff in each book. I want my 11 year old son to read these books, but in I can't allow it quite yet. I will have to wait until he is probably 13 or older. Very great books. I can't put them down even when I know what is going to happen. I recommend this series to any fantasy reader who likes the works of Martin, Jordan, and authors of that caliber. I have noticed several gramatical errors in the kindel downloads in each book. Some of the sentences are hard to read with repeated words or totally misplaced words in them. But the errors are few in each book. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longest and best series I've ever read.","review":"Faith of the Fallen is every bit as good as the previous five.

In addition to it being a great fantasy novel, it has solid morals that could apply to today's society. I especially enjoyed Richard's adventures as a common everyman in the old world & Kahlan's role as leader of the Midlands forces. This was a unique divergence from the run of the mill fantasy novels published today. I can't wait for the next installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand would be proud","review":"After a lackluster fifth book, Mr. Goodkind brings it on strong in \\"Faith of the Fallen\\". I have always been a fan of Ayn Rand's objectivism and this book gave forth the same ideas, if in a fantasy world. I won't go on about each point and how he made it, but if you are interested in more, read The Fountainhead\\", and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\".The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I was hoping for more of the 'world building' that made his earlier works so enjoyable. It seems he gave much more attention to driving home his points than in dealing with creatures or Richards magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 down and still strong","review":"I have read the whole series up to this one (7th is on the way to me.) and I'm not in the least disapointed. Goodkind does a very good job at writing a good classic epic fantasy. The books in this series as of yet have almost never let me down and I finished this one off in one day of lazyness. This series is definately in in my top 5. Start at the beginning of the series though as it fills in the background. I would have to say my review is more directed at the series rather than the individual books, but it is the individual books that make the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Waste of Words","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the first few books of this series, I have been steadily disappointed as time has worn on. I debated whether or not to even buy this one, and unfortunately curiousity got the better of me. I read the first 200 pages, put the book down and have no desire to pick it up again. It's awful. The characters are predictable and annoying. The grace and wit of the writer is long gone. Too bad. Another good Fantasy series sunk by greed and burn out. That's it for me. I'll stick to reading Robin Hobb. At least she knows how to END a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the series best...","review":"The \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" of high fantasy well serves its escapist raison d'tre. It is a fun, distracting page turner written in Goodkind's usual flowing style offering just enough carrots to keep you going. Some may frown at the obvious Randian politics, but the good vs evil in the individual vs the state motif is not to be missed. May Richard and Kahlan live on. I eagerly await the stories of their son to come and the final defeat of the Imperial Order. But please, Terry, provide a map of the old world. One of the series best!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep The Story Going","review":"I have been hooked on the series from the beginning and continue to want more. Why do so may people want the story to end? I have read the frist two books from The Wheel Of Time series and have not enjoyed them nearly as much. There is always a sense of danger in the Sword of Truth series. Number 5 wasn't great but so what. Keep the story going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Of the Fallen (Sword of Truth, book 6)","review":"THis book was great, a real Fanatsy lovers dream. I had thought that Nothing would top Wizards First Rule. The first Sword of Truth book, boy was I wrong. This book has it all, a great plot that keeps getting deeper and deeper.

If you are to read this pick a clear afternoon where you have ntohing to do. because once you start this book you wont be able to stop. Thats just my 2 cents worth E-mail me at drunk_man84@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Think for youself, express yourself...","review":"This is the most amazing book I have ever read, it blows away the rest of the series entirely. Terry Goodkind comes out and says what he has been hinting at all along, and if you think about the connections between the series you'll finally understand exactly what he has been trying to say. This book is, in my opinion, the most emotional of them all. While there are places of intense action the main focus of this book is the characters, how they think and why they think that way. This book defines Life in the simplest, yet most stunningly correct way I have ever heard it defined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Grandpa?","review":"Did you ever wonder what happened to Nathan Rahl and Zedd? How can anyone say that some characters weren't left out? You don't introduce \\"main\\" characters and never bring them back into the picture! Goodkind left so many characterts in limbo. Other reviewers were saying something along the lines of \\" the story line was so good it was like living in a communist country\\". Well I'm sorry but I didn't buy this book to read about the life styles I can so readily see on our own world! This book was a big disappointment! Mr. Goodkind needs to take some lessons from David Eddings! Goodkind doesn't plan on writing another Sword of Truth novel but if he did I will have to say that I would buy it only to see what will happen and to see if Goodkind can recoupe after this sorry tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get cover image for my Kindle","review":"I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the cover image when I purchased the book for my Kindle. I've tried contacting customer service to see if they could find a solution to this problem several times, but no solution was found. Not having the cover image reduced my enjoyment of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I have read this already","review":"Have you read any Ayn Rand? Terry Goodkind obviously has. In fact I was so turned off by the unsubtle pushing of capitalism in the beggining of the book that I almost stopped reading. Don't get me wrong, I love Ayn Rand, but If I had wanted to read a good old fashion communist bashing book I would have reread \\"We the living\\" or \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Terry manages to keep the story (slowly) moving, but it is a far cry from the first book, which I couldn't put down. The main plot is basically the same one we have seen in the last five books. What happened to the origional story lines that I used to enjoy? I was hopeing that this book would prove my fears wrong, but it hasn't. The series is slowly dying. Sorry Terry, I think it is time to put the Sword of Truth to rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it first, then comment","review":"As a former big time Terry Goodkind fan, I am very disappointed by this book. It's the same as many of the others but not as magical, and the characters I've been waiting to see [Chase, Gratch, Scarlet] are apparently a thing of the past too. This is one big rant against socialism, just like Soul of the Fire was a big rant against the Clintons. This is a dumb book, and Goodkind fans will be disappointed, even people who give it 5 stars without reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Awaited - Disappointed","review":"I eagerly awaited this sequel. I really didn't expect a novel that left the relm of swords and sorcery into a long winded diatribe on failed Soviet style socialism. Out of 20 tapes in the unabridged version, 17 were boring! I expected the usual action that the other stories in this series excelled in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Of The Fallen...","review":"Now I know some folks don't think Terry Goodkind does that great of a job, I think to the contrary...that man makes books where you can feel the pain, the love,the lust and the hate...when a book can do that to you you know you've found something special...now Faith Of The Fallen epitomizes now a days...we sit in a state of disillusion till one of us figures our place in life and rises above bringing others with us...as usual Terry Goodkind shows that art is alive and well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Temple of the Winds","review":"This book started out cool with the hut in nature and everything. However, I think that Richard's part really declined after that. I really enjoyed Kahlan's battle with the Order, but when it got to Richard it got really slow. I don't think they should have put a picture of the statue on the cover! It didn't seem as magnificent as they made it out to be. I really enjoyed Temple of the Winds, and this was a good comeback after a dismal Soul of the Fire. I cannot afford book 7 in hardback so I await it in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"#00 page book in twice that number! A steal? No","review":"As with all books, after book one of a series, the author is obligated to bring all readers 'up to speed' with backstory. We are well into the series now and this author fills in backstory endlessly to the point of boredom. If I were not hook on the story, I would have shelved the book. There is an awful lot of exposition ... the why of what is happening. It does get tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morally and ethically wrenching!","review":"My stomach was in knots throughout this book and there were times I had to put it down and breathe...thanking God that I was \\"right-here-right-now\\". Terry Goodkind will pull you into his reality so completely that you won't even realize it happened. You will clench your fist and your lip will curl at times; there is no way around the physical emotions that you will undoubtedly be submersed in. His depictions of the Old World are so intense that they became more real than the lands on Earth. No history teacher could make me see another culture as though I were experiencing it, but with this book you WILL experience it. You will live it. Take my word for it, read this series. It will change you. Change."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the last","review":"While I did enjoy the last in the series it was somewhat of a let-down. the storyline was interesting but not what I had come to expect. This book is much better. Goodkind takes you to more places than ever in his world. A very good book. As usual I can't wait for the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but I see several problems here","review":"Wow! The first time I read this book, I was amazed. What a great plot! What a beautiful philosophical discourse! One thousand pages later, I found myself disgusted with the entire book.The one thousand pages I refer to are modern philosopher Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" a wonderful book which I am not reviewing here. However, I will say that the book describes her philosophy, objectivism, which is remarkably similar--read, identical-- to the philosophy Goodkind puts forth in the conclusion of Faith of the Fallen.I can understand appreciating Rand's philosophy. However, appreciating to the point of putting it in a fantasy novel and passing it off as your own creation can only be called plagiarism.The plot of Faith of the Fallen was excellent, but I found myself disgusted with Goodkind's blatant replication of Ayn Rand's ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like(d) this Series, and I liked Ayn Rand...","review":"...when I first read her books back in high school. There is certainly a lot of value in what she wrote, as it's thought-provoking and interesting.The Sword of Truth series, however, is something that I indulge for entirely different reasons, and as entertainment this installment falls flat on its face. Goodkind leaves out interesting subplots and characters whose fates were totally unresolved at the end of the previous book so that he can hammer home his Objectivist points. I have philosophic consonance with those points, but don't buy his books to hear them rehashed. If I really wanted that, I'd pick my copy of Atlas Shrugged back up and read it again. Heck, he even named Nicci's father \\"Howard\\". How obvious is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but . . .","review":"After reading the first 5 books of the series I was a bit disappointed with this one. Faith of the Fallen is certainly as well written as the other books of the series, but the plot seems a bit \\"small\\". It's as if you keep expecting there to be much more to the plot, as the whole book seems but an aside to what was left hanging in other books, particularly Temple of the Winds.Still a good book, but doesn't really seem to advance the plot of the \\"world\\" as the other books did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as 5 but still leaves me wanting","review":"After Soul and the Fire I waited for this to hit the bargain bin before reading it. I was overall happy by the story, but have to agree that the seperate Richard from Kahlan and make sure he can't use his power is getting too repetitive. I crave a wonderful story where Kahlan and Richard work side by side and attain a victory together.Although I also thought the anti-communism sentiment was overdone, I felt there were enough twists in the character development to justify the purchase of this book. I find myself once more eagerly awaiting the next book in the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent once more......","review":"I must say that Faith of The Fallen is a great read....I could almost picture Nikki. The reason I gave only four stars is that I am ready for Richard to start to learn his power and to use it. I'm sure the next book will do this as well as give Richard and Kahlan a son. That will bring Shota back into it. Faith was well written and almost seems to parallel current political issues such as conservatism and liberalism, communism and capitalism. I like the way Goodkind incorporates this in his themes....Anyway, let's bring Gratch back and keep up the good work, Goodkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK NOW!!!","review":"For those who have been waiting for FotF to come out, you will not be dissapointed. This book, in my mind surpasses every sequel so far. After page 200, i could not put the book down, literally. Goodkind fabricates a setting of shear antagonism, which seems impetetrabel for Richard, yet he prevails. Nicci, the Sister of the Dark, is riveting. She adds a new dimension to the Sword of Truth novels, the reader friendly antogonist. Throughout the whole book, Nicci is stunning. Her transformation to the light is unbeleivable.. I actually received chills down my spine at the climax. This book will blow you mind.... Mr. Jordan will have to outdo this in my mind..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayn Rand's new boy toy","review":"If Goodkind wants to become a born-again objectivist that's his own business, but for him to whore himself out and write this propaganda drivel is a disgrace. He has characters thoughtfully developed in other books mindlessly repeat Randian nonsense as a mantra. He has completely ruined the series. I would suggest you do yourself a favor and avoid this book at all costs - believe me your imagination of what happens in infinitely better then what Goodkind actually wrote. I would like to officially start a collection for Goodkind's family to hire a deprogrammer to remove him from the cult he's joined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still ripping off Rand, just a different one now","review":"If you've gotten over Goodkind's incompetent and slavish copying of Robert Jordan's literary style and still want to read his books, do yourself a favor and SKIP THIS ONE. Goodkind spends hundreds of pages reciting the plot of Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTAINHEAD, slamming Rand's totalitarian ideals against strawman political after strawman political. Utter drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can get away with it.","review":"Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan are writing worse and worse books, and we are willing to accept them. I find myself continually buying these books with the hope that the next one will be better and continually being disappointed. I think each of them had about 3 good books in them, but instead of stopping decided to keep up the cash flow and see exactly what they could get away with. This book is the stupidest yet. TG seems unable to develop the characters' personalities. We have mild insight into 2 characters this book. Richard and Kahlen do not grow as people. They are no longer endearing. They are beginning to come across as arrogant and petty, where they once were sweet and their relationship was mildly refreshing. If you want to read a good series read George R. R. Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hail to the new Piers Anthony","review":"Faith of the Fallen has to have been Goodkind's worst book. I have been a fan since the first one, although I was disappointed in the last one, and bought this one eagerly. A waste of trees and my time is all I can say for this book. Let me see, how can you describe what he is talking about other than to see him describe his idea of communism? How many times are we going to go through the same \\"Richard is captured and lives as a slave, only to charm everyone around him including his captor\\"? On top of it all, he takes 539 pages to show everyone what he already knew? Piers Anthony died a cold death because of how he ruined his series. Goodkind is on his way to following that fate. I just wish 1) I had my money back, and 2) I had my time back. I could have been playing a Squaresoft videogame - they have more imagination than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same plot, yet again","review":"This book isn't so much a novel as it is a manifesto on the evils of communism. If you want a 500 page lecture, go ahead and buy this book, but don't expect a whole lot of entertainment. Goodkind yet again recycles his tired plot: Richard is captured by an evil woman; Flawless hero, Richard, eventually prevails; Evil woman turns out to be good in the end; Richard and Kalahn are reunited; Everything works out for the best. For someone who spent 500 pages extolling the virtues of reason, Goodkind shows an apalling lack of logic (and imagination) in the creation of Richard's world. There seems to be no overall creative vision for this meandering series of books - Goodkind appears even more lost in his own work that Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed Ayn Rand","review":"The first book in this series, I thought, was the best sci-fantasy book to come down the pike in ages. Almost since the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. But the books have devolved quickly, culminating in this latest installment. Faith of the Fallen is Atlas Shrugged all over again. And while Ayn Rand can fairly be called a philosopher, Terry Goodkind is an author. There's a big difference, and one which Mr. Goodkind ignores.One similarity to Ms. Rand, however, is Goodkind's incessant need to repeat. Like in Atlas Shrugged, it was \\"90-page rant on the evils of surrenduring your will to that of the community,\\" followed by \\"100-page soliloquy on the evils of surrenduring your will to that of the community.\\" Condensed, I think the plot development took about 10 pages.And, unfortunately, those 10 pages were an almost-verbatim repeat of prior plots. But this point is aptly addressed in the other several-hundred negative reviews on this book, so I'll leave you to read those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete utter rehash","review":"Terry Goodkind has written another episode in his amazingly popular series. And like a tv sitcom, everything happens the same way. Again, we see Richard and Kahlan happily together in the beginning. Then they are forced to separate, again. Richard discovers a wizard's rule, again. No one listens to what Richard says, again. Richard goes through torture, again. Richard refuses to quit, again. Richard's beautiful \\"evil\\" captor changes her ways and falls in love with him, again. (i don't think this counts as a spoiler).So if you liked everything Terry Goodkind has written before, you'll like this one too. However, if like me you are tired of the lack of originality in fantasy today, this books will be a waste of time.Well, there was one innovative idea, which was to write this book as a propaganda piece. Someone should tell Mr. Goodkind that the Cold War is over and capitalism has triumphed over communism almost everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like it the same...........","review":"This volume continous the story of our brave Richard Cypher, and as some other reviewers already told, it is the same as the last five books.The Good:-Written very vividly.-Something importants happens.The Bad:- The cover already reveils a great deal of the plot (I think)- There is a wise lesson of about 500 pages on Communism in this volume.-----We don't need that! And I hate most that Richard seems to be an All American Guy: How cheap!-New temptation for Richard, New depart from Kahlan, New 'impossible Task'to perform, New foolhardeness', New Magic Rule and a lot more New. But the problem is that it is not new, but it goes on and on and on, each volume, every time the same.The Ugly:Geeeeez, Richard is too close to the Creator: is he immortal?? George R.R. Martin would have killed such a guy a long time before.Anyway, if you read this series you'll probably buy it anyway;'for the always developing story'.................."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayn Rand + George Orwell + Sword of Truth = Nothing New","review":"The absolutely transparent plagerism of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"1984\\" was so distracting that I found it hard to concentrate on the original material in this book. I've read the whole series, and to say it's getting tedious is an understatement. Every book, Richard discovers a new talent he never had before, a new form of magic, does something of legendary proportions, and gives away more of his empire.It's getting old. Every book starts the same way, something they did in the last book didn't turn out quite right, so they now have a bigger problem than before. Ugh... and book 7 just came out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Sequel","review":"As a sequel to Soul of the Fire, I enjoyed the closer examination of The Imperial Order and some of the ideological implications of the book, they can definitely go beyond the pursuit of economic freedom alone. Although I must admit getting a little annoyed at the repetition in describing certain characters. I can understand the possible need for reiterating certain traits of the characters but it becomes unnecessary.The relationship between Richard and Kahlan appears as too perfect in all the series including this one, Kahlan's actions in Temple of the Winds notwithstanding. Richard's character is presented as likeable to the point of incredulity and at times I skipped a few lines of somewhat pretentious narration. The main characters could afford more of a blemish or two, it might make them more interesting.Now that there are troubles in the Imperial Order, I hope that the threat will come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book in the series.","review":"Goodkind does a wonderful job of continuing his epic story of Richard and Kahlan. Richard delves deep into the Old World with Sister Nicci and allows the reader to experience the ongoing struggle from the Imperial Order's point of view. Overall, this book created a 3-D picture of the Imperial Orders purpose whereas, up until this point, the Order was nothing but a faceless, emotionless enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Political and preachy, story got lost.","review":"The socialist world presented was too extreme to be believable, and the story degraded into sounding like the rantings of distrubed bitter old man. The ineptness of the leadership and councils was too extreme, and the evil too intentional to make sense for such a large movement. The side of good's evil wasn't addressed well, though at least it was more complex than pure evil against pure good. The whole nature of the story was distorted by the idea that a simple woodsman, could so easily outperform all the locals in a business he had no prior knowledge of. Again, a little more work justifying the sequence of events would have helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SWORD OF TRUTH","review":"I LOVED THE FIRST FEW BOOKS OF THE SWORD OF TRUTH NOVELS HOWEVER THE LAST TWO BOOKS \\"SOUL OF THE FIRE\\" AND \\"FAITH OF THE FALLEN\\" HAVE LITTLE OR NO ACTION WITH RICHARD EITHER USING HIS SWORD OR USING HIS MAGIC. THE SWORD AND THE MAGIC WERE THE REASONS WHY I LIKED THE SERIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE LAST TWO BOOKS FOR ME HAVE BEEN A REAL LET DOWN. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE VACATION IS OVER AND THE NEXT BOOK WILL GET BACK TO WHAT MADE THIS SERIES GREAT IN THE FIRST PLACE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointing \\"Must\\"","review":"If you are into this series, then like me, you have been waiting a long time for this book. Unfortunately, as much as it is a \\"must\\" read for us addicts, it is really disappointing and the plot seems to be going very stale. I will not be wasting my time, waiting for his next book in the series. I've had it and feel really let down by Goodkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith of the Fallen (rocks)","review":"Asides from the final book of the series, Faith of the Fallen is undoubtedly my favorite. It is a tail of failure, redemption and self actualization. As a fan of both fiction and non-fiction, I highly reccomend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Classic","review":"If you have read the first few books, you probably know what I mean when I say he gets better with every book. Combining the wonderful fantasy world with the basic rules of life, love, and liberty, Goodkind brings out everything. He has humor, joy, truth.... you name it, he's got it in this book. Not many books have me crying, but this series is exceptional- every single book had me laughing and crying over the charactors. His well painted, easy to relate to charactors push the boundaries of real life. I loved it. Unlike Robert Jordan, this series has 6 separate stories even though the charactors are the same, Unlike Modesitt's recluse, there is a purpose to goodness, and if you look for more than just adventure- like good charactors and problems you can relate to, READ THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Yet","review":"This book was amazing. The story hinges around the character of Nicci, instead of being entirely reliant on the actions of Kalahn and Richard. Although they are the main characters of the series, and very prominent in the book, Goodkind shifted his focus slightly which gave this book burst outward into some really intriguing statements and have much more depth than any of the previous, but keep all the magery and adventure that made them so awsome. I absolutely would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Goodkind did it again!","review":"I can't believe it! The Wheel of Time is no longer my favorite fantasy series! Faith Of The Fallen is the best in a line of great books. Even as the kind of person who's always looking ahead to when I know the hero will worm his way out of the current predicament, I hung on every word in this book. I simply could not fathom how in the world Richard would get free, and I wasn't disappointed. One of the most powerful endings I've ever read. I highly encourage you to start with Wizard's First Rule, and work your way up to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the previous, well-written, but more of the same","review":"The latest installment is a definite improvement on its predecessor. I've read a lot of the other reviews and they all make valid points: Similar story, boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy gets beat up, boy gets girl back. But if you are paying attention, it seems that Mr. Goodkind is taking a close look at the rise and fall of communism. The story is very well written and it kept me interested from cover to cover. It does advance the story, as we find more of the Midlands falling to the enemy, and we learn a lot more about the Order and its goals/reasons for what it does. Nikki is a great character, but she becomes a little frustrating after a while. Well worth the money and time to read. PS. I hate to see reviewers tearing a book apart when they obviously have a weak grasp of the written language themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't this book already written in the series?","review":"I just hope Richard and Kahlan die, I know I died a little bit when I finished this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"truthful review","review":"This is simply my opinion and i understand that many blind fanboys will disagree.This is how it goes:If my dog took a turd and that turd had sexual intercourse with a cat and the offspawn from that cat and turd had a retarded cat turd baby and then that horrid baby wrote a book with no knowledge of the english language i can assure you that the retard cat turd baby's book would be much more entertaining then this crap that terry crapkind wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"This book is boring, there are better books(Like wheel of time, or song of ice and fire.) Richard is boring and Kahlan is boring. And i don't like goodkind. bye a fanatic Jordan fan, who hated Goodkind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?!","review":"I paid ten dollars to hear some man talk about what a tree looks like and how it feels. Its nothing compared to lord of the rings and other real fantasy books such as harry potter. I really do believe that Goodkind got high, went to sleep, woke up, and just started writing down what he remembered from his crack dreams. I'm only glad I stopped reading after wizard's first page! I count myself lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry must be a republican!","review":"Alot of people have accused this book of being political. That is exactly what it was and what made this book so good! This book brought to life the pitfalls of overtaxation, income redistribution and government handouts for the sake of the \\"greater good.\\" Those who were offended are obviously insulted by hard work,determination,pride in one's own work and all the things America is supposed to stand for. I thought it was one of the best books I ever read. Although the ending did wrap up a bit too fast..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book blew me off my feet","review":"I am an avid Sword of Truth fan. I read all the other books in the Sword of Truth series. If I had it my way, they would all be given five stars because they all had me hooked on them until the end. Faith of the Fallen is no exception. This book is spectacular, as are most Goodkind books. I couldnt put this book down and its long enough to keep me that way for a long time. Im not a slow reader either (the fourth Harry Potter book took me 2 1/2 days). This is an awesome fantasy book but if you are new to the series, you HAVE to start at the first book (Wizard's First Rule) or you wont get what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"First of all, I have to say that I strongly object to the rating this book got from Paul Hughes. Granted it is not nearly as good as the first book of the series but it is still very excellent with great characters and an interseting plot. I am also reading the series by Robert Jordan and they cannot be compared at all. If you try to compare them you might just as well say that if you have read one fantasy book you have read them all. I can only strongly recommend not only this book but all books of this series, it is a great read and promises many more good books to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind comes down with Jordan's disease","review":"The Sword of Truth started with such high hopes. I liked the first three, the fourth started the downward slide. The fifth left a lot to be desired and this one...the 6th is a total waste of time and money. Goodkind has now joined the Robert Jordan club of has-been writers. Both started with great ideas, then through greed kept churning out mediocre and then awful novels. Jordan's Rand and Goodkind's Richard started out such strong and interesting characters and evolved to the point that I no longer care what happens to them. Both also started their series with interesting and strong female characters. All of the surviving women in the Wheel of Time series became comical caricatures and Goodkind's Kahlan is fast joining that group. There should be a Writers' First Rule...no epic can go beyond 3 volumes. Philosophers should write philosophy and fantasy writers should write fantasy...the two don't mix. At least not for Goodkind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrrgh!","review":"How much do I have to take this? The series are getting worse and worse! And this book like the last one is a piece of junk. Don't we dezerve something other than a stupid presentation of the communism and capitalism? No we don't dezerve! We dezerve this book where there's nothing itneresting. I doubt that Goodkind will become better in his next books like Jordan - from 7 to 8 not so good, but book 9 was great. And I doubt that \\"Pillars of the Creation\\" will be better than this junk, but who knows maybe it's even worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An improvement over book 5","review":"I enjoy the way Goodkind writes, so I still enjoyed book 5, but, let's face it, it's often more enjoyable to read about your favorite characters than people you despise and who talk about their twisted beliefs endlessly. Faith of the Fallen has much more of the good guys in it, lots of action, suspense, drama, everything. The only thing that keeps it from being five star is the amount of Imperial Order philosphy that you have to wade through. Otherwise, it's perfect! Loved it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as bad as the last two, but...","review":"If you survived to reach this book, you might allready know that each book where Richard and Khalan are togather, the book is bad and when they are seperated the book is good.The good news is that most of the book they are not togather, so it's not as bad as the fourth and fifth, The bad news thought, are that the idie of the book seems to be taken out of a fanatic anti comunist book from the cold war.Don't belive me? don't say I didn't warn you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as it ever was.","review":"If you have been reading this series, then you know the story. Boy loves girl, boy loses girl, boy gets tortured, girl cries alot and kills people, against all odds they find a way to each other in the end. Come on!!! This is what book 20 or something, and has the same structure to every book. If you have read the other books than this one will be absolutely predictable. The more deliberate interjection of politics into Goodkinds writing is becoming loathsome. We get it already, controlling people is bad, freedom is better, now get on with the story. The only difference between this book and the others, is that Richard doesnt save the day with some great magic that is never explained. Istead he saves the day with... are you ready... A CARVING!! UGGGHHH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disapointment.","review":"The first books of the series were good. I read them because they were very interesting with lots of action and surprises.The Faith of the Fallen was very dull though. I had to force myself to finish reading it. The first couple of chapters were good until Richard was captured by Nicci who took him to the Old World. Here the book really gets worse and worse. Basically Richard travels with Nicci through the Old World and this goes on and on and on. Nothing major happens. They just struggle with daily life in the Old World rein under the Order.In my opinion Terry Goodkind suffered from lack of imagination while writing this book. He published it capitalizing on previous excellent books from the series. I'm not sure if I ever read another new book from the series. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconceivably dull and irritating","review":"Readers of the first five books will have already been subjected to Terry Goodkind's total lack of understanding of psychology and human relationships. Now, in 'Faith of the Fallen', readers have the chance to be bludgeoned senseless by the author's simplistic and fervent Political Philosophy. As pedantic and doctrinaire as the Imperial Order he lambasts, this book is as embarrasing as it is slow.OK Terry, we got it. Communism bad. Freedom good. I said we got it. No really. Please don't lecture us on tyranny for 900 more pages. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars!","review":"If I could give a book negative stars, I would. This is definately what I call an \\"author in love with his own words and characters\\" and halfway through the book I was rooting for the bad guys to pulverize both lead characters (Kahlan and Richard). By the end, I was at least liking Richard a bit, but I still say the world would be much better off without Kahlan in it. When your favorite character is the villainess (Nicci) for most of the novel, you know you're in trouble. It took me three months to read it for a reason, I suppose. I will not bother with another of this series - a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Ayn Rand...","review":"had been resurrected from the grave and, still addled from her journey back to the living, coerced into writing a long, droning fantasy novel, this would be the unholy fruits of zombie Ayn Rand's labor. I loved the first 2 books, I really did, and I toughed it out through 3, 4, and (whew) 5, but I couldn't get all the way through this one. One of the only books I've ever thrown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's different, but good","review":"Yeah, Goodkind's series is getting long, but this book is different than the rest. All of the other books in this series focus on the use of magic. This book focuses on the human spirit and its strength. Initially I thought the book was slow moving because no crisis was immediately brewing. Before I knew it though, I was totally absorbed in the humanity of the story Goodkind was presenting. I give this book and all his other books 5 stars, just because they are as politically motivated as they are fantastical."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta love it ...","review":"Faith of the Fallen is by far the best in the series. Goodkind really takes a hold of you and makes you feel more for these wonderful characters. He has really evolved as a writer and his approach in this book leaves you captivated and anxiously waiting for the next book. I personally feel that you have to relate to the characters and feel with them so I have become a great admirer of Kahlan and Richard's strength and morals. I am truely in love with these characters and if you really want to experience this series you have to let it go and just let the story take you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Whine...","review":"Goodkind's books are beginning to read like Danielle Steel novels--same old story, different dust jacket. Again, Richard is spirited away against his will, this time by the Dark Sister, Nicci. Again, Kahlan the Mother Confessor is used as leverage to ensure his good behavior. (At this point, readers will think, \\"Kahlan really needs to jump off a cliff, we're sick of her!\\") The story plods along as Richard's innate goodness is the catalyst that inspires the downtrodden to rebel. Can Goodkind stretch this storyline any thinner? One good thing about this book, it is slightly more readable than the last book in the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Travesty","review":"You know, there's a real problem with this rating system: You can't give a book 0 stars. If I could I would. Faith of the Fallen is a strong candidate for the worst book I've ever read. To state all the problems would take well over 1,000 words. So I'll put it like this: If you like books that preach the same message eleventeen times, that are clearly bigoted and closed minded, that have completely one dimensional characters, and that have literaly no climax this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Goodkind writes a masterpiece","review":"This book has definately picked up where some of the others didn't. In my opinion, books 3 through 5 were a little boring. They started off slow, and picked up near the ending. This however, starts strong, and finishes strong. It's the best book in the series behind Wizard's First Rule. A lot of questions get answered in this book, while new ones arise. People think the story line has been done before, and perhaps it has, but the author twists the line a little to create excitement nontheless. This book tries to represent humanity, and save Richard's world from the advancing shadow of tyranny. Even in the heart of darkness, light must fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"FotF is easily the worst book in the series. Not only does it needlessly repeat previously elucidated ideas (the whole capturing thing and the tyranny), but it spends too long on insignificant themes. The conclusion is abrupt and unsatisfying. Also, Goodkind had led us to believe in previous books that Warren would one day be a great prophet; evidently, he changed his mind rather quickly. The whole Imperial Order/ Altur'Rang concept was a carbon copy of communist rule - I was hoping the author could be a little more creative. It seems that Goodkind simply ran out of steam for Faith of the Fallen. The series to this point has been wonderful but this book was simply a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get The Book","review":"This is far from Goodkinds' best work. The writing is stilted, repetitive and full of political message. The narrator sounds like he is reading The Three Bears to a pre-schooler. I stuck through the whole unabridged thing from a fondness for the characters and the previous books. Would be much better to get the book so you can skip over the anti-communist/socialist message."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Ayn Rand then you'll love this book.","review":"ARGH! Enough already Goodkind! What a slog! This is basically a book in fawning reverence to Ayn Rand and her social/political philosophy of Objectivism. Particularly in the chapters detailing the raising (?) of the character Nicci (wow! I just got it: Nicci - Nietzsche?). Basically Goodkind's Sword of Truth books, especially this one, preach and preach and preach. Please note that I am NOT talking about religious preaching, but rather social/political preaching. The preaching is way over the top and goes on and on for chapter after chapter - We get it, we get it - stop already. I had hoped to find an entertaining, exciting fantasy series, and instead ended up with a social/political diatribe. If you don't mind being preached to in the guise of a fictional novel and/or you like Ayn Rand then you will probably enjoy (and agree with) this book/series. But for anyone else, don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure to Terry's tax bill. . .","review":"You would think that in the year 2000, ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and about 25 years since any successful form of state socialism existed, Terry Goodkind would not need to spend his entire book derailing collectivism, socialism, liberalism and the Bismarkian social compact.I can only guess that Terry's tax bill was a bit high from the success of his usually great Sword of Truth books. Well Terry, this rediculous diatribe in the form of a fantasy novel is the cure for next year's tax bill. I, for one, am not coming back for more.We do not need a fantasy counterpart to Ayn Rand.I believe in helping others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly veiled Ayn Rand book.","review":"I don't know... this might be my last Goodkind read. It felt like he read a bunch of Ayn Rand, or maybe just some Objectivist philosophy, and said \\"Hey! I can write that!\\" Because that's pretty much what this book is. Not that there's anything wrong with that, really. I mean, I'm a big fan of The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. But it felt to me like he really wanted to write a book with that theme, then had to try to figure out how to wedge his characters into the scenario that would let them do that.So I guess I found that part kind of disappointing. It seems like the fairly rich potential Goodkind's characters started with is being squandered at the sake of a message. I understand the logic, but the result, for me, falls flat. Oh well. At least it was a fairly quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Goodkind","review":"As we've come to expect from Goodkind, dear old Richard can do anything and everything... and do it better than anyone else.Kahlan was developed a bit in the book, showing her flaws and frailities. In others, being human.Goodkind beat us over the head again with the Communism Is Bad(tm) stick.I always feel robbed after reading one of these books.. Goodkind tantilizes us with intriguing villains, but fails to follow through with them. Same head true in this book with Nicci, Jagang, and Narev. Why is Narev such a zealot, Jagang so polar, Nicci so dispassionate?? The author just glosses over these aspects of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith of the Fallen","review":"In a very enjoyable series of books, Faith of the Fallen is by far the best. Richard Rahl's perserverance and the example he set truly was a tribute to the best of the human spirit. I found myself laughing and crying and cheering with the masses near the end of the book, and finding myself with renewed conviction to live my life to the fullest and not let it pass me by.This book, like all of the Sword of Truth series, can be stand alone novels. So much of the previous story is woven in with the present tale that it is not difficult to read. I would however encourage fantasy enthusiasts to read them all, but this one is by far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith of the fallen","review":"I was about to throw the book in the trash less then a quarter of the way In, lucky for me I did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent piece of storytelling","review":"Well it's not an end to the series, but i enjoyed this book a lot compared to his last offering Soul of the Fire. Very fast paced and it shows the truth of the Order. Although it seems the Order seems a cover for communism in this book it is masterfully written and i can't wait for the next book in the series. Any fan will be very pleased by this book. Good job Mr. Goodkind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anotjer rehash...","review":"I'll admit that I really enjoyed the first two novels of this series, but in my honest opinion, Kaylan needs to be killed off. All she ever does is betray Richard, doesn't listen to him and basically is a spoiled woman. I mean, how many times is she gonna feel that Richard is cheating on her? How many characters are going to be so stupid and dense (Nicci in the revelation scene about Richards doings in the Old World). Come on , Terry, bring back the old excitement. I'm not going to buy the next book, I think I'll just get it fromt he library. I truly believe Terry has no idea how to end this story. Each book is just a retelling of the previous one, with a few differences. Even the characters are the same., No development what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST AWFUL","review":"I can only liken the people who praise a book like this to the mindless brainwashed people in Wizard's First Rule who were slaves to Darken Rahl. The writing is pedantic, the plot is a rehash of earlier SOT books [how many times is Richard going to be captured and tortured, for pity sake? How many times is Kahlan going to betray him?] and Ayn Rand's vastly better work. I am sick of buying books that wrap right wing political theories in the guise of fantasy. ICK."},{"rating":"2","title":"its about faith..","review":"Mr. Goodkind's book is about human nature. I've read alot of the reviews and i think some of you have missed the point. He is not judgemental about particular political arrangements. He is not telling us how certin socio-economic people are made. He is not even trying to tell us that money is the root of all the worlds woes.What he tried to relay to us is the role of faith in our selves . When he ended up penniless in the worst slum in the city, Richard knew that the people around him were no worse or better than any other people anywhere. With hard work and determination you can attain what you want. Richard became a leader to these people not because he was a \\"mighty wizard\\" or the leader of the empire but he showed them how to value their own lives.The plot revolves around the message in this story.Which is why I can't give it 5 stars. I think that he felt so strongly about his feelings that that interfered with characters. All and all a good read .."},{"rating":"2","title":"master story weaving by Terry Goodkind","review":"i read some reviews of the last book saying how Richard was not quite him self and that the whole thing was gone about in a different way than the other books. well this was first, i think moor like he would like to go about all things \\"moor brain, less blood.\\" and besides, if your looking for a 2D hero who goes strait for his sword and doesn't stop till he is the only one breathing, then you are reading the wrong books! This new book as all the others is very well thought out and written and you get to see even deeper in to the soul of Richard \\"THE SEEKER OF TRUTH\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER READ","review":"My only regret about this book is that I've finished reading it. It set up such a sense of anticipation. And the end was such a fulfillment of that anticipation, that its effects still linger days later. (I've actually read the ending twice, just to re-live it.) I won't tell you anything about the story, as any re-telling would ruin it. If you like this series, or if you just like Goodkind's work, READ THIS BOOK! On his website, Terry Goodkind asked that we trust him and not read the jacket, as it gives away too much. I agree. I took his advice and took the cover off of the book and put it away as soon as I got it. I didn't read it until I'd finished the book, and OH BOY am I glad. I'm even happy I didn't look too closely at the artwork on the cover. Even that gives too much away. Just read this book! It is one of the best I have EVER read!

But the book is always fun to read. The best chapters are the ones on maggots, on heads and on the autopsies themselves. Baden recalls his experience while on the OJ Simpson case and during the autopsy of a corpse that could have been Princess Anastasia. He tells us about the strangest and dumbest things he has seen during his very long career, all the while sharing every single gruesome detail with his readers.This is a great nonfiction book that tells us a lot about this strange and fascinating profession.

I am a scientist and I was expecting somewhat more informative. However, the main problem of this book is not that it gives very little information about forensic science, but that the writing is simply AWFUL. To me, it looks like this book was generated from a five-hour interview that Marion Roach later transformed into many pages of bad writing.

Overall, many, many references and indictments of the poor job done by the LAPD in the OJ trial! It's everywhere in the book!!! Over and over he harps on it.

Braking power and feel is exactly the same as the OEM pads. They make zero noise and low levels of dust.

If you really want to read about Egypt, pick up Peters' _Crocodile on the Sandbank_; even though she writes novels, she has a degree in Egyptology and has forgotten more about ancient Egypt than Jon E.

No HDMI in... so unless you run this through an HDMI switcher, if you only have one HDMI in on your TV, you're screwed! I have a PS3 and this system, and they don't play nice together.2. The speakers are nice, but they all have a custom plug on the end that goes into the theatre system. So unless you get new wires, or cut these custom ends off yourself, the speakers won't plug into other receivers.Overall, this is a very nice system, especially for those of you who aren't very tech savvy. And the speakers put out nice sound, and match with my Sony Bravia TV. But if you really want to get your HD devices to play nice together, you need to buy a receiver with at least 3 HDMI in and 1 HDMI out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set","review":"These candies are a treat for toffee lovers.

Their songs have true emotion and meaning, something that is becoming increasingly rare in today's music. Every single song on this CD (and on Tip) is excellent. There are absolutely no filler songs. For the Ocean, Sick Of It All, and Broken Words are some of the best songs I've ever heard. The vocals are also amazing. The singer is truly talented, as are all the instrumentalists. This group deserves a lot more recognition. Buy the CD. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts good, then fades","review":"The 1st couple of songs are pretty good, but the CD really drops off after that.

Ive been listening to the most talented man in music , moby and I listen to Deftones and Our lady peace. I have heard comparisions between Olp and F11, first let me say OLP is a million times better than F11. The biggest problem with this cd is the TERRIBLE sounding snare drum which was asome on \\"Tip\\". I do like \\"Tip\\" after relly listening to it. And f11 are a good rock band. bye"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain mediocre","review":"Well I'm sorry, but there is nothing on this album that I havn't heard maybe 2 billion times before. Where on Earth is the creativity? What makes this band any better then the thousands of other mediocre bands that sound just like them? Nothing as far as I'm concerned. Sure these tunes are catchy, and will appeal to the young mainstream croud, but if you know anything about writing and composing music you will see how incredibly simplistic these songs are. Still, there is much worse out there, so I'll cut them a little slack and give them two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't been able to REALLY listen to it","review":"I bought this CD on a whim and couldn't wait to get home to listen to it. The problem is, it's encoded so that you can't listen to it on a computer. Seeing as I don't own a CD player anymore, I've only been able to listen to it in my car which isn't ideal. From what I can tell, it's a decent CD. I'm probably not going to buy another disc of their soley because I can't listen to it on my computer or my iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"More hardcore emo from one of Canada's finest.","review":"One of the first things that caught my attention about Finger Eleven is the way they can blend Fear Factory type riffs with Our Lady Peace type vocals, and make it sound great! For fans of Tip, you might be expecting something that follows that style. But this album is sort of a change (not that that's bad). This album focuses more on the song writing other than how the music itself sounds. Which is why this cd falls short of perfect. Sometimes they try to sound too heavy with that emo edge and it just flat out falls face down. But a lot of the songs on here should satisfy whatever mood you're in. Either way, Finger Eleven should be able to find a place in everybody's CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely Beautiful","review":"This band is Completely amazing (and I do not say that about jsut ANY Canadian band). Truely though they just mix in the best of everything. From the Amazing guitar to the beautiful sounds of Scott's voice. These guys truely do not get enough respect. Personally my favorite songs are \\"Famous\\",\\"Broken Words\\",and \\"Waiting For the Ocean\\"....personally I like the whole cd exsept for \\"Drag You Down\\" that jsut isnt them....the song is weird but I still listen to it....its almost like a good song mixed in with a bunch of other AMAZING tracks. It jsut didn't mix but other than that you should be hitting the buy button as we speak or searching it on napster enjoy this whole heartedly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Sick of it All","review":"As a long time fan, Tip certainly never wore out of my cd player, but now it just may be put back in its jewel case...for there is a better album, yes, better than Tip, The Grayest of Blue Skies offers some hard hitting songs such as Drag You Down, Suffocate, Walking in My Shoes, and Sick of it All, and is surrounded with a perfect supporting cast, including euphoric tunes like For the Ocean, and First Time...Finger Eleven's albums have a knack of having no songs to skip ahead of...when i listen to it, i have to listen all the way through....a must have, look for this album to be their breakthrough...its happening..Finger Eleven is taking over the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I find it incredible that Finger Eleven has not had mainstream success besides one track on the Scream 3 soundtrack. The band continues to pour out great metal tracks, much better than the overrated Korn or Limp Bizkit. Their music is deep, and dark with lyrics that match it perfectly. Tracks that stand out are \\"Drag You Down\\" and \\"Sick of it All\\". Great album, if you're a fan of rock or metal definitely pick Finger 11 up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken Words","review":"I bought this CD at my local music store, because I had heard they were good and the CD wasn't much expensive $14.99 CAN. Boy was that worth the money. Finger Eleven is another band that comes out straight from Canada. The Music is Really powerful full of hooks and riffs. The Singer of the band Scott Anderson has a really good voice and his voice can be heard perfectly through the loud and groovy music. He is not constantly yelling at the top of his lungs like some singers do. The guitar playing is simply amazing. There are no tracks that aren't worth listening on this 11 Track CD. My favorite Tracks are \\"First Time\\", \\"My Carousel\\" and \\"Suffocate\\". The Band even did a cover for Depeche Modes \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" Which is a very good cover, quite impressive if you ask me! Now if you excuse me I'm Off to go listen to some Finger Eleven."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first time listener to Finger Eleven","review":"This is a band I didn't know at all until purchasing this album 'The Greyest of Blue Skies' through Amazon.com whilst I was look for Filter CD's. This is a rock group undoubtedly however the band has their dark moods which is interspersed within the songs of this album release. Although this CD is quite listenable and actually after 2 or 3 times in your CD player gets enjoyable. I believe this is the band's sophmore release from 2000 and I am in the process of getting their other 2 albums. 'Finger Eleven' is a Canadian band with their own unique rock sound that fuses dark melodies with intense lyrics that are somewhat mysterious. The 11 songs on this CD are listenable and each follows on the other in a somewhat natural progression. 'Drag You Down' and 'Suffocate' are the heavier songs on this CD and my songs I most enjoyed were 'For The Ocean', 'Broken Words' and 'Bones + Joints'. Fans of nu-rock and alt rock bands should enjoy this sample from Finger Eleven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finger Elevens Best Album Yet!","review":"Not many people that live in the United States have heard of Finger Eleven. \\"Greyest of Blue Skies\\" is the groups second album, and I must say that it is groundbreaking. Finger Eleven's first album, \\"Tip\\", was also very good. There is not one track on either album that I do not like. Both albums prove themselves. Each of these albums have a different tone of music with them. The \\"Greyest of Blue Skies\\" is their best album yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as \\"Tip\\"","review":"I've only had one full listen and heard about half the songs 2-3 times, so this is a first impression. There are a few songs which I really like immediately, like \\"Sick of it All\\" and \\"Suffocate\\". This CD had a muddier, less \\"crisp\\" sound than \\"Tip\\" and is heavier overall. The songs don't flow as well as those on \\"Tip\\". While a pretty strong CD, it is considerably different than Tip. Rating: 3 stars comparing with Tip (one of my favorite CDs ever) 4 stars compared to other recent entries in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"From the day I bought this CD I still think it is one of the best CDs out there and i bought it about 2 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Finger Eleven CD","review":"The first Finger Eleven CD i listened to was their most recent one, and then i found out about Greyest of Blue Skies and once i listened to it i was hooked. It is at the very least a masterpiece and even though Scott Anderson doesn't do nearly as much screaming as he does in their newest album, i found it was still very loud and each song was full of emotions that really drew me in. So if you've heard some of their newer songs on Much music like One Thing and Thousand Mile Wish don't let these songs deter you from listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sophomore album.","review":"Finger Eleven is three albums in their career right now, and they have yet to dissapoint. This is my favorite from them. Its dark, but if you dont like evil stuff, dont be worried! This album isn't like Cradle of Filth or Dimmu Borgir or anything. If the first album you heard from them was their self-titled release \\"Finger Eleven\\" then, while this a bit different and, in a way, darker, its not like you wont notice its them. The songs are also very catchy with good lyrics, and even though they're popular in their native homeland of Canada, it still sounds much better than most of tonights generic rock clogging up radio and MTV *shudder*. I don't hate or find a single song on here boring or annoying or just plain stupid. Hopefully they'll become bigger in the United States and other countries, but they're doing decently here; and their most recent single \\"One Thing\\" is getting alot of air play. This album is short but sweet and a great record to have. So go off and get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"letdownville","review":"Started out great, but fizzled into a typical 3rd rate suspense yarn.

Once you start reading his books, you really want to read all of them. They are easy to read. Most take just over a day. They are set in areas, geographical and situational that the author seems at home with. There is a lot of mayhem and lots of bodies.The protagonist has an amazing variety of unfortunate situations to deal with; they just keep coming. There are a great many dysfunctional characters and dysfunctional relationships pictured. Mothers and mother's in law seem to be particularly lame.There always seems to be a surprise villain surfacing. \\"ABOVE SUSPICION\\" is a sequel to a much earlier book, \\"THE PARDON\\". It probably is best to read the earlier one first.I really enjoyed this book and the rest of Grippando's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This One!","review":"I have only recently began reading James Grippando's novels and my reaction has been - \\"Why haven't I heard more about this guy?\\" He is an outstanding writer who has the ability to pull you into the story he has created and makes you want to keep reading to find out how everything is going to turn out. BEYOND SUSPICION is a welcome sequel to THE PARDON. Grippando does an excellent job of presenting interesting and believeable characters whose lives twist and turn throughout a compelling story. I found BEYOND SUSPICION to be much more than just a typical legal thriller with the reader given an enjoyable reading experience. I look forward to future works by this exceptional author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book of this series, \\"the Pardon\\" and jumped into this book as soon as I had finished it. Perhaps that was a mistake as I soon became tired of Jack, the main character, being accused of another murder. The plot was good, but a little formulatic and at times confusing. This is a good book, but I suggest reading the first book and taking a break before jumping into this one. I am definitely interesting in reading the next in the series, but maybe not for another month or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Author For Me","review":"I just discovered Grippando and am very glad that I did. I really liked this book and I can say as a lawyer that his characterization of legal issues is much better (more realistic) than most writers in the genre.I won't downgrade the book for this, but I must point out: I have since read several more Grippano books and there are entire passages that seem \\"blocked and copied\\" from previous books. He likes to make fun of the work \\"interesting\\" for example, and uses the same device in several books to make his point. He also uses gratuitous references to pop culture. I get them (because of my age bracket), but it really is a lazy way to evoke a mood and will ultimately \\"date\\" his writing.Anyway, very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book-a-day Reader Gives Grippando High Marks","review":"I read a novel or biography a day, so an author's work has to be outstanding for me to remember it and ponder its characters and plot later.Grippando's Swyteck series is perfectly paced for readers who want the story to move forward rapidly instead of knowing who takes time to recline on a chaise lounge and contemplate his or her toenails. Think early Grisham on steriods - wonderfully relentless pace. His easy style is breezy, witty and believable. Result? Terrific escapism without the usual gore.I've give anything to be one of the \\"early readers\\" of his manuscripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"X41 - Prepare extra money for a replacement battery","review":"It was very frustrating me that the battery shipped along with this latop lasts only an hour without powersupply.

This one, however, was a disappointment. I forced myself to finish it.Most off-putting was the first person narrative. This could have worked OK, however, the dialogue and interaction were ineffectual and too infrequent to balance the over-abundance of introspection. This exposition provided insufficient relief from the seemingly endless narrative and resulted in a character with limited dimension that failed to evoke either empathy or engagement with the reader.I suspect Oates wrote this as an example of first person composition for her students. As an academic exercise, it probably delivered. As a novel, it was a major yawn. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's about time JCO bothered to create a new character, someone different from herself. A name for the protagonist wasn't necessary since she was Marya all over again meant to dazzle us, or somehow shock us, with her interracial relationship and her sorority tribulations. Now, the object of her affections, this Vernor, would have made a far more interesting protagonist and could be used again since we learned little about what he wanted out of life. For our protagonist, it was obvious. She needed material so she could be a writer. Lacking in plot, the book offered the usual good visualizations, but I had trouble finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum.........","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book based on the plot and the author's reputation, but after reading it I just don't think it was worth it. The character of \\"Anellia\\" was interesting but tiring. How does someone so intelligent fall in love with a man that is mentally abusive and even physically abusive towards the end? I know she had a bad childhood.....oh I guess that's it....she's emotionally damaged so of course she wouldn't fall in love with a \\"normal\\" guy. Vernor, her \\"lover\\" (but there was NO LOVE!) was drawn as a character with a pseudo-intelligence that's masqueraded as a philosophical genius of some sort but as geniuses go, he is a social misfit. Yeah, very compelling (hear my sarcasm?) He was boring and couldn't say much other than endlessly quote philosophers.

I'm sure the writing is just as beautiful and sensitive as it was in this one (and it was), but how could anyone take such gifts and use them to do things like describe first love as a disease? I felt utterly horrible the whole time I was reading this. It was depressing, without any sort of emotional reward.The character names sounded fake.I'm not saying the book was bad (the star ratings, I noticed, have to do with how much I enjoyed the book), but it takes a certain type of reader to deal with protracted melancholy. There's a certain tension that comes from a character seeing herself in a situation which she finds uncomfortable from day one, and then just staying in it until it ends horribly. This is just fair warning to people who like to actively solve problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books..","review":"I have read in a long time.

Mr Cohen firmly demonstrates his case by showing how the complexity that makes up life refutes darwin's theory of common descent.

To me, there was too much background detail and talk about Byron and Nick obviously both wanting the lead character, Miranda. The author also decided to throw in way to many other characters like the agent, the publist, the 2 other girls in the contest, the bodyguard, etc. It was distracting to the story with so many characters in the room trying to talk.

It definitely wasn't up to her usual standards; the entire element of suspense was simply not there. I'm also disappointed by the fact that this author seems to have dropped off the face of the planet so far as her books are concerned, devoting time to writing up screenplays from Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead of writing her own original books.

But my conscience didn't allow me to give a rating higher than 2 stars. Having gone through 2/3 of the book, I decided that I should not continue my reading. This book did not bring me the excitement I had when I was reading his other magnum opus. This book is about the return of two Czech emigre and what these two people, certainly a man and a woman, encounter on their native land. Kundera, as usually, mixes eroticism in his work. He also employs his usual way of constructing stories: writing about how each of the main characters thinks and feels in each one's own perspectives. But written in French, this book doesn't have the brilliance of his other books...I don't think he truly masters French as well as his own language."},{"rating":"2","title":"another persons shoes","review":"This was an account of the move from one world to another and how if affected both the person who left for a better life and those who were left behind.

The potential projects are endless, and will take you as far as your creativity will go.

Put another way a perfect breeding ground for the english character of inhibitions, repression of feelings, violence and fear of economic success riddled with Edwardian class distinctions of no value/relevance in the 50's. Jealousy of the American post war success and hide bound by genteel poverty everywhere it was not surprising that England's social scene exploded in the 60's and 70's. I left England for the US many years ago to escape the trapped kingdom of the mind and the pathetic lack of real freedoms, nostalgia is the UK's greatest industry and the more books like this that appear will help people understand that england's \\"ennui\\" is not that attractive after all !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mechanics of interacting psychologies","review":"What struck me most about this book was the meticulous detail describing the way various personalities interact.The individual features prominently here; every character has his or her own set of hopes, desires, and frustrations. It's like watching a set of machines going through their individual routines, bumping into each other and causing emergent pathologies as feed-forward loops escalate their built-in tendencies, innate or shaped by the past.The author is ruthlessly candid about her own part in these stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Item in great shape.

I expected beautiful poetry and soaring rhetoric and was not disappointed. What I didn't expect was to be so thoroughly entertained and held in suspense by the story. There were times I would shout and pound my car's steering wheel in disbelief over something Achilles said or did. (I had the cassette version.) Listening to it, as opposed to reading it, helped make the story and characters come alive for me. But I'm eager to own the book so I can revisit favorite passages from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing rarely found today","review":"Homer's Iliad, written well over 2500 years ago, stilldelights the educated reader today. It's theme is Achilleus'anger, and the results of his selfish pride on his own armyand closest friends. Homer deals with issues still aroundtoday-\\"there is nothing new under the sun\\", and his writingis like a gourmet meal compared to the macaroni and cheeseliterature of modern times. His characters are complex, hisdescriptions vivid, and his similes striking. This is requiredreading for anyone who calls himself educated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Homer","review":"Yes, it reads easily, but please do not be deceived into thinking you are reading Homer's Iliad. This is Lombardo's Iliad, and he has taken incredible liberties with the original epic. The hard Parryists-- those who would have you believe that everything in Homer is essentially derivative metrical 'filler', thus expendable, may be satisfied with this butchering of the poem, but I would rather let it stand as it has been read and appreciated for the last, oh, going on three thousand years.Lattimore's translation is still the best. It's getting a little old, and may sound a little archaic, but if you want to read what Homer wrote (and don't have years to spend studying Greek), it's the best thing widely available. Read Fitzgerald if you want, or Fagles if you must... but this version is best left on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT BOOK - AMAZON DELIVERY SUCKS","review":"Amazon should be ashamed of the confusing and complex methods needed to download this audio book to a simple Kindle.Audio books are large, but the expectation on the wireless system is that it will download in a few moments, not in hours.The secondary download system provided by their other website (why? It makes no sense to have a separate website) is even more user unfriendly.This audio book is excellent and well worth the price.But Amazon should really be ashamed of this atrocious delivery mechanism.

The storyline is kind of hard to follow, at first, but once you know the characters, it's a much smoother read. Bernard Knox's introduction was very informative and interesting.

It consisted of words that i have never heard, much less being able to pronounce them. The story line was an adventures one, but was hard to follow as i read since it was in a poem format. The scenes of death were preety interesting. The way Homer tells you specifically how each character dies is cool, but also a little disturbing. I encourage people who are into the whole greek mythology to get into this book. As for me, I don't ever want to read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard version","review":"this book was ok because of the graphic violence, and because of the killing, the greek gods and the trojan war, most of this book is hard to understand and personally i thought it was very hard to read, my teacher said it was hard for me to understand because i got the hardest version of the book, to understand the book you have to pay attention through the beggining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I really did not enjoy this book.

The age of it should have been a first clue. Really a rather boring read that is tripe with inept ideals. Homer Simpson was named after this guy but I believe that he has more insight into the subject matter than the original home boy they call Homer. Good for using to set your coffee mug on and start a fire with in the fireplace, but beyond that it is really a lot of rubbish.

You pay full price for production quality that compares to the free project Gutenberg downloads.Buy the book. Better yet, buy Lattimore's translation for the Kindle, which at least has line numbers, though it also lacks links to the end-notes.Are the publishers trying to condition us to diminished expectations?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly epic and surprisingly touching poem","review":"I was expecting gory battles and elaborate similes, and this delivered on both counts. Yet there are also some fascinating characters here. Hector and Achilles, despite their near-unbelievable prowess on the battlefield, are so very human. Hector's final goodbye to his family at the end of Book VI and the confrontation between Priam (Hector's father) and Achilles at the end are the two best scenes in the whole poem, IMHO, because they show the human vulnerability that still exists in both characters.

The translation is a good one, and is very poetic yet easy to read. The verse form has been maintained and reminds the reader that this was originally a verse, not a prose narrative.

It is lyrical and accessible. You will be amazed at Homer's insights into the western male ego's characteristic attempt to balance fragile vulnerability with \\"overweening pride.\\" Homer shows us the shame of violence that constitutes the tragic foundation of Western Culture - the overwhelming sense of mortality that overshadows our deep passion for life.

One of the most exciting and heroic stories is cut from the reading: the night raid by Odysseus and Diomedes. Although the reading is well done, the absence of so much of the poem destroys the original intent. Pass on this one.Also, Penguin Press is misleading in that Jakobi is not the sole reader. There is a woman who reads as well. It sounds like this one was pieced together. A shoddy job really."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Translation To Read Out Loud","review":"I own two copies of The Iliad. I own the Lattimore translation for study, and the Fagles translation for love of the story.Translating ancient Greek is tough work. The author must constantly fight the battle to match the *meaning* of the original and the *feel* of the original in a language built for a very different culture and time.Lattimore was invaluable when I was translating passages myself for college. He comes closest to writing ancient Greek in clear English. But when I want to lose myself in the story and action and feel myself swept away by the rage of Achilles, I reach for Fagles. He, more than any other translator I have read, carries the pace and force of the original Homeric Greek in an English that breathes life into the work without calling attention to itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good translation","review":"Out of the various translations I've read of the Illiad (Fagles, Lattimore, Butler, Lombardi, Pope) Fitzgerald's does the best job at sucking me in and making me forget I'm reading and just flow along with the story. I also like how Fitzgerald uses what I assume are the Greek forms of the names such as Aias instead of Ajax and Akhilleus instead of Achilles. The language and layout of the poetry also adds a historical feel to it all. While this is a modern English translation that doesn't try to replicate the actual rythems of the Greek original, it makes me feel I'm reading an epic where other translations seem to be just a poem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow along with a book","review":"My daughter is listening to this while she is reading from the Homer, Iliad translated by Robert Fangles and she is totally upset that so much is skipped and it isn't labled will, so it is very difficult to follow along with a book.

I read Richmond Lattimore's translation about thirty years ago and what mainly stuck in my mind were phrases like \\"rosy fingered dawn\\" and the \\"wine dark sea\\" etc., and my reading as whole had a feeling of cultural duty about it. Stanley Lombardo's translation is a different story. Since I bought it, I'm having a hard time putting it down. Reading this Iliad is truly reading for pleasure. If you've never read the Iliad, this translation is a great place to start. If you've read other Iliads before, don't ignore this one. It's a tremendous experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best book I have ever read.","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The book also presents a good collection of printed material, like photographs and fac-similes, that gives the reader a lot of visual information and an extremely pleasant time.

In this subject the book contains the most detailed information about the automatic instruments I've ever seen.

There are really only two good songs, Safe European Home and English Civil War (the live version of which is much better than this one) and a load of mediocre to awful ones.But this was a transitonal album and it was on the tour for Give 'Em Enough Rope that _London Calling_ was born, so one can't complain too much.For Die-hard Clash fans, this is, of course essential. But for everyone else, skip it and buy the Boxed set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STURM & DRANG","review":"Besides Sandinista and this one, I've never owned another Clash album, but this one cooks up a storm. It certainly doesn't lack energy and good songs. I suspect the production on the other albums was rawer but I certainly don't find it \\"tepid\\" as in the editorial review above. My favorite tracks are Safe European Home, about a visit to Jamaica (great urgency and I love the heavy metal reggae rhythm), Tommy Gun, Julie's Been Working For The Drug Squad, Guns On The Roof and Drug-Stabbing Time. This is real passionate punk-rock at its best and will also be enjoyed by those who love more mainstream hard rock. A winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"the clash fall just short of perfection","review":"Many of the tracks on \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope\\" are true punk classics. Tommy Gun, Drug-Stabbing Time, English Civil War, and Safe European Homes are all powerful commentary on 1970s politics, not to mention powerful, intelligent songs. Julie's in the Drug Squad is an entertaining change of pace and Stay Free, despite how close it gets to being poppy (if it had a chorus, I think it could have been a hit), is possibly my favorite Clash song. However, I must say that the rest of the album, while still good, is not as explosive as the songs previously mentioned. Those remaining songs lack that special something that makes me sit up and take notice of most Clash songs. But, in a time when record companies were molding \\"punk\\" to be the next big moneymaking deal, the Clash showed how strong and rebellious punk could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, even not their best","review":"Give 'em enough rope isn't Clash's best album, but it's very good, maybe even etter than first album! First I thought it wasn't so good, but then I listened it.. Totally awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit messy, but still good","review":"Yes, \\"Safe European Home\\" sports one of the most jaw-dropping, monstrous, head-stompingly powerful riffs ever written, but the rest of this album is powerful but *muddled* - the band's messy punk fury worked beautifully on \\"The Clash\\" but on this record they expand their sound without refocusing their energy, and that makes the five-minute length of some of these songs a bit inappropriate. The album is sarcastic (a plus) but too short (a minus) -- this is proto-London Calling."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their greatest works","review":"While there is constant debating among Combat Rock, The Clash's first album, and London Calling over which is the Clash's best album, I cant help but feel that this album has been given some what of a raw deal. Its style is very much true to the punk rock roots, while at the same time its very distinct form their first album. I personally have a hard time deciding which Clash album is my favorite, but this deffinetely belongs in the top three. That is next London Calling and The Clash. This is deffinetely an underrated album.RIP Joe Strummer"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks!","review":"I got that one for xmas! It is so cool but everyone hates them! why?

I plugged all three units into live AC receptacles andlet them charge for a week. The dim green 'power on' indicator was lighted on all three units. Today, I decided is was time to see if they worked.Only ONE OF THE THREE units alarmed and provided light from the three LEDs. The OTHER TWO units did not work at all!I purchased them from one of the sellers here on amazon.com. Today, I called the seller and they promised to ship out two replacement units.They do not require that I send the defective units back. I like the fact that the AC Power prongs do not fold.

Very nice support.I tested the alarm volume and came up with 82db at pint blank. That is loud enough to wake most people if it is in the same room with them. It does not project well as the volume dropped to 70db only eight feet away. It is unlikely you will hear this through any walls or doors.I am using it in my garage where a GFI keeps tripping.

I bought this book in hopes of another masterful legal thriller and all I got was a tale of boring characters muddled with 60's.

I wanted to return it for a refund but was so angered I needed to destroy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoring and disappointing","review":"I have to admit that I listened to the audio version first, then for what I have yet to determine reason, I punished myself with the book. I was so disappointed. A waste of time. I had eagerly awaited the tapes for a cross country motoring trip. I had to listen to it on a personal cassette player or wear earphones when I used the builtin player because my husband thought it was so boring he couldn't drive and stay awake! I had trouble as well listening to the tapes and reading the book! I finally got through it, but I think it was mostly because we were on vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy, dull","review":"I agree with others who find this over-written.

I too was seduced by the outrageous comparision to \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" and \\"The Big Chill, both of which I thought were great entertainment. This book no way compares to either of those books. I liked Turrows early novels. Sometimes an author who is successful just get \\"too full of himself\\" and fails to reach out to his readers. I am just glad I picked this book up in a used book sale for half-priced. At least I didn't waste too much money on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Basic Mystery Book","review":"People looking for a page-turning thriller like early Turow or Grisham may be disappointed in this effort. But those looking for a more complex novel will be deeply rewarded by Turow's examination of relationships, history, and the inner workings of the story's 3 main characters. I found his development of Sonia to be skillful and wonderful to watch. I was very pleasantly surprised by Turow's insight into the human heart and psyche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it... a snoozer","review":"This is definately not one of Turow's best books. I have enjoyed many of his others, but this one gets lost between the present day (mid-90's) and the 60's. I know he was trying to set the sage for the present day story with background of the characters relationships in a different time and place, but the reader gets lost in too much detail and extraneous information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going nowhere... excrutiatingly slowly","review":"This was the most boring book that I've ever read, bar none, and I've read a lot of boring books. The only remotely interesting chapter is the first one and from that point the 'novel' (loosely used word) spirals downward until the final few chapters which (in the case of the italicized chapters) are literally unreadable. Other reviewers have talked about this being 'literary fiction'. Apparently if it's really boring, uninteresting, not exciting and oh, reduntantly written, it must be literature. BAD BOOK! BAD BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Turow's worst, by far.","review":"Avoid this one. It's good for a cold,winter evening but only as a fire-starter.Laws of Our Fathers starts out with a bang, then becomes a slow and boooooring rehash of all that was bad about the sixties. That I finished it at all speaks more to my stubborn heritage than Mr. Turow's writing. I probably won't even read his next one - quite a comedown, considering Scott Turow was one of my all-time favorite writers.Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel about people who miss the 60's","review":"Attracted by Turow's other legal thrillers, I undertook this massive tome with optimism. His technique was to alternate chapters about a current, intriguing murder case, and flashbacks to the main characters' life in the 60's - they have miraculously all been reunited in the current courtroom drama. I found myself bored to tears about the flashbacks, awaiting the legal case to resume. If you miss the 60's and the campus unrest of the time, you may enjoy this. I found myself bored and irritated with almost all the characters; I kept waiting for something profound to be revealed, but it never happened. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't bother finishing it.","review":"The author tries to put himself into the characters by talking like them (speaking in jive and street for the brothers) whenever they're in conversation. It makes the book hard to read and follow when he jumps back and forth from one to the other. And Scott, white boys are incapable of speaking street, (there is a survival element ingrained that a pale man in America will never know) so you failed miserably (don't start wearing your hat backwards).. I just wish there where a return policy with Kindle.. I like all of Scott Turow's other books, so this one was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and long and boring","review":"This is one long, long never-ending story - which has some elements of thriller and courtroom drama - boring for my taste. There are too many flash-backs embedded in the main story-line; difficult to keep track of time or the main story as you skip the pages. Excessive is the word I would use to describe plots and sub-plots of this book. Skips chapters when you feel that the chapters don't go anywhere!Don't buy and don't read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BOOK!","review":"I liked an earlier Turow book, but this one is terrible. Sections are written in a phoenetic ghetto slang that I had to read aloud to understand. Turow filled the book with so much past history of the characters that he forgot to get on with the story. It significantly diluted the plot and left me not just empty, but annoyed. Skip this thing and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gave me a headache!","review":"This is definately not Turow's best novel, I loved Burden of Proof and Presumed Innocent, but found this one to be long, and slow to progress and confusing with all of the jumps from past to present.

I ordered this volume from a book company in Pennsylvania which obtains volumes from libraries, etc, to sell at a discount. I managed to get through 170 pages before calling it quits. Turow has written an excruciatingly boring volume, full of dull characters and a plot which is as exciting as watching chrome rust! The sixties scene has been done to death, enough already, the judge is poorly written, the other characters arouse little more interest than a funeral. Turow has made the same mistake John LeCarre made-getting so full of himself he thinks he can do no wrong. Le Carre has basically written sludge the last few books. After trying to get through Laws of Our Fathers, it looks like Turow has joined him. I don't think I'll read Turow again. A sad waste of what seemed a really promising talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer Drudgery","review":"I'd never read Turow before, but I selected this book because it was on the best sellers' list. What a mistake! The plot, so long to develop, is incredibly resolved in an instant to tie up loose ends. Turow's use of language reminded me of a high school English student who uses \\"big\\" words to impress and nothing else. It is unlikely I'll read another of his books. It took all my effort and patience to finish this novel, but I did it! I survived!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I agree with most of what's already here--that is, with the reviews that gave it less than a 5. I wanted to add this: It's the only book I've ever read that I put down with 10 pages ago and didn't care to pick it up for about a week. Finally I finished it just to get it off of my bedside table. For a Turow book, this is amazing. I just didn't care at all what happened to these people. I feel like an idot for wasting my time. Perhaps if 200 pages were cut out of the book it could have been something. Maybe the novelization of the movie script?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding, ridiculous, uninteresting, unreadable.","review":"After plodding through the gibberish of the first chapter, I was astonished about the confusing and unintersesting pages that followed.

I liked Presumed Innocent, and the book jacket showed promise. This guy is like many initially successful authors. They become full of themselves.

I'm surprised I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch 'Thirty-something\\" reruns instead","review":"My wife warned me. She said not to waste my time but having loved all of Turow's previous novels I sallied forth anyway. Being a child of the 60's, I was intrigued by the book's premise.How do children of that time cope with adult life? All I got was a bunch of whining similar to the recent series Thirtysomething except not as interesting. This book is too long, there is not enough story, and has unsympathetic characters. Unless your literary forte is characterization only, don't waste your time with this book.How can someone who wrote something as fresh as Presumed Innocent produce this drivel? If you want to gove Turow a try, try any of his earlier works! This one will scare you away from him permanently!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great build-up, poor finish","review":"The story builds well with a fascinating court case, sprinkled with flashbacks to the main characters in their early years.

Don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book, but reading it was a chore","review":"There's probably a good 300-page book hidden somewhere in this bloated 500-page tome. The idea of reconciling crimes and causes of the past with those of the present is an interesting one, there are some clever plot twists and the flashback scenes are fun. But every time the story switches to the present, boy, do things begin to drag. The characters bear little resemblence to their former selves, and it is hard to work up much concern about what happens to them. They tend to drone on and whine about themselves for pages and pages and pages. When the end finally comes, you're just glad to be rid of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"SCOTT, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!?!","review":"This is one of the worst books that I have ever read.

There are very, very few books which I just refuse to waste my time finishing. This was one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Mr. Turow is obviously trying to be a 'serious' writer. In my opinion, he fails at linking the children of the past to the parents of the present as he intends. He takes a core story line that would be mildly interesting as a short story and drags it out for 800 pages. Neither depictions of student life in the 60s or inner cities of today ring true. To add insult to injury, 50 pages near the end of the book are printed in italics. As far as I can tell, the only purpose being to increase my headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters I did not care about","review":"I started this book in August and by the 4th of November when it was still on the table next to me half-read I realized that the reason I couldn't finish it was because I didn't like the characters and really didn't care what happened to them. I then did something I never can remember doing before. I threw the book away. I just didn't want to inflict it on anyone else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read these comments before I bought the book!","review":"Amen to those who thought this was overwritten. Was it a mystery, a social commentary on the 60's, or a love story? Turow tried to juggle all three and none of it was strong enough to keep me interested for over 800 pages. One of those books you get half way through and wonder if you should just give it up. By the final page you know you should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the first 1/2 of the book is boring","review":"I got to around page 260 and found I was bored by this book. I did not particularly like or dislike any of the characters, and the story line was meaningless to me. I skipped forward a couple of hundred pages, and it was still the same old same old. I quit. I have enjoyed Turow's other books, but I will not run out to buy his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to read and what to skip","review":"If you have glanced at the other reviews, you know that the main problem with this novel is that it mixes good court drama with endless and boring reminiscences about the 1960's.To actually enjoy the novel instead of dying of boredom, read the chapters where the characters are at court. Skip everything else, except, at the end, \\"Summer 1995 - NILE\\" and pages 813 through 817.The court drama is actually quite good, IMHO. The tricks of the sneaky defense lawyer are very interesting and quite enjoyable.Four stars for the court drama, zero stars for everything else. Average result: Two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and complete","review":"This is a book not for the timid-hearted nor the shallow Grisham-lover. Despite overromanticizing the sixties (especially when the seventies generation deserves the credit anyway), Turow weaves of masterful tale of personal and criminal intrique. He traverses through racial, gender, and generational barriers with great skill and leaves any reader over 30 wondering about life, relationships, ethics, and weakness. Not a modern classic, but give Turow credit, it is a step in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turow's best yet!","review":"Excellent reading for Turow fans.

Yes the characterization and dialogue are first rate, but the work as a whole failed to capture my interest.

I am glad that I listened to it on tape rather then taking the time to read it. I lost intrest at the pivital point of the book (won't say and spoil it for the people who have not read it) and just never got drawn back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst work by so far he can't even see it.","review":"I have read all of his books and enjoyed them. This book, however, is so boring I can't believe anyone would compare him to Grisham. He has continually gone downhill since Presumed Innocence, although the others were at least entertaining. This was so bad I don't believe I can ever read another book by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck was that all about?","review":"I've read all his books, and this was a major disappointment. I got the feeling he was trying to saysomething, like look what we were like in the 60's and look how far we've come. And? It would have been more effectiveas two books, one about the 60's and one about a murder in the 90's. It just sort of petered out at the end. Such bad food and such large portions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed A Better Editor","review":"I think the author was trying to fit two books into one here, a view of the 60's race relations and a legal thriller. Becuase of that I think the thriller got a little crowed out. I have no issue with the story line and some of the detail, but I thought it took more away from the book then it added. He is known for writing tight, suspenseful legal thrillers, great fiction that you can sink your teeth into. The subtle preaching of societies wrongs also left a bad taste in my mouth, I am looking for fiction when I pick on of his books up. On the other hand he is a good author who writes in a somewhat complex way so that you have to pay attention. This is not the McBook of Grisham, but a deeper telling of a story. He has put out much better books in the past and I would suggest starting with them before taking on this beast of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This audiobook was a huge disappointment! Boring, boring!","review":"I am a Scott Turow fan - at least I used to be. This book made me so angry, I fast-forwarded through the last 30 minutes or so and threw the tapes into the nearest dumpster. A dumpster is where it belongs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A grueling bore","review":"The story is a mind numbing journey from present to past and back again, featuring characters that I just couldn't muster any interest or sympathy for. I don't recall reading a story that was so completely filled with selfish jerks. Reading this made me feel that I'd died and gone to hell. It's like being stuck in a DMV waiting room on a hot day with no AC and the only empty seat is between Ms. Nosepick and Mr. Pitstains. I can't imagine anyone but the most devoted Turow fan finding this anything but dull from beginning to end. I could, however, be wrong. After all, there are fishing shows on tv, and you can watch Spam decompose on the internet...if you want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"I have read Scott Turow before and had high expectations of a great read. Presumed Innocent was a 5 star mystery and unputdownable. This boring book took me twice as long to finish and failed my expectations miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"It ain't rock, but that's okay...","review":"I've heard other people say that the Move's last album, \\"Message From the Country\\", is really the first ELO album. Not if you listen to this. Other than \\"10538 Overture\\", you'll be hard-pressed to find an electric guitar on the album (okay, CD...) I hear no similarity between this and \\"Message From the Country\\".This is a moody little set of tunes, filled out by Roy Wood, sawing away at cello and viola. Gone are some of Wood's shrill attempts at vocal acrobatics that had a tendency to sabotage his efforts with the Move. He's toned down quite a bit here.When I say moody, I mean it. There are no light pop songs to be found. An almost gothic atmosphere pervades most of the CD. The one major exception would have to be \\"First Movement,\\" which is uncomfortably reminiscent of \\"Classical Gas\\".A melancholy mood for a Victorian drawing room... and yet somehow satisfying and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AMBITIOUS DEBUT . . .","review":"Half the album is composed by Roy Wood, the other half by Jeff Lynne. In general, Lynne's songs tend to be more expansive and rock-oriented; Wood's songs are more intimate and chamber-like. Lynne's most interesting song is probably \\"Nellie Takes Her Bow\\", which sounds like a precursor of many ELO ballads to come (with the notable exception of a rather bizarre instrumental passage). While Wood's purely instrumental writing is even more archaic, his songwriting-particularly on \\"Whisper in the Night\\"-ranks among the finest of this era; it is a pity he departed the group shortly after this album was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish all ELO albums were like this one","review":"ELO was my favorite band as a pre-teen and No Answer was my least favorite album. 20 years later, this is the only ELO album that I think is worth listening to ( though sometimes I will take a peak at their second or third album ). Their other stuff is too pop, and most of the stuff after their Eldorado album is dreadful. If you are an ELO fan, you probably should NOT buy this one.On the otherhand, I prefer this album over the Move's work. The Move was a little too ecclectic for my taste and I have to run for the \\"next\\" button on my player too often.No Answer is a solid, well-done project where virtually every track is a home run and stands the test of time. Don't get me wrong; this is no where close to being as good as even a mediocre Beatles disc. But I am betting that there are a lot of people like me who still find it fresh after 20 years of listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hate to do this fella's","review":"I hate to bring down an average like this, but my opinion is just as valid.Why do YOU like ELO? The sassy pop? The layered vocals? The hooks? The futuristic themes? The out of this world vibe that can only be hand delivered to your heart via the great Jeff Lynne? If you answered YES to these questions, you too should stay away from this cd. Perhaps come back to it after you have purchased all others and have money to throw away.Ok, there is one great song. The song \\"10538 Overture\\". However, I already had that on a compilation making this cd a near total loss. Queen of the Hours is almost good.I do realise that this disc is \\"pre ELO\\" in a sense, being that Jeff's vision isn't quite in place and is shared with Mr. Woods, however, that doesn't make this any more bearable to actually listen to. I still do not understand why Overture turned out the way it did and all the rest just didn't even come close to that quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book about Veitnam you will ever read.","review":"I read the first two books and gave them away no I want to buy them but they are out of stock. They have a good plot. I would recomend this book to anybody who wants to learn about war and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helps put life in a clear light.","review":"I have this book on tape. The voice takes a little getting use to but after that it is a great little tape. The author is simple and easy to understand. It tells how to deal with life good and bad and how to be closer with God. The tape helps us to remember that life only has to be lived one day at a time and tells us how to get the most of each day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats the fuss?","review":"I thought this movie was boring. Not going to go in depth of the synopsis, as morgoth has highlighted that in his review. Yeah there's action and training scenes but the story was weak. I was not the least bit drawn into the movie nor the main lead. Dont get me wrong, Cliff Lok can move and is very agile. I liked the interviews in the extra section more than I liked the movie, if that should tell you something. Even if the picture was better or if the subs were redone and not burnt in, I dont think this movie could have improved. Ko Fei couldn't save this flick for me either. This is among the least of my favorite Rarescope releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliff Lok and Phillip Ko go for a rematch","review":"Choi Lee Fut was released in 1979 and is directed and action choreographed by Chan Siu Pang(Shaolin Death Squad,Interpol, Rivals of the Silver Fox).The cast includes Cliff Lok Kam Tung(Ring of Death,Kung Fu Genius),Phillip Ko Fei(Angel on Fire,Just Heroes,Shaolin Intruders,Loot),Sharon Yeung Pan Pan(Deadly Target,Lion Vs Lion),Lam Kau(Drunken Master,Bells of Death),Chung Wing(Protector,Lady Assassin)Phillip Ko is once again the villain.He is ruthless,shows no mercy,kills his opponents,has a long braid that he uses on his victims to choke them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like music from a kindergarten","review":"The music is done too straight-up.

The original was a classic for any serious student. If you are a casual reader of Joel, then this book will be fine for you.

By the time it arrived my class had already covered a lot of stuff that I had a real hard time to catch up with.This super saver shipping really sucks! It takes as many as 5-6 days for amazon to get the item out if one chooses super saver shipping. This makes no sense.

T-Rock is just on another level.."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a way to sweat!","review":"I borrowed this DVD from a neighbor. I enjoyed it so much I ordered my own copy. I was not familiar with bhangra but found the steps quite similiar to hip hop or african dance moves. It was pretty easy to follow. Although its a bit repetitive, this DVD is a nice change of pace from the traditional cardio workouts. It gets the blood pumping and you'll definitely work up a sweat. I was drenched by the end of the workout. The only complaint I have is that the dance steps aren't truly in sync with the music. Its a little annoying for those of us with rhythm."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite videos","review":"Ever since the first time I did the Masala Bhangra workout I was hooked. It's so different than anything else, and it's so much fun. This video is good for beginners. My mother-in-law has a bad back and knees and she could do all the moves without pain. Jain is very energetic, but she doesn't give you much time to learn the moves. Don't give up - you'll catch on after doing the video a couple of times. The reason I only gave this video 4 stars is because her timing is off for most of the video. The moves don't go with the beat, and it made me a little crazy when I was first starting to learn it. I never dred doing this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed it.","review":"I enjoyed this workout. You are moving continually and the moves aren't too hard. Can't wait to try some of Sarina Jain's other workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I expected to have a great \\"hip hop\\" style workout from this DVD, but I don't get that.

Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bhangra","review":"I did not like this one nearly as much as I liked Volume 1. Some of the moves in this video were already covered in the first one and in her All-Star Workouts routine (which I wish was also available on DVD). Additionally, the production quality was not as good as it should have been. I will be getting Volume 3 eventually, however, because I am interested in learning as much Bhangra as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout and fun!","review":"I'm really enjoying this exercise DVD. It does give you a workout but allows you to pace yourself. It's fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beat?","review":"I've had this DVD about a year and a half now, but have never been able to get into it because of the issue I have reconciling the instructions and music with my steps. I never had a problem with coordination, but this workout gives me such a complex that I usually end up marching to the beat. Would not be my first choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thirteen mysteries","review":"Miss Marple and friends gather to talk about mysteries. Each tells of a mystery personally known to them - leaving out the answer as to who was responsible for the crime. The friends each then have to try and work out who did it. Naturally Miss Marple excels at this sort of thing though ex-commissioner of Scotland Yard, Sir Henry runs her a pretty close second.These are intriguing stories which include all sorts of crimes not just murder. All are well plotted and well written with believable characters. The clues are there for the observant reader but most will fail to arrive at the correct conclusion. I only managed to solve one of them before the answer was revealed. Marvellous comfort reading which will transport you to a different era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....","review":"I guess...it is said that meeting ones hero and then learning what they are REALLY about can change ones life...for the good....or not.

He never really outright says bad things about her himself. But quotes various social figures who bad mouth her for him. Basically it seems that Slim and Blass were a 'couple' for sometime, and that on a vacation together, Slim has a plan to talk marriage with Blass. When he senses this, he just left the vacation home without telling her.I feel bad for Slim. Judging from all these New York socilites' terrible words on her, she must had a lonely social life at the end when she became a single girl. She had her faults, but she was an unique American character: with Extraordinary look and sense of style unlike any others. She also had warmth and coziness that was unique to her.Judging from just this episode alone, I don't think Bill Blass was a gentleman."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding and insightful book for dads.

After interviewing 1,500 kids Doug Webster tallies the answers to three basic questions and the cry of the hearts of children can't be misunderstood - \\"Dad, please be with me\\" \\"Don't hurt me\\" \\"Listen to me\\", etc. I was humbled by the notes kids wrote their dads seeing myself in many of them. I was also greatly encouraged as Doug Webster has concrete, practical solutions to the entire range of difficulties dads and children have. This book has already made a dramatic difference in my life and in the lives of my (5) children. A great and greatly useful book. No dad would be unchanged after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book can change your relationship with your dad.","review":"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my dad. Although I am grown, it still says the things that I have always wanted to tell him. The author interviewed children who were candid in their search for their father's love and acceptance. He presented their answers in a sensitive and non-threatening way. After my father finished the book, I received the first hug from him in over twenty years. This book expressed the words that I could never say to my dad, and maybe now we can start our relationship over."},{"rating":"2","title":"well suited for a beginner","review":"Middlebrook writes in a deliberately breezy and informal style that is characteristic of the Dummies series. He explains the very latest 2006 version of AutoCAD. Necessarily, in an introductory book, he does not go very deep into the full extent of AutoCAD. But given just a minimal maths background on your part, you should be able to quickly lay out simple two and three dimensional objects using his advice. That maths mostly involves a good grasp of trigonometry and algebra.If you are already familiar with the 2005 or earlier recent versions of AutoCAD, then avoid this book.

Even Caleb Carr's somewhat lackluster Holmes novel is a more valid effort than this one. Masterpiece? No, sorry. However, if one reads this novel without any knowledge of Holmes, Watson, the Conan Doyle canon, or the handful of fine Sherlock pastiches that are out there, it probably wouldn't be so bad. Otherwise, you'd be better served to engage yourself in Laurie R.

The book doesn't even include the whole Tao Te Ching for reflection, just bits and pieces, which seems silly for such a small bit of text in the first place.I walked away from this book with the same feeling as I did after reading Covey's 7 habits. I feel Autry set out with an idea and found bits of the Tao to fit his ideas, just as I feel Covey started with the Seven Habits and found business examples to fit the idea.

Your face will be very sore. It took me 10 years before I got another straight razor shave, and I hated it as much as the first time. I'll never get another. However, this oil product made the shave tolerable, and it makes daily shaving fantastic. This combined with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave. It's amazing how soft your skin feels afterward. Buy the oil and the moisturizing aftershave, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just castor oil and olive oil...cheap & easy to make your own!","review":"I love this stuff...I don't even need shaving foam on top of this, just use this on my face and shave. It's the best shave I've ever had. But $22 is absurd, since the ingredients are simply castor oil (about $10 for a pint) and olive oil (similar price), plus some scenting ingredient which is wholly unnecessary. I made my own, using the old Art of Shaving glass bottle...it's exactly the same for about $1 a bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price!","review":"Its ok but definitely not worth buying because of the price.It does not do anything awesome to your face before shaving.

You can see from the other reviews that you can MAKE this stuff for pennies! Don't be fooled by fancy packaging and retail stores in upscale malls. It's clear that the EMPEROR has NO clothes. These guys would do fine if they cut their prices by 80%, but until then, don't waste your money.

After I used the three products (pre shave oil, shaving cream, and after shave) my skin felt amazing and I had a really close shave. I usually don't shave on the weekend because shaving during the week is hard on my face even with changing razor blades frequently.

It demonstrates that successful political leaders in war are ones who 'lead' the military ones rather than simply hire generals. Even if a leader is inexperience in military operations, they can be successful if they study war and ask questions, and challenge assumptions. This mode of operation extends to other fields even in sport management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a well thought out book.","review":"The writer tries to generalize from the experience of four great statesmen in war times to make a conclusion that politicians should tell generals what to do!I think this book is political biased.Say if I was to reverse the equation and generalize from the experience of four great generals to make a conclusion that generals should tell statesmen what to do! Would the writer agree with me?I could also write a few essays where democratic leaders just left his military leaders to do their job and the military leaders did a very good job eg prime minister Eshkol of Israel in the six day war and the Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indian Gandhi in December 1971 in the Indian Pakistan war. Is the conclusion now that statesmen should stay out of the actual war.Also I should stress is that most people are not *great*. To try to generalize from a few great men is a very dangerous experience.

However, I unfortunately found out, in the subsequent chapter, that Cohen's REAL purpose was an end-around to attack American leadership during Vietnam (and, to a lesser extent, the Gulf War). For a book that focuses on leaders from England, France, and Israel, as well as the US, this struck me as a non-sequitor out of left field.I do recommend purchasing this book. However, do NOT continue reading beyond the Ben Gurion chapter. You will become disappointed with your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good yarn","review":"I just read this book. Ten years ago, I traveled in the area of China that is covered in the book. However, I have no experience with adopting a Chinese child.I did not read the slip cover material, and I read this story as being mainly fiction, but a fiction built upon the rich and varied texture of a great, complex people and nation. As noted by others, even the smells of China make it into the story in a way that is real to those of us who've been there.There is no question that there are some flaws in the reach and premise of the story, but it grabbed me, and it surprised me, and I enjoyed it immensely as a superior work of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"China Run by David Ball","review":"If China Run was not ever on the New York Times Bestseller list, It should have been!

I was lucky enough to secure a copy of this book on tape. I couldn't stop listening! Always being extremely interested in anything Asian, I was thrilled with the descriptions of the villages, the fishermen, the Yangtse, the country doctor, the villages in the mountains shrouded in fog and rain and the temple. I heard so much Chinese spoken, it just rang wonderfully in my ears. The characters are believeable, you care and fall in love with them. When Ruth Pollard lost her \\"Wee Duck\\" I had to pull over and stop tape to cry. I love the new relationship that forms between Allison and Tyler, I have one chapter to go and wanted to review the book while it was still fresh in my mind. I only hope the ending is as exciting as the book has been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and racist","review":"As an adoptive parent of two children born in China, I personally find it absurb that this book was ever published.I picked it up in our local library, couldn't believe it could possibly be about what it seemed to be, and had to skim it to be certain I wasn't having a bad dream.It's racist, just depolorable. But, worse, it paints an inaccurate of the adoption process in China, possibly dissuading parents from looking into China as an adoption alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author should have researched Chinese adoption first","review":"This book misrepresents Chinese adoption beyond recognition. As a parent of a daughter adopted from China, I have found the Chinese government to be reliable and predictable. The situation described in this book is ridiculous and offensive. Perhaps Mr. Ball wanted to seem contemporary by seizing on the current trend of international adoption. His ignorance of the subject is staggering."},{"rating":"2","title":"China Run","review":"I loved China Run! I've never traveled to China, or adopted a baby.

This movie is horrible. As one commenter stated the pot of this movie was ridiculous! It was full of stereotypes and asinine clichés. The black women were portrayed as loud, manipulative, and vindictive while the white woman was portrayed as meek, too understanding, and easy to control. This movie was predictable and undeveloped.I actually like the actors and actresses but they could do nothing for the poorly developed script and the script did nothing for showcasing their talent.I'm giving it two stars because it did entertain me during my time of restlessness and Marcus looked great shirtless."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this?","review":"This movie started off with a lot of potential.

Then Viv's in a coma and two years later, she's a conniving, evil little bitch who sabotages a pregnant woman's life as well as her child's for the sake of 'true love'.What is this? What kind of movie is this? What kind of message are you sending along here to black women? Especially that Marcus' pregnant wife is white and Vivian and her friend constantly talk about 'white bitches', 'white slut', 'rich white Daddy's girl', come on! There was a stellar cast and a plot with a great starting point and it went this way? Please.BET, please, raise the standards.

Terrible editing transitions and camera angles.3. Breaks in continuity and awful, AWFUL \\"acting\\".I normally don't even do reviews on Amazon, but I had to comment on this terrible film. I don't mind being called a hater if that's what you think, but this movie earned every single word of this review. If you don't believe me, watch it for yourself.P.S. I didn't want to give it any stars but Amazon wouldn't accept my review if it were any less..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Plot","review":"This movie looked like it would fun. However, this movie has the most ridiculous plot I have ever seen. The premise for this movie and why Marcus is married to two women is ludicrous. The writers must think the viewer has no intelligence and that this can happen in real life. Without giving away the plot, there is no possible way that you would ask to turn off life support for a loved one and then just walk away. What about the paperwork required to turn off life support? What about a funeral? This movie didn't address these things and instead choose to jump two years after the accident. Absolutely ridiculous!!! That is why I turned this movie off after the first 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"The idea is right but the script could have used a little work. Rich girls are usually smart and know what not to do during pregnancy. April plays a dumb \\"white girl\\" yet has smart moments where she catches on to what the first wife was doing. The argument in the kitchen could have been better from Aprils side. After all the woman tried to kill her baby!Ending was terrible. Bottomline is a happy marriage and a family is split up because of the selfishness of the first (and seemingly dead) wife.

However, the lines are cheap and naive and the actors' play is so-so. Like some other ppl said, the script is jumpy and kinda unrealistic. However, I liked the fact that the end was real. If something else happened, it would have been made-believe. I don't know, maybe Marcus wanted to try how it is with the white girl, but deep in his heart was still bonded to his first wife. Which is kinda controversial, because if he really loved her, he wouldn't have just forgot about her. Anyways... good idea, but bad execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Movie was great, a big fan of black films, Marcus Patrick is SEXY!!!!!! n April was cute too....The girl did not die, she stated her and the girl are good friends now, the little girl was just at her daughter birthday party, and plus its obvious marcus was in love with april, so they ended up together....great movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worse!!!","review":"The story had potential..but the roles were stereotypical and the characters were all over the place.

Any woman who ever had her heart broken or any man who ever messed up can relate to this movie. Vivian was a little devil but played the hell out of her part.

She is so annoying...not at all like the CINDY DVD","review":"So I fell in love with the excercises and mellow workouts on the Cindy Crawford video with Kathy Kaehler. I've been using it for a year and finally felt like I was ready to move on. I thought that the success of the Cindy video was due to Kathy but apparently that isn't so.This video has horrible music, pretty much the same excercises as the Cindy workout and oh yeah...have you seen Kathy's arms? There bigger than The Rock's. She's jacked...no thanks. So disapointed. I guess I'll stick with Cindy and the non-annoying Kathy. What's odd is she never had an accent in the other workout...maybe it came with the giant arms. :-( I guess the workout is alright if you can stand to look at her and put it on mute. There has to be something better out there than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Fitness Workout","review":"I really enjoyed the part I was able to do which was around 30 minutes of the DVD, then as soon as the last part of the program begins, the DVD freezes.

The segments are 5 minutes each and hit all of the trouble spots....arms, legs, abs, butt and cardio. They are simple and can be done in your own home with the only need being a couple of weights. I first saw and taped a week long 5 minute series of exercises by Kathy Kaehler featured on the Today show, which I used religiously until my husband accidently taped over it. This tape is very much in line with that series.I would recommend it for anyone looking for an all around basic workout. It really works for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Quick and Effective Workout","review":"I really enjoy this workout and feel it adds good variety to my routine to keep me motivated. You can go through the whole thing in 35 minutes and feel like you hit every part of your body. This is great for days when you're in a hurry. Also, it feels more like 15 minutes for some reason. The time really flies during this one, in my opinion, but you still feel the muscles working."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Band Sucks!!!","review":"Over rated, over produced bomb DO NOT WASTE A CENT ON THIS ALBUM AND KEEP MALL GOTH OUT OF THE SCENE."},{"rating":"1","title":"the undisputable worst band in existence today","review":"If you've heard this CD and are sane to some degree, you would have concluded that Hawthorne Heights have by far the worst lyrics you could find (the same overused phrases and topics that you can always find on crappy hit radio stations), a squeaky singer who thinks he can scream like a death metal vocalist (I dislike yell rock already, but with Hawthorne Heights you can really tell what bad yell rock sounds like), and just plain stupid melodies. Like other reviewers have expressed, I am shocked that anyone would have musical tastes horrid enough to actually like this band. They are the worst of Emo out there. Nearly all Emo sucks, and Hawthorne Heights certainly is no exception. If you want good Emo, look no further than the new Lostprophets CD, and My Chemical Romance if they count. I would think they would. Anyway, don't waste your money or precious seconds of your life on this complete trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"I love this cd! at first listen I liked it fairly well, but now it is one of my favorite cds, and I just cannot take it out of my cd player. Hawthorne Heights deals with heartbreak, and anyone who can relate will love this cd.my favorite songs are \\"who We are,\\" \\"Language Lessons,\\" \\"Dead In The Water\\" and \\"where Can I Stab Myself In the Ears.\\" All the other songs are great too. The only song that I didn't really care for was \\"decembers.\\" It was just okay.I recommend this album to anyone who loves emo/screamo music or has a broken heart. And to everyone who says Hawthorne Heights sucks, go phunk yourselves, because that just means that you have no appreciation for good music.Anyway, go buy this cd, cause it rocks!

This one has the girl, that one has the guy.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tunes with better versions elsewhere","review":"I'm bias. I'm a huge ELO fan. Having said that, you'll do better with other ELO releases than this one. It's audio quality leaves something to be desired and it has the SHORT version of \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", which is a crime. The original vinyl version had the full-length version when it was first released. So many people complained that their record player would eject before the track was finished (the recorded grooves were very close to the label), that the label put the short version on it after the first pressing. The label COULD have corrected that on the CD release. Look to the 3-CD set \\"Flashback\\" or the newly issued re-masters of the original ELO albums for better quality.

Its deep house like technoish sound is really good for any time of day, the opening tracks vocals are reminescent of ladytron, and the cd really only gets better minus a 1 or 2 songs. The majorty of the cd is filled with instrumental, extremely pleasing, cut up, sounds and melodies and some danceable beats. Alone with you's male vocals remind me of some work by Gus Gus, and it sounds, very, very good. I would go on but I strongly encourage you to go out and get this cd becuase its truely a work of art.

That is good--very rich sound with the perfect amount of bass emphasis.However, as others have mentioned, the band is way too narrow--almost like it's made for children. I doubt any male head will fit into these things without the band digging into the sides of your scalp! Like the previous reviewer, I made the mistake of trying to bend the band to widen it--snap! And these were brand new!!! Luckily, the lifetime Koss warranty came through to replace it for only $6 s/h. Because the headphones are brutally unforgiving for my head, they are still in the package unworn. I highly recommend the behind the head band style of the Sportapros if you like this style (I DO--I can wear a cap without band interference) and feel it is more easy and comfortable to wear than the clip-on ear style of the KSC75/35."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and true","review":"The 99-270 bit set I purchased took a little getting used to. When I first opened the package and studied the profiles, there was no way these bits would match. Or so I thought. After some practice cuts and a little trial and error I was on my way. The bits are of course Freud quality all the way. Mine unfortunately were assembled incorrectly from the factory. (4 Stars) One of the cutting heads on one of the bits was installed up side down. This made for an interesting first cut. After correcting the assembly error, I had no problem making all the parts for a divided light window. You will however, have to use mortises to assemble your project. Overall these are a great addition to my Freud collection. Solid as expected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freud 99-270 set","review":"I just got this set this morning and tried it out. It works like you would expect any Fredu router bit to work: flawlessly. I guess Bosch is firmly in control of Freud now after the buyout. My bits were not the expected red color that's been their norm in the past. Rather they are now a silvery gray and the coating is some kind of perma shield or such. In any case they cut extremely smooth, and the profiles fit together perfectly. Freud (or Bosch) may have got the feedback from the earlier reviews about the lack of instructions since my set included a little flyer. They were most basic but still useful.

An excellent teaching and learning tool. I highly recommend it to my students since it moves abstract concepts closer to the concrete stage.If you are a parent, this is a MUST have for your child to aid their learning of physics concepts.The downside is some of the applets do not work but they are a small minority.

I found it on a plane during a cross Atlantic flight and soon found out why it was left behind. It's one of those books you keep reading simply because you can't believe how horrible it is.

Sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"inconsistent characterization hurt this book","review":"My feeling as I read this book was that it COULD have been a great book. It had an interesting story line, an interesting setting, and even the potential for interesting characters but the author portrayed the main character as a mishmash of stupid vs. supposedly clever. She's supposedly this tough as nails prosecutor back in the states - a loner that's been through hard times as a child and yet has become a great lawyer through hard work and intelligence. Then for the practical part of the book, she proceeds to make stupid choices never bothering to think of the consequences while everyone around her gets bumped off. It's as if the author sat down and wrote Lara's background and then disregarded most of it to further the plot of the book. I can't help but feel this book would have done better as a spy/thriller/mystery if it had been given some pointers by Agatha Christie and John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knew the killer from his first appearance","review":"... It's is a quick read. No big Russian words to slow you down. I haven't been in the former Soviet Union, so I can't speak to how accurately the author depicts things since the fall of Communism, but it's easy to see which side of the 60's he was on. The main character, Lara, is sort of like Alex Keaton from Family Ties, but without the personality. The detective, Yuri, reminded me of Sgt Wojo from Barney Miller.As soon the Killer made his/her first appearance, I knew s/he was the one. There's misdirection after that, but it doesn't work.I guess you could say this book is a classic instance of trying to force current, enlightened, multicultural, liberal, post 60s, flowerpower, warm, fuzzy, American values on another culture. Even the defense attorney, Nina, has to be made a minority so the reader can know that she's alright. Throw in a little gay action and some disabled people for window dressing, and there you have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Presumed Guilty, What a great read!","review":"I normally take an hour 0f the day to settle back and read.

Escape From Lucania is not only a window into this era, but also a look at the men themselves, men of decency, honor, ambition, character, honesty, immense skill, intelligence, and an \\"aw, shucks\\" attitude. These are men who would abandon their own ambitions on a moment's notice to save a friend. These are men I would want to have with me when the going gets tough. And the going does get tough in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"This is just a story of two friends. It is not complex but it is a very fun read. It is not written as a catharsis, like into thin air was, it's basically the coolest story your grandpa ever told you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely wireless","review":"We purchased this item because we needed some of the speakers wireless, however, with this unit they must still be wired to a separate unit that transmits to the stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Equipment defective","review":"The instructions are well written and easily understood. Unfortunately the unit does not work at all. The menu on the Dav500 does not recognize the Sony WAHTSD1 Wireless transmitter when it is plugged into the recepticle in the back.This is particularly upsetting after spending $3,000 for the Bravia 46 inch LCD HDTV and $400 for the DAV500 home entertainment unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony wireless speaker set for home theater systems","review":"This item was purchased several weeks ago for the new home theater system also recently purchased. It works great, the surround sound is just as great as the non-wireless alternatives. There is no delay in the sound transmission and it is very nice not to have to worry about all the wires. Definately worth the price and the 2 days it took for shipping. I would recommend this item highly for those who are interested in the wireless components."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless and Witless","review":"Once properly set up, this wireless kit does work effectively; however, the remote sensor is quite sensitive to direction and stops working whenever it jogs out of perfect alignment with the main transmitter. Also, I am admittedly a home theater neophyte, but to me, wireless meant \\"no wires\\"... You still have wires from the wireless kit to each of the rear speakers; all you've eliminated are the wires running to the main receiver/amplifier. That's better than nothing, but I'd truly love something that eliminates all but the main power cord!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Product performs as expected","review":"The product performs as expected. It was easy to install but took a few adjustments that were not too hard to figure out. It was received in a timely manner in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Extremely easy to set up. I had it set up and sounding great in less than 30 min.

I really loved how the furniture in the room came alive and wanted to be clean. I had the book on tape to listen to as I followed along, and I listened to it all the time. Maybe that's why I always try to keep my room as clean as I can! I highly suggest this book for any parent to get for their child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just sweet, no flavor","review":"Had purchased this years ago and didn't care for it, but thought now w/Splenda and the good reviews, it had to be good. Wrong. They get you to bite w/the Kahlua on the label, but there is no comparison to Kahlua, doesn't taste at all like Kahlua. Actually it doesn't really even taste like coffee. It has just a sweet artificial flavor, but not a coffee flavor. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Use for making lower calorie White Russians to replace the sugar content in real Kahlua. Also use fat free half and half. Not quite as good as the real thing, but close for the amount of calories saved. Downside is product is fairly expensive when having to add shipping. Not a bad price for the occasional drink, but would be too expensive if using regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Da Vinci Sugar-Free Kahlua Syrup Smells Funny","review":"I buy the Da Vinci sugar-free syrups all the time and love most of them. I only use them to flavor my coffee.I recently opened a bottle of the sugar-free Kahlua syrup and I may end up throwing it out. It smells awful, kind of sour. I don't know if it should smell this way in the bottle or if there is something off about MY bottle, but the odor is unbearable.I researched it online and can't find anything in relation to the Kahlua flavored syrup smelling funny.Better to toss it out than find out later on that there is something wrong with my particular bottle. I won't buy this flavor again.Sue"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite Christmas music","review":"We have had this Hennie Bekker Christmas tape since it was released and are now buying a cd.

They may know more politics than the case itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reporting and detailed insights!","review":"A Convenient Spy is an awesome piece of reporting. I was amazed at all the details that are disclosed. They result in real insights into the motives of key participants. Clearly, many different participants in the Wen Ho Lee story shared their perspectives and experiences with Stober and Hoffman. If you are interested in learning about how scientists at our national labs work, how the FBI, the CIA, lab administrators and politicians responded to the possibility of leaks at Los Alamos, this book is an excellent read. If you want to be well informed about what happened in the Wen Ho Lee story, you have to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Results","review":"The unit works as described, but the picture when using the PC is fuzzy and there is low-level static in the sound. I bought it to hook up an old PS2 to my monitor and that seems to work just fine for that (although that picture may be a bit fuzzy as well, but it's been a while since I've seen PS2 games in action, so it's hard to judge.)Bottom Line:There has to be better VGA box than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"VGA Box (Wonder Box)","review":"I love this VGA Box.

The arangments are solid and due justice to the original pieces. It is well worth the three bucks of the purchase price. I listen to this often! I find it to be very inspiring for my own playing. The pieces are performed in absolute tehnical perfection without a lot of studio noise or interfearence. A guitarist that does weddings would do well to have all the music on this CD in his repretare.

It also messages the gums to help keep them healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jell-O Gelatin Dessert, Lime","review":"I don't rate this 5-star because of it's high sugar content. Nevertheless, I consider it a kitchen staple. This is one of the few flavors I use (Cranberry is also good) to turn the \\"dessert\\" course into VEGETABLES! I grate/finely slice/chop vegetables and nuts (green colored vegetables, such as green cabbage or celery yield the most attractive result with Lime)and stir them into the Jello before it has completely solidfied. Use LOTS of vegetables--the role of the Jello is simply to bind them together & add color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly what I was hoping for","review":"I've not played since I was in middle school, and thought I'd pick it up again.

So, I will look again for something a little more basic, but my kids are going to love it when I can play Queen's We Will Rock You."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is a legend","review":"I really like this album. It is a true legend. I remember some of the songs when they were brand new, especially \\"Fire on High.\\" I like the beginning. It sounds kind of scary, and then it suddenly changes, and becomes more rockin'. My favorite song on the album is \\"Evil Woman.\\" I also like \\"Strange Magic,\\" and \\"Nightrider.\\" Alot of the songs remind me of Beatles, and George Harrison. So if you like ELO, I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"You made a fool of me but them broken dreams have got to end","review":"ELO's sixth album Face The Music was first released in the Fall of 1975. This was the first album with new members Kelly Groucutt and Melvyn Gale. It was also the first ELO album to go Platinum in the U.S.. The album opens with a great instrumental number called Fire On High. Waterfall is a nice ballad and is followed by one of the band's biggest hits, Evil Woman. the first half ends with Nightrider which builds into a nice gallop. The second half starts with one of the band's fastest songs Poker with a nice rock and roll edge. Down Home Town finds the band doing a country number and being pretty successful at it. Strange Magic is another one of the band's biggest hits. It has a pretty melody and Jeff Lynne's guitar hooks are very nice. The original album ends on a high note with the ballad One Summer Dream. the bonus songs are quite nice giving us alternative mixes and versions of the songs on the album. A perfect ELO album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another all time Great Record to have in your collection","review":"Great use of orchstration.. early days of ELO.. at the time they were very edgy - innovative...using backward masking..amazing arrangmentsThe two hits at the time weree Evil Woman and Strange Magic.. I like the other songs on the album too but One great song that many NON ELO Fans probably never heard but would like is a son called ONE SUMMER DREAM. It was a simple song but amazingly beautiful!!!!MUST HAVE FOR YOUR COLLECTION"},{"rating":"2","title":"fire on high","review":"Fire on high is quite simply hands down the greatest recorded rock instrumental period."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a winner from start to finish","review":"While there's only eight songs in the original release format, they are all very good. This is a case where the non-hits are the real gems - Poker rocks, Down Home Town is a funny take on the southern US from a Brit's perspective, and the lush One Summer Dream wraps up the package nicely. I had a chance to see them perform some of this material live in a small theater in Chicago and it was one of the best rock shows I ever saw. They were having a great time performing and it showed. Later I saw them in a large arena during the \\"Out of the Blue flying saucer\\" tour and it wasn't quite the same at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ELO Album","review":"This album, although too short minuteswise, is my favorite of the ELO classics. Fire on High, Evil Woman, Strange Magic and One Summer Dream anchor this transitional album. The only weak song is Down Home Town, but it worth the oversight for the rest.This was originally released on CD without the intros to Fire on High and Strange Magic. It also missed a string finale to Waterfall. A letter of apology from a Jet executive appeared in a Digial Audio magazine in 1987 because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel about the end of the stone age with an authentic setting.","review":"I read this with interest and then passed it along to my grandson in hopes it will arouse an interest in history in him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but a goodie","review":"This is an interesting 'historical novel' my brother and I really enjoyed as kids - thrilled to be able to purchase it for my niece who happened to have just flown over Skara Brae on holiday where the book is set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fiction based upon the actual archeological finds of Skara Brae","review":"This story is fiction but is based upon the actual archeological finds of Skara Brae. Items recovered at Skara Brae are included in the story and this gives us a glimpse into what life may have and probably actually was like 5000 years ago. I am 48 and found the read very interesting yet somewhat predictable but for young to older teens, it certainly would be a great read. I am reading it to my 7 year old and he is absolutely enthralled with it. Not only is he is learning about prehistoric life but he is truly loving the fact that the story uses actual artifacts in the story. It just makes it come to life. Kathleen Fidler did a wonderful job with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond memories","review":"This was one of the first books I ever read.

I thought it was very funny and even if you don't have an odd sense of humor like I do, you should buy this movie just to give the rude gesture to departed Attorney General Ashcroft and the rest of the Bushies . If anyone ever makes a believable movie about a magic bong, please let me know. SHEESH ! You can tell what to expect here from the title alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Band then Chong.","review":"Only thing I thought was cool about this movie was how Band mixed a few of his other horror movie characters in it. I think reviewers are focusing on Chong too much when this isn't really a Chong movie. Chong is on the cover to get some sells. It wasn't like he was in the entire movie. He came in towards the end to put an end to this disaster of a movie. This is a Charles Band movie, and like many of his movies they're only good because they're so bad. - And this comes from a Puppet Master fanatic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot Head Horror","review":"Full Moon studios number about a group of friends who every time they smoke pot from a bong they pass out and are \\"killed\\" one by one in a dream sequence.

I think the 1725 RPM is perfect all around speed, don't forget, you will be spinning 10\\" wheels. Plus the sanding drums are only rated for 1800 RPM. A great machine, I don't think its too heavy as one suggests (74 lbs for the buffer and 50 lbs for the stand, total 124 pounds), it has to be or you'd be chasing it around the shop. I would suggest adding more weight to the base if necessary or bolt it to the floor for safety reasons. As for the accessory flap sander and the sanding drum, they are available, you just have to scan the internet (etoolclub.com).

Such peace and joy come over me whenever I listen to 4Him Hymns. Thank you, 4Him, for this fantastic CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4Him's Magmum Opus!","review":"This is more than an album. It is a testament of praise and worship to God & Jesus. These guys sing so well. I have 3 of their works (The Ride, Obvious and Hymns) and this one has the most varied sound. There are many instruments used and the studio artist chosen for this disc are excellent. Their vocal arangements are second to none. All four (Andy, Mark, Marty & Kirk)seem to have sung an equal amount on this disc. Standouts are It Is Well, Oh sacred Head Now wounded, Be Thou My Vision and The Love of God, Great Is Thy Faithfullness. Another plus is this CD has all the lyrics and background information about these Hymns. This album is a must for any Christian music fan. Acually, its a must for any music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing Christian message & music","review":"Have always liked 4Him music; this collection is so soothing and beautifully done; love to just sit still in a big comfy chair, close my eyes, turn my iPod on and listen.

The REAL woman cannot really talk, but Reba changed parts of the movie to make the ending happier. And, Reba had the permission of the REAL woman's family to do this story. Get off your soapbox!
