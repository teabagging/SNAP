It was cheaper for the same amount of cereal, and is even more nutritious than oatmeal alone. The taste is great, I make mine on the stovetop with soy milk instead of water so it's nice and thick and creamy, then I add some brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. It's also good with a banana mashed into it, and as a special treat sometimes I mix chocolate syrup and peanut butter into it. I also like to let it soak for a few minutes before I start cooking which seems to help with the texture (it can be a little gritty). Overall a delicious hot cereal that I would choose over oatmeal any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politically incorrect","review":"How did this wild black comedy ever get made?

In any case, this film is for people who would also, perhaps, enjoy \\"Little Murders\\" and \\"Harold and Maude.\\" The story is a first rate rip of homosexuality and the shrinks who often treat the \\"disturbed.\\" This may be the most politically incorrect movie of the 1980s (it was filmed in Paris) and you'll never see it on television. Oh yes, the movie is also very funny---for the handful of people (I'm one of them) who enjoy extraordinarily black comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Altman destroys a Christopher Durang Masterpiece","review":"Beyond Therapy by Christopher Durang is an excellent intellegent comedy. Unfortunately Beyond Therapy by Robert Altman is not. He tries to place realism in an existential play, for example destroying one of the important themes of Durang's play by placing real waiters in the restaurant. There are too many distractions, with strange background noises and many characters who are never developed. It drops in and out of the play script, and the audience can immediately tell those moments as the style of the lines change."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO IT AIN'T VAL LEWTON....","review":"I can't carp about this little 40's spooker with LUGOSI playing Dracula again (finally) even if it IS low-budget and has a funny-looking werewolf/assistant. It's still a curio and features a wartime setting as well as the lovely Nina Foch (in an early role) as a potential victim. It's goofy and weird and not all that bad, really. At least it was a major studio that released it and not one of those hideous poverty row junkfests that were churned out by the truckload around the same time. The class shows through with the acting,camera-work and story coherence. It could have been much worse but it's not and it sits proudly with my other DVDS as an old fashioned reminder of what going to the movies used to be about and how thankful I am that some of these old chestnuts are still around to be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return this vampire","review":"THE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE is an interesting WWII-era 'B' grade Bela Lugosi movie made by not UNIVERSAL but COLUMBIA studios. There's plenty of gothic atmosphere, fog and a caped Lugosi oozing his lines at Nina Foch to enchant and delight fans.His assistant, a talking werewolf who stays hirsute even in the day and when the moon isn't full, is to some this picture's weakest element. Suggest you ignore the beast and concentrate on Bela's beautiful performance instead.Note that GOODTIMES videotapes are recorded in LP mode, have a somewhat degraded video quality and lack HiFi sound (thus the two-star rating). VHS collectors should seek out SONY/COLUMBIA's 1996 edition ofTHE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE.It's also available onDVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEWARE THE NIGHT FOR THE VAMPIRE STALKS","review":"Any true monster movie fan would have this film on their movie shelf.

I've always been fascinated by what humans can do to other humans. But this book took me longer to read than any other book I've read as far back as I can remember. I just could not get into it. The writer's style did absolutely nothing for me - and the \\"sections\\" he divided the book into made no sense at all. Plus he couldn't decide on a name to call each of the main characters, so he just jumps around from variation to variation. It's fine to do that a bit at first so you can get a feel for the characters, but after a while you really have to pick one!

The holster is very secure, doesn't move around much and the plastic belt clip is strong. Leather is of high quality as is the stitching and fit. The cut is very tight and provides complete protection of the trigger. My only complaint is of the long tang of the release tab that wraps around the top of the holster. This metal tab has a tendency to jab into your side since it is at the top of the side closest to your skin. I've come to get used to this and if an undershirt is tucked in behind it, then I can wear this all day long without notice.

If you read about him, he was not like this at all, yes he was gay, BUT, did not try to hard to establish a long term relationship with anyone, the movie gives you the sense that he actually may have cared for someone. so if you want a 2 hr gay love story, maybe you will like this. If you are looking for the gory aspects of his life (not that they will ever show that in a movie, or could for that matter) then this is far from what you want.

We see full afternoonns and evenings play out with those Dahmer was attracted to. We can never understand who Dahmer really was, but this is an interesting portrayal that probably comes as close as we're going to get.

You dont even see the events leading up to his arrest...poor acting throughout as well.

They didn't accurately portray Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes. It was about a man as you know, going to bars picking up gay men, drugging them and having sex with them. All they did was have flashbacks and him hanging out with another gay man. Nothing gory, nothing exciting, biggest waste of my time. What about the saving of body parts in the freezer? What about the eating of his victims? WHERE are these DETAILS? If the writer of this movie would like the true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, please go to A&E.com and purchase the serial killer box set. Now that is something worth your time. When the re-write comes out with all the \\"true and factual\\" details, let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time.","review":"This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I've seen. I expected something that gave insight into Dahmer's life and what drove him to his acts.Instead we got snippets in flashback form that give little information.I found the format a bit confusing as it was hard to delineate when each flash back was, so it was hard to get a handle on how things progressed.There was virtually no information about Dahmer's childhood, and what could have created such a pyscho. And very little about what he actually did other than two short scenes depicting him cutting up what I think was his first victim, and using a powerdrill on the head of another victim.Overall I thought this was a terrible movie, and I would never recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"This movie is worth watching if you're looking for more of a story and less gore. I think it was done well and the flashes between current events and childhood events went well together. Jeremy Renner did an excellent job playing Dahmer, so much so, that whenever I see anything on about Jeffery Dahmer, I picture Jeremy Renner. This movie is more like having free time to kill and watching a little cable on a Saturday night. Not worth a trip to the movie theater but something to watch to see a little more \\"human\\" side of Dahmer. Good movie altogether and I would watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"to all the people saying this movie was horrible...","review":"if you buy this movie and expect an actor portraying jeffrey doing every murder hes done, chopping up bodies and eating them, than this is not the movie for you. this movie is more like an psychological insight of dahmer. what he was and why he did what he did(what sparked him to kill). you're gonna see 4 major psychological event in his life. his first murder, detailed insight of the only guy who happened to escape, a flashback why he was the way he was, and one of his plotted attempted murders. thats it. its not going to be a gruesome detailed description of every murder he's done. if you're looking for that than i rather you buy a documentary of jeffrey dahmer rather this dramaticized movie of his life. knowing the director insight of the synapsis of this movie, i think this movie is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a movie could ever have stunted growth, this is it...","review":"Dahmer was an OK movie, but was rather slow. I mean, it's so damned obvious that the guys/boys he brings home/meets end up hacked up for BBQ (metal fans, anyone?!) so why not work in some action, suspense, news, talk of the missing, etc.? All the movie does is show how he lured, tortured, and killed his victims, basically. Doesn't even touch on him being a cannibal. The movie has an abrupt ending, which really is it's biggest flaw. Given when the movie was made, I expected it'd touch on his hunt, capture, trial, imprisonment, and, ultimately, his demise. Very disappointing, that movie. Extremely lacking. Imagine getting dressed up in formals and your blind date picks you up for dinner in his Yugo, and you find out he's Mr. Rogers and you're going to Wendy's for dinner, when you expected opera tickets, a limo, and dinner at the Mansion. Try beating that with a greaseburger and a frosty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Out The Uniqueness","review":"Don't waste your money on this movie. What made Jeffrey Dahmer unique to other serial killers, was his methods of disposing the bodies. This movie didn't even touch base on this. Jumping from teenager to adult continuously was frankly, quite annoying. Very disappointed with the ending. Left it open, and many unanswered questions. I recently watched TED BUNDY. This was accurate, and didn't leave you guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Dahmer","review":"I don't know what video company put these out but it seems last year or so, there were suddenly tons of these serial killer movies in the video stores.I don't follow serial killers at all. This movie was extremely disappointing because despite not knowing much at all about Dahmer, I think I knew 10 times as much about him as this movie presented.It's terrible acting and we don't see any motivations for his actions and there aren't much details of his crimes except that he met gay guys and killed them in his apartment.The details of the time one escaped, was questioned by police, and was returned by the police to Dahmer due to his drugged up nature are widely known and the movie didn't even demonstrate the things that are pretty common knowledge let alone show anything about him that isn't already known.See the ones about John Gacy and Ted Bundy instead. I can't speak about their accuracy but they are more entertaining than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I thought the movie was better than the other two I purchased-Green River & Henry Lee Lucas but it was still not that good"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"i actually think this movie was done quite well.the blood is low on this movie but enough to satisfy someone who isn't looking for much.the acting is done well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dahmer","review":"What's great about this movie is how it's structured. The story almost moves backwards with its interesting use of flashbacks. The editing is top notch [the bar scene is notable], though the pace can feel a bit slow, I think it's because you are just waiting and waiting for this explosion of Jeffery. Tension is built up by not giving you what you truly think you want, a gore flick. Everybody knows what Dahmer did, and knows it was horrifing and awful, 'Dahmer' focuses on the seemingly normal life of a person that you can actually relate to. That is where this film freaks you out the most. I also reccomend watching this with director commentary, very informative, and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not many songs per CD+G","review":"To use the Karaoke function, you must buy CD+Graphics CD's.

In any case, you have to buy many CD's, or you end up singing the same songs over and over agains.Also, it takes a few minutes for the system to recognize the disc, (just like a DVD player).A better Karaoke solution is the Leadsinger microphones.

When they told me the regular price was $119.00 (wouldn't even look at it really), I didn't believe him, because the display had an old sticker on it (the sticker was faded and looked like the old stickers they used) that said $59.99 which he said was the price it would be now with half off. Don't seem like a sale to me! Where is the features? Something didn't not feal right about that, so unless I've missed something I would look at another Karaoke machine.

I'm glad we didn't. My husband did a great job installing the speakers under the eve of the house. We have a surround sound home theatre so we are not stupid about sound quality, but we are not audiofiles either. These speakers sound great! We can even hear the music from the lower patio, without having to crank it too high. The way my dear husband has them installed, we can listen to music late at night without bothering the kids inside.

Correct they are not water-proof, only weather proof (water gets in). So take the time and put your stuff in a large garabage bag (55 gal works well).

Bag being the key word. If you're going to be using it often, spend the extra cash and get a hard enclosure. It's almost impossible to stuff it so that there are aerodynamics involved. This means you will usually end up killing your gas mileage with the semblance of a large air dam on the top of the vehicle. Under wet conditions, the bag performs as expected, however, in a hard rain prepare for wet luggage. I learned my lesson the first time when we got to the hotel and had to use the laundry room to wash 4 suitcases of clothing. Wrap everything in garbage bags if you can. Due to the fact it has a zipper, you can expect a soggy reception after you drive through a storm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Extra Rooftop Storage","review":"We used this for our first family roadtrip vacation about 3 hours away.

If you can, buy some ratchet straps and tie it down for extra security and to prevent any possible flapping if the unit isnt full.During our trip we encountered a day or two with heavier rain and hail; the floor of the unit was damp but we expected this from reading the Amazon reviews.We checked our 846 often and had to tighten the straps and ratchet straps on occasion but that was to be expected for such a long trip.

Of course the next week after we bought it, the price went down, so beware of that, and keep an eye on the prices changing. My only complaint is that I wish it were a little darker color.

Blu's complex, but not over your head metaphors, are a welcome listen compared to the nursery rhyme nonsense on the radio. when I first heard him on \\"Narrow Path\\", he reminded me of a west coast Mos Def or Black Thought.This is a must have for any hip hop head's collection. There is no fast forward material here, just quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic underground album","review":"If you are a stone cold underground hip hop fan, you will need to get this album to your collection. with blu on the rhymes and exile on the beats, you can't go wrong.

Blu has recently done some work on The Roots latest album, How I Got Over, and Exile has collaborated with the likes of Aloe Blacc and cites infuences such as J Dilla. I think a more appropriate name for this album would be \\"In The Heavens\\", because this album is quite heavenly. I had never heard of Blu or Exile previously, but already I would consider them my new favorite hip-hop act. As far as the album goes there is not a bad album on the track. Usually I don't enjoy r&b tracks but some of the songs have an R&B feel to them and they are fantastic as well. If you enjoy \\"REAL\\" hip-hop, then you absolutely MUST pick this up!!!

Better be a McGyver or your kid will be unhappy.- Pieces that need to fit snugly together don't, so the finished product (like race car) can't be moved or touched or it falls apart.- sticks are fragile. If you don't pull them exactly straight out of holes when dis-assembling the ends of the sticks crack. I don't know about your 5 YO's ability to pull stuff exactly straight out, but mine doesn't quite get that. And in some configurations, it is impossible even for an adult. Needless to say, it is breaking after only a few uses.Net-net: if your kid wants to build something and put it on the shelf and never touch it or never re-use to build something else, this is a good kit.

We ended up buying the 750 pc set after buying this one. With that set we can make all the other sets pretty much using some ingenuity.I gave durability only a 3 because you do have to be careful disassembling it. you have to make it tight to get the flat pieces to stay, and then taking apart is hard especially triangular configurations which are very common, planes, race cars, forklifts, carousels.highly recommend, we are also fortunate in that our youngest doesn't put stuff in our mouth, if you are not as fortunate becareful because the people's heads are very small as well as the blue connectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare for the faint of heart","review":"After trusting using other Progeny Press Products, I dove into Hamlet and then MacBeth.

They know more about the plays than I did as a senior in high school!

There are many anecdotes that I want to remember and lessons too. Stay sober for one, keep working on art, don't give up and love well. There is an enormous, enormous sadness that she does not hesitate to share, she survived to share it with us and if we happen to have similar habits we understand a bit more about what is the right thing to do, in a sense this is a self-help book besides a phenomenal celebrity read.

Sting is one of those few artists that really rarely has that happen. His song, Stolen Car (Take Me Dancing), the second track from Sting's 2003 Sacred Love record, isn't really as diverse of sof spoken to the message just like his previous single, Send Your Love. All in all, that really isn't one of Sting's most enjoyable tracks at all. The beat on this song and the lyrics actually didn't go all in together. For die hard Sting fans, they might not enjoy this one, and neither do I. Hopefully, he'll make some better songs than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point...","review":"with ALL these various remixes and versions?

Acting is also terrible, with 'Bubbles' being exceptionally poor.The basic storyline is that a London crimeboss is taking out the competition to ensure a merger of his 'company' with a big US crime syndicate. After the killing of a rival in a park, a witness survives, and the hunt is on.On first glance, this sounds like a Guy Ritchy or Tarantino plot, but where those directors manage to create exceptional dialogue and bizarre plot twists, this one just lacks.

It started off okay but you can tell right away that it's one of those straight to video B movies-- just bad enough to be good. I almost expected Eric Roberts or Rutger Hauer to show up. But it went from bad to worse to one of THE WORST movies you'll ever see. It was disturbingly bad, not to mention just plain disturbing. Like \\"Seven,\\" or \\"Salo\\" (never seen the latter but from what I hear I never want to),it's one of those movies that makes you feel different for several days after watching it. You know a flick is bad when the villains tell you every detail of their sinister plan before they off you. It's good for a stoned laugh or two...maybe three because the acting and dialogue are deplorable. I wish I could give it a -5 stars. Ridiculous. The good news is it only cost me 1 dollar.

I already did love his work, however, so now I just have a deeper appreciation for it. His illustrations are vibrant, textured, easily recognizable both for the subject and as being Carle's work, and virtually hum with life.

Strauss', and Previn's, finest albums.","review":"This is one of Richard Strauss's, and Previn's, finest albums. The performances on two of the composer's most beloved works are overall good, and Telarc has done a marvelous job with its always superior sound quality.The fanfare from Thus Spaka Zarathustr is probably the single most famous music by Strauss, ever since it became the intro for 2001 The Space Oddysey, and that segment alone is what I consider to be the highlight of the album. Brilliant brass, thunderous timpani (some other recordings of the timpani solo sounded more round and fat; this one is more sharp and full of intensity), and at the climax, the trumpets, as triumphant as they should be, really pierces the air.It's worth a listen for any Richard Strauss fan.P.S. - Strauss' Alpine Symphony under the same conductor, orchestra, and label, was a bit pale; you gotta get Karajan's performance on that piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"sux","review":"Not what I expected.

O'conor's sound is warm and lyrical with a powerful technique which serves, but never overpowers the music - he's not a basher. He sounds utterly at home in this music and the performances have such a rightness about them that they feel inevitable. He leans, perhaps, a bit more to the classical than the romantic style of playing, so if you're in search of melodrama this may not be the recording for you.As to the sound - well not to contradict the shrill reviewer below - but to my ear this is one of the best (of hundreds) sounding piano recordings I've heard. There's some room ambience, but not enough that the sound gets lost. It is NOT harsh or overly treble, nor does it have too much bass. It feels intimate, as if you're in the room with the performer and is exceptionally clear and warm. This not a dry recording (see Gulda's WTC).My favorite 'Waldstein'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, good performance - but terrible recording.","review":"The music may be great and the performance may be great, but the recording (or the piano - but I doubt that) is terrible.

Unfortunately that is not so, for me there is still pressure in the wrong places around my eyes and I've had to go back to the old flat non-contoured eye masks until I can find another contoured mask that works for me.

This layout fosters confidence in harmonica playing such that by the end of the book I was comfortable improvising to the backing music with the numerous riffs and techniques learned in this book. The shortcoming of the book is that the volume 1 stops right at bending. This wouldn't be that bad, but as I understand it, volume 2 was never finished or published. Without bending, you really are not playing the blues. I would still recommend this book over other beginner books because it sticks to teaching licks without all the goofiness of books like Gindicks.

Or do we have the same guy posting as 20 other people (this is probably closer to what really is going on)Don't believe all the hype and hoopla; however, now that I have my rebuttal out of the way, I do agree that Greely's Cove is a 'good' book (not great, not awesome, not the best ever)...but well worth reading. I DO recommend reading it.

I have tried for two days now to contact someone one this issue and the computers are not letting me send any email and of course there is not a phone number you can call. My advice be very careful of what you order cause there pictures and what you get are not the samething. It is very upsetting to order what you think is the best gift every to find out it is a lesser version then represented and so it is not a great gift after all.

The suspensions are your domestic woofers: expecially with the great final major cord concludes the cadenze, in the third movement. Here Murray does not endure: the 64 foot cement-pipes slip from his hands, and all the other recordings of it seem, by comparison, accordion's accompaniments... Something like that happened to Virgil Fox, who played here (on a famous RCA recording) the \\"Little\\" fugue of J S Bach, with the acoustic result of a running train... Do not lose, good look!

There are two plastic grommets that hold the jig in the correct position on the support arm above the sharpening stone. They (the grommets) keep coming out of the jig. When one, or both, of the grommets come out, the jig wobbles and you cannot properly sharpen. I tried gluing them in myself but so far have been unsuccessful in finding a glue that will hold. This could be easily fixed by making the grommets with a lip on the inside that would snap over the inside edge of the hole on the jig.

The characters themselves were the disappointment. A man of honor would not, under any circumstances pass himself off as his dead friend. Gideon performed acts of heroism, but the descriptions of him weren't sufficient to convince me that I needed to cheer for him. Daintry, the heroine, was her era's feminist, but lacked the common sense to recognize some potentially dangerous situations or curb her willful niece. The secret was a tiresome thread through the story. The dialogue relied on phrases/terms that after a while became annoying, especially \\"dash.\\" Too bad the characters weren't more likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't wait for the movie","review":"I am not a fan of Romantic novels, I tend to go in for movies and books about car chases, and blowing stuff up. This book, though, touched a nerve. I identified with the strong romantic male, and found the story to be wonderfully enchanting.

This book offers little of value to anyone involved in the computer security field. Frankly it offers little that couldn't be learned from reading the backs of software boxes at your local Fry's or Comp USA. Given the depth of quality recent releases in the field of computer security and high tech investigation and more promising publications on the horizon, it's hard to justify spending the money on this book. Unless you just think the title will look cool on your bookshelf. You'd be better off with any of the recent releases by Eoghan Casey, or Kruse and Heisner.

The hood doesn't fall on my head when I check the oil. Yay!!! You need this left one 4217L and a left one 4217R for the complete job. The left replacement strut is missing the cable bracket of the original. It supports some wiring which you don't want flopping about. I drilled out the spot welds and knocked the bracket off the old one so I could reuse it with the replacement. These came with replacement brass mounting balls but I chose to leave the originals in place since they didn't seem worn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, it works well.","review":"It replaces existing lift and works well.

It is much easier to use since it has a simple menu structure and not the wierd button combo selections of the SB-600. The flash output is better, the recycle time is better and you can use the flash as a commander for other wireless flashes. Also the extra battery holder for a fifth battery reduces recycle time further and never comes off my unit.

The flash is very powerful, automatically adjusts to the width of your zoom lens (up to 105mm) and is one of the reasons that Nikon is so well known for being the wedding photographer's choice of camera. It's a superior system to anything out there on a capable Nikon (I use a Nikon D2Xs and Nikon D70s, a Mamiya 645 Pro TL and a Zenza Bronica ETRS II, but everyone with a D40 and up will love this flash)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatility and more","review":"Although I have only had the SB-800 for a few weeks I am totally impressed with it's versatility.

That is just ridiculous, as you can get the SB-900 (newer model) for $429 right here on amazon, and almost anywhere else you look, this flash it is in the $300-$400 range.

I agonized over which one to buy and what lenses and what accessories. I ended up buying th Nikon D200 with the 18-200mm VR lens, and the 50mm f1.8 lens, and the SB800. Because I know nothing about dslrs, and I am learning all the lingo by reading David Busch books, my first few pictures with the D200 when it arrived last week, were less than stellar, lol. Now, this is of course no reflection upon the D200 itself, but more so my infinite lack of knowledge on the subject. So, when the SB800 arrived two days after the D200, for some reason, I found it easier to understand (NOT the horrible manual, but just by playing around on it) than the D200. I have had both less than two weeks and I am now producing magnificent (if i do say so myself) photos. I would reccommend this to anyone serious about getting into freelance photography, or anyone who wants gorgeous photos every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon SB 800","review":"I have been using one of these for the last couple years with my work camera (D100) and recently purchased one for personal use with my D200.

As fast as I could, I removed the batteries. I could not hold the batteries in my hands as they were really hot. I opened the flash and yep, the diode was gone....I don't know why but for sure if I have not done anything the whole thing could blow on my face....I don't think it is worthy to spend that much money...as a matter of fact, I bought mine, new,from Photo Alley for $300..."},{"rating":"1","title":"$699!?

The SB-800 is no longer manufactured.See the manufacturer's link at [....]The SB-800 has been replaced by the SB-900. So if you really want the old item, the SB-800, they are in short supply which explains the high price. Why would you want the old item over the new item? Maybe you have several of the old items and want to have a consistent group of flashes with the same menus and features. For me going back and forth on the different menus and settings can be confusing. Both produce great photos. The SB-900 menus, buttons, features, and settings are easier for me to use than on the SB-800."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was extremely entertaining and enjoyable.

I would not have read the book if I had known, because, though I have no problem accepting gay lifestyles, I could not relate to these characters. Also, the main character seemed to just fall into this affair because she was bored with life. This lack of motivation weakened her as a character and made the story less believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I fortunately checked out this book from the library so I can't complain too much about the price. I read constantly so I thought this book might give me some ideas on some new books to read. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Most of the books suggested are predictable choices - books that most voracious readers read long ago, like \\"Gone with the Wind\\" or \\"Diary of Anne Frank\\" to use two examples. I got the impression they were getting kickbacks from bookstores to sell some of these books. Their \\"cutesy\\" writing gets old after a few chapters and I didn't agree with a lot of their observations. If you can, check this out at the library and wait for someone to write better book selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise, Poor Execution","review":"I was quite disapointed in this book, though it does have a terrific premise.

I later purchased an edger.The cultivator on the other hand works well. However the start cord does not retrieve/rewind without continuous help.

Black Tube and wire wrapped drive shaft bent and broke. 2. Tines broke. 3. Handle broke off on the bottom where it attaches to the lower assembly. 4. More tines bent and broke and 5. The cylinder head moves back and forth when the engine runs and spews out the oil.My Previous tiller was a NOMA that I purchased from Lowes and it worked 12 years without problems in the same soil. I could not find a NOMA so I purchased a Mantis because of their iron clad warranty and blemish free reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad case design","review":"The second time I tried to use this the pull start handle holder rattled loose and the nut that held it sheared all the teeth off the flywheel.

But you must understand that this is NOT a tiller! If you have a large area and/or need to dig to a significant depth, this is not the unit you want. I use this cultivator for very small areas and turning over the top couple of inches of dirt. It is very easy to maneuver due to its size and weight. It is great for making shallow trenches and digging around plants for removal and transplanting. The true test will be how well it stands up to repeated use but so far it has performed to my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Four years ago I purchased a Troy-bilt tiller/cultivator from Lowes' Home Improvement Center. The first spring I was very pleased with it's performance with the exception of a crimped fuel line upon purchase. Second year, starting was very difficult. Required excessive priming and the tines were sluggish in rotating. Third year required putting in the shop because tines would not rotate. Fourth year again, tines will not rotate. I am not disputing Troy-Bilt quality, but disappointed because I love to garden and had hoped this would resolve alot of physical labor for me. Instead my tiller has created more labor, expense in repairs and frustration. I feel Troy-Bilt products are one of the best, but feel I happened upon a lemon. While I don't expect to receive any response, I felt compelled to keep your organization informed on defected products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk","review":"Purchased in early April of 2006 due to alledged quality of brand name and it's been in the service center virtually ever since.

Had it repaired ran it about 3/4 hour and it began spewing oil everywhere. It took at least 5 weeks to get the determination that it was not repairable (so much for early gardening season.

Most recently the repair shop completely replaced the starter system - I picked it up Saturday and I'm on my way back today (Wednesday) because - again - the starter line is not engaged and so the thing can't be started.

I chose troy built because of the name. Immediately the transmission gear tore up. It was fixed for free (after driving about 80 miles) and very soon was broke again with the same problem. Pieces broke off or fell off, it is now collecting dust in my storage building.

Within the first 20 pages, Freedman offers a child abuse excuse for The Poetesses later fascination with her own gender. And, in these same 20 pages, Sappho is seen drooling over a collection of muscles and external genitalia with little brains who will eventually exile her from her home. To make matters worse, Freedman ends with the apocraphal story of Sappho and Phaeon (a fiction fabricated by Ovid for the amusement of Rome) For those of us who love The Lesbian, this novel will bring pain, sorrow and little enjoyment. This is not a book I would recommend to lesbians or feminists."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes, low fulfillment","review":"Since I've always been fascinated with Sappho, I was excited when I came across this book. What a disappointment. The writing is sketchy and unfleshed. The plot seems like little more than an excuse to show Sappho lusting after everyone she comes into contact with. I never thought I'd say this, but I actually got tired of lesbian sex scenes. Worst of all, the character of Sappho herself never becomes real or sympathetic. I had high hopes for this book, and it didn't come close to fulfilling them. There are good points (interweaving of poetry into the text, details of ancient Greek culture, some intriguing insights) but they are far outweighed by bad ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow but gratifying","review":"Having read some of the other reviews of this clanbook i have to agree that yes it did take me longer to read this one than some of the other ones.

I for one am going to try and pick up a copy of Dark Ages Inquistor at the first possible oppertunity after reading this book.

Had it plugged in about 3 times. This last time when I needed it for a job, due to the headset capability, it wouldn't work.Got a dial tone, no numbers would print digitally, and no numbers would dial when I pressed the buttons. I wish Amazon wouldn't sell this product and wish I had read the reviews prior to buying it.The phone was ordered at the end of Oct 2008. It's now April 2009.

Owls is an important, basic, and comprehensive reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owls of the world","review":"A stunning and fresh look at the Owls of the world. Each of the 212 species recognised by the Authors is described in detail, including Habits, vocalisations, distribution and current status. 64 colour plates add visual credence to the descriptions. This is all preceded by a general overview of Owl anatomy, behaviour, vocalisations, and breeding and nesting habits. Evidence is also presented to support the Authors' views on taxonomy. If you only ever buy one book about Owls, make it this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow, fast forwarded through most of it","review":"The pace was really slow and not engaging.

Wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was truly a bad movie","review":"Perhaps there were some deep themes in this movie, but it was painful to watch. None of the characters made me like them which is saying a lot since I was always a Katie Holmes fan. I suppose that's how the world is - no one is perfect, but these people weren't even likeable. It's definitely not a comedy, and not particularly romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The potential was there...","review":"So the movie offers the build of a great story and an exceptional cast of characters, however it's like all set up and no follow through. The ending seems like it's the middle of the scene and while a great many things happen they don't tie together or make much sense beyond the idea that the characters are truly messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty story about empty people doing nothing","review":"I hope the writers were not from Yale, as some of the characters supposedly are. If this is the level of intelligence that now characterizes Yale students, then the school should probably just close. I've seen several old-friends-get-together movies over the decades. This might be the worst. These are empty people with no understanding of life or themselves. They reveal this fact in most uninteresting ways. Not worth watching at all, not even with beer and popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Everyone in this movie is unhappy and miserable. Not much back story, just a bunch of unadjusted adults behaving badly. I really like a movie to have a point, and an ending. Just a cliff hanger here.

Not only was it a waste of time but a waste of money. Boring, Boring, BORING!!! I was thinking based on the description something like \\"The Big Chill\\", I loved a lot of the cast and thought how could you go wrong? Well wrong, wrong, wrong they went! No story line, not sure if the acting was bad or not, this movie was just bad! I hate to write a bad review, but I felt all should be warned! Pick a different flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"There wasn't much to like about this film. It was like watching a poorly written high school stage drama. Bad acting from normally pretty good actors, No sense of character development.The characters are completely unlikable. It was hardly funny and boringly predictable. It could have been a good or even great film if they focused on the awkwardness of the situation or some sort of revenge plan, but this film maintained its blandness for a full hour and a half. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Awful... that's all there is to it. Good idea, weirdly put together. There's an argument scene that lasts at least half the movie and the ending is just odd. The only entertaining part was the fight between the bride and maid of honor. Everything else didn't seem to fit and was randomly thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Having read the reviews, my expectations were not high when it came to watching this film. However, I found myself enjoying it. I thought it moved at a good pace, the group was delightfully dysfunctional, and Katie Holmes and Anna Paquin were great - especially the scene right before the wedding.

I didn't even care if they went through with the wedding and turned this off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic FAILURE of a wannabe love story","review":"As many others have stated, this movie lacks substance. There is absolutely NOTHING in the story to pull you from moment to moment. It's like walking uphill in the snow ... for an hour and a half. Don't be surprised with yourself if you get off the couch and run, screaming, towards the DVD player's power button. On the other hand, the supporting cast certainly makes lemonade out of the \\"lemon\\" lines they've been given! Elijah Wood and Malin Akerman are the most entertaining characters in the movie, while the two female leads, Paquin and Holmes, deliver performances that seem stiff and uninspiring. ... The worst part of the movie is overwhelmingly the writing. It had so, so much potential, but the writing just fell flat. The ending brought no resolution to the conflict at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad!!","review":"Let's talk about the good.

After reading the synopsis, I wasn't surprised that the plot was predictable. Still, even a predictable plot can be interesting if the performances are good, the chemistry is there and the writing is decent. None of the above applied in this case. I didn't find any of the relationships remotely interesting.....not between the friends or lovers. There was zero tension and little sincerity to make me care about the characters. Who cares who ends up together? I certainly didn't. I blame the writing mostly, but this cast of capable and talented performers really did nothing to help it along. I love all kinds of film and don't normally write reviews. This one was just so disappointing, it felt necessary to pass along a cautionary note to those who might be tempted by the famous ensemble.

I now plan to read the book so that hopefully it will give me more incite into these characters. I've read in other reviews that Anna Paquin demolished her character Lila. Which would be about right because I was rooting for Katie Holmes (Laura) the entire time. I honestly thought the movie was mediocre at best. It was also very boring at points as the characters mostly just talk. Even the parts that are supposed to be \\"funny\\" failed to even bring a smile to my face. There were parts that I almost liked about it, I am a sucker for tragic, angsty, love. However I guess I'm sad in a way because I cannot stand movies that don't at least give us an idea of what happens to the characters. If you're sick and demented and like to watch people cheat on each other and argue for an hour and half, this one's for you. Otherwise ...Save your precious time and watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal","review":"Frankly, where was the romanticism in that boring movie?

Remember the scene in the old 80's movie where the guy holds up the boom box (forgot the name), well, the part where the Duhanel holds up his cell phone and ran out to Kattie Holmes about put me over the edge...lame, lame, lame.

Tough to know where to begin about this movie, probably in my top 5 worst movies I've ever seen. It was tough to enjoy or appreciate the super shallow characters in this film, the script tried to provide depth behind their morally bankrupt actions but it didn't flow, the characters had no chemistry, and not sure the point of the entire film. The rhythm of this film was odd and never quite evened out, and the intimacy between Josh Duhumel and Katie Holmes was painful, their dialogue seriously strained. I ignored other low star reviews and was drawn to the cast, but don't waste your $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow pointless movie occasionally pretending to be artsy","review":"This movie had very little entertainment value and had no cohesive story line.

After finding some low-quality recordings, I finally decided it was worth it to pay for these, and man! What value! I've listened to this entire album probably eight or nine times already, and I've only had it a few weeks. Strangely, it also makes fantastic workout music. Weights, not cardio. YMMV. I wish I could give you the review of a cultured classical aficionado, but coming from someone who's only exposure to classical was the obligatory piano lessons in grade school... get it. Get it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faure's Finest.","review":"I am a fanatic about Requiems; I like them in all shapes & sizes. Faure's Requiem is at the top of my list. Where other major Requiems tend to be bombastic showpieces, Faure relies on subtlety and sensitivity to generate an exceptional feeling of loss. The music is deeply personal, exuding a deep respect for the loved one. You could actually mourn to this music, yet there is not a drop of schmaltz in it. Faure's setting of the text \\"et lux perpetua\\" is without equal. The soaring melody line of the \\"Pie Jesu\\" is the very essence of prayer. Only the kindest, most benevolent soul could be buried to this music. I wish I was that kind of person. Do not miss your opportunity to hear Shaw and his forces shed light on this masterpiece. This recording is a must for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Beauty","review":"This recording of these two masterworks is a gem. Shaw has put together a stunning recording of the Faure. However, the true treasure on this disc is Durufle's underrated Requiem. The sheer beauty in the written work, combined with Shaw's perfect interpretation is exquisite! Blegan and Morris, as soloists, add extreme beauty to the release!5 lush stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for keeping Long Distance Charges Down","review":"I can't tell you how angry this phone makes me.

PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE -- I do NOT recommend this product. For [money], it should have worked longer than 16 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliability problems","review":"The features and sound quality are top-notch, but I discourage purchase of this product because of reliability problems. I purchased two of these units, one for me and one for my parents. Both units failed within a year because a chip went bad in the phone causing static and disconnection. Panasonic did a good job of repairing my phone and the service tech was familiar with this phone's problem. Nonetheless, my next purchase will not be from Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Phone Ever","review":"This has got to be the worst performing phone ever.

Everytime I make a call, I use the handset to dial and put it back on the speaker phone to talk.

In all, I would never ever recommend this model of the phone to any body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was (and still will am since I've returned the phone) looking for a high quality speaker phone with a good range of operation for my home business. The phone is not intuitive to use (e.g. if you type in a wrong number, it's not obvious where the backspace button is, mute?). The receiver is awkward, heavy (compared to the Siemens model)and the notion that I'd have to replace the batteries at some point make this a return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Application Caution","review":"This phone seems to be hypersensitive to outside interference. To its credit, there is not a problem when the unit is in use and the clarity and sound quality are excellent. However, when the unit sits or is charging, 'Out of Range' conditions have occured requiring a complete power disconnect to fix. According to Panasonic customer service, something is interrupting the phone- to-base signal. My unit is currently at the repair center and its less than 90 days old."},{"rating":"1","title":"A problematic phone from day one.","review":"I've owned this model phone for just over one year and I have endured many annoying malfunctions; finally the handset is unusable. Frequently the phone will not dial the currently displayed number, but instead just gives you the dial tone. The only way to \\"reset\\" this behavoir is to cradle the handset for a second to restore normal operation. Occasionally, the hand set will display an \\"out of range\\" message even when standing next to the base unit; this in now a permanent malfunction. The sound quality from the handset is clear but contains some strange distortion that makes some callers sound mechanical.

After a year of ownership, my \\"out of range\\" problem occurs in about 1 of every 10 uses. In addition, the phone does generate more static over time, rendering a normal conversation quite difficult. Further, a large majority of people I talk with claim that my phone makes my voice sound very quiet. Finally, the phone is awkward to hold during a long conversation.There are good points. The answering machine is nice and relatively easy to use. That's pretty much it.Conclusion: I got suckered by the good looks of this machine. Believe me and everybody else here when we tell you that no matter how good it looks, the unit is not reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"I had a simple objective when purchasing my last cordless phone: clear and reliable operation. Unfortunately, I was lured by the good reputation of Panasonic and assumed their top-of-the-line model would fit the bill, especially given the high price.I was terribly disapointed. The phone is only 6 months old, and it is now totally useless. I usally can not create a connection between the handset and the base, and if I can, the audio is so bad the phone is useless.

I would strongly recommend against this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead at one year","review":"This phone worked great for almost a year. Then as I talked, I would hear a crackling noise. Finally, the crackling noise became unbearable. Now when I search on the caller id, I get the message 'out of range'. I thought it was the battery going bad (it has a re-chargeable battery); however, when I replaced the battery, it did not improve. Don't buy this phone. The service is poor too. I left a voice mail and they never returned my call. I bet I have cost Panasonic at least 6 phone sales by word of mouth. I proud of it too. It would be morally reprehensible to let people enter into a buying decision on this phone without letting them know it is a terrible contraption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance wears off...","review":"I bought this phone a few months ago from an office store. It worked very well the first couple of months. I then began to get some out of range signals, even though being just a few feet away from the base. Now, the out of range signals haven't increased as I've read in other reviews, but the sound quality decreased by about 50% along with much static when walking, to the point that I feel I need a new phone. I don't think it's Panasonic that is to blame here, but rather the 2.4GHz technology. So I will not get another 2.4GHz phone. Also, the ear piece is somewhat too open and it becomes difficult to maintain a conversation if your immediate environment gets noisy. I rate it two stars because I liked the design of that phone and it worked fairly well for six months. I do not wish to deal with their customer service because I have no time.I hope this helps some of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"no more display","review":"The phone looks good, and has a long range.BUT, you always need the user guide because the interface is not intuitive at all.

After numerous calls to Panasonic and angry letters, the best they could offer was a new model I could purchase for $50 in return for my silence (to which I obviously declined). With the number of horrible complaints they've received, I'm surprised that no one has threatened a class action lawsuit. Any lawyers out there interested?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Product","review":"I have owned this product only for it to spend more time in the Panasonic repair center than in my home. After 4 times of being returned to me, the product still doesn't work. Panasonic stated they would replace the phone if I CALL their repair center to get a copy of the repair history. I CALLED the repair center and they stated the only repair record they keep is the last repair.I have spent more money on this phone in shipping and batteries than I did on the actual product... Please avoid Panasonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible range but a bit fuzzy","review":"I really like the look of this phone - very high tech. And the range is incredible--I walked halfway around my neighborhood looking for the lost cableman who was parked down the road, instead of at my house like he insisted--the sound was like being right next to the base unit.Unlike other reviewers, I was disappointed in the sound quality - I find it a bit fuzzy. Especially if the person you're talking to is a child and not apt to speaking clearly I sometimes can't understand what they're saying. I've tried moving the base unit around in case of interferance, but to no avail. People tell me that I sound clear, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible experience with this phone","review":"Like others my phone went dead after a few months.

At first I thought it was my phone line, but I tried my phone line with other phones and it sounded fine.Bad phone. I am very dissappointed with Panasonic.

For first two months the performance was good. No problem at all. Third month onward the handset started showing \\"Out of range error\\" even though the handset was at 1 feet distance from the base unit. But with few retries, it was working. Fourth month onward, we started getting frequent \\"Out of range\\" errors and some noise disturbance while talking. Today, 90% of time, it shows \\"Out of range\\" and if it is in range, caller-id doesn't work and even if caller-id do work, you still can't hear from the other side, because of extreme noise disturbance. The blue-color scroll button also stopped working and doesn't scroll any numbers and again shows the same error \\"Out of range\\".Wasted a lot money, just because of brand-name. We switched back to our regular phone with caller-id."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this phone!","review":"Unfortunately, I didn't read these reviews until after I bought this phone.

After about 5 minutes on the phone I get this buzz that is so loud I can't hear the person I'm talking to. The buzz starts low and gradually gets worse. I've tried moving the base unit, unplugging appliances, messing with the antenna, and switching channels. All to no avail.

My phone lasted about one year when the out of range messages started appearing as well as the loud buzzing in the handset. My brother also bought the same phone with the same problems after six months. What seems obvious from most of the reviews as well as brother's and my own experience, is that this product is defective and Pansonic should be forced into a total recall with either replacement working phones or give everyone who bought this product all of our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works","review":"The phone provides a number of good features, primarily the extended range which gives great reception with little interference or fading. The hand set is extremely sturdy as the edges are encased in rubber which allows it to bounce back from drops of several feet. The speakerphone provides true duplex with very good quality.Now for the negatives: The microphone on the handheld distorts speech and numberous callers have complained about our muffled voices. The Answering system and phone commnands (such as directory) are complicated and time consuming to set up and difficult to access. I also question the quality of the phone. I used a headset with the phone and after 5 months of use, the connector for the headset started getting intermittent and then stopped working all together. Also, the microphone on the handset now work intermittently. I expect a phone to work for longer than 8 months. I'm going out to buy a new phone today. Definitey; will not be a Panasonic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"high cost/low performance","review":"I believed I was stepping up in product category when I purchased this unit. The manual specifications state battery life at about six hours and have not been able to finish a call longer than two hours without the battery running out and this is within four feet of the base unit. Has no hold feature and I see no difference in reception over my 900hz system."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY poor reception","review":"I purchased this phone a little over a year ago and, like other reviewers, as time went on the range dropped SIGNIFICANTLY. I've replaced the batteries multiple times and no luck. The problem appears to be signaling from the base to handset since everyone can hear me clearly but I can't understand a thing they are saying. Because of this problem, the caller ID only works 1/3 of the time (which makes me wonder why I'm paying $10/mo. for the feature). Also, you can't play messages from the answering machine while the handset is in use - very annoying.I got this phone to replace a Sony 900MHz DSS model that kept cooking the batteries. 3 years, two phones, and $400 down the drain. Don't get this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone I have ever owned","review":"I bought this phone only 1 year ago , for alot of money, and now it won't even work. At first you would only get the \\"out of range\\" message every once in awhile and it would only last for a minute. It kept getting worse and worse until now the phone will not work. All you get is the \\"out of range\\" while standing inches from the base unit.Also the programing of the phone is confusing. I have read and re-read the manual I don't know how many times and I still can't get the time and date to work.This phone is the biggest waste of money. You're better of buying a cheap phone that at least you know will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as everyone claims","review":"I've had this phone for 4 years and I have just now started having the 'Out of Range' error. Yeah, it's definitely obnoxious, but I managed to get 4 years of use out of the unit before it croaked. Up until now it's been an excellent cordless phone. The range is fantastic, the handset is very durable (it's been dropped probably hundreds of times), the caller ID and speakerphone features work as advertised and I never experienced any interference from other cordless phones or other wireless hardware. I'm going to look into getting my unit repaired but if that turns out to be more hassle than it's worth I will definitely be purchasing another Panasonic product as a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery doesn't last","review":"This phone has never been useful to us. You can talk 10 minutes and the battery starts beeping and the phone goes dead. We kept the phone on the charger when not in use BUT to no avail. We had to buy another cheaper phone and discard the Panasonic KX-TG2570B which cost $79.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKS!!!","review":"I bought this phone over a year ago. ... I like the style and design. I also like all of the features, but the quality completly diminished. The first 6 months was great. Then I started to experience crackling. Thought nothing of it and continued to use it. Now I can't even use it. You pick it up to answer a call....it pops up with this OUT OF RANGE. Goto check the caller ID and get OUT OF RANGE. [its just bad]. I also have a wireless computer network....but I have had that same network for about a year as well and never experienced these problems. I also have a 2.4ghz GE cordless phone that does not have any problems. I think it is just the quality of the phone......DON'T BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate talking on phone and love reading OUT OF RANGE?","review":"... I bought the phone in May, 2001, when I had just moved into an apartment next to a municipal airport in Indianapolis. I thought the interference was possibly caused by a RADAR station nearby, but once I moved into a house in 2002 I realized the phone itself was faulty. I called Panasonic and they said they'd never heard of the \\"out of range\\" problem ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey and poor quality - lost confidence in Panasonic","review":"Hi,I've had this phone for about 3 years now... Its been quite unreliable.The phone went \\"OUT OF RANGE\\" after about 6 months of buying it. It became unusable. Went to the Panasonic service center and got it repaired under warranty. The service person told me that the problem is VERY COMMON for this model. He said that there is a faulty chip or something and after repairs it will not have problems.But after a few months after repairs, the \\"OUT OF RANGE\\" kept happening. But now, it has become much worse and the handset hardly ever picks up when there is an incoming ring. There is also so much static that its become unusable.I've lost confidence in Panasonic after this product (Made in Japan) and I am considering other brands as replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it","review":"I too have this \\"out of range\\" problem after about one year of use. I e-mailed Panasonic Customer Service twice about this problem and have received no reply at all. I finally got fed up with this junk and bought a Uniden 2.4 GHz phone (TRU4485-2) to replace it, and the Uniden has no problem at all. So the problem is NOT because of the increase use of wireless network as one of the reviewers claimed. \\"Made in Japan\\" is not necessarily good. This is definitely one of my worst purchases in my life. And I will never ever purchase any Panasonic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 1 year","review":"I thought this phone worked pretty well when we first got it, but the longer we had it, the less we liked it. The reception is good, but that's just about the only positive thing about it. First of all, we lost the manual when we moved and it's just about impossible to figure out how to use any of the features, even just setting the time and date is difficult. Secondly, when you listen to your messages and you want to return a phone call, the answerer shuts off as soon as you turn the phone on. So if someone left a number to return their call, you need to write it down first and then turn the phone on to call. And thirdly, after a year of use, we're getting this \\"out of range\\" message almost every time we try to make a call, even then we're right next to the phone. I've had Panasonic phones in the past that have lasted over 5 years, but this one is a big disappointment, especially for the price. We're changing to Uniden phones which tend to work well and get good ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to replace in less then 2 years","review":"I got this phone in November 2000. The design and features are great. The only thing that I missed is ability to use speed-dial buttons - you always have to go through a directory. The range and clarity were pretty good in the beginning.Then several months ago it just started deteriorate. I have to say that I didn't really take good care of the phone. But then LCD screen became loose, some buttons became a bit sticky and, most important, voice became garbled. The called would hear me fine, but I can barely make out what they're saying.It's sad to replace this phone, but I'm going to give Uniden a try now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Phone EVER~ Don't Buy It!You;ve Been Warned","review":"This phone is the WORST!

DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unpleasant experience","review":"I bought this phone and used it for a little over a month and it stopped working. My first thought was that I needed a new battery so I contacted Panasonic via the number on the manual and they told me they were backordered and that I should check with my local stores. I tried these with no results. Can't a company take some responsibility for their replacement part availability?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Few few problems","review":"I've had this phone for about 2 years now and I haven't had any problems with it. The only problem that I am experiencing now, is that the battery doesn't hold a charge for anything longer than 20 minutes of talk time. Which, I understand, is normal of batteries. I've never had the \\"out of range\\" problem or anything like that. Of course, I do live in a semi small town in Iowa and not a remotely large city. So I have very little that would interfere with the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay \\"Out of Range\\" of this one","review":"An absolutely horrible phone. Do not buy under any circumstances.

I get severe static moments into any call, and the static simply gets worse during a call. Also, it now loses its connection with the base unit on about a third of attempts--even when I hold the handset directly beside the base! I get the message \\"out of range\\" in these cases. So, I'm here to buy another phone and would suggest you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for the first couple of months","review":"This phone is great in theory. After a couple of months, everything falls apart. I've read the other reviews and all complaints are consistent with my experience. I've owned my phone for less than a year and I'm throwing it in the trash. The range deteriorates with time and I often receive \\"out of range\\" warnings, even when standing next to the base. The sound is distorted and at times I hear nothing but static.I don't have time to go into detail, but this is the WORST phone I have ever purchased. You'd be better of with the $10 special from Radio Shack."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"I have owned several cordless phones and, in the long run, this was the worst. Performance was not much different than a 900MHz for the first couple of months, though there was an odd \\"muted\\" quality to the sound; range however dropped quickly. I was soon unable to go from one room to another without getting unbearable static. Not much later, the charging contacts got tempramental and the phone needed serious jiggling to juice up. Finally, after about four or five months of ownership, the phone died altogether.If there was just one problem, I might be tempted to blame a faulty unit; with nothing but problems, I have to blame the model. Over on the cnet site, you will find hundreds of similar complaints about the panasonic gigaphones.Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses calls","review":"We've had Panasonic phones for awhile and have always been happy with them. This phone misses calls though: we'll pick it up and it'll take a moment to connect then say \\"Out of range\\" even though it's next to its handset.I've missed too many calls with this phone and I'm here now shopping for a new phone.I strongly would not recommend this telephone: especially at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out-Of-Range and Out-Of-Patience","review":"I too have fallen victim of the infamous \\"out of range\\" problem. I paid the extra bucks for this crummy thing because I didn't want the hassle of an inferior phone. It just goes to show - you don't always get what you pay for. In addition to this complaint, my other pet peeves about this phone are: 1) the fake silver coating rubs off the handset turning the once metalic-looking object into an wornout-looking piece of garbage with spots of cheap-looking plastic showing through; 2) the display screen gets all greasy from being pressed against your face, forcing you to wipe it off before/after every use; 3) the rubber protective strip below the ear piece rubs off on every surface you place it down on, producing black scuff marks all over the house.Needless to say, my next phone will not be Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!","review":"The phone failed after 13 months of use.

They seem to work ok for about a month then the buzzing starts. It gradually gets worse to the point where you are out of range when you are standing right beside the base unit. The answering machine works but with no local dialing control to place outgoing calls it is just an answering machine. Do yourself a favour and buy another phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality and battery life","review":"I chose this 2.4Ghz phone + answering machine + caller ID for its features, and found that though everything worked, they didn't work very well. Like other users, I found the menu system difficult to use. The sound quality was marginal and wasn't even as good as my 900mhz phones from other manufacturers. On top of that, the battery started dying about 4 months after I purchased the phone. It can no longer maintain a charge. The same poor sound quality also exists on the answering machine, making messages difficult to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic 2.4 cordless w/Caller ID & Answering Machine","review":"if you're looking for an expensive disposable phone, this is for you.I paid $200.00 + for this phone that will only last a year or so.

Utilizing home automation products, so I'm very competent with using home electronics. Fact is that after 1 year or so, started developing static/noise on the line, progressively getting worse. Constant out of range messages, as well as no talk activation. Called Panasonic said it was cheaper to replace the phone than repair it. If I could purchase the board they explain that goes bad I would replace it. People that haven't experienced problems got the good ones. Before the 1 year phone worked great. So the people not experiencing problems should not critic the ones that got stuck with the lemons. Pansonic lost me as a future customer, and a class-action suit should come forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent range and clarity...","review":"I have owned this phone for 7 months, and the one thing I'm very impressed with is the clarity, which is the best I have ever had in a cordless.This phone also features a large oval button which you scroll either up/down, or right/left, for many of the functions. The one I like and find easy to use is scanning to see who has phoned you. The name and phone numbers are displayed very nicely and easy to read.What I do not like about this phone (and why I rate it 2 stars)is having to get out the owners manual every time I need to change something. Setting the time is a nightmare. Something as basic as turning off your phone's ringer is a project!And the very basic 're-dial' function we all know, is lost on this phone because you need to get out the manual to find the program to do it! VERY frustrating.What could have been a great phone is nothing more than an over-done, complicated mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"I... expected perfection from panasonic. I have 2 big complaints: 1)Its unbelievable how poorly constructed this phone is! It sounds ok, but the handset creaks whenever you just squeeze it a little while talking. Its VERY annoying because the noises are amplified thru the earpiece and actually hurts my ear. Its like the parts don't fit well together or something. While talking on the phone its impossible to hold your hand perfectly still, so every time you move it makes creaking sounds (sorry but thats the best i can describe it). 2)The base unit will frequently malfunction and won't even pickup incoming calls, so the phone doesn't ring. Nothing on the base will work when this happens so I have to unplug it, then plug it back in and it usually works after that but is a major pain in the neck. Customer service didn't help. I would stay away from this phone for sure!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Panasonic KXTG2570","review":"I was one of the first to breathlessly purchase this phone about a year ago. What a mistake! So many features that made Panasonics early cordless phones the best are gone and instead are replaced with confusing, ridiculous new ones. You can't do ANYTHING without the handset and good luck firguring out how to set the time. It is non-intuitive, you have to rinky-dink the phone in place so it can actually re-charge and it's range it questionable.With so many 2.4Ghz on the market now, there is no reason to buy this inferior product. My home just experienced an major power surge (blow-up the transformer). The Panasonic KXTG2570 was on the same surpe protector as my computer. The Mac is fine, the Panasonic KXTG2570 is FRIED and DEAD. I'm happy though -- now I have the opportunity to buy a decent 2.4Ghz phone.I love Panasonic; I own their VCR and DVD players and they are excellent.

The phone has a hissing in the background that drives you nuts,I constantly have to change channels to talk to anyone for more then 15 min and, and the phone recularly says \\"out of range\\" even though im 5 feet away). It's pretty sad, I live in an apartment and you'd think I was down the block the phone acts. The answering machine is horrid as well, sometimes you cant even hear the caller's message, and even my own message is crackled and has hissing in it. Save your money...Dont buy this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a Phone by its Looks","review":"I owned this phone. After three months the silver coating all over the phone started to peel and the printing on the face of the phone began to wear off. When I contacted Panasonic, they said this was caused by chemicals from my skin, i.e., makeup. I remarked there was not warning about using the phone while using makeup or having the phone come in touch with my skin. Ultimately, I am getting my full refund.The phone has other problems. Sometimes the screen doesn't work; I would get a message saying it was too far from the base when it was only 6\\" away; the phone wouldn't work in front of my house when they claim it will work up to a mile away.It's difficult to hold and overall just a pain in the neck to use.

I was looking forward to long range and clear reception, but it falls far short of any expectations the cost should imply, and all the other problems render the phone almost useless. We had a lot of difficulty hearing anyone because the mic picked up every noise in the house while talking and fed it back in your ear. We had a problem with out-of range cut-outs when standing right next to the base unit. You can not program any function without the manual right there to read the codes. Even the layout of the buttons was poorly thought out. I think Panasonic came up with a big loser on this one. I wish I would have returned it shortly after I got it.

Because i procrastinated I did not send it back to the warehouse as you have to do upon calling customer service.The phone is certainly not user friendly, who wants to press 3 buttons to redial a call and it only stores 30 numbers. I also own the SONY Spread spectrum 900 mhz and prefer it. However, this phone too, has failed on many occasions.The Panasonic ultimately was a big waste of money.

Its reception was getting worse and worse and finally died. We have another one at home. I tried the handset on it, which worked. So the problem was the actual recieving/transmitting machine which has the 2.4 chipset on it.The menu of the product is confusing and not smartly designed. You have a big blue button which should work miracles of OK/Exit/Menu/Up/Down/In/Out etc. Believe me, it is confusing.Reading from above comments, I feel like I should not send it back for repair, since they do not anyway.

I let the battery drain completely and then recharged the handset--the buzzing/binging actually got worse! After reading here about Panasonic's customer service (or lack thereof), I'm not inclined to waste any more of my time and money repeatedly mailing the phone back for repairs, so I'll probably end up trashing it.

They gave me $58 back, and pretty quickly. So it cost me about $11 (additional fedex cost to ship back) for trying it out. Not so great but not so terrible either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price !","review":"I purchased this item thinking it would be very relaxing , especially in view of the price. What I received was a beautifully packaged small fan. But pretty packaging doesn't relax one. What I expected was a soothing continuously variable sound. One would do better to buy an inexpensive small table fan that oscillates for about $19.00 and change . It would be a varying sound, at least, instead of a constant rush of air."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARPAC Sleep Mate- Good product","review":"Purchased the Sound Screen sleep mate about a month ago and it has definitely helped to drown out any peripheral sounds.

Now we and our boys stay asleep all night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"We purchased this dream machine for our master bedroom and it has worked great.

It works great! A few months ago one of our sons got a third shift job and was having problems with sleeping during the day, so I let him try out our Sleep Mate. He liked it so well that I had to keep retrieving it from his room every night before I went to bed, so I finally gave in and bought him one of his own. I would recommend this to anyone who has problems with sleeping because of outside noises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating, not soothing","review":"After reading the other rave reviews and purchasing this product, I was disappointed to find the noise the machine makes to be quite grating on the ears. I had a headache within minutes of turning it on. The product is essentially a small fan in a small plastic case; I found I slept much better when I turned on a full-sized fan, which doesn't make as irritating a sound, and which was a lot cheaper, too. I had hoped that using this product would save electricity (and alleviate my guilt about using fossil fuel to power a full-sized fan while I sleep) but the noise was just so irritating I couldn't use it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"just more noise","review":"I thought this would help in an office to reduce voice traveling however, what it really did was annoy me!

I am so thankful that I tried the machine beforehand for one night before giving it to him because the noise that came out of it is so loud and irritating, that the outside and upstairs neighbor's noise I was trying to mask seemed more bearable! This machine really grated on my nerves. I had to return it! I think this machine is fine if you are used to loud noises and like really loud noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love It!","review":"I bought this white noise machine a few years ago when I lived in a noisy apartment building near a freeway.

Unfortunately this novel goes off into drivel about princes and princlings wearing red and gold outfits and even has people riding horses and harvesting crops.This latest in the Andrej Koscuisko series from Ms. Matthews is the weakest of the series. Previous novels in the series were at times gruesome but also exciting and well written. The writing in this one is difficult to read requiring that I read a paragraph over a time or two to get it. The sentence structure is awkward and not always just to try to convey the strange world and language of the planet where the story is set.This novel does not stand alone. One must have read the previous novels in the series to enjoy this one and one must have read them recently enough to remember all about Dormitt Prison, and why what's-her-name hates Andrej so much or much of the story in this novel makes little sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTRE MI COLECCI\\"N DE","review":"LIBROS DE CHISTES, A ESTE LO LLAMO \\"MI PROZAC \\", porque me quita la tristeza como de magia y me hace reír como loquito !Muy latinos, muy buenos !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Al son que me toquen,¡bailo y canto!","review":"Quality: between mediocre and bad.

First, the author expends a great deal of energy demonstrating that there was a plethora of mindless plays and books about witches, etc. after the (unfortunately unsuccessful) attempt to blow up James and the Parliament. The author never seems to realize that what makes Shakespeare great is how he is DIFFERENT from his contemporaries.Secondly, the author appears to have an inside track on the mind of God. He states baldly that God was on Malcolm's side, and Malcolm is the most depraved brat in the Canon. Mr. Wills doesn't have a clue as to \\"What Happens in Macbeth\\".

This however works perfectly for securing it into a waist pack or other bag for discreet carry.Not recommended for training or practice, since its non reinforced, soon as you draw the gun, the holster lays flat and it takes two hands to carefully re-holster. But you get what you pay for. Thumb break is very nice and holds the gun securely.Works great for throwing it on quickly to run errands or step out of the house for a short time.

Once you open the tub, each tub in the box has it's own plastic hanger, which is also wrapped in plastic.

We eat them out of hand as well as adding them to cereal and baked goods. They are crunchy and slightly tart when eaten dry. Like most freeze dried fruit they can become quite soft when reconstituted but they are still far better than canned raspberries. These are not quite as good as the freeze dried strawberries but only because raspberries have larger seeds. I grew up eating raspberries right off the bushes and these really bring back memories.The price is not high at all when you consider the cost of fresh raspberries, 8oz dry is probably equivalent to several pounds of fresh fruit.

They start out fine for about 5 minutes, then konk out for no reason. They continue this way, turning themselves on and off until I get aggravated and shut them down. I could understand it if I had one bum fan, but for both to have problems is completely unacceptable. The only reason this review even gets 1 star is that there isn't an option for zero stars! Save yourself the headache and buy a Vornado."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.","review":"This fan is an absolute piece of garbage.

I made the mistake of assuming this was a packaging error and ordered a second one (with which Amazon was extremely helpful and quick.) The second one arrived in one piece, but was knocked over onto a pile of stuffed animals and the cheap plastic and tiny metal rings holding the fan blades shattered, rendering the fan useless.

Now, having seen all the Fontaine episodes, I think that no person could be better at singing Sinatra's greatest hits. I really love them all, no exceptions.

This CD might not be for everyone though. I also have several Sinatra albums, and while \\"This One's..\\" is excellent, Darren does not quite have the range and the smooth voice of Sinatra.

One of the items I needed to make this happen was a tea pot. Checked out various offerings on Amazon and decided on the SST (stainless steel teapot). It's a nice pot, holds twenty-eight ounces of liquid, more than enough for 4 six oz or 3 eight oz cups of tea. I find that I get a satisfying cup of tea using Rishi Earl Grey, three tea spoons to a pot with a four minute brew. The pot doesn't keep the tea as warm for as long as I'd like but that's what a microwave is for. The included tea basket works great. The handle is a bit awkward but all in all a good selection.

Wendell Berry loves his characters, but portrays them honestly, and makes you feel like you have known them too. The Memory of Old Jack isn't about nostalgia, it's about how people live. It's about human nature and the human condition, and though the circumstances that produced that moment in time have changed, human nature hasn't, at least where I live, and that's what made this book enjoyable. I plan to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring!","review":"Wow, what a surprise! I bought this book after reading all of the very positive reviews. What a mistake!

By the time the case is resolved, long after I ceased to care one way or the other, the author has written over 400 pages of uneven prose, punctuated, to be fair, by occasional dramatic episodes. However, there are way too many comments from Gunther about the complexity of the case, the political danger of the police proceeding as they do, and Gunther's hope that with just one more clue, the case will be solved.

When she's pregnant, he gets married AGAIN--toss the book at a wall, scream in rage, tear out intestines. At the end, \\"I was never with them....\\" (NOT A REAL SENTENCE) SERIOUSLYYYYYYYYY??????? WHAT THE HECK? If you like jealousy, go for it. If not, don't even look. And i agree with some reviews, she is rescued way too much for an amazing heroine. The summary on the back is terribly misleading...don't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read romance to be uplifted do not touch this book !!","review":"I don't know why someone would write a romance novel based on Alexander the Great as we all know it ends badly.I also don't know what I was thinking in picking it up, mabey it was the cover, mabey I thought that the couple would be happy in the end before he dies so young and have a happy hopeful ending for the woman.Boy was I wrong !!!If you wish to be deperessed this book is great for you.They are always arguing and never truley work it out right up to the end and the woman goes on to have a depressing and horrible end.If you look at romance novels to have at least a glimmer of happiness at the end don't bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my 6 hours back!!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't like the way the \\"hero\\" acted and I did not enjoy how he treated his \\"heroine\\". It may have been historically accurate, but if you read romance novels for warm and fuzzy tales of true love, DON'T BOTHER READING THIS BOOK.The hero, and I use this term very loosely in this case, is arrogant, selfish, delusional, politically nieve twards his companions, and completely clueless about the inner workings of women.The heroine is childish and prideful, but is good with weaponry which may be of some interest to feminists.I was surprised that it didn't have a traditional type ending, but historcally it remained true. To a point. (If my memories of high school are correct, Alexander the Great died of VD)The only thing worse than paying full price for this book, is that I wasted the time to read it. If you want to read this book, please go to a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This is not romance. Nor did it end happily. The hero treated his woman badly and I could not like him at all...and the heroine was annoying because she put up with it. I wish I had my .50 cents I paid for it back. And also the couple of hours I wasted on it. Please beware, even though this book is labeled as historical romance IT IS NOT. It left me cold while reading it and also at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEpressing!!!","review":"I must agree with previous reviewer. I made myself finish hoping for a happy (even if fictional) ending. Great cover! That's what made me pick it up. That and Judith French has had stories in anthologies with Hannah Howell, one of my favorites.I keep most of the books I read and take those I KNOW I'll nver want to reread to a used bookstore as a trade.

I don't know where all the 5 stars are coming from, I assume its the \\"BLS street team\\" promoting it, but this is clearly an inferior album to his previous efforts.

Not one single filler as far asI am concerned. Zack is my new insperation to pick up my guitar andstart playing again. His style of playing and writing is about asclose to perfection as you can get! Super clean,heavy,loud,crunchy,melodic,you name it Zack has got it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"Same rehashed cords...Zakk should listen to some other bands to learn some new techniques. Sounds like it could be played forwards or backwards and still sound the same. This combined with his 'free guitar' scam with 357 Customs spells the end of my need to hear his name ever again....sad.Avoid this album so you will only remember the GOOD stuff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak CD, Poor Effort","review":"While I really enjoyed Mafia, Shot To Hell comes off as a very weak CD. The opening song Concrete Jungle is a pretty cool tune but after that boredom and a terrible case of balladitis sets in. There are fully 6 songs on this CD that could be considered ballads or easy listening. Complicating the poor music is the vocals. Zakk must have phoned his vocals in over a cell phone on this CD. We've heard this method before but not this bad. In all, a very boring CD with one good opening song. Not worth spending your money. When you consider how many hundreds of thousands of dollars Zakk stole from his fans via his website via the 6 months of 357 Customs promotions, one must wonder if he really wants to give Zakk Wylde another penny of his hard earned money. My answer is a resounding NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zakk. Please stop making such weak releases!!","review":"Bottom line: Do not waste your money on this album.I love Zakk.. He is by far one of the best heavy metal guitarists of all time. He also was putting out some of the best music in the genre. But, for some reason, he has lost his ability to write a decent song. He has somehow forgotten that BLS is a metal band. Which is a huge problem, for Zakk's style just doesn't work when trying to write songs that are soft and new age. They over-expose his horrible lyrics (which work really well in metal songs), which aren't covered up but amazing riffs. The only solice you find is in waiting for the guitar solo.. Please Zakk.. Please!! Find your metal roots, and give us what we deserve... you are a complete example of what you always bagged on... Yes Zakk, you have become pretentious and lame... Please come back Zakk, we need you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zakk's trying to change, but it's for the worse","review":"Zakk's either getting too old to be heavy or is trying to get more radio play through softer songs, but it doesn't work for me. The slow, elton-john-wannabe songs will make you roll your eyes in boredom, and the lyrics are very lame.Zakk's strenghs are about heavy headbanging beer-swilling rythm that makes you want to raise hell like it's 1985, but you won't find that here, except for his single \\"Concrete Jungle\\". Even the album cover is a disappointment as it looks like something you'd see on a Weird Al album, not Zakk's.I give it 1 star for Concrete Jungle, I refuse to pay over 10 bucks for just one song though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Record, Zakk Wylde and the guys show growth","review":"Don't listen to the negative reviews, it is obvious that there are closed minded people who want one thing and don't believe in variety. I feel this is BLS best effort. The album has a mix of classic Zakk Wylde Metal but brings some softer, classical ballads to mix things up. I have to say, unlike mafia, which came on strong with Fire it up, this record deviates from rock, to slower songs, and cranks back up. Definitely shows that Zakk and the BLS gang have what it takes to make a true metal record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - things are going downhill for Zakk and Co.","review":"I just got to listen to this album all the way through and I'm really not impressed. It just isn't good. Music is not inspired, and his playing isn't nearly as tight as it once was. One or two of the tracks are OK, but there are too many slow rocker-ballads and not enough good rock. Has BLS become a side project for Zakk? I know he is recording an album with Ozzy, and I would have thought an album like this was below his normal standards. Sadly, it isn't, and us fans will suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF Happend to BLS?","review":"This CD is by far the worst effort from Zakk Wylde to date. The songs sound very rushed through and poorly written. And his overuse of the talk boxes is quite annoying. It sounds like he is in a huge rut. Time to take a break and focus a little more on your music instead of \\"pounding out another album\\" every year Zakk."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The Hell Happen???????","review":"I am a huge Zakk Wylde fan and I have bought anything and everything thru out his career from the begin. I was very dispappionted in the writing,the production,the mixing and at last THE MASTERING! Come on Zakk! you can do better than just putting out something that we all know that is not up to what \\" Zakk Wylde \\" can do. What the hell was the Exective producer:(Michael Beinhorn) a big name in this business doing? I rather wait 2 years where you can get recharge and have a better batch of songs...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Zakk won me over on one CD. He pretty much lost me on this one!Anybody interested in two tickets for the Chicago show at the Congress Theater?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shot to Hell","review":"I was a bit skeptical on buying this album due to the rewiews it was given on Amazon. I bought Mafia because I really liked Fire It Up, while not expecting too much. I loved Ozzy era Zakk Wylde, so I figured I would get it so I could enjoy some healthy guitar playing. I was surprised at the quality metal that Zakk was laying down and Mafia got me interested in BLS. The next album on the list was this album but even though I wanted to get it, I was hesitant because of the beat down it was recieving by these reviewers. I think that the album is great, and I think the first 5 or 6 tracks on the album made the money I spent worth it. If you are a fan of BLS I recommend getting this album. So far any investment I have made in BLS has come up worth it and this album was no let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"How does Zakk Wylde get away with peddling the same old trash. Spend your money on something better... like a banana skin drying rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst BLS album yet.","review":"You may hear people complaining about the album being full of ballads and think 'Maybe it's like Book Of Shadows'.

If say, for instance, you're well versed in Excel and want to port some of those skills over to learn Access, then you'll be frustrated. This book covers the very basics. It tells you how to do those basics, but never why. I'm an experienced dBase programmer from the good ole days, and I'm still trying to find the structural elements to build end user applications in Access using this book as a reference.

If you did buy it new and loved it, you can't pass it on to friends either because they won't be able to take the test!Also, if you buyNow, Discover Your Strengthsand use it well you probably won't need this book.

He embarassingly muffs all of his trademark guitar licks, so the back-up guitarist has to fill in. Tina only shows up for the encore, and her gyrations and histrionics are not enough to redeem this sub-par performance. Only worth it if you want to see a generic bar band playing Berry covers with a drunk Chuck staggering around in front of them.

Solti brilliantly conducts the score, Sass (Judith) and Kovats (Bluebeard) sing and act from deep within their roles, the scenic design captures, and recreates for the audience, the meaning of the drama, while the director, Scinetar, draws together the components into an intense love song plumbing the nature of love, life and death. For 56 entrancing minutes one is spellbound by the beauty, the lust and the suspense. Bartok's music and Balasz's libretto meld seamlessly with the performance. All-in-all this should be in any opera collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to Turn Off.","review":"This was one of the better documentaries that I've seen this year. It has some excellent interviews with the likes of John Milius and Dennis Hopper. It really wasn't about the sixties or seventies as much as it was about the age of directorial freedom in film. Before I saw it, I knew very little about Sam Peckinpah or Martin Scorcese. They are/were fascinating people as well as artists. The same can be said about George Lucas. \\"Easy Riders...\\" explains quite well the reasons why he went into semi-retirement after \\"Star Wars.\\" For any film buff, you'll be rewarded greatly by letting this play for two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dam!

The movie discusses the old movie system and how it was brought in to the 20th century, by a few directors such as Scorsese, Coppola, Peckinpah, Beaty, Penn and Denis Hopper. It shows how the directors like penn were influenced by french directors like Trafut etc. but what makes the film so good to watch is the interviews from the directors themselves.

The interpretation is way too ethereal for Rachmaninoff. I've listened to it several times now to try to figure out what's wrong, and I think it's this. Shaw goes for a totally legato line, which is great as far as it goes, but it smooths out the accents; and Rachmaninoff's music is much more varied than that. The parts that are supposed to sound like tranquil prayers do, but Shaw makes the parts that are supposed to sound like Russian folk tunes (no. 15) or dances (no. 7) or cries from the heart (no. 5) all sound like tranquil prayers too.

I have personally given this album as a birthday gift to both friends and family who can appreciated fine choral singing. This recording is worth the price alone for Karl Dent's solos---unimaginably beautiful singing. Not only is the quality of the singing excellent, the recording quality itself is another example of the Telarc engineers' efforts to produce a crytalline but warm reproduction of the venue.This recording should be considered a reference performance of this body of work. I don't speak Russian, but I can feel the devotion of the singers to not only the text but the intent of the words.

Now correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the most noticable difference between Christian and secular music the fact that there isn't cuss words in Christian music. You are supposed to guard the words that come out of your mouth. What comes out of your mouth is what's in your heart. I'm sorry but I just can't agree with these guys cussing in a so-called Christian album. I left a message a month or so ago and it never made it to the board. I want this message to get out because when I bought this CD I had no idea that it had that in it and if I would have I wouldn't have bought it. I was offended. I suggest that if you want good Christian hip-hop look to Cross Movement or Grits or 4th Avenue Jones'. This is not true Christian hip hop.

From the first time I used it,the lid has always been loose, with no access to screws to tighten it. This requires pushing down on lid (with a pot holder)to get the back pizzelle to bake along with the front ones. I bought this 5 years ago and now the heating elements must be failing because it bakes very unevenly, with many sticking, even after re-seasoning the grids. I have been making pizzelles since I was a child, helping my grandma and mom make them on an old-fashioned, hand held stove-top iron. I've had two other electric ones over the years, one with cast iron grids and one aluminum, and they are still usable, but cook slowly. I had hoped to purchase a newer, faster model, but this one is just a big disappointment. I will probably buy yet another one, but it will not be a Chef's Choice brand.

I searched Amazon, and based on the excellent reviews, I ordered the Pizzelle Pro. I have already (as of 1/2/11) made three batches of cookies, and am very pleased. I noticed when I was reading reviews, that some cooks objected to the time it took to make a batch of cookies. With this in mind, the first time I made the cookies I cut the recipe by two-thirds; i.e. instead of the six eggs called for, I used two. It didn't take too long, and I had a nice little batch of cookies. The only problem was standing at the counter for several minutes. So the next time I did one-half measure (3 eggs) and set up shop at the dining room table where I could operate the press and still watch TV and be part of family converations. This worked great and that's how I will make my pizzelles in thefuture.

But, we got the Villaware pizzelle iron instead and found this traditional size better suited to both standard cookies as well as filled cookies, ice cream cups, etc. that my wife likes to make.

I usually don't review books because whether or not you like a book usually depends on personality, and what you were expecting. But this book was awful. I made myself read it, but found that it read like one giant run-on sentence. She kept going in circles ( o.k. I get it you were lonely and misunderstood, welcome to adolescence).The hippie stuff was also very boring. It consisted of a very very short time in a commune ( six months I think), and some time living out of a mail truck. The rest was a relatively normal broken-home experience.To be fair this woman can definately weave words, and knowing that she is a poet, I think she should have stuck with that. Her poetry is probably amazing. Unfortunately,this book was undisciplined,self-absorbed, and like listening to someone ramble on and on saying whatever is in their head.

Unfortunately the editors of \\"Split\\" failed to cut this longwinded account down to something which could do justice to the pieces of Lisa's life really worth noting.

It also shed light on the painful experience of divorce when you're a kid, and how hard it is shuttling between parents and adjusting to their different worlds.

I found this at a bargain price and grabbed it. I had not known that drummer Joe Morello was playing with MMc before he joined Dave Brubeck in the mid-'50's. The only thing wrong with this, recorded when Marian was 80, is that she and Joe and bassist Bill Crow probably had insufficient time together in rehearsal. Therefore, the 13 songs chosen are pretty basic and come off as competent but not inspired renditions. The fact that each is a geezer is not the problem (I'm 58 myself, and I believe Shearing and Brubeck still produce good music at 80) but I think if the trio had had a couple more weeks rehearsal, a more adventuresome set would have resulted.

I was also hoping for definitive answers on which poses to avoid (I still don't know whether I can safely do reclining hero pose).

(They're actually pretty complementary, too: the differences in tempii are noticeable, and each conductor does a lot with the choices they make). The Dohnanyi/Cleveland set benefits from more updated recording technology, but I also like Dohnanyi's approach. He's not afraid to pull out various sections to reveal details we sometimes miss with von Karajan. There is also a force and grace to some of the slower movements such as the 7th's... and when the 4th starts in earnest, it's wonderful. The 9th is superb, and I find the sound clear, but to be honest with you it will not rivet you the way a live performance will.

Something I can live with as long as it cools off the room.Performance-wise, my 10x14 room called off within minutes of installation. Thankfully, I bought two and put it in the other bedroom as well. Works perfectly for SF Indian-summer days. The twin fans--you can have one in exhaust mode (pulls the hot air out) and the other in Intake mode (blows air in).Sitting cooler in SF."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"I did not get what I ordered, so review is tricky.

Too bad this particular item doesn't fill the bill. To begin, the pen is too long, about an inch too long. Because it is heavier than most pens, and because that weight is distributed unevenly (toward the top) the thing is awkard to hold. Terrible balance. Making things worse, the finish is very smooth, so the pen tends to slip around in your hand. The stylus is great, but it requires both hands to switch from the stylus to the pen (requires twisting or rotating the two ends in opposite directions). Finally, the ink pen glides over the paper like the tip of an X-acto knife. So, poor balance, clumbsy mechanics and mediocre performance. Strike three.

The laser pointer and LED light components of the pen seem to work well--the other end is the problem. The ballpoint pen writes poorly. The ink does not roll out smoothly. Of course the pen-insert can be replaced, but it's really not worth replacing. The greater problem with this 4-in-1 device is that the twisting mechanism that allows you to select between pen and stylus is loose--it's poorly and imprecisely machined--so the extruted tip doesn't stay out when you apply pressure to it (i.e. when you try to write). You can feel the intended catch when you twist the barrel, however the it doesn't actually catch. Not adequately anyway.

However, I was never able to evaluate the light as it simply did not work. At first I thought it was the battery, so I changed them and tried again... nothing.

There is no question about the weight loss. I can vouch for that.

In our early seventies now, we haven't felt so good in fifty years.Now in this book Dr Fuhrman has condensed the advice that has been so helpful to us into a simple, easy-to-understand form that is still rigorously based on scientific evidence about human nutrition.Most importantly, we think, he has couched his diet recommendations in a positive form--namely, to eat foods yielding the greatest nutritional value per calorie.

Otherwise your salad and veggies just wash through you; you'll find it very uncomfortable and it will impede your daily life.So be sure to supplement your healthy new diet with enough soluble fiber, including apples (peeled), applesauce, soy/tofu, oats, dried beans and peas, carrots, and, of course, psyllium.

We read a book together every month, it was her month to pick the book, I thought I would be bored out of my mind. I was wrong!

It is the most effective and healthiest diet I have ever seen and the only one I have ever lost a substantial amount of weight on. I speak from direct experience and not heresay. I have lost 70 pounds on this diet over the last year as well as an exceptional improvement in health. I have not had a headache in a year, not one cold this winter and my skin cleared up from a longstanding problem.The book is extremely well researched and documented as well as being very readable. Everyone I have ever spoke to who has ever followed this diet, even those who didn't stick with it, said that it worked well when they followed it.Read the book, try it, it did me a world of good!

That's saying a lot since I've had a long dieting career. It's new information that's working for me. The first two weeks of the initial 6 week plan, I lost 14 lbs. and I feel great! None of the other plans ever made me feel this good.Through this information I'm removing myself from several risk-factor groups that I was not happy to be in.It's about more than weight-loss, it's about total health, being accountable for yourself and getting real results.

She thought that it would supplement my healthy lifestyle. The author makes the point that we are what we eat-essentially that to eat saturated fat and animal products and to barely eat green vegetables will set us up for health problems and early death. He cites many scientific studies to support his theories. His arguments are compelling but he states them to the point of reader exhaustion. This book does not have a lot of suggestions for how one would gradually adopt this way of eating. Overall, I will incorporate some of his ideas. I read his newest books which are more specific about how to eat and live this way including sample menus for the first few weeks. They are too restrictive for me but it seems that they are extremely healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little more truth in advertising would have helped...","review":"I can summarize this weight loss plan simply: become a vegan. Not a vegetarian, mind you, but a no dairy, no eggs, no kiddin' vegan. To be fair, the author does offer a \\"Seven Day Plan\\" for non-vegetarians but that is little more than a concession on his part. The narrative of the book says that the only way to really live an optimally healthy life is to become a vegan.I have no problem with people who are or want to become vegans. Furthermore, I have no doubt that I would lose weight like a conventioneer loses money at Caesar's Palace on this diet. I, myself, just don't want to eat a pound of kale every day for the rest of my life. Or bok choy. Or rapini. I wish I did. I just don't. If you do, this is the diet book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"I want to add my applause to that found in most of the rave reader reviews. It is an absolutely wonderful book. (One of the interesting things is the collection of highly complimentary comments by numerous significant physicians listed on Fuhrman's own web site, www.drfuhrman.com)One of the easily missed but valuable and rarely found comments concerns hunger--its role and nature (see the book's index), although Fuhrman could have said a bit more in that context about the question of the timing of meals.As for minor criticisms: Fuhrman could have paid more attention to other nontraditional approaches to health (e.g., intravenous chelation; colon hydrotherapy) and commented on how they might relate to his own nutritional approach. But on the whole, I just cannot say enough good things about Fuhrmans very valuable contribution. As he notes, it is not for everyone (see some of the readers' comments), but that's just too bad for those who cannot or will not use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat to Live","review":"Excellent, easy reading in laymen's terms.

At the time I was working out rather aggressively for a workout competition and was having tremendous trouble dropping to a lower weight class. As instructed in the starting chapters I read the book all the way through before beginning this diet. I successfully lost 15 pounds doing this diet. I thought at first it wouldn't work for me because of increased energy and protein I needed to accomplish my goal, but it worked fine and I never found myself lacking. I only give this 4 stars because it is VERY aggressive and requires a tremendous amount of dedication to maintain it. Treat it like a diet and the affects will be temporary; treat it as a lifestyle change it will last. After my training I stopped following the guides in the book and the weight came back rather quickly. Because of the drastic reduction in sodium during the first several weeks if you stop after this process your weight in all likelihood will immediately return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat to Live","review":"This book is very good and should be read by everyone.

It's a nice book... aesthetically.Inside it has a number of Franklin's writings; stuff he published in his newspapers, essays, letters, and of course it has his autobiography at the end. That's the part that I actually read. The autobiography is excellent. It gives you a real flavor for the kind of life that we all can live.

I love their commitment to Christ and the work of the gospel and their dedidcation to their craft. I would recommend this dvd because it shows the country wide spread and acceptance of this form of gospel delivery. These artists have a desire to reach the lost and their skills are on par with secular artists; that's what God requires, excellence.I live in Philly and the one thing I pray to see there is a mass Gospel Hip Hop concert to compel our young people to hear the gospel which would help destroy the spirit of murder in our city!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Hip Hop","review":"This is an okay video documentary on what some artists are doing in the area of creative worship.

The bulk of the book is a word-for-word repeat of generic moving information that has nothing to do with Los Angeles in particular. Additionally, the part of the book that *is* specific to Los Angeles appears to leave key areas out. The Newcomer's Handbook series, on the other hand, is completely specific to the L.A. area -- no boilerplate information here. You'll find more-detailed neighborhood info, better maps, and more pertinent information on services that can help you find places to live.

Strawberry Shortcake makes Barney look like a talented genius. Flat characters, extremely low budget animation, and a dull plot are the *best* things this animated children's film has to offer.

And once you've heard the first lame \\"berry/very\\" switch (e.g., \\"that would be berry excellent!\\") the remainder are like hitting your thumb with a hammer over and over again. The only reason we play this CD is because our two little girls (ages 5 and 3) enjoy it and there is nothing offensive content-wise. (Indeed, there's almost nothing content-wise, period.)

There are some great lessons in this DVD - of the joy of giving rather than receiving, of how important friendship is [more so than presents] and of course of treasuring quality time in the company of good friends.

The AccuTemp has been designed on basis of a wrong inference: that its operating temperature has two digits. This is a kind of Y2K problem. When the temperature is 9x deg F the readout begins to hesitate, and at 99 the motors start thrashing, changing speeds, stopping, restarting. Even when set up in direct, i.e. bypassing the thermostat, when the temp readout hesitates the motors also vary speed although not as much as when used with the thermostat. Holmes customer service and tech service proved ununderstanding. Until they fit their AccuStats with 3 digit redouts, I advise not to buy the fans if you are going to use them with temperatures above 9x deg F. Definitely not if you are like me in Arizona.

Even when it seemed they were on the ropes, someone always stepped up (i.e.-Robert Horry). Jason Kidd was the true 2002 MVP, but the Lakers are still the champions. Sacramento may be upset, but it's their fault. They were challenging, but who won Game 7 of the Western Finals, on the road, in overtime? Kobe and Shaq was a 1-2 punch that was unstoppable. Even though the dynasty is over, they rank as one of the best teams of all time. This is a great DVD because of the inside footage, as well as the extras.

It is powerful, and really moves the air. I bought one for my cubicle at work against the other recommendations. It is a little loud, but not a nuisance on the low setting (which still moves the air quite adequately). If it is turned on to medium or high, it's just too noisy for a cubicle. For an office with a door, it may be just fine. If you're in a cubicle in a relatively quiet office, run it on low, and you'll be just fine.The footprint for the fan is quite large.

Your fan blades will get dirty and inefficient over time and you will have no choice but to toss this in the garbage. We have a thread that somehow wrapped itself around the shaft. Can't do anything about it or the serious dust collected on the blades... The engineer who designed this should be drawn and quartered. Or perhaps it's another fine example of planned obsolescence, only they unwittingly designed the product to die too soon. Big fail.Does it blow well for the first several months? Sure.

After buying it from a local department store, we positioned it above the top shelf of a large book case and plenty of room to oscillate the complete 90 degree swing. We were pleased instantly, particularly with it's performance throughout the night. Strangely, it would develop repeating strange noises. Finally, the switch that locked it into a specific position, disabling the oscillation, became loose and would work itself into the locked position with each swing. We were very disappointed.

(I had not seen the bad reviews yet.) Well, it's none of those things. It is ,however, an obstacle to mow around in the back yard. My daughter will be 4 this year and still has never been able to get it to do anything. The ball has deflated some so her feet touch the ground but it isn't bouncy enough to actually have fun bouncing it. My soon to be 2 year old can't even begin to ride it.

First we bought sand that was too wet. My son and his friend were dying to get on this thing, so I had to go back out and get 90 lbs of dry sand. Also, it tells you not to get sand in the spinning part, which is impossible because the hole for the sand is 2 inches from the spinning part.Not very happy at all. And it was expensive. By the way, when it was finally ready to ride, the kids were on it like 2 minutes and were bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I bought this last summer and it has had about 5 minutes of use total.

Since she loves jumping and bouncing, I was excited to get this for her, thinking it would be hours of fun for her. WRONG! It doesn't swivel, and the child had better be larger-than-average to apply enough weight to get the thing to bounce. The \\"arm\\" of the toy is heavy and unless alot of weight/pressure is applied, it just sits there. The ball doesn't inflate enough to do much of anything, and is just taking up space in our yard. She still attempts to play on it every now and then, but is always quick to find something else of better interest.Also, putting it together was frustrating. I am very good at assembling things, but this was a test in patience.

We decided to pull it out from the corner of the garage and give it another shot this year since he will be 3 this summer and has grown quite a bit. Nope...he still doesn't touch so there is no whirling or bouncing again this year. I decided to give it a try and I am 125lbs.

Sure, I read all of the reviews with the complaints and quite frankly, I thought they were a bunch of whiners. Having lived through the experience, I cannot emphasize how long it takes to funnel through sand (especially damp sand) into the little hole. After hours of working the sand through the hole my son spent about 3 minutes on the ride. I think that Little Tikes underestimated the ages for this toy and now we have a huge, heavy paperweight in the middle of our play room.

It is now in the middle of our yard collecting dirt {on the ball}-- I'm waiting to see if she will grow into it, but I'm doubtful. At her birthday party a few months ago, I watched some of the older kids playing in the yard, and even the four-year-olds got bored on it fast.I'm very glad we didn't spend the money on it, but I wish mom had read the reviews before wasting her money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I purchased this toy after reading POSITIVE reviews on it.

We got a little bouncing but not much else.I was surprised to read that Little Tikes stated that they never receive complaints on the item (I had called them once, my self, prior to returning the whirlybounce to the store). It is a great idea but they should add some sort of metal hardware to the whirly portion...and make it easier to clean...and easier to bounce...and..... ;0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"whirlybouncer rider","review":"My kids did not enjoy this product at all. It did not bounce and whirl. my kids were tired and bored on it they did not stay on it long because they had to push and work very hard for it to bounce at all for them to have a little enjoyment out of it. the item does not go high they have to use there legs to do all the work i give this product a thumbs down, and alot of my friends bought this for their children and they all said the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The picture gives the impression that your child can spring and float fairly easily around in a circle...like a teeter tater on a merry go round...that is not what it does.

Not only his style but also his outlook has changed. Whether it is his own wry way of viewing the poverty of Africa versus American life or the realization that he is no longer punk rock and is now an icon. Rollins' self-awareness has consistently been his strongest artistic virtue. His writing in \\"Smile\\" shows he recognizes his growth and evolution. Rollins does not fear aging. He embraces it. Covering the period before the end of the previous incarnation of the Rollins Band, he shows us that 20 years in the business have made him not only wise but ready for any challenge he faces. Solitude truly is his hard won ally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Check","review":"In his third installment of the Black Coffee Blues series (Black Coffee Blues and Do I come here Often?)

It's written in the first person, which I don't like, but I read it anyways ... and was glad I did.The romance in it was frustrating at times and definitely took backseat to the plot, but man, what a plot! The book kept me on the edge of my seat. Throughout the story there are various threads weaved through that you can't quite fit into the picture (just as in real life). It's not until the end that they all converge and everything becomes clear (again, just as in real life).Great job Ms. Nobel!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya'll is not singular!","review":"The book was an average read, however, the author's use of dialect writing was quite distracting.

Just because Arizona is in the southern part of the United States does not mean it's the South. While expressions such as y'all aren't uncommon in Arizona, other parts of the dialogue in this book seem ripped straight out of the Southeastern US. Cattywampus? That's something I've heard in Mississippi, but never west of the river. Other descriptive elements the author added for southwestern flavor also fell flat. Unfortunately, it sounds like a book about Arizona written by (and for) snowbirds.I'd have given this book 1 star but I enjoyed the plot. It's a shame the author didn't suspend her southern stereotypes long enough to get a proper feel for the state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Effort but Disappointing","review":"I found this novel to be predictable and disappointing. Basically, I think it was a good attempt at writing an interesting read but it fell flat with character and plot development. The repetitive \\"damsel in distress\\" scenario did get rather tiring.Overall, I kept thinking it was a slightly more adult version of the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew. These are good models upon which to write but not for an adult audience. I did not realize this was part of a series (as another review said was the case) and this is a compliment to the stand alone nature of this installment. However, I won't be reading the others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boobs and Buns","review":"This novel is obviously written for those who are interested in a quick, easy read... short sentences, silly dialogue (boobs and buns??) inane characters and an insipid, vapid plot.

It actually did help me a lot! I would hug her if I met her in person! The only negative I can say is that I don't think she ever really needed to lose any weight so isn't really a weight loss book but is more about dealing with food addictions which it does a marvelous job. Why the advice on how to eat? I skimmed those parts because I wanted to get back to the important stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is the only book I have ever read where I felt like the author knew exactly how I was feeling.

Nancy writes with a funny,chatty,candid style that speaks directly to the heart.With every turn of the page I found a ah-ha, yes that's how I feel.Her positive enthusiasm, and warmth is very inspiring.Showing us how to deal with real life situations and using her tools of how to make daily food choices and journaling to find the real issues behind the food is so helpful and very doable. This approach to working with and for yourself is really the key to being free from the distraction of food as a way to hide yourself.You will love the feeling when you read that you are not WEAK of WILL or ALONE.When you read this book you will laugh, cry, and at the end wish you could meet this remarkable woman to say hi and give her a hug of THANKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"Nancy has the most wonderful writing style. I felt as if a good friend were telling me things.It wasn't easy, I'm sure, to bare herself in this way, and I really give her credit for her honesty, bravery, and attempt to help others.One of the themes of the book, \\"Deprivation leads to binges\\" was really (forgive me!) food for thought. I realized that this is a stumbling block for me, and to understand it really helped me. Other hints helped me as well.She well addresses the emotional side of overeating, or of bingeing. And again, brought up some things to really think about. I almost felt the lightbulb switching on, above my head a couple of times.This is a great book for anyone who has food issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphics look nice, but maps are a problem","review":"You can't beat the price for this very colorful atlas with lots of pictures and graphs that kids will like, but it has a major flaw in that almost every map is split by the tight binding. Information is lost by being buried in the gutterless pages, which makes the maps almost usless. Hopefully, future Scholastic (and other publishers') atlases will be designed with a map on one page and the graphs, pictures and info on the other. We had high hopes for acquiring such a reasonably priced atlas for our library patrons to use, and were very disappointed. It's a shame to waste such nice resources on poor layout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for my pool","review":"Bought this for my above ground pool, was supposed to work on my pool, but it was far too big and hung down in the water.

It tore right on the vertical seam directly above the tie line. It was extremely tight from the first time we used it, but seemed like it was made well. Wrong. Before the seam tore -- which has now branched out to the top horizontal seam going around the pool -- one of the small holes in the center tore. We don't have any children and are very careful with items we purchase. So, after just 4 weeks we are contemplating a tarp or purchasing another cover at least one or two sizes larger. That would fix the issue with it being to way to tight, but I don't have any idea why the ventilation hole would tear. I want to go with a tarp, but then we have to fuss with a line/rope around the top every time. Outside of the cover being a hassle, we love the pool. I highly recommend you buy a cover one size larger than your pool size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holes ???","review":"The other reviews would have been helpful if I had seen them. The picture nor description show that the new product has several small holes and one big hole (with screen)in the center. I had a previous cover (without) holes that worked great. I presume the holes in the new version are to prevent drownings, but no explaination is given. The new version tends to sink, allows water to evaporate, and allows dirt to get into the pool. It is better than nothing, but I prefer the old version. My reaction may have been different if they had bothered to change picture and / or desfription."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok.","review":"This pool cover does not keep all the dirt out, because there are small holes in the center of it that the dirt come through, but it is better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Pool Cover","review":"Very dissapointed at product, not as it was listed, or as viewed on picture at all!

However, when using it to cover my 10' x 10' pool, I found that it was much too large and that it laid in the water instead of stretching across the top. Attempts at using the drawstrings to tighten the cover across the pool were in vain, and actually resulted in the cover splitting where the crawstrings come out. Great design, good material, just entirely too big for my size pool.

It comes with a bunch of holes in the center of the cover which pretty much defeats the intended purpose as all the smaller leaves, twigs, bugs, and dust end up in the pool. There was no explaination in the packaging . . . I can only guess it was to make it easier to remove after a rainstorm?

It was fairly easy to set up. I wish I had put level sand under it though. The ring needs aIring up about every other day, but it is easy to do. I understand all the water will spill out if it deflates. But it was perfect for the age grandchildren I have. It comes about to the thighs of the six year old and knees of the eight year old. They aren't afraid of the water, so they could swim with minimum supervision but not alone. It is 12' across, so it was great for adult floating as well. I love this pool and highly recommend it for this age child. I bought a cheap pool cover, but it was impossible for one person to put it on. I then bought the one made by Intex.

They're pretty large in my opinion (about quarter sized, give or take) and do allow quite a lot of dirt/insects into the pool despite the cover being on. This could possibly be remedied if the holes were all mesh covered, however, on the one I bought (10' size) *none* of the holes have mesh. The 12' cover seems to have one larger drain hole in the center that is covered with mesh vs the dozen or so completely open holes that the 10' cover has scattered around the top. If I could find the box for it, I would probably return it and try the 12' cover, since the 10' is pretty large on the 10'x30\\" pool anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for price","review":"In my first attempt to tighten the cover around the pool, the strings provided cut directly through the flimsy plastic.

It still protected the pool for the most part, but allowed the cover to flap in the wind. Overtime, the stretching caused the cover to sink below the water in the middle allowing debris to mix with the water. The cover would slip out from under the debris (like leaves) when removing. Finally, the seam across the middle began separating. I contacted the seller, but was told their was no warranty. I can't recommend it for more than 1 summer (2 to 3 month before separating).

This works well for that purpose. No, it won't keep the rainwater completely out because there are little holes in it. You really don't want it to do that, or the weight of the water will make it collapse in and it will get way too heavy for one person to remove. Here's how it works in our house: the cover can be put on or taken off by one parent working alone. You just pull it down and work your way around the pool. Our particular pool consists of three inflatable rings, so we simply pull it down to the joint below the topmost ring. Then we tie it. I've had it stay on through thunderstorms and wind, so I doubt anything short of a tornado will move it.

In addition, the filter pump that comes with this pool is junk. It never lasts more than a month before it stops working. I ended up purchasing a higher quality pump which has been operating for over 2 years without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits, but...","review":"This fits and its of decent quality. However, it has holes in it for whatever reason and so there is constantly water on the top and then god forbid a bird shits on it or there is a storm and debris collects on it. Now you have a disgusting mix of crap in your pool. If I had to do it again, I'd opt for one without HOLES ON IT. That is just silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Small and has HOLES??","review":"We have a 7'6\\" pool and this cover wouldn't even make it from one side to the next. Also, get this it has holes in the center. Why would I want a pool cover with holes in the middle??? The idea is to keep dirt and rain out not sift it. Since shipping it back would be about the same as a refund its going in the garbage or to Goodwill.

The description says the cover is used to keep stuff out of the pool... how is that even possible with the size and amount of holes there are on it? Half inch round hole do nothing but let just about everything through, with the exception of large leaves and twigs from the tree above.

Our pool was a bit unlevel (but not terribly) and this may have contributed to the problem but definitely needed 2-3 people to try and get it on. Really unhappy that it would tear so easily and can't imagine having to put this cover on the pool on a daily basis. We left it off after this and don't imagine we'll get much use out of it due to lack of ease as well as the damage that already exists from the very first time. Too bad since we've enjoyed the actual pool purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed for Intex pools only","review":"I purchased this cover thinking it would be the perfect size for my eight foot wide circular wading pool.

Had it fit, though, it would have been ideal for my purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done for the right price","review":"This cover is exactly as expected and the price is right. The holes are not a big deal. It is easy to put on and remove (we do it every night, mainly because we dont want to change our filter as often as they suggest.) Our only problem is finding somewhere convenient to put the cover in between uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better!","review":"We purchased this 12' cover as a replacement for the 12-14' cover we originally bought (which sagged and was a nightmare to get off after rain). This one is a much better fit and I'm so glad we got it. The only issue I'd say is that it is very snug which means your pool has to be perfectly level and round for the best fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sized right","review":"We have a 12' pool and our old cover (the one that came with the pool)worked great. It wrapped completely around the tube and we were able to pull it tight and it stayed on in all kinds of winds. This cover barely reaches. In fact it doesn't wrap all the way around the blow up tube and the wind keeps blowing it off. It is simply too small. I recommend ordering a different brand or ordering a 14' one. Also this type of material doesn't allow the sun to warm the water, it is too thick. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Picture is VERY misleading. It is not blue, but more of an army grey color. It is not stiff, but more like a car cover. Once the cover is one, which is difficult by oneself, it ties. It you don't tie it tight enough, and there is a strong wind, it will blow away. Also, there is no way to get it as taught as in the picture. There are about 10 holes around the center which allows a lot of debris in. This is not anything like the picture at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I am really disappointed in this cover; I am going to buy a better cover next year. When it rains water just sit in it and it is has made the cover bigger; it is so thin and cheap made. I have to get a shop vac to get the water off the cover before I remove it. It is very hard to take off and on.

My rating would be a 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!","review":"I have a very nice carved slate table and I wanted a clear cover to use, so the table itself could be seen underneath. Don't waste your time on these cheap covers. I figured for only $8 I would try it and see, but it is not a cover at all. It is more like a large piece of clear raincoat you see tourists wearing. It is completely flat with no corners shaped for the table, so the edges just drape over the sides and pockets. The tip of each \\"corner\\" has what looks like a coin about the size of a nickel sewn in it to weigh the edges down over the sides. I threw it in my garage to use as a rain cover instead if I ever need one. Save your time and $8, and buy one of the real table covers for $20-$30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"There are holes in the cover (for ventiation I guess) and they let stuff in including water. The water eventually fills up on top of the cover & then the cover becomes to heavy to pull off without all the junk that has landed on top of the pool cover going in too. Also, by having the pool covered and the fact that the \\"filtration system\\" isn't too swift (to keep the water moving), algae & mildew form in the pool. So, I think I'm just going to try a small swimming pool net instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!!!","review":"My cover from last year needed to be thrown out at the end of the season, so I bought this one.

Easy to set up. I would recommend purchasing a filter system for a larger pool to ensure a very, very tidy pool. We live along conservation land, so more leaves and bugs to fall in but I also hate cleaning. We had our water tested at a local pool store and then just purchased water treatment for hot tubs. You will have plenty of supplies for a couple of seasons. Our friends have it now and are very happy. The solar blanket sold separately held in a lot of the heat so worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sure it was the best solution!","review":"I bought the pool cover to help keep my pool water clean, keep bugs and other stuff out.

Cheaply made, no durability what's so ever, you can pretty much poke your finger through it with very little effort. C'mon folks, let be honest here.

If it rains, and there were no holes, the cover would fill with water, making it incredibly heavy and hard to remove.I don't get a lot of debris (leaves, etc.) or dirt in my pool, I just get a ton of bugs, and for my purposes, it's worked well. If you live in a dry, windy area, where you would get dirt blown in, it would HELP, but the drain holes would still probably allow some to enter, but I'd venture a guess that this cover would still be a big help.It stays on (which is more than can be said for other covers), and has kept me from having to use my net to clean out bugs quite as much, so to me it's well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pool Cover - 15'","review":"The picture of the cover is a little off.

It also ties around the edges instead of having an eleastic band to cinch it to the upper rim. When you tighten down on the string to cinch the cover tight the flimsy plastic skin will tear. There are holes in the center that will lay into the water and then let the water come through. This will nearly pull the cover off the pool.

I contacted Intex and I am waiting for an anwer.albertocardonape@gmail.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design","review":"As you probably already know, this cover has holes. These holes are meant for rain water to be able to drain into the pool, so that you can take it off after a heavy rain. Although that makes sense, the holes are much bigger than necessary (approx. 2 inches in diameter) and allow leaves, bugs, and basically ANY debris to easily accumulate in the pool. Smaller drainage holes or, better yet, a mesh lining could easily prevent these contaminants from getting into the pool, but INTEX just decided to punch a bunch of big holes into the \\"cover\\".Unfortunately, this is just a poorly designed cover that really doesn't seem to serve any purpose except to advertise for INTEX. If you are looking for a cover to help keep debris out of your pool, look somewhere else, because this one is all but useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"10' pool cover","review":"The pool cover has 10 perfectly shaped holes in the center & 10 more about a foot out from the center ones.

It's 2.5' deep so he can stand up whenever he needs to but yet deep enough for him to totally submerge and practice swimming. It's also big enough that ALL of us can get in with him (mom, dad and big bro). Sure it's a bit crowed when we are all in but it's still big enough that we aren't touching or on top of one another. Even my wife's inflatible pool lounger fits inside it!!

It does, I mean did that job until it ripped. The problem with this product is that it is not made out of a very good material and rips very easily. Especially along the seams where it ties.

Unlike the picture, the cover does have about 6 holes near the center. I can only assume this is to let rainwater through. Any dirt or small items that land on the cover, usually end up inside the pool. The filters are not so great on these pools, so any added dirt is a pain.I tore a small hole in the one corner while putting it on last night. I'm guessing it won't last us past this summer.

It keeps our Intex pool (mostly) clean and (mostly) free of any leafs and the like every night. It is easy to get it on the pool as well (we leave the string tight and just push the pool edge a bit when at the end - it helps if you have help as well, otherwise you'd be chasing your tail around the pool trying to set it on).The cover has holes - not a bad thing, but sometimes I wish it didn't, especially after a rain/storm - there's dirty water and small debris on the cover. So when removing it, all that water would go into the pool, which is the very thing we wanted to avoid...Nonetheless, it's a great value, given the very low price and the reduction in the time it takes now to clean the pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social Harp - in Sacred Harp tradition","review":"The Social Harp music is authenicately American, the same line of tradition that gives us the Sacred Harp. The shaped notes are intended to allow individuals who do not read music to read the Social Harp music. It also allows the individual pitching the music to move the music into the range of the singers rather than using a true pitch. The melody is in the tenor line which is sung by both genders. The music has an open harmony - altos may float above sopranos or below tenors for example. The beat is strictly kept and there is little variation in volume - this is not your standard choral music.This album falls midway between being sung as part of a folk tradition and being sung by a professional performance choir. The result is enjoyable but unlikely to be the album that will sell you on this tradition. If you already love the shaped note tradition, you will thoroughly enjoy this album as an addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethical PR is not an Oxymoron","review":"Whether you're just starting out in the PR business or you've been plugging away at it for years, this book is a wealth of information.

Instead of his Mother addressing his disobedience, she seems to half smile and watches his attempts to get dressed and do what he wants to do. Well, that just ruins it for me. The idea of Froggy having a hard time getting dressed and the repetition which I know kids love is cute, but I just cannot get past the fact that his Mother told him to stay in bed, he chose not to listen, and she was perfectly fine with it!

If you are tilling and hit a hard spot,hold on for life,or let it go. The forward rotating tines will drag you with it when they come out of the soil.(by the way I weight 200lbs). This tiller is dangerous to operate,because when it comes on top of the soil the tines are rotating faster than the wheels,thus it takes off.I tried to trade it back to the dealer where I purchased it,and he wanted so much difference,I finally sold it thru the newspaper and bought a counter rotating tiller. A world of difference.If you have loose soil or a sandbox to till,this tiller might work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang on to your horses","review":"We tried the super bronco after hearing the saleman's pitch. The machine itself sounds superior to others we checked out but the test is in the trying. It worked great in the ground that we had already tilled just a week before, it made the ground soft and almost fluffy. But my husband got a little close to the outer edge of the tilled ground and the maching took off at a full gallop taking him along for a ride. He almost got hurt. Since the tines rotate forward, as soon as you hit a little harder ground it goes full speed ahead and there's no holding back. And if your ground isn't perfectly soft it won't till, it just drives on top of the ground. We took it back, it's not for general tilling, only re-tilling, and even then it has to be really soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicken Little Strikes Again","review":"Rifkin is unqualified to write a book of this nature.

The little blurb about Somatogen making transgenic pigs is what really caught my eye. I worked for Somatogen (later Baxter Hemoglobin Theraputics) for ten years. The only way any pigs got onto the company grounds was dressed out and roasted to be eaten with lots of beans and cold beer.

I neither love nor hate his writing, and feel this is a topic worthy of a well-researched book. Unfortunately, this feels very much like the sort of essay that gets written when somebody is assigned to finish x-thousand words by Thursday, and doesn't have time to research the topic. Seriously, in the first hundred pages or so, absolutely nothing happens except Rifkin asserting, over and over, how important biotechnology is. Wouldn't it have been better to provide some examples and let us decide for ourselves whether it's important? Better luck next time, Jeremy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning of the End","review":"The unparalleled scientific achievements described by the author are truly awesome; in fact, they dwarf all of mankind's former endeavours. The science is, as described, invaluable, if left to disease treatment and relief of suffering.

He clearly longs for some pristine time in the past, when life was better and simpler. Certainly a common sentiment, but one that lacks the maturity to consider the brief life spans of that time and the social order in which the strong preyed upon the weak.Rather than bore you with details, let me make clear that Rifkin makes his living by writing so as to scare his readers. Always under the guise of educating and serving to simply raise potential concerns and issues, but the message is always the same - industry/biotech/America is bad, Jeremy Rifkin is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid \\"criticism\\"","review":"Rifkin is not very critical on the diminishing diversity of life on earth and it's imminent sterility thanks to the \\"benefits\\" of the cult of efficiency, which Business Week was quick to observe.

Deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeremy Rifkin is an attention-seeking nuthatch.","review":"Ever since the 70's, a decade that was quite receptive to this type of character, Jeremy Rifkin has been inventing false crises and getting himself media attention for them. I first remember him for a book on the physical principle of entropy, from which he inferred the obviously false conclusion that all human doings are fated to decay and decline. Entropy may increase with time for the universe as a whole, but any subsystem, including the earth and its human civilization, can become more ordered with time. After all, we've been doing just that for 5,000 years or more.

Within moments my wife and I were startled by a loud cracking noise from the right fan, which soon came to a dead stop. The left fan was working happy as Larry though. Our thoughts of having a cool evening quickly diminished as we gathered up the packing materials and proceeded to pack the thing, returning it to the sender.

Also great at drawing air thru the house as well as cooling the bedroom when we move it in there - can bring the temp down about 5 degrees in 15 minutes, which is great since our house can otherwise take a lot longer to cool down at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out motor","review":"For the partial of two days this fan worked just wonderful--cooled nicely almost as good as an air conditioner--Then on the third day there was a short time of sweet smell coming from the fan a bang and it never worked again.

This is pretty ridiculous, containing about only three actual interviews with the band members, one with Peter Buck stretching over about 8 out of 12 tracks. There's a brief snippet from Stipe from around the release of \\"Up\\", but it's hardly worth noting.

With what I assume is a hearty use of multitracking, the Empire Brass give us a glorious rendition of music of Gabrieli and some of his contemporaries. I think it's lovely, absolutely captivating and completely respectful of the original, if not an attempt to reproduce the original. But so what, every time Bach is played on a modern piano it's not authentic--for that matter, neither is playing Mozart on a modern piano authentic, but somehow we manage to suffer through it all and enjoy it nonetheless. Personally, I think Gabrieli would be delighted with this rendition. And it's not just Gabrieli on the disc--my personal favorite is Lauda Jerusalem by Gabriel Diaz Besson; a piece I've not heard in any other recording.

The Kajan and Iban peoples of Borneo were still living as hunters at stone age level in the impenetrable forests of Borneo when the author visited both tribes and spent considerable time in an Iban village of headhunters. He went through the initialization rituals and married an Iban woman, learned to hunt by blowpipe and appreciate the rich and lighthearted life of the primitive.This book offers views that deeply affected my outlook on our species. Still, the author is a zoologist and had no anthropologist ambitions whatsoever to begin with. I rate it equal to Jean Liedloffs books.

A good scifi book should have some semblance of believability. But, this book slops time travel, hauntings, hive minds, global warming, business ventures, etc., etc., into one book that is beyond boring. Steven Baxter is a great writer if he would slow down and not try to impress the readers with his intellect. His goal should be to entertain not put the masses to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first two parts, then do yourself a favor and stop","review":"This book was a pretty good read through parts one and two, and maybe even could have been brought to a conclusion shortly thereafter, with a short epilogue or something.

For that reason alone I give it only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this crap?","review":"I have completely turned 180 degrees from being a fan of Baxtor to absolutely loathing the garbage he's been writing in recent years. He had a good run early on, but has totally lost touch with his base. I loved Ring, The Time Ships, Flux, all the way up to Vacuum Diagrams, which seems to have been a turning point in his career--for the worst. This novel, like all of his recent work, suffers from very weak character development, a highly suspect series of plots. In his early stories, the pathetic character development was entirely excusable because his science was rock solid and exciting! I loved his Xeelee stories and the whole dark matter creatures were very engaging. But lately, he's focused too much on personal interests that are completely non-interesting to this reader. His attitude is that of an informed and wizened academic, but he comes across in fictional form as foolishly optimistic that his ridiculous themes are believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"propaganda fiction","review":"The entire book flips back and forth from telling a story to preaching about man destroying the world and global warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really Transcendant if you can skip the environmental hooey","review":"I really liked Transcendent, even though I am as anti-environmentalist as anyone can be. I think a lot of the negativ reviewers were put off by (admittedly) ridiculous environmental disasters, but I thought it was kind of cute (in a silly way). Here we are 500,000 years in the future. Mankind is about to \\"transcend\\" into a god, and Baxter is crying that the old people in Florida have to sandbag their homes. You can almost imagine Baxter was really making fun of the global warming fearmongers (although I doubt he was). Anyway, I thought the universe he created and the concepts he explored greatly outweighted any minor worries with the earthbound components of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from a S.B. fan","review":"Of the three books in the Destiny's Children series, this has turned out to be my favorite. Stephen Baxter has continuously amazed me with his ability to tie complex physics, theories of evolution, and far flug timelines, into a tight and readable story, but this time he has perhaps done more. This is by far his most \\"human\\" story. It clings tightly to the suffering of its main character Michael Poole, and digs more deeply than any of his other books into philosophy and the heart of the human condition. Nonetheless it is packed full of Baxter's deep ideas in physics and technology.A very engaging and rewarding book to read for any SciFi fan, and a must for any Baxter fan.

For one thing,Auger's voice isn't as powerful(Some people call it \\"creamy\\",whatever that is.)as Janowitz's. Auger's voice has a more tender, human quality that's a pleasure to hear. For another,Previn's tempos are different than Karajan's. Im Adendrot,for instance,is a full minute slower than Karajan's But, you're gonna love that extra minute! It's truly majestic.

This is such a fantastic concert that I would recommend this to anyone, specifically someone that has never heard Liberace before. This is highly entertaining, with wonderful music and you will be surprised at Liberace's comic timing! You will laugh your head off a lot too at his jokes and comments. His charm and warmth is very evident here, as well as his humanity. His brother George is the musical director. They also play with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and members of Liberace's regular band which are all introduced. By the end of the show, you will be a Liberace fan and will understand why he was and is so popular and was known as \\"Mr. Showmanship\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TV COMPILATION!!!!!","review":"Fairly decent selection of tv shows in rather decent condition.

And the author's use of religion and race as a force to drive the characters into a storyline was interesting, though not overly done.

A lot of wrist grip and leverage techniques, which are effective if you are really much more skilled than the attacker and on the other hand many defences against dumbos who aproach you from behind and press the knive against your back like guns in the old detective movies used to be put, without even holding your collar!

There are things that the military teaches that are quite asinine. However, the main goal for 99% of the military is to teach aggressiveness.For example, the US Army Rangers teach Gracie Jujitsu for Christ sake. They go out to the wrestling mats and roll around. Why? To teach you to be aggressive. If you think you can wrestle wearing 70 pounds of gear, carrying a rifle, and after marching 20 miles through rough terrain, then you should be able to qualify for handicapped plates.Does this book contain information that is commonly taught to the US Special Forces?

The techniques are inefficient, rely on strength, assume the other guy is an idiot moving at the speed of molasses, and put you in a lot of danger.They also violate really basic, and I mean BASIC principles of self defense. Several of them get the attacker in trouble. And then let him out. Others make contact and take control. And then give up both. There are, G-d help us, pictures of him kicking the knife out of the attacker's hand and others where he exposes things most of us REALLY don't want cut to the blade.Save your money.

People who say this book is effective may have dojo training, but have NEVER encountered a real knife attack.Personally I could overlook Echanis's personal history if the book were OK - but it just isn't.Ice pick grip decreases your distance by about 2 inches. Someone with a saber grip and 3 or 4 arnis classes will slice open the arteries in your arms in short fashion. Sacrificing your lead hand is great if you want to bleed to death.

This whole book focuses on being more positive than negative. Sounds easy right? Probably because it is if you try. Gallup, specifically Tom Rath and Don Clifton have put together a workable theory that states you need to try and have 5 positive interactions with people you meet before you have 1 negative thing to say. They cite research that shows most marriages will fail if the ratio of positive to negative is not better than 1 to 1. So, keep it positive, and life will be better. A simple and important concept.

In a sentence, I can tell you that the biggest statement that the book relayed is that if you fill someone elses bucket with positive energy, words and praise, it fills yours. In a few sentences... I will say that the authors vision and recommended actions, as well as reading examples in the book, really hit home. I was able to realize that by speaking in negative terms about things in life, whether they pertained to me, someone else, or life, really dipped from my own bucket of positivity. Positive actions reinforce one's ability to adjust and heal from within. Good words are contageous. Caring discussion with another spreads not only between you and who you are speaking with, but the energy from positivity spreads from individual to individual, a domino effect.A must read.

This easy to read book helps you as a leader reflect on your interactions with others. Throughout the book the reader is given several facts on the importance of positive interactions with others. I was amazed that approximately 65% of people surveyed last year said they did not receive recognition last year, in addition the number one reason people leave a job is because they don't feel appreciated.

From the other side, the explanations of how negative vibes affect us no matter how big or small. Uplifting book to encourage positive thinking and \\"filling of buckets\\" for all who have any sort of relationship with people whether it be as a leader, a parent, a teacher, a student, a team member, or just a simple interaction with a waitor or waitress while eating out.

If you have monthly female-related pain, take these when you have the first sign of it and it will stop it before it starts. Great stuff for that and for headaches, especially if you're prone to sinus headaches like we are. Two of these along with two pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) will knock the pain and get rid of the sinus pain and pressure within a very short period of time.In my book, whether it's back pain, body aches, fever, swelling, you name it, Advil does the job.

The excitement and exotic dishes found in the Japanese Iron Chef were severely lacking, and the commentary was as bland as Shatner's acting in T.J.

This one, and \\"40 Acres,\\" by Caedmon's Call. The two sound nothing alike for those wondering. Anyway, I listened only to those two, and on that trip I listened to the Caedmon's Call CD once through. The rest of the trip was Fono and only Fono.My advice is this.

Fono's vocals and instrumentation-- though not as deep or thought-provoking as a group like Radiohead--managed to draw me in and demand additional spins. The lyrics may not be strongly evangelistic, but they do offer hope, and they do speak of Christ. Compared to some of the secular bands I've heard, God's Spirit shines bright through this music. I've claimed \\"Alcatraz,\\" the fourth track, as my present anthem against the sinful nature that so often tries to take over my thought processes.

I just couldn't believe someone being 28 yrs. old would carry on the way she did. And towards the end she realizes that Clay is her one soul mate and loves him. Why?

I sprayed the entire grate. It looks new now. Don't spray paint the grills (if they got rusted) if you want to try this, for obvious health reasons. You can sand down the bottom grill for wood and it will be fine left as is. You can replace the cooking grill, if it got rusted, at any Home Depot or hardware store.

One that explodes and sends Skelley man back in time to 1301, the time of William Wallace's rebellion. Caira Mackenzie is struggling to keep her secret (both her husband and her father are now dead and Castle Kilbeinn is without a laird) from the nearby British. Can the recently discovered Skelley help or hinder Caira? A Blast to the Past is brisk, breezy fun, with the adventure aspects getting just as much attention as the romantic story. All in all a short and satisfying read. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled... avoid this book!","review":"The author struggles with her own language and butchers the Scots dialect, making the whole thing painful to read. She confuses verb tenses and inserts oddities like \\"delicateness\\" in place of delicacy and \\"clearness\\" in place of \\"clarity.\\" Her Scots speak a bizarre mix of modern American and British English overlaid with the couple of words most Americans associate with Scotland. Modernisms like \\"okay\\" don't faze them at all. But the worst of it was when they started tacking \\"ye ken?\\" onto the ends of their sentences like valley girls. They're cartoon characters, not real adults living in a real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining!","review":"I am an avid reader of time travel romance novels, and I would have to say this one delivered a very good story. There were very few grammatical errors, which always annoy me. The concept of a Navy munitions expert being blown back to the past and having to use his high school knowledge to create black powder and save the day created a lot of fun scenarios. Her two elderly Scottish male characters were very believable with their close bond and constant bickering, and they truly helped carry the story through several comical scenes. Overall, I would give this story 4 stars simply because it's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting instrumentation","review":"Bask: Hans Kennemark (fiddle, altifol); Jonas Simonson (alto & willow flutes, traversflojt); Sten Kallman (soprano & baritone saxophones, talking drum, Hatian conga)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"My dogs love them and seem to be more energetic since taking them.The best thing is they are easy to give since they are chewable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I have been a music junky since my early teens (I am now 41).

I've read much about the Holocaust and been moved by many stories, but none seemed more real or more human than these incredible comic strip figures.

I have read several books focusing on the Holocaust, and none better describes it than this. Yet Maus is not to be classified simply as a chronicle of WWII; it brilliantly portrays other matters as well, such as paranoia and suicide. Though it is captured in just a few pictures, the scene where Vladek is fighting for Poland is the best portrayal of the guilt and instinct associated with war I have ever seen. Whether you like comic strips or not, this is a book to have on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome true life account of a Holocaust survivor.","review":"Spiegelman's \\"Maus\\" is a great story about the life of a Holocaust survivor named Vladek. The book is written uniquely in that the text is written in comic strips. The Jewish victims are represented as mice and the Germans as cats.

It leads to a nice study of the holocaust, allows students to explore the ideas of discrimination, generational differences and using pictures to share a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true story of the holocaust","review":"This book is a survivors tale of being a Jew in Nazi Germany. The author tells his father's memories of the horrors of the holocaust. It is written in the form of a comic book. The author uses a metaphor for the people in WW2. The Jews are mice and the Germans are cats. The book talks about the author's father being a succesful person and then being captured by the Germans and finally freed from his POW camp, but forced to live in the Ghettos and hide from the Nazis who want to send them to Austwitch. The book leaves off as he is being shipped to Austwitch (a Nazi Concentation/death Camp).This is one of the best books I've read about the Jewish experience in Nazi Germany. It's easy to read and surprisingly informative. I would most defenintely recommend this book for someone else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic Alternative: What if the Jews Were the Pigs?","review":"I object to the portrayal of Poles as pigs in this cartoon. It is demeaning and insulting. How would the Jewish author, and Jewish readers, feel if the genocide of Jews during the Holocaust was shown, in a popular comic strip, as Jewish pigs being sent to a giant slaughterhouse? The answer is rather obvious. So why did the author choose pigs to depict Poles? Did he lack the social intelligence of the average 5-year old, or does he harbor malevolence towards Poles? Oh, I apologize for my silly sentiments, because I forgot the obvious answer: The Poles are not deemed a politically-correct victim group, by the liberal elites, so it is perfectly OK to ridicule and demean them, even in widely-used educational material. After all, everyone in the US is equal, but some are more equal than others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanderous simplification of the Holocaust","review":"I wonder what would the Jewish circles say if somebody published today a comic book with Jews depicted as, say, rats (actually, the Nazis have already done that...)? \\"Maus\\" shows the Poles as pigs, and it does that in the context of over 220 trees (the largest national group) planted in Jerusalem in memory of the righteous Poles who saved Jews during the war at the risk of their own and their families' lives. Now the descendants of the saved ones pay the Polish people back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"It's sad but true--in more ways than one. Yes it's won awards and rightfully so, but if you only ever read one comic book in your entire life, Maus dosn't have to be it. The story is intense and important--and it's nothing you can't read in Night and the art leaves a lot to be desired. I think people who say they like comics and have only ever read Maus are not unlike people who say they are really in to philosphy and they've only read the Tao of Pooh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"I thought that this book put a realistic touch on theHolocaust. By having a character throughout the novel who the peoplecould actually sympathize with, with his wife and his kids, I really got a feeling of what he went through. I believe that this was also a fun book to read given all of the different kinds of characters that they had. The Germans were the cats, the Jewish were the mice and the Polish were the Pigs. I thought that put kind of a fun twist throughout the novel. I also enjoyed the comic book format. I thought that it was ingenious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maus: What I think","review":"I thought that Maus: A Survivor's Tale and Maus: A Surviver's Tale and Here My Troubles Began were both excellent books written about the Shoah.

Please read these two books to have a deeper understanding of the Shoah"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Maus' Trap","review":"Art Spiegelman's critically-acclaimed graphic novel chronicles both his father Vladek's misadventures in Hitler's Europe and a rocky relationship between father and son. Depicting the Nazis as cats and the Jews as mice (and the Polish as pigs, a hot-button topic in an already controversial piece), Spiegelman's illustrations actually gives \\"Maus\\" the type of appeal that couldn't be achieved in any other medium except this one, as well as lure readers who wouldn't have picked up the comic otherwise. The story itself reels you in but \\"Prisoner on the Hell Planet,\\" Spiegelman's comic-within-a-comic about his late mother, offers even more insight on Spiegelman and his family history despite its contrast with the main story. This is truly the stuff survival stories are made of.This comic is unrated: Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR ALL READERS GREAT AND SMALL!","review":"Maus is Incredible. You learn so much about the holocaust but it is done in a form that all readers young and old can learn so much. I'm in 8th grade and I wouldn't be as inspired if it were in book form. It is a comic, a novel, a memoir, a biography and a history book all at the same time. Believe me, one reader to another you will be inspired to learn more about the independant comic world, you will be shocked at what the jews must do and you will marvel at the amazing yet simplistic art of Maus. I garunntee! A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely creative...a book for all ages","review":"Maus gives a fascinating look at what the Holocaust was and the effects it left on future generations. Spiegelman gives the reader a look at what people went through without going into too much detail.

I appreciate slower moving art films, and I give slack to low budget indie films. However, this film is poorly acted--I, a non-actor, could have done better, the editing and cinematography is confusing and awkward, and the plot is virtually non-existent. The characters are flimsy and leave the viewer apathetic to their lives. This film could and should have been reduced to a 10 minutes short film. I almost think that this is someone's psychology experiment. Make a bad film on purpose, give it great reviews, and see what happens.

What really stands out is the breakdowns, and the singer's brutal death metal voice during these earth-crushing breakdowns.

My family loves potato salad and mashed potatoes, so I thought I would give them a shot. Took me twice as long as it would have if I had just peeled the potatoes as I usually do. You have to cook the potatoes BEFORE you peel them - but only halfway- and if they are not cooked anough, the peel doesn't come off as easy as they say. Then you put them back in the water to finish boiling. The \\"bumps\\" on the gloves that give them the rough texture also started to come off with the second potato.Don't waste your money - just keep a very sharp knife handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable product","review":"Tater Mitts ?

Many of the articles weren't building techniques at all.

Then once youv'e gone through a few levels and save the princess the story goes on. One complaint I have is once you load a save file and forget to save again your all the way at the begining of the dungeon again. If this happens you get more and more experience but you have to play the level again and it makes the bosses way to easy.

Some books on candles are really just a list of patterns, and unless you learn them all by heart, it is very confusing. However with this book I really gained a much greater understanding of what sort of market psychology is at work when you see a particular type of candle pattern. The wonderful thing about this approach is that it makes memorising long lists of candle patterns redundant. This book is well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting But Sloppy","review":"I picked this book up while on vacation in Colorado and was very interested in the subject matter. Unfortunately, I could not make it through the entire book because the disorganization becomes tedious. It is one long collection of anecdotes, rather than an organized look at the subject. You will read bits about a madam in various chapters, but never all in one place, making it confusing to read. If it had only been organized somehow: by madam, by town, by timeline..SOMEHOW...it would have been much more enjoyable. The author has done all the research but then just thrown the notes together without anything tying it all together.

Works great within line-of sight, and has already saved me a handfull of tickets in a construction zone I commute through daily. The range can be somewhat inconsistent, sometimes it will detect 1-2 miles away and sometimes less depending on conditions and highway layout (such as around curves, challenging for all detectors). You will get false alarms for automatic doors, microwaves, etc. which the city function easily eliminates. Volume plenty loud enough to hear over stereo at normal volumes. VG2 protection worked great on my trip through Virginia, went off several times but the cops seemed unaware. I have a $250 detector in my wife's car, and can tell no noticable difference between the expensive model and this one as far as detection range and false alarms. Great buy for the money, easily pays for itself if you are speed-limit-challenged like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I have a Polk audio system, and I did not need any EQ, the mastering was great, and I really liked the rhythms.

The details of medieval life are seamlessly woven into this mid-winter tale, set in a small village. Once the mystery of just who killed the husband of one of the nuns' servants is introduced, the pace increases. When suspicion falls on the vagrant troupe, Sister Frevisse summons her considerable powers of deduction to help solve the crime. But when the body count starts to rise and Sister F learns the crowner is enroute to wrap up the case, she knows she must work hard to not only find the guilty party, but ensure an innocent person is not convicted.A nice, tight story for lovers of history and slow-moving, but well-plotted crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"Be very careful when purchasing this item from Amazon.

This rendition of the two symphonies is a very desirable addition to any serious collection, but my reference performance of the 5th is by Eugene Ormandy and the then outstanding Philadelphia Orchestra. The Telarc recording is beautiful with attention to the heavy percussion elements as well as the sheen of the strings and detail to the inner voices. All things considered, a fine choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - DO NOT BUY!","review":"I was very excited to get my son a Lite-Brite (remembering how much I enjoyed the one I had as a child) and decided to go with this 'travel' model as a starter, to see if he would even play with it. Although he did enjoy the concept, and we do play with it when I have the patience, the actual toy is awful.Everything you read about how this toy is bad is in the other reviews (the absolute uselessness of the storage compartment, the inane functioning of the light); I suppose that its many negative attributes were not expressed in such a way as to make me appreciate how awful they actually are. I can think of two ways to explain the horribleness of this toy:Either, 1) The person who \\"designed\\" it never had a toy as a child is now taking revenge on the world, or 2) (the more likely case) this toy was not designed, but instead pieced together by somebody with some extra plastic parts. It is a parent's nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend $50 on thin plastic","review":"When you open up the kit it's disappointing to see that you spent all that money on this lame looking crapola. I mean, it seems fun until you are trying to snap the plastic parts together and realize they were molded improperly and don't fit well. Then you finally assemble it and it just looks like a pathetic plastic robot. Makes me sad that such a piece of crap costs so much.

This one has the added advantage of being whole wheat and has flaxseed mixed in, hopefully lowering its glycemic index and making it richer in essential fatty acids. I haven't actually compared the nutritional profile with regular couscous.The best thing about couscous is the easy cooking- simply boil water in the microwave, add couscous and salt, cover and wait for 5 minutes. Done! Then you can dress it up. My favorite recipe is sauteeing some whole spices (cumin, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon) along with sliced almonds and raisins and mixing in the couscous, along with a chopped preserved lemon.

It was very rushed. But \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" was excellent as per usual I must say. This concert did not seem \\"Live\\" though. I'm still Fleetwood Mac's #1 fan!

Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, brought in to fill the gap left by Lindsey Buckingham's departure, lack the stage presence and vocal electricity of Mr. Buckingham. Stevie Nicks, looking like she'd rather be somewhere else, is a major disappointment. She was battling depression and vocal problems during this time and her performances seem phoned in only to be redubbed later. Only Christine McVie sounds great, but her material is often too bland and lightweight. As for the production, this concert sounds and looks like it was digitally created instead of recorded. Choose \\"The Dance\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fleetwood Mac music for rehab members","review":"This video is perfect evidence of the downfall of the band after the departure of Lindsey Buckingham. The late eighties saw the band become a slick \\"hair band\\" with little to offer that was unpredictable. The set list from this 1988 concert filmed at San Francisco's Cow Palace sounds overproduced and anything but live. Moreover, the close-ups shots of Ms Stevie Nicks (that were redone months later after she was unhappy with her appearance) are downright comical. It's obvious they don't match the rest of the footage...What were they thinking. The long and senseless drum solo by Mick Fleetwood in \\"World Turning\\" is redundant and again, comical at best.

FM had to use two men to replace the irreplaceable Lindsey Buckingham, and to no avail, it just is not the same. Although these men are clearly talented, Lindsey, they are not.

Its incredibly repetative and quite absent of any sort of emotion. Really, its pretty boring. Go take a look at it in Barnes and Noble or whatever you have near you, and if you don't grow tired of hearing about T34 turrets being dislodged page after page, then order it online. Or support your bookstore. If you are looking for more interesting ground combat stories, I highly recommend Sniper on the Eastern Front, Black Eidelweiss, and pretty much any Ambrose or Ryan book. These seem quite likely to have been written in German, probably for progaganda use, and translated poorly over into English. I would love to say it was fantastic, but I grew bored with the writing style and lack of detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up close and personal!","review":"As with many books of this particular genre, the subject matter is very interestingng, but suffers from translation. The six men, the \\"Aces\\", are well profiled and seem to become real people.In regards to the lack of \\"technical details\\", most readers of this very specialized type of biography/memoir/military history, can easily find the necessary information eleswhere. This book focuses on the MEN and not the equuipment.Overall a very good effort. A few maps would have helped understand the overall strategic situation, better, but still entertaining.

The speaker volume is so loud that the speaker vibrates inside the case making carrying on a conversation with another person next to impossible. All you can hear when someone is trying to talk with you, is the buzzing sound of the speaker rattling against the case. This is with the speaker volume turned all the way down mind you.

It looks to be a factory defect on that side after speaking with the Sprint store in town, however it has not been recalled... I would NOT recommend getting this phone unless you can afford to be with out a phone for 2 weeks while the company gives a poor reason as to why they can't repair it under warrenty.

The hinge to flip open the phone has completely broken -first just one side broke and pretty soon the entire thing broke. Then just yesterday the display completely stopped working as well. According to Sprint, I am not eligible for a new phone for another 3-4 months so now I am going to be forced to spend about $200 just to get a new phone that will probably just break after a year.

The new stories do nothing to grab the imagination and the stories from established authors just give the feeling of being chosen more for their obscurity (cheap royalties?) than the quality of the stories. The whole thing just seems to have a feel of \\"let's get as many words into a book as cheaply as possible\\".If you're looking for something to while away the time, you've come to the right place. If you're looking for a collection of stories that either defines the genre or challenges the imagination, you'll want to look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Bolan Fans It's A Must!","review":"Taken from US radio sessions recorded in '71 and '72, \\"Spaceball\\" is largely just Marc on solo acoustic guitar, belting out versions of popular \\"Electric Warrior\\" and \\"Slider\\" cuts. For this reason alone it is essential to any fan of Marc's music; hearing many of the electric glam anthems redone in the setting of his intimate acoustic hippie past is a treat and a half, and his voice is in top heartfelt form throughout. On several tracks Mickey Finn joins in on congas,providing an unexpectedly ethereal backing to favorites like \\"Cosmic Dancer\\". There are also a couple electric tracks using the full band, and while there are better versions of the dramatic guitarwork on \\"Elemental Child\\" available, the jamming in \\"Jewel\\" is on fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Tiresome","review":"This is not a good read. It is poorly written, incoherent, and even with all the murders and black magic, the author still manages to make the medieval era of European history come across as acute boredom.

Especially the motet O Magnum Mysterium which one choir I sing in (at Holy Name Cathedral) is performing. The director Matt Walsh recommended the Robert Shaw Festival Singers recordings of the motet so I picked this one up: And the performance is excellent, but because it's recorded with the mic some distance from the singers, you really almost hear more of the church than the choir. Some of the really beautiful harmonies are less than clear with all the reverb, including the great chord progression at the beginning of O Magnum Mysterium. Maybe it's just because I'm used to hearing it from within the choir, but I really would much prefer a close micing recording of these pieces over the version which appears here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-handed and dead, but Americans dont seem to mind","review":"Why is that American choralphiles and most choral singers seem to go along whole-heartedly with the heavy-hand of these bohemoth old-school conductors? Page, Shaw, Hillis, Flummerfelt - it's all over done and lacks spark (well, that which doesnt come from sheer volume and thickness).If you want to hear Poulenc sung with style and life - then listen to Harry Christophers and The Sixteen.I have been a professional singer, both from the inside and outside of choirs, large and small, for the last 15 years. I have sung with 90% of the professional choirs in America and a handful of European conductors and their choirs. As an American, it's hard to explain to my American colleagues why I prefer to work in the UK and Europe, but if I want to actually enjoy the experience, I never work here in the states.Leave Shaw to the big, robust choral rep (his Rachmaninoff/Vespers is great), but PLEASE - if the music has any life or light... steer clear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Gift","review":"I bought this for my brother for Christmas to adorn his new desk.

This 32 page book has one half page of instruction. It is not for the beginner. It shows you where to put your hand for the base buttons. That is all. Then it goes into about 30 pages of sheet music. It is assumed I guess that you know all about music because this doesn't even tell you what a quarter note is or what the base and treble symbols are. A lot better book is Accordion Method by Frank Zucco. At least that book has pictures and tells you a little about music. Oh one more thing about the Easyist Accordion book. That half page of instruction has two spelling or grammer errors in it that I found. Must be nobody bothered to read that half page.

What a powerful, beautiful wonder of a piece.The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra's performance is peppy, sharp. The recording so faithfully captures all the vocal and orchestral nuances.

There has been no one that I have heard that can get people together to do that. I have a whole room full of cds to prove it. Just listen to Helsinki Laundramat Blues and then switch to I Would Be A Sinner and you will see what I mean. The fact that one man can get the talent together that Kid Ramos can to do cds like this tells me a little about the man himself. He has to be packed with talent (duh..no kiddin) and not be too pretentious about it. And he has to be humble and just plain likeable. Live a long life Kid! I am buying everything you make.

Some of these stories are only based on one person stating they felt a presence or had an experience, which even for a believer, isn't enough for me. No bibliography, excellent pictures, but too much opinion without giving you the facts and letting you decide. Seems to be written more for a teen or older child vs. an adult. My niece read this book and loved it, but she is 10. I have loved almost every book on hauntings and ghosts I have ever read, and this is one of the unfortunate exceptions.

He then proceeds to lock the cat in the bathroom. Again, the cat is outside the door when he gets home. The story ends abruptly. There is no explanation as to what this means? Might there have been a window that the cat could have exited from? Why exactly is this worth writing about?The author is more concerned with jumping from one \\"tale\\" to another instead of weaving an entertaining or compelling argument for the existence of ghosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I have no idea how this book was published. There are so many obvious grammatical errors that should have been caught. I guess the book is so dull that an editor couldn't be bothered to actually read it.

Good personal writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and forgettable.","review":"What could have been an interesting collection of stories suffers from a vague, disjointed style with no sense of progression, transition, or really any type of storytelling at all. Another reviewer called the style \\"conversational,\\" and that's actually a fairly apt description; reading these stories feels like having a conversation with someone who's easily distracted by tangential subjects, so they never get to the point of their original tale. There's little to compel the reader to care, or to believe; in fact, the overall sanctimonious tone of smugness about the author's belief and experiences just turned me off from the start. One generally reads ghost stories for a reason, whether that reason is to be frightened, amused, informed, reassured, or even validated by a similarity to one's own experiences. These stories provide nothing of the sort and are about as interesting (and meaningful) as idle conversation overheard in a cafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I've read many of ghost books and I must say this one isn't the best. The book is vague...It seems as though having the content fit a specific page range or word limit was more important than the actual stories themselves. I found myself asking for better examples or more elaboration on the parts that seemed promising. It's as if it's enough to make you curious but not curious enough to really give the book a second thought. The book could really be better, have more \\"meat\\" in each of the stories instead of just a broad generalization that is an urban legend. Any how, if you really want to get chills or read a better written stories about abondaned and curious places that you'd swear are haunted.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz","review":"Our book club tries to read something like this around Halloween every year.

Just a compilation of occurrences and events across the country that may or may not involve ghosts. Some were almost interesting.

Recently parents have started asking about the nessecity of infant circumcision, and I have had no good reasons to recomend it. The AMA reseased a statement that circumcision is \\"not medically nessisary\\", and that has slowed the number of these operations to a trickle. This slow-down of a common (and expencive) precedure has caused SOME medical staff to lash out against parents and bully them into cutting thier sons. They bring up fears of Cancer, and HIV, just as thier predisesors 100 years ago brought up fears of Epilepsy, TB, and (god forbid) Mastrerbation.This video is a hollywood version of a very painfull procedure. It has quite music, and the infant is happy. NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH! If you are thinking about cutting your son's Foreskin off, go see a circumcision for yourself, then you will see through the lies in this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"behind the times","review":"This is a good video if you want to see how the procedure is/was rationalized. Sorry to say, it isn't a fair portrayal of the procedure and seems to have been made specifically by the makers of these surgical devices to convince people they aren't really as evil as they seem to some. Um, very misleading. A more accurate and in-depth video is \\"Whose Body/Whose Rights?\\", a PBS documentary. If you want a real examination of circumcision, that is the video to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sue your doctors!","review":"I just don't understand how Americans can be so blasé about mutilating their infant boys! I also don't understand why doctors are not sued left, right, and center over performing unnecessary surgeries.No medical body in the world recommends routine circumcision. Parents can ask doctors to perform all kinds of crazy, inhumane surgeries. That doesn't mean doctors have to satisfy their requests. US doctors make me sick.If you're a man who is saddened by your circumcision, I suggest you contact Attorneys for the Rights of the Child and start suing your doctor. You'll probably win. And perhaps you'll help make videos like this a thing of the past!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT VIDEO","review":"This video is wonderful because it show how precious the foreskin on the penis is. That is a valuable organ the will help the boy during sexual reproduction. Just to tell you how big the foreskin gets...if a boy is circumcised as a teen or and adult the forskin is the size of a 3 by 5 index card. That skin protects the glands from scratches and the skin stays very sensitive on the glands. When i was little i was circumcised and I cannot sexually reproduce because my glands are not sensitive and i cannot ejaculate. Now uncircumcised boys can ejaculate easier than any other men in the world!

This album has a sound to it unlike any other Smiths record in their catalog mainly because it is a compilation album that was compiled from several different radio shows in the UK. It is in my opinion a definite must own and captures The Smiths in their rawest under-produced form. Even though this record came out in 1984 it still sounds as fresh and unique today as it did way back then. No one else has a sound quite like The Smiths *****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Balls","review":"I bought this album a year ago instead of 'Meat Is Murder', because I had heard 'How Soon Is Now' on the radio and I figured I should get the original album that it was released on rather than 'Meat Is Murder'. I was wrong. Although there are some witty lyrics and tricks of the tongue found here, very few of the tracks vary at all from one consistant vein of music, the same guitar riffs, the same vocal 'ah-ha-ha's. The album is very boring, I won't lie. I tried listening to it about a dozen times and every time I thought 'when will this side end?'. Now, I'm not completely putting down The Smiths. Get 'Meat Is Murder' if you like 'How Soon Is Now'. It blows this compilation out of the water.

This is no exception - most of these tracks are available other places. This version of \\"What Difference Does it Make?\\" is far superior than the one that appears on The Smiths self titled album, though, and the version of Still Ill is also excellent. This compilation is definitely not just a shuffling of elsewhere-released tracks, and any fan should definitely pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unusual collection","review":"If you're already a Smiths fan, you should get this album, although there are many songs that appear as the same version on the indespensible singles collection, Louder Than Bombs. Because of its' eclectic nature, I would advise newcomers to get LTB. The BBC Radio tracks are a mixed blessing; all of them would be interesting to hear for fans, but some are definitely better than others. Examples: gorgeous acoustic version of \\"Back To The Old House,\\" the otherwise unavailable \\"Handsome Devil,\\" and a version of \\"Still Ill\\" with a very fun harmonica intro/outro. However, the BBC takes of \\"What Difference\\" and \\"Reel Around The Fountain\\" leave much to be desired.

Recommended for the already fanatical convert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Island Disc at least","review":"When the time came for me to be initiated into the Smiths, my elder brother was the one to talk to. His worn out copy of 'Louder Than Bombs' was the precursor, but even he admitted when I came home with a cassette version of \\"Hatful of Hollow\\", that this was the real thing.Most of the British bands never achieve the levels of their first few recordings, and while most purists claim \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is the one to buy, anybody who's anybody knows that such a statement is patently false.From start to finish, the whole album is a complete work, and drastically improves on the ball-less debut album, especially with regard to production.

When the previous reviewer said it was too big for her, but worked for a size 16 woman, I ordered with confidence that it would be fine. It's not. It was, at best, a size 10 or smaller. The \\"angel\\" side, with the long sleeve, split at the seam, the second I put it on. The dress bottom was not long enough to wear without boy-shorts, or bike shorts, or *something* underneath, as it didn't come down long enough to cover anything. I didn't expect it to be high quality for the price, but I expected to be able to wear the costume I bought. Thankfully, I ordered it early enough, that I can purchase another costume to wear for my event. It will go in the trash, only having partially gotten it on, in the first 10 minutes of opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the series","review":"I've read the first two as well and have enjoyed the series very much. Her writing is good and she is an inspiration to anyone who dreams of living a more primitive life. I have been very fortunate to fulfill that dream and some of her advice (and mistakes) have been very helpful. When the price is reasonable for #4 in Anne's series I will happily add that to my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love these videos!","review":"We own both videos, animal alphabet and animal numbers. They are fantastic, the music is catchy (both my 2 and 4 year olds love to sing the songs) and the animal footage is beautiful. I would recommend this duo to anyone. It also helped increase my 2 year old with number recognition. He could count to 10 before this video, but now can look at a number and tell you what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally awesome, welove it","review":"This video is great for the whole family.

The songs are catchy and easy to sing along with. Your children will be able to name dozens of animals at the zoo after watching this video. It's great for all ages. My sons are 2 & 7 and both of them watch parts of the video almost every day. I like it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this little book!","review":"Dear reader,I can say with utmost sincerity that this was the first and only self-help book my mom and dad ever bought me. It's really the only one I ever needed. I was only 20 yrs old then, and it has changed my thinking and life for the better.For example, there's the story about the girl who missed a heap of good times but learned to play the piano to perfection. That inspired me. And another story about the man who cleared the field... he just \\"Kept at it! Kept at it! Kept at it!\\"Kenyon's message is a drumbeat of \\"struggle to improve the gift.\\" Keep moving forward. I read the stories to my children from the time they were old enough to understand its message.Also, at times in my life - when I honest to God - was hanging on by a thread, it was tidbits of inspiration like these that kept me. I am grateful for this little book.I still have my original copy, and I am 45 yrs old now. I will never part with it except to pass it on to my children or grandchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Japan!","review":"The first All Night Long movie is crazy, but this one is 10 times crazier! Just read what it's about: \\"In downtown Japan, a lonely computer nerd tries to maintain a peaceful existance while being stalked by a gang of deviant homosexuals who want to use him for their brutal S&M; activities\\"! Sounds crazy, right? Well, it's even crazier than it sounds! It has torture, sadomasochism, rape, murder, etc... and like the first one, it has a very violent and brutal ending! It's not very gory (it has some gore though), but the craziness makes up for it. A skinny computer nerd might not be as harmless as he seems. I love this series! All of the movies are about the dark side of human nature, about how we all have a violent side, about how a seemingly normal person can be a psychopath and/or a sadism, about how simple things can turn a person into a murderer, etc...Recommended. Definitely not for everyone though."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a doorstop - save your money!!","review":"This 50W DK subwoofer came free after I purchased the projector.

But the performance of both symphonies here is REALLY weird. Especially the First--which lacks any momentum or suspense of any kind. The highs and lows are extremely even, and the overall pacing is too slow. I don't mind the slow pace so much--but there's no variety as marked in the original manuscript! Even Bernstein didn't take these kind of liberties. Levi just missed it.

This song makes me want to throw up my candy. I dont think ive ever heard a worse song. I cringe when i think of what the full album must be like. Mandy Moore is the biggest panflash ever, and in a couple of months, she will be gone. She sings just as bad as Britney Spears, but at least brittney spears's songs dont make you want to litteraly chop off your ears! Pop music has gotten to be embarrinsingly bad! The only good pop music album was \\"Music Box\\" by Mariah Carey, and even Mariahs stuff has gotten pretty scary. Mandy, if your reading this, here's a tip: Keep your day job, cuz honey, your gonna need it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT just another Britney wannabe","review":"I first heard of Mandy Moore when 93 in Detroit had her as an in-studio guest. This was long before the \\"Candy\\" single was released, actually. Not only is she pretty and very talented, she's a very nice person too. Her voice is a little whiny at times, but she sounds better than Britney Spears. In fact, she sounds a lot more like Robyn. (Speaking of which - when's Robyn coming out with something new?) Fans of Britney et al. will definitely snap this one up. It's a catchy song, and the spoken interlude (\\"Love always, Mandy\\") part actually sounds kinda sexy.... Mandy definitely seems to be trying to cultivate a Britney-esque image, and it's working. I wish Mandy all the best, tho I still think Christina Aguilera is the most talented of the teen-pop queens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good- Better than Britney","review":"I really like this song! MAndy Moore is very talented and I think she will be around for awhile. She is right up there with Christina Aguilera- who has a beuatiful voice but so does Mandy. If you like MAndy I suggest you check out Jessica Simpson. All three aformentioned girls are better than Britney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy, Your Love Is As Sweet As Candy!","review":"First of all Let me add that this single is cool not only because Candy is a catchy song but because it come's with free stickers, Yeah. I love this single because of the remixes not the original version of the song but the remixes. The second remix is the best it starts out slow and sweet with mandy's voice breating heavily as she sings \\" I know who you are. your love is as sweet as candy. I'll be forever your's. love always mandy\\" and then all of a suden the song goes fast into a dance beat. Mandy is such a cuty, I wish she would get as much popularity with all her songs as she did with candy! The snippets (track 5) go so fast that you cant even pay attention to them that good and thats why I rated this single a 4! Oh well.

Mandy Moore is just trying to copy Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Now, to me, Britney Spears is just a little too full of herself and her music.

Her single does show a little talent from her, but she wants to be in pop because she's got nowhere else to go.

What a difference music was then compared to now. It sounds beautiful, all songs are taken word for word from the Bible and it is relaxing to hear. I recommend it to anyone.The first ten songs have lyrics and the last ten are the instrumental form of the first ten songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Amateur Approach","review":"Marc Shapiro takes just over 100 pages to say what many authors have said much better in biographical information recounted in magazine articles. The facts are bungled in details from the books which makes me question the facts about J. K. Rowling's life. Were those bungled as well?Clearly the book went to press prior to the time when the name of the Fourth Harry Potter Book was officially released because it refers to that book in it's working title. However the last couple of chapters report \\"facts\\" about J. K. Rowling's life that take place as late as the last quarter of the year 2000.Overall, save your time and money for more worthwhile reading..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it.","review":"I didn't get why this book was written at all. The author associated everything about her life with Harry Potter. I was going to do a report about her but then I couldn't find many important facts about her life. The facts that were in the book were all jumbled up and unorganized. Half of the magazine articles written about Ms. Rowling are better than this. It's not very helpful with report either. Don't spend your the time reading or purchasing this book. It's a waste of time and money. Go read the Harry Potter series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"This book is not at all what i had in mind when i purchased it. In reading the first ten pages it was clear that the book was poorly researched, there where errors in the names of the charactors, like when the author said that Harry was in love with Cho Chan, when it should be Cho Chang. There were other mistakes such as saying that Harry's world was full of creatures like crookshanks, reffering to it as a species when it is really Hermione's cat. Overall this was not a very satisfying book and I recomend waiting for a authorized biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but a little dissapointing","review":"Although the book was highly informative, it did not tell much more than what was already said in many interviews. Due to the fact that it was not an official biography he simply took the sources interviews and turned them into a book. I did not feel that the book was worth spending time reading. I also felt that the author was a little confused with some of the details in the books when he stated that owls run banks (although this may be a difference in the British and U.S. versions, the books say that goblins run Gringotts) he also states a few incoorect names. All in all the book is good for someone who has never read a single interview with J.K. Rowling. Don't expect any big shocking secrets no more has been revealed than the interview with scholastic and a few British magazines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother ....","review":"The author can't even be bothered to correct Rowling's birthdate in this \\"revised and updated\\" edition!!! It's a *biography* and he doesn't even have the subject's birthdate correct. Sean Smith's biography of Rowling is far superior. This one shouldn't even be on the market, and I can't fathom why large chains are stocking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping on the bandwagon","review":"This book is shockingly bad. It is appallingly written, has very little content, many errors, and is highly repetitive. By the author's own admission, it is merely a collection of facts gathered from published articles and interviews, and official and unofficial web sites; in other words, Marc Shapiro has found an easy way to make easy money, by gathering public information (and not very much of it) in a short, unsatisfactory book riddled with errors (Knight's Cross Station in London? There is no such place, in reality or Rowling's fiction.) If you really want to know as much about JK Rowling as you can, this book is perhaps easier than your own internet research, but do not expect to discover anything new or surprising, do not expect to enjoy the read, and bear in mind that Joanne Rowling has not validated a single word in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"While this book gave me a better idea of the life of J.K. Rowling I was very disappointed with Marc Shapiro's writing. The whole time I was reading I found myself wondering if Shapiro had actually read the Harry Potter books. A devoted fan of the Harry POtter series I noticed right away the many mistakes Shapiro made while talking about the books themselves. A note of advice DO NOT spend money on this book!!! Get it from the library if you want to read it. It isnt worth even the few dollars you may spend on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her life isn't all about one series","review":"When I had gotten this book, I was excitied on the prospects of getting to know J.K. Rowling's life better. Her childhood, motherhood, and other things interesting in her life besides Harry Potter. However what I got was not at all what I wanted...actrully exactly the opposite. Though it did have some parts on her childhood the things were very vague and gave you hardly any information. Half of this book was on Harry, and practically a lot of info in this book everybody already knows. It seems all J.K. ever really accomplished in her life were the Harry Potter books. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because it was informative on what J.K. is going to name her future Harry Potter books and some plot lines to number 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information.","review":"All that is in here is what you can find on JK Rowling's website. Only if you have no access to an internet connection, and you haven't read her previous interviews, then this book would be informative to you. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read.","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. Apart from being badly written, it is obvious that the author has never met JK Rowling and all the information is pieced together from interviews she has given to various newspapers and magazines. There is no substance to this book at all, just many repetitions and inconsistencies. It is obvious that both the author and the publisher are trying to cash in on JK Rowling's success, because they figure that people will buy the book because they like the \`Harry Potter' books and want to know more about JK Rowling. This is the mistake I made. Do yourself the favour and save both time and money and just read a few newspaper interviews with JK Rowling - they will be far more enlightening and informative than this book. If there was an option to give this book a zero star rating I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed To Do Homework, Gave Away To Much!","review":"I didn't like the typos, I didn't like the inaccuracies, and for god sake don't give away so many spoilers.

I wanted to read about Ms. Rowling, if I wanted parts of the book ruined I would have asked someone in my home who read the book to do it thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"The writing style leads me to believe that this book is written for older elementary school age to middle school age children, so thankfully it was a quick read. The entire book is just a piecing together of interviews. Marc Shapiro has never interviewed J.K. Rowling himself. So there wasn't anything new or all that interesting in the book if you've read the interviews JKR has given over the years.Shapiro also does a very lazy job of updating the book by just tacking on new material every couple of years to the end.Overall, it was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better","review":"I checked this book out from the library hoping to learn more about JK Rowling, but I was disappointed. It provided very little about her, more about Harry Potter than anything else. Most of what's in here you can find in interviews she has done in the past.Something that really irritated me was the constant jumping around this book did. It would be describing something at a specific period in JK's life, then jump ahead 5 years and describe something else, then jump back 8 years, and so on. That was really confusing at first and really irritating. There are probably much better books, don't bother reading this, you won't learn anything new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Drivel","review":"I was unable to finish this book due to the glaring errors and poor craftsmanship. I should have realized that any author who listed People magazine as a model of respected journalism was not to be trusted; still, I let my curiosity get the best of me. Finally, I determined that I could, in fact, be reading ONLY what could be described as an UN-authorized biography; and a re-read of the front cover of the book confirmed my desperate diagnosis. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this book stinks; it reads like a ghastly farce of a paper cut-n-copy fan-zine. I should like to see what a more capable author (not to mention editor and proofreader) would do with such interesting material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Errors","review":"I belive that the man who wrote this book did not read the books at all or he did not know what he was doing.On the second time of reading it.

It is so filled with misinformation and bungled facts that it actually made us angry that it got published. The author got some of the most basic facts wrong like the year of her birth, why she is called J.K., and why she wrote in cafes. Really, he could have gotten better information for his research using Wikipedia. Do not waste your time or money on this useless piece of trash! Anyone interested in researching J.K.

However, as the book progressed it became very obvious that the author knew very little about the books themselves. He suuggested that owls run gringotts bank, and called cho cang cho chan. As other reviewers have already mentioned he also made a flaw on Miss Rowlings birthday. I know every one is human, therefore prone to flaw, but the lack of editing was noticeable. There was some pretty good pics, and lots off fascinating tid bits, but perhaps could use a bit more editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk away!","review":"How I wish I had read some online reviews before picking up this clunker at the Barnes and Noble this week! It would be patronizing and insulting to kids to say this was written for children. Kids who read and understand the Harry Potter books will be far too advanced to find this more than a paperweight. Grammatical errors abound, the author apparently has a very limited vocabulary (he repeats pets phrases two and three times per paragraph) and yes, it is obvious he has never picked up and read a Harry Potter book. How else can one explain the Shapiro statement that wizarding banks are run by owls?!Give this one a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, beautiful, and touching","review":"Peaceable Kingdom: The Journey Home is beautifully filmed, filled with gorgeous views of rural scenes and sweet animals. The movie interweaves the stories of people who used to raise animals for profit, then were profoundly transformed by the animals themselves. The film's human stars and animal stars can both bring you to the realization that the greatest role of chickens, pigs, goats, cows, sheep, and turkeys in your life is as loving companions, with their own fascinating lives and deep love to share. The scene of the mother sheep and lambs reuniting is alone worth getting the movie for. Please open your heart and reconnect to your own most fundamental feelings by watching this film. Share the lives of the movie's human and animal stars as they speak not just in words, but in emotions and actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The G-Rated Earthlings","review":"This movie is great for so many reasons. It doesn't rely on gory images meant to induce guilt in its viewers. Instead, it focuses on the amazing personalities of animals, the way we connect to them and why they deserve more from us.

To everyone involved in the production of this film, thanks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give yourself the gift of this film","review":"Commit to investing an hour & watching this movie.

The Ring was pretty good, I enjoyed it. Not top flight fantasy like Martin or Keyes, but still pretty well done. I had high hopes then for the Chalice. Sadly, those hopes were dashed by page 50. Just not a good book that wrapped up 700 pages of prologue in literally 15 pages. The ending was way too rushed, and just not good.The one redeeming quality of this book is Prince Gavril, who despite being one of the biggest jerks around, is far more interesting than Faldain. Without spoiling the end of this book, if you have read more than 2 fantasy series, you can already guess the conclusion. In fact, you can probably tell exactly what will happen 100 pages into the book.This put such a bad taste into my mouth that I won't be reading Queen's Gambit."},{"rating":"2","title":"To each his own","review":"In contrast with the reviewer who gave this wonderful recording 2 stars, citing its speed as a liability, I love this recording both for its speed and for its bright and beautiful sound.

I bought her this book though (as with many others) in hopes that something will set off a spark and have her wanting to read. For some reason (I'm sure it was the wonderful artwork on the cover) she was attracted to this one. Once her nose was in the book, you almost never saw it leave. She absolutely loved it. So much so that I decided I needed to read it too. I adored the book. Jodi Lynn Anderson does such a good job at spinning a wonderful tale of the Ever After.

Well it really isn't anymore... who would've thought, gangsta rap has gotten REALLY boring. Whether it's the barking style of DMX or the flat out repugnant \\"artists\\" known as Cash Money Records, hardcore rap hasn't sounded worse. The artists that sell the most in hip hop (Tupac, Eminem) are ones that are actually saying things that shock us, rather than simply saying shocking, vulgar things. This CD should be used as the tombstone for hip hop which is clearly by any indication on its deathbed. If you think this CD is worth more than 1 star, you REALLY need to go back and hear what hip hop sounded like a few years ago.

Even first-time director Arie Posin was surprised to be able to get Glenn Close for a role. I guess she doesn't mind slumming every now and then. But I hate to see a great young actor like Jamie Bell (\\"Billy Elliot\\") misspend his time and talent this way.The creators of this movie evidently think it has \\"a lot going on\\", but essentially \\"The Chumscrubber\\" is just disconnected and incoherent drivel and blather. See it only if you wish to waste your time by watching accomplished actors waste theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Even charming stars like Jason Isaacs and others could not save this silly, inept script. One wonders who in Hollywood really doesn't know anything at all about Americans other that dumb Californians who don't know that \\"All the nuts roll West\\" is the true psychological theory about how crazy California really is. Putting out such trash films shows the reality of that theory which is taught in college psych classes everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst excuse for a movie.

In a pathetic attempt to be edgy and a vehicle for insight into the plastic world of middle class suburbia, it just comes off as pretentious and unsympathic. I don't get the characters motivations, except for the bullies. The one thing that actually saves this movie from the pit of despair is the acting, Fiennes, Miller, Janney Closer, were nothing short of superb and all of the kids were really great. Oh and the soundtrack kicks ass. The ending? in two words pretentious melodrama. If Meredith Baxter and Kirk Cameron were in it this would of made a great, wonderful Lifetime movie. Someone lost a bet with Posin and I guess it was Dreamworks."},{"rating":"2","title":"lighten up","review":"Jeez, some people (other reviewers) just do not get it . This is a black comedy, the key word here is \\"comedy\\", so many things will be quite quirky and strange/underground/dark, not within the spectrum of our daily lives like a characature in film format. This may not be five star stuff, but any movie that keeps my attention, and makes me wonder just what the hell is going to happen next, gets my approval to recommend it to others. Just rent it, and many of you will want to buy it, in order to see the looks on your friends faces as they watch it for the first time. A great watch, and that's what really matters here. I actually bought it by accident.

Goes beyond believability, relies very heavily on unusual and unlikely situations to make its point.

If a movie is described as a 'dark satire' or 'dark comedy' - I won't get it. Granted, I'm a 45-year-old mother of two (not exactly 'hip') but this movie just seemed weird to me.The only reason I don't give it one star is because of the fine actors and actresses in it. Unfortunately, most of their talents are wasted (except for Glenn Close).All in all, just a strange movie that I did not enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required viewing","review":"This film has every element of a cult classic. It's funny, sad, satirical, enlightening, disheartening and thought provoking. It's a screenplay of depth paired with a cast of true talent. Chumscrubber has the ability to reach a multitude of generations with its vast array of themes and situations. This film should be required viewing for teenagers as well as their misdirected parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous and Stupid","review":"I can't agree with the reviews that have emphasized that this film is somehow \\"real\\". Neither the teenagers nor the adults in this snoozefest reminded me of anyone I know or have ever known and yes, I grew up in the suburbs as well.Of course none of this would matter if the story weren't stupid beyond all belief. I'm tacking on the second star because the acting actually wasn't bad, but then again it's not hard to stand out against a painted backdrop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the Murk, This Trail is Ended. G'night, Cinematic Failure #83,037...","review":"A more aptly entitled film never crossed my macadam.

Both occur in suburbia, both have somewhat of a family drama element, both deal with death, and both have an absurd/sci-fi element to them. Darko's elements pull together beautifully, while Chumscrubber's meander, without a clear direction.I loved Ralph Fiennes performance, as the delusional mayor of the town, but it didn't add up to anything. The plot yields no greater discoveries of character, beyond the fact that everyone needs to take drugs because they hate their lives. But rather than having people change or deal with their problems, they seem to squirm about in them, never dealing with anything concrete or moving foward. The lack of dramatic action results in a film that, although interesting in content, never approaches the satisfactory build and arc of Donnie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This looks to have the ingredients for a good indie...DONT BE FOOLED","review":"If you decide to watch this, you'll sit down expecting a nice indie film with a timely commentary on american suburban life. You'll watch and wait and wait and wait for things to start getting good. Two hours later you'll wonder how a movie like this gets made.The \\"characters\\" are nonsensical to the point that its impossible to imagine what the director was even attempting to capture. Really awful.Instead try Donnie Darko, Thumbsucker, My Summer of Love, Edukators, or Lila Says."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT cast, not a great movie...","review":"I rented this because I thought such a great cast would hopefully mean it was a good movie, and it sounded interesting, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. (As always - bad script = bad movie.) It has a few moments here and there, but mostly it's kind of a mess. It's too bad; I have to wonder what attracted these really excellent actors to it, but I suppose they all have mortgages to pay too! LOL The youngsters in the cast are as good as the more experienced older actors. I would give the cast 5 stars, the movie only 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Heard all these good reviews about Chumscrubber then when I did watch it wondered why I had bothered.To me, it just seems like it is trying to be meaningful but my problem is that it is set in today's society. Nowadays the culture for \\"perfect appearance\\" primarily held by the media contests with \\"embracing one's faults or differences\\")--there is less of perfect appearance culture now as opposed to earlier (Think 1950s) and in any case for a satire I don't think they went far enough down that track. The main problem is that in order to be profound, well...you need to have some content. Some NEW content. If you are looking for a film which tries to achieve an edgy, thought provoking film instead of one which just leaves you utterly confused and wondering what dolphins have to do with anything, I would suggest Donnie Darko."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of Kuralt, this will be a treat!","review":"I hadn't thought about Charles Kuralt for years - until I ran into his book on tape entitled 'Summer.' Kuralt pulls summer-based items from his reports from CBS News and reminds us (this listener anyway) that we've missed his folksy approach on the reporting on everyday life in America since his passing a few years ago.Kuralt lays it on a bit thick from time to time but he avoids being too schmaltzy as he reports to us about Maypole dances in Minnesota and tubin' down the Apple River in Wisconsin. The best reports are on side two, where he focuses on the Fourth of July. He travels to Gettysburg and Independence Hall, New York City and Brazil and takes us along for an emotional ride.Although he takes a lot of his footage from his television reports, only once or twice did this listener feel that he was missing something by not actually seeing the pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food Essays","review":"\\"The Artful Eater\\" is similar to \\"The Man Who Ate Everything\\" in its detailed, perhaps obsessive attention to things gustatory. Behr's writing tends to be more serious, less irreverent and self-deprecatingly humorous than Steingarten's. He approaches food with gravity and curiosity but certainly not with the righteousness and pompousness of Christopher Kimball. He has collected here essays that each explore in detail a single food type, such as apples, eggs, walnuts, or vanilla beans. He infuses his writing with interesting facts about using the ingredient, how it produced, and ways of discerning quality. I imagine any experienced cook would enjoy the book as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Food","review":"Well researched and well written.

Patrick Muldoon (Starship Troopers, The Arrival II) and Theresa Russell (Black Widow) join forces to try to stop the creature before it inhabits the town and everywhere else.

The author's avoidance of focussing on Tipton's homosexuality and seeing her life as a pragmatic decision due to her love of jazz and the constraits of her era are a major weakness in this book. It was not a \\"hard to put down\\" but a \\"can't get through it\\" read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Tipton Remains a Mystery","review":"I was shocked to find out that the author has received awards for her previous biographies. I think this book is poorly written. I don't think there was enough material to write a book here. The author is thorough in listing Billy's \\"gigs\\" but cannot come up with anything concrete about her personal life. This is not actually the author's fault; however, while researching the topic, she should have realized there was not enough information to write an entire book. So what she does is ask question after question about Billy and even writes passages the way things might have been (but we'll never know, she says). If one has to guess and piece together the way things may have been, why even bother with the subject? One can get more mileage out of a subject like this through fiction (such as \\"M Butterfly\\" or some of Shakespeare's plays)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dog toy","review":"My six year old Australian Shepherd and I have been using these small frisbees in games of catch since she was a puppy.

Listening to this disc in professional head phones is indescribable - the sound is so rich.I was skeptical toward this version of the Rite of Spring, as I'd heard very well conducted versions of the piece already, but to my surprise it was better than any other version I had heard. Before listening to it I had said I found the Stravinsky conducted (Columbia SO) recording from 1960 to be an 8/10 performance and the Karel Ancerl conducted (Czech PhO) recording from 1962 to be 9/10, but I was still waiting for a 10/10 ten version.

Congrats to JR on her debut!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope the author has more like this","review":"I read a couple of chapters as a preview and was immediately hooked. This is very good writing, especially for a first effort. The characters are well drawn and just quirky enough to be really interesting and often amusing. They're attractive people. The basic idea of a somewhat out-of-the-ordinary police consultant joining forces with an amateur, a distinctly out-of-the-ordinary geek, is very appealing. This has all sorts of possibilites for a great series. I hope a sequel is coming soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Not be Published","review":"The language of The Crowning Circle is elementary, copycat andcommon.

By the closing of chapter one, I was hooked bad. I whipped to chapter two, then three, then four, and so on, daring my family to even mention the word \\"dinner?\\". The Crowning Circle is about more than just two men searching for a killer. It's about friendship and honor and human commitment. The challenges Skeet and Jake face don't deter them from what's right; in fact these challenges make them more admirable. I was a part of their lives right up to the last paragraph.

I loved the characters, Jake being my favorite. J. R. Lankford has done her homework especially the technogeeky stuff. At first I felt myself trying to critique the novel because it was a first effort but by the fourth chapter I was totally engrossed. This is a classic edge of your seat page turner.

From forensic psychologist to computer nerd they were as ordinary as they were unique. At various times I feared for them, felt frustrated by their bad decisions, was impressed by their good ones--and when I reached the end of the story, I hated to tell them goodbye. At all times I cared about them. (I even find myself wondering what happened to these people after the book ended.) The Crowning Circle is a great read. I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A meditation on love and a murder mystery","review":"How many murder mysteries are at their core a meditation on love? In my experience, not many. But in Lankford's novel, we are treated to an intellectual thriller with the most unusual cast of charcters in the genre. Skeet is a black PhD psychologist with a ton of secrets from his time in Nam. His music buddy, Jake, is an eccentric white software genius. Skeet's girlfriend, Shirely, is a black/Vietnamese beauty who is not accepted by the Vietnamese community. The unusual mixture works perfectly due to the clear and concise writing and the compelling narrative drive. We are most vulnerable in how we love and this vulnerability is explored in depth in both the bad guy and the good guys.Any fan of the genre owes it to themselves to check out this book, and encourage this first time author to continue writing. But understand that once you start, be prepared to read it whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The book does cover some good matial in an okay way.

The Tunnel, Otto's Boy, and 58 Minutes were exciting reads with good plots and page turning narrative. This book falls far short of those other two with its wafer-thin characters and annoyingly condescending tone. Also, for an action-thriller this book has a lot of space taken up by Wager's political opinions and societal observations of late 1960's America, which is when this book was written.I only recommend this book for die-hard Wager fans.

Considering a move to the Seattle area from the mid-Atlantic, I picked up Mr. Steele's \\"Relocating to Seattle\\" and found that I had hit the jackpot! Sort of like One Stop Shopping - I found all the information I could possibly need for anticipating and making the move westward. He even had advice and suggestions on topics I hadn't even thought about! Also, expecting - as with many travel books - rather dry text, I was thrilled to find that Mr. Steele's book was a truly enjoyable read! Lots of personal annecdotes and well-placed humor made it a book I will hang onto for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I don't like this book. The neighborhood reviews are too short and too opinionated. The author clearly thinks that owning a big pink house in the suburbs is paradise. As a result, his descriptions of the city neighborhoods are all scorn and no detail. Also, a big chunk of the book is boilerplate info from monstermoving.com that has no particular relavence to Seattle.I also got the Newcommers Handbook for Seattle, and I am much more impressed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relocating to Seattle","review":"Some good information but the book tries to cover too much and hence, doesn't do anything exceptionally well.

I was hoping to learn more about demographics of surrounding communities but only a few were covered and not in much depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page-Turner","review":"I enjoyed this Stuat Woods book on Kindle and found it hard to put down. The characters were well-developed, and there were plenty of twists, turns and surprises in the plot.

Even then, the ending was satisfying enough, and I'm glad I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well below par!","review":"Apparently you folks havent read Stuart Woods early novels.

My favorite has got to be the difference between Episcopalians and Methodists. Having grown up on the Methodist side of the battle, I have to admit she's dead on in her description of our Campbell's mushroom soup-based funeral fare. I was so happy to see that Daddy had picked up a signed copy for me from McCormick's when I was home to visit last week.

The author practically swoons over those fabulously fortunate [white] folks who owned plantations. I think we all know who provided the labor force on said plantations. Thus nostalgia for slavery is pretty much undisguised. I quit reading and returned the book to the library at this point.

If the other books in the series are as good as this one, I want them all.Caution to those who buy this book for the recipes - everything is a can of this, a dollop of this and they aren't really recipes anybody who likes to cook from scratch would make.

I took my time reading the book because it had so much delightful information that can be so easily understood that it could be easily and quickly skipped over and missed. Sometimes we need reminders and a new way of looking at life and success and how it is supposed to be fun and flow. This book reminded me of that and gave me some new ideas. As I read this book it calmed me down, reminding me that success comes naturally as a result of keeping ourselves happy and simplifying life's tasks. It is a must have to any book collection.

It also lists on the cover that it is for beginners and intermediate, this listing is accurate. There are some advanced things I would like to do with Powrpoint, that I have seen done, this book does not cover. If the author did an advanced book, I would buy that also.

It seemed like they failed to keep up with times and had a real 90's sound. Regardless, I went out and bought a copy of their new record \\"The Shadow Line\\" today and it smokes! The first single- \\"Trapped In Your Lies' is a heavy-driven rock song with hooks galore. Unreal. The best song on the record for sure is \\"Fall Down\\" which I can only compare to Hoobastank's \\"The Reason\\". It is a catchy rock-ballad that will blow you away. For anyobe who likes rock music, this CD is a must have. the band certainly outdid themselves with this record and it lives up to the hype that has been created on their new release. I HIGHLY recommend this record!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CHILD DEVIANT","review":"Lame! So sad to report, but this band, despite thier talent...has lost my interrest. This is a simple rock record that brings a little hyped up DVD to help make you hate the album even more than when you listened to it. Yeah, they still look coool, but they sound like a band who is despearte to appeal to a radio friendly generation. It's not going to happen. Even cashing in on the anti-Bush card, as much as I relate to that, it's a worthless effort. It sucks. I could care less what Godhead does next. They are used-to-be's who became never-will-be-again's.

I first got into Godhead at the end of 2000 when I saw them open for Marilyn Manson. So when \\"2000 Year of Human Error\\" was released I picked it up and fell in love with it. Their next album was \\"Evolver\\", which was a step down in my opinion. Just when I was thinking that Godhead would never put out another great alblum they released \\"The Shadow Line\\". The best way I can describe this album is a cross between\\"2000 Year of Human Error\\" and an Orgy album. Its a little less goth then their debut, but also better. I won't get into all of the songs but every track is great except for maybe track 5 (Push) and track 11 (Your End Of Days). Just buy it and see for yourself how good this record is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I've been a huge fan of gODHEAD since I first heard them...I bought Power Tool Stigmata and 2000 Years of Human Error and loved them...Evolver was pretty whiney but at least you could rock out to some of the songs....this is just pure emo rubbish. I know their songs have never exactly been positive, but at least they had that good old-fashioned metal energy...this is just whine whine whine...I'm ashamed I ever bought this album, I actually have it tucked away in a drawer so nobody can see it. I used to love these guys...hung out with them at a concert, etc, but their music is quickly turning into whiney emo crap and I, for one, am not buying another one of their albums unless they stop boohoo'ing and start rocking again.

The orchestra and chorus sounds very distant and shallow. The Atlanta Orchestra has made an admirable attempt to record this piece. Unfortunately, the competition is overwhelming among other recorded Mahler 8ths. For the outlay required for one CD, one would be far better served to purchase the historic 1972 recording of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (recorded in Vienna) on London/Decca. Even the 1960s recording of the 8th with Bernstein and thd London Symphony Orchestra, while not a first choice, is far preferable to this recording.A final detail that I do not like about this recording: the organ music comes through speakers, not an authentic pipe organ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shamefully Underrated","review":"I couldn't say it any better, i prefer this to the other recording i have (Solti), this sounds much more authentic and might i say at a bargain price. start your exploration of Mahler's 8'th here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Mahler 8th ever!!","review":"This performance is almost as bad as the Mahler 8th I witnessed Shaw destroy with the Cleveland Orchestra around 20 years ago. He simply had no conception of what to do with an orchestra nor the intelligence to make anything out of this great work.There are a number of excellent Mahler 8ths (Maazel, Tennstedt on DVD, Kubelik, Haitink, Neumann...) but if you truly want the best, look up the remastering of Eugene Flipse's stunning performance with the Rotterdam Philharmonic. It dates from the mid 50's, the singers include some of the finest post WWII artists and the man clearly knew the work inside and out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels decending from heaven","review":"My usual commute wouldn't allow anything more than the first movement. Thanks to the accident/construction, one day my commute took unusally longer which allowed me to sit tight in my car and listen the entire CD. When it was over, I was in tears because it was so beautiful and inspriational. I am fairly new to Mahler and I don't have any bias or expectation on how this symphony should be played. But I know good music when I can hear it and I absolutely love this album. Not only it sounded killer (I have a high end car stereo) and the performance was spectacular, especially the choral part at the last movement was out of this world. I almost saw Angels decending from the Heaven.As a life long Wagnerian, I am very familiar with Solti so I purchased his 1972 CSO recording. Solti was usual himself in that album. However, everytime I want to listen to M8, Shaw/ASO M8 is the one I play. Since then I got M2 by Levi/ASO, which was also a killer. I highly recommend that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Start","review":"This was my first experience with CJ Barry. This book was beyond formulaic in its rendering and could not be saved by what little chemistry there was (after more than half the book) between the luckily-DNA-capatible aliens. If there is anything worth repeating by purchasing the other two books in this series I could not find it.In addition to being predictable Barry's world is confusing; with descriptions of machinery and technology which are certainly uninteresting and only distracting. While the female characters are spunky the male lead is uninteresting and uncharismatic. While I understand that most of us reading romantic fiction are in it for the relationships and the happy endings (dare I say: the SEX?), CJ Barry has given it to us; there is nothing to distinguish this novel from any other girl meets boy paper weight.The only reason it got two stars is because of the Bobzillas."},{"rating":"1","title":"7 good stories out of 30","review":"I really liked Baxter's \\"In the Un-Black\\", Moorcock's \\"A Slow Saturday Night at the Surrealist Sporting Club\\" and Wells's \\"'Bassador\\", and liked the stories by Whitton, Kelly, Rucker+Shirley and Niven.

She is the sort who recommends Biblical morality while going against it. It's too bad. There's no real discussion as to why she can't say whether or not Simpson killed two people. Sure, he lied to the author of this book repeatedly and was angry if she challenged him. Sure, he became almost violent with her--of course, she wasn't married to him yet.

This is completely wrong, says Fuller. If anything, Kuhn legitimized the idea that science should be subject to one dominant paradigm, excluding all alternatives. From that standpoint, it's easy to see why he testified for the intelligent design people since Darwinism is a closed shop in biology -- and isn't even treated as falsifiable (which is Popper's point). Make no mistake: This book isn't a simple Dummy's Guide to Kuhn and Popper like some of the other books mentioned by the commentators here.

I've watched this video at least ten times, and I'm still not sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent makeover of the play into a movie!","review":"This is an offbeat story of a gay female impersonator in his seach for love and a committed relationship. Primarily psychological drama with excellent insights and incisive dialog. Anne Bancroft is great as the Jewish mother, and Harvey Fierstein, who wrote the original play, brings so much angst and personality to his portrayal of the main character that I just couldn't help wishing I knew someone like that in real life. Highly recommended if you want to know more about a lifestyle most people have never seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old favorite I just had to own","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out.

They spend their time sniping at the cartoons who pose as secondary charcters or bitng back some smart-aleck remark that the reader has to read. There's also plenty of warm-hearted gush such as women weaned on women's magazines like.Most silly of all is that the main character runs into person after person who want nothing more that to discuss in detail with strangers everything that they know about everyone involved.Her readers must be semi-literates, overworked to the point at which they don't want anything but pablum.Jane Jeffry - criminal tree murderer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Jane and Shelly!","review":"This installment of Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffry series is a bit of a disappointment.

Ms. Churchill had a great idea for this book but I feel that she failed to follow through as well in this book as she usually does. I'm not saying that this book is not worth reading. In fact, read them all. This series is a lot of fun and a lot of laugh out loud funny jokes. I would just say that this installment is a bit weaker than the other Jane Jeffry Mystery books.

I was extremely disappointed! Had the actual wash cloth that I received been the same thick material that the Salux one is then I definitely wouldn't have had a problem sticking with it. This one is made of a cheap material that feels very thin. Contacted Amazon immediately and am shipping it back for full refund. I should have read the other reviews before ordering so that is my bad.

I ordered these and am sad to say that they are not at all what they used to be. They even have a new name now that I didn't realize until after I ordered them. The old ones were strong and thick. These new ones are light and thin. So disappointing. Also, I ordered aqua and received green. I will look elsewhere for the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous for smoother skin ...","review":"When I purchased a few as holiday gifts, I also impulsively threw another in the basket for me.

Instead, received a Chinese made \\"Leyijie.\\" I have not used this Chinese product yet and will not return it (as we opened the package when it arrived to compare the quality to a real Salux washcloth.) Granted, these washcloths soften with repeated use, but this Leyijie feels very scratchy and the weave does not seem as consistent as the Salux.

My daughter (5) got it as a gift and loved it from first sight. She and I played with it for half an hour together, and only the \\"lock\\" pulled off, so I wasn't worried. I folded it up, put the lock back in place and we thought it was great. The next morning, she woke up and took it out ot play with it on her own. She managed to open it by herself, set it up to play, and then everything went wrong. The swing broke 5 or six times over the course of an hour, and the parts are tiny. Then after she was finished playing, she tried to fold the castle up and as she did, and I watched, the floor in one room broke off and the pillars in the other came apart. She is so dissapointed. She really liked the concept of this toy, but it's VERY poorly constructed. Save your money...it's just not worth it! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Cheaply Made","review":"This toy is way too expensive for the cheap production of it! I love the idea behind it though. It folds up so your child can take it anywhere. The problem is that it never folds up very well and can break very easily if not folded exactly right. Also the swing never attached very well and when I finally got it to work, Sleeping Beauty never would actually sit. She slid right off. I guess this bothered me more thn my 5 and 2 year olds. They enjoyed it for a while. The plastic furniture gets lost, but that is not unusual for these type of toys. Unfortunately, I just ended up throwing this toy away. What a waste!! Again, this toy is way too expensive for what it is. Disney should start making better quality toys for our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better Quality From Disney","review":"My 3-year-old daughter wanted this product so badly for Christmas. It was expensive but Santa delivered. I am thoroughly disappointed with it and I hope Santa reassigned the elves responsible for construction of this toy! It so cheaply made and never folds up properly...staircases and pillars bend, the swing has never worked (it fell off when we opened it for the first time) and the floor keeps popping up once it's opened. She still plays with it but gets frustrated that it doesn't \\"work\\". There is a Little Tikes version of a castle similar to this...I believe it's Cinderella and the figures are short with snap-on clothing. We have that one too and, not only is it better quality, the price is (or was at Christmas) better. I'd take the Little Tikes version over this one any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"I agree with several of the other reviewers, it is very cheaply made but my 4 year old doesn't seem to mind she uses it with all of her other polly pocket princesses.

I expected much more violence than what there was. A small scene where the White Arab attempts to force the abducted girl, Georgie, to give him oral sex and there was something that I THINK was supposed to be a rape scene, but otherwise no more violent than an episode of Criminal Minds.

The show is fine, albeit dated, and deserves 4 stars if one disregarded the audio quality which is incredibly poor and certainly below even 1950s standards. But how on earth can you disregard the fact that the music and the dialogs and the jokes (which is WHY you'd buy this DVD !) are garbled and at parts unintelligible; there are scenes one simply cannot make out what is being said or sung.I am in the process of complaining to Amazon, but given their non-return policy concerning \\"opened\\" DVDs I expect some discussion about how one might learn of unacceptable quality without opening this product.

I was amazed. Bruckner's brass section stampedes out of the speakers. I have to admit that the stirring opening movement reminds me of a caravan moving across the sand dunes in search of Egyptian treasure. The relaxed Adagio is delicate like a breeze and is interrupted perfectly by the following Scherzo rather like someone stepped on a fire-ant hill. The final movement is a typical Bruckner cavalry charge. Telarc gives the orchestra the space to expand exponentially but can capture the intimacy of the softest phrase. If you can appreciate the visceral thrill of being trampled by hordes of explosive brass instruments you will not be disappointed by this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad introduction lacking in \\"good proofs\\"","review":"According to my instructor for this course, I would not receive an A (or probably a B) if I wrote my proofs like Fitzpatrick does.

The most serious problem is its lack of examples. The theorems alone do not help the student understand the concepts and do his or her homework. Also, I don't know if it's because the author is lazy or just that some things seem easy to the author himself, but when the theorems are presented, a lot of times it would just say \\"it immediately follows from...(some other theorem)\\" or say \\"it is not hard to show ...\\" but DOESN'T SHOW IT.

The selections are all great virtuoso showpieces, and track #6 by Messiaen (Dieu parmi nous from La Nativite') is especially demonstrative of the great contrasts available in a large organ. The horizontal trumpets in this piece are predominant and very bright, contrasting with the snarling bass of the pedal organ.A word of caution - this CD requires a capable stereo (think subwoofer) to sound its best.

I strongly suggest this album for its DMB/Jack Johnson mellow style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willy Porter","review":"I've been a huge fan of Willy Porter for the past 12 years. I first saw him in \\"concert\\" ... . He was promoting his first album--The Trees have soul--and WOW, I was stunned at his amazing and overwhelming REAL talent. Willy has become a recognized and celebrated performer since then. HUGE! But, he's still Willy--a good midwestern soul. He might be touring with the big league (Sting, Tori Amos, Paul Simon etc.), but he still said \\"yes\\" to a private concert for his biggest fan who he had never met. I recommend buying all three CD's at once--they will all blow you away. You will treasure and protect them as much as I have and continue to do. I even have backups!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Feeling of Being Transported","review":"I have always reserved a warm corner in my soul for haunting, folk-inspired music from artists such as Emmylou Harris and Dan Fogelberg. When I first heard the sounds on this album, and experienced the feeling of being transported that such music can provide, I knew that there was another musician with the same sensibilities. The tracks that really stand out for me are \\"The Line\\" and \\"Anonymous Caller.\\" If you enjoy the same spirit in the music you listen to, don't pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This guy has all the tools for greatness. His voice is beautiful and soulful. His songs are well crafted and lovely. His musicianship is outstanding. He's got the goods and he delivers on this excellent cd. There is so much good music here it will take an awfully long time to absorb it. There are many tracks that stand out. Sister is one that is just fabulous. I can't say enough good things about this artist. I will look forward to hearing more work from him in the future. Thank You, Willy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willy knows how to deliver","review":"We've been waiting for this 3rd album and it delivers what Willy does best...the thoughtful lyrics, amazing guitar work and his voice which can be playful and soulful all at once. favorite tracks \\"Sowelu\\" and \\"Anonymous Caller\\" and \\"Paper Airplane\\".

I feel stoned without smoking anything. Pure happiness. I saw Willie sing live and loved it, loved him, but this is the one CD that really captures his magic. I wish he could write more music like this, but at least I have this music, I turn to it often, in times of happiness and when I need a lift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Old-Fashioned Ghost Story, But Please Do Read The Book","review":"I can add little to the review of the movie that the other people haven't. This is an old-fashioned type ghost story, relying on atmosphere rather than special effects and splattering blood. I did want to mention, though, that if possible the viewer should get a used copy of the book \\"The Uninvited\\" by Dorothy MacArdle. It's even more eerily atmospheric, with no \\"comic relief\\" at all, and with some wonderful side characters that unfortunately were left out of the movie. In addition, there is an interesting sub-plot (relevant to the ghost story) about a play that the main character is writing that was dropped from the movie when they decided to make him a composer rather than a theater critic/author. Then, after you read \\"The Uninvited\\" you might want to pick up a copy of \\"The Unforeseen\\" by the same author. It's not as good as the former, but will tell you what happened to the main characters from \\"The Uninvited\\" after the book ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Scare's Me......","review":"This movie is excellent in the fact that even though you know what's going to happen it still scare's you.I can think \\"their not in any danger,their in the next scene\\" but that does nothing to alleviate the tension and atmosphere.I get so sick of \\"horror\\" movie's nowaday's that rely only on jump scare's...the movie \\"Boogeyman\\" did exactly that.I watched it once,liked it but later on when I went to watch it again it didn't do anything for me,oh a couple scare's caught me off guard because I wasn't paying attention but overall the fun was out of the movie after the first time.Not so with this movie.I know EXACTLY what's going to happen and I still get scared.I put this movie in the rank of other great's like the haunting of hill house and the tingler and the innocent's and 13 ghost's and nightwalker and the house on haunted hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unwanted","review":"I saw this recommended by a few people reviewing The Haunting(1963), so I thought it might be good. What a disappointment.Except for the girl, the acting is atrocious and overdone, 1930s style. They even have the temerity to show the ghost and give us a logical explanation of events. Bang goes all sense of mystery and intrigue.The more this movie sinks in, the more it becomes obvious that it's a cheap imitation of Rebecca(1940). The coastal setting, the dead hand of the past, the sexual intrigue...the similarities go on. But Rebecca is scary (if a bit slow-starting)whereas this only offers a bit of nice scenery.Gail Russell does a great job as Stella, just exactly what you'd expect from a sensitive girl in such a situation; hence 2 stars.Watch Rebecca to appreciate the difference between acting and hamming. If you really want to be scared, watch The Haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie, bad acting, bad ending......","review":"It was just bad people and in no way a classic-no wonder I never heard of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Uninvited","review":"I think this one of the scariest movies I've seen (in black and white or color). What the director did with sound and lighting almost made you feel the wind blowing, the temperature dropping, and the smell of perfume. One of my favorite scenes was when they are all in a room together and the pages on the medical ledger start turning and they all smell perfume. That was just fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This is one of the scarest movies I have ever seen. You WILL keep the lights on all night after seeing this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Average","review":"I loved the whole \\"ghost\\" story approach. Muffled crying in the night when no one is there. The mist. The cliff. The ghostly appearances. One would never guess until the end what is going on! The only problem I had was a 40 year old man pursuing a 20 year old girl. Call me old fashioned! But, you won't be dissappointed with this one. Although there are some \\"dead\\" scenes now and again (pardon the pun), all in all, a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite ghost story, really spooky.","review":"Ray Milland and Ruth Hussy give fantastic performances as the brother and sister who buy a sinister old house overlooking the sea.

First rate film, not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it years ago","review":"Ive got to say that even for its time this was creative. I well enjoyed watching this because of the setting. Ive always been one to prefer movies with more reliance on atmosphere and noises to keep you wondering, rather than just some guy running around cutting heads off..A very atmospheric movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie---A Perfect 5!","review":"In this chilling ghost movie, Ray Milland and his sister move into a spooky old mansion, where voices cry during the night, flowers wilt and die, and eerie figures can be seen roaming around. Then, Milland meets the beautiful Stella, whom he falls in love with. Stella used to live in the haunted mansion, where her mother died; and she and Milland slowly uncover the houses' dark, frightening secrets. Truely a remarkable film, this flick is one of the best in it's genre, along with The Haunting, The Innocents, and The Lady In White. You must see this brilliant film, whether you like scary movies or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good who-done-it with ghosts.","review":"This is a good who-done-it about an old murder, with the added thrill of a doubly haunted house. The acting is good, Gail Russell (Stella) is beautiful, and Ray Milland is suavely appealing. The attractive musical score by Victor Young features his beautiful hit melody \\"Stella by Starlight.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie, still scares!","review":"I had long been wanting to see this classic ghost story when it finally was released on DVD. It actually exceeded my expectations and was surprisingly scary, making perfect use of the techniques for special effects available at that time. If you like the other classics in this genre, The Haunting (1963) and The innocents (1961), this one should be right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD DVD DVD DVD DVD DVD!!! RELEASE IT NOW!!!","review":"This movie is so amazing. I first saw it as child and some parts scared the living crap out of me, but it was still good because it wasn't loaded with blood, gore, and sex. The quiet scenes are scariest and this is one of the first films to start the whole \\"Jump Scare\\" that is still used and reused in horror/thriller movies today.I agree with everyone else here that this movie NEEDS to be released on DVD! It's also a cruel joke that it isn't even out on VHS anymore. Everyone write to Paramount Pictures and annoy the heck out them to release this underrated classic on DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brrrrrrr","review":"The kind of ghost story we used to tell as kids out under a lone street lamp.

It's storyline is engaging and it moves pretty quickly. Excellent cast and genuinely creepy without cheap scares AND it's filmed in glorious black and white which yet adds another dimension to this great mystery/ghost story! A wonderful movie to curl up with on a rainy Saturday afternoon! I would rank this right up there with the original version of \\"The Haunting\\" and \\"The Innocents\\". My big question is since Amazon rates the VHS version as #268 on it's sales list when will they let the owners of the license know that we want it in on DVD!! That's it for today. I gotta go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Scary Ghost Story","review":"No explosions, no special effects....nothing modern about this film. Its just a good old-fashioned ghost story that will indeed give you goosebumps. I first saw this film as a young teen and it scared me so much that I could not get it out of my mind. I believe it to be in the top 10 of my favorite all-time movies.I was lucky to come across one VHS copy of this movie in a mall store one day about 15+ years ago and bought it right up and have watched it a dozen times or more since! I just love it. Don't look for sex scenes or any kind of nudity, don't look for bad language. Its all so very correct - an english style film...but you'll love it all the same. A beautiful, young Gail Russell steals this movie, and rightly so.I think the others have said enough about the story itself. I simply say watch it...and you'll be pleased you did and will probably watch it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but Outdated","review":"I liked this book but bought it not knowing it's from 1939.

Took it off and took it to a tire repair shop. They got it aired up but it only held for 3 days. Tried again and it only held for 2 days.

We were attracted to the film because of the fantastic cast, and they did act beautifully. However, this was a long drawn out story with a beginning and a middle, but no end. It was painfully slow, and with hindsight, we should have given up after the first long painful hour, but we persevered in the hope it would improve. None of the characters were likeable, and therefore it was difficult to care what happened to them.... and given that the scriptwriter couldn't be bothered to create an end for the film, I can only assume he felt similarly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead, please","review":"Waugh's Handful of Dust is a terrific and dark novel, with funny sharp dialogue. For reasons known best to the writers of this movie, precious little of this amazing dialogue appears in the film.

Well, if you are a professor and if you need list of questions to your students but, pardon me, do not have your own, its the book for you. If you are in the 99.99% other readers, maybe a practitioner in the industry, and would like to either learn, review or to find answers to real life problems, do not waste your money on this booklet. I got it a few years ago from a smaller online book seller, who misprinted the number of pages.

This band has heart and this documentary sets a new standard of artistry for music DVDs. I had seen the movie shortly after it was released and loved it and Disc 2 in this set is about as much a treasure as the film itself. You can buy these now for, what, $10? What are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aesthetically Pleasing","review":"This DVD will open your senses. Well, at least of sight and sound, though it will also invoke your sense of touch and smell, maybe even taste. The music is different from what one hears on the radio, that is for certain, but if one's mind is open, one will definitely feel the emotions of the compositions and improvised songs. The scenery is beautiful--it is all of different places in Iceland. And the talent of these people is outstanding. I purchased this DVD as a gift for my sister, who loves Sigur Ros, and she's completely enchanted by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Phenomenal!!!","review":"This DVD is absolutely amazing. The imagery is stunning and the music is beatiful and ethereal, extremely appropriate as you are watching the footage from concert feeds from widespread icelandic towns. Admittedly I was already a huge sugr ros fan beforehnad, but this is the most amazing documentary of a band that ever existed. I would recommend this as a gift to anyone, regardless of their musical preferences. The music is awe inspiring and the video footage is too amazing to not be seen by everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my wife","review":"loved this video. The music is beautiful - even if the words aren't in English and the scenery is outstanding. I especially liked the energy of the show in Rejkavik -The whole idea of touring Iceland and playing for free in a wide variety of venues - if you can call an open field or abandoned fish processing facility a venue, was charming and clearly illustrates the bands love and respect for their country.Don' miss this film !"},{"rating":"2","title":"brill movie CRAP BOX","review":"again this save the planet stuff taken to far.a card board box thats done to cut costs and save on useing plastic.what happens?box falls apart,nomatter how carfull you are,you end up haven 2 buy a plastic box 2 replace it anyway.same goes for all their cd realses too. forget the arty farty pictures and just give me normal case.brill movie 5 out 5,amazen dts sound.prob best iv heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Question","review":"I want to know if this dvd contains spanish subtitles...It is very important to me to buy it.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeland","review":"I was fortunate enough to see this film last night at the showing in San Francisco. I am a big fan of Sigur Rós, and Icelandic music in general, but I am always a bit weary of tour documentaries due to the fact that they tend to fall a little flat and don't fully capture the energy of the performances. But Heima, Sigur Rós' documentary of their free summer tour in Iceland, tells an actual story rather than just editing together songs from a concert. You learn much more about the band, their culture and their beliefs. This film will not disappoint you, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"I too saw a screening of this in Los Angeles on November 1st, 2007. The Sigur Ros 3-song acoustic set preceeding the screening incited in me emotions I haven't felt in a longtime. The footage of scenic Iceland coupled with the live music played by the band is awe inspiring. The film is simply beautiful, and if you are a fan of music, not just a fan of Sigur Ros, you need to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"heima, the dreamland of Sigur Ros","review":"when i listen to sigur ros' music i always dream of icelandic landscapes, montains, valleys, colours. when you play the movie is like watching your inner dreams.

The idea is to show the free and improvised concerts that sigur ros made in Iceland on 2006 tour. a splendid documentary on music and nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. Absolutely awesome","review":"Probably in the top three music DVDs I've ever seen. Absolutely incredible. If you're even a casual fan of Sigur Ros, this is a must buy.

The manual is nothing more than a couple of pieces of paper and is useless. The packaging is so poor and the product itself is not even labeled so that you can figure out what item on your order to return!! The product descriptions are so badly done that it is difficult to tell which products are compatible...as a result I ended up ordering two incompatible systems. I am returning on system and trying to get the other to work...or it will go back too. I was never able to get the system to anything but beep. Other reviews here sounded good but this product was nothing but frustration for me. The only saving grace is Amazons fantastic return policy.

A third had horrible sound.After searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products I finally settled on the 900 Megahertz Wireless Intercom from Radio Shack. (43-3102)Beautiful sound. Well made and about half the price of the Reporter. Pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet. So if you need more than 300 feet for range it's something to consider. Better warranty than the Reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year.Anyway I couldn't be happier with the RS intercom. I just can't recommend the Reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive disaster","review":"I replaced 4 Novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 Reporters. Attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter, I was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands. Unfortunately the quality of the Reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use. Failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units, no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit... all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions.

The front of the case features a sliding cutter, allowing you to neatly cut bags in a straight line. The blade is completely concealed, making it a very safe device children can use.One of the dissatisfied reviewers pointed out that the bag roll is not held inside the case, causing the material to shift as you slide the cutter and resulting in wavy cuts. True, but easy enough to fix: hold the bag while you're sliding the cutter, and you'll get a perfectly straight cut everytime. You don't even have to apply pressure to the cutter as you slide it from side to side, because of the blade's clever design.Highly recommended if you use your FoodSaver often."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe I'm stupid but...","review":"I'm finding it kind of difficult to get it started cutting, so the bag will get kind of wrinkly and not cut a very staight line"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good results","review":"Despite the fact that this product is very light and does not seem substantial, it works very well. You must get the technique right. You can cut in either direction and it cuts a straight line, which I can't do with just scissors. After trying it, I bought a second one so I would have one for each size bag roll and I bought two for my sister as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Straight Cuts, Just Another Gadget","review":"One of the biggest problems I have with the rolls of Foodsaver bags is trying to cut them straight. When they're crooked it's hard to line them up properly in the machine to make the first seal to create a bag. I got this to avoid that problem and it really does make nice straight cuts. It's a little awkward to use, or maybe I'm just not used to it, but the results are what I was looking for.On the other hand, it's one more gadget to deal with in the kitchen so unless I'm making several bags I find myself just grabbing the scissors and cutting off what I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"FoodSave Bag Storage and Cutter","review":"I have tried this product twice and had the same problem the cutter breaks after a very short time.

I do not yet have all of their albums, but it is in my future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect Pitch","review":"This disc is one of my favorites for the sheer intensity of the music more than anything else. The tunes are intricate and evolve intellectually throughout. The \\"Organ\\" Symphony gives the impression of attending a Command Performance at which the dignitary arrives about 30 fashionable minutes late. The organ and the orchestra were recorded in separate locations. So, once the organ arrives one gets the definite impression that the orchestra is deliberately pacing itself to allow the organ to keep up. This usually doesn't bother me because the organ is supposed to take center stage at this point anyway. The inclusion of Phaeton make a perfect companion piece. It almost feels like a 3rd movement to the \\"Organ\\" as it has similar hair-pin turn themes and is just as inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Work","review":"This is a beautiful work of art. I encourage anyone interested in pipe organ music to obtain this for their collection. The performances are excellent. Camille Saint-Saens compositions are always interesting and beautiful. The recording and production values on this CD are first rate.

But I will say I am disappointed with the sound quality. If this CD is remastered like it claims, it falls short of today's high tech remastering quality. Heck, I've heard remasters of some 1960s songs sound so crisp when remastered with today's high quality standards (such as Eric Records' fantastic \\"Hard to Find 45s on CD\\" series).

Actual parents describe in plain language what items you need and who's brands to buy and not buy. But they go further! They help you understand where you can save some money and still provide quality for your child; what items you don't need, where you can buy generic and which items to buy for quality rather than cost. They point you to the places to shop to find bargains, both in your neighborhood and on-line. All of this is written with a no-nonsense approach. There's no politics being played here; if the product is awful, they'll tell ya'! I came onto Amazon intending to buy the Consumer Reports guide to Baby Gear and chose this book instead.

But it does seem kind of creepy to have a 17 year old kid and a mid thirty year old man to have attraction. Of course I wouldn't have thought so much of it had Warren not taken such offense to it. There have been huge differences in ages in other novels that didn't bother me at all. I liked that Amy was aggressive...but when they kept mentioning her age...well then it transformed into childish antics. BUT like I said if you skip over the mentions of the age difference...I thought the book was excellent. I didn't even mind Warren's constantly bellowing having become aquainted with him in the Gentle Rogue novel. ALSO you must read Gentle Rogue and Tender Rebel first so that you catch up on their stories. This is a totally worth while read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has to skim...A LOT....","review":"This is basically a story about the h chasing the H the ENTIRE book. It wasn't until almost the last page that the H even consents to marrying the h and even then he acts as if he is doing her a favor. I just don't understand why readers would want these two together. The H constantly rejects the h in the cruelest words he can find the entire book and just because he begrudgingly asks her to marry her in the last page of the book that is suppose to be a HEA? For me, not so much. I found the h to be pathetically annoying for chasing a guy that constantly told her that he didn't want her and the H a whinny, indecisive character. For a romance novel there was little romance to between H and h."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsey's Best Book Ever!!!","review":"This book is my favorite. I read it about three times a year.

Also I can't wait till she comes out with Jeremy's and Jack's stories. Keep them coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER WINNER!!","review":"This is the fourth installment of the Mallory series. It is the story of Amy Mallory and Warren Anderson. Amy Mallory is another niece of the handsome Mallory brothers. She has set her sights on Warren Anderson, Georgina Mallory's brother. Warren, who was hurt in the past, has sworn to never love again. Well, he never met anyone like Amy. She's determined to have him and he's determined to avoid her. But no matter how much he tries, he can't resist her. They are fantastic together. I absolutely love the way James and Anthony try to provoke Warren who has a temper from hell, talk about explosive. But thanks to Amy, Warren learns to love again and calm the anger that boils within which really ticks James and Anthony off. They hate being ignored. This is a wonderful story filled with love, danger, inner conflict, and definitely laughter. You'll love it and the other Mallory novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stubborn Amy & Warren","review":"This 4th book in the Malory's series is perhaps the worst book in the series. Both characters (the hero and heroine) are stubborn and selfish. For me, Amy and Warren do not fit the criteria of becoming lovers in the book. The love between them looks forced and sometimes jerky. The book have lots of holes in its plot.I would not recommend it as a good buy. Consider it as a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I visitted Skipsville often","review":"A woman chasing a man to this extent is not romantic.It was like a foxhunt with her trying to run the fox to ground,at any moment I expected her to yell \\"tallyho!\\" It's ok to give Warren a nudge but this girl was outrageously ridiculously too forward to be believable.I finally got through it by skipping the more outrageous parts.Of course Warren was no dreamboat either.Unfeeling is the best I can come up with to describe him.To be fair to him though he tried to warn her about not setting her cap for him and constantly referred to her as little girl in order to discourage her.Alas she didn't take the hint.Halfway through the novel I still had no idea why she was chasing Warren.What qualities of his caused her to believe herself in love with him? I don't believe he fell in love with her either,he gave in so she'd stop chasing him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of the five Malory books, four were really good.","review":"Warren was not worth chasing! I did not think that the plot in this book was realistic. The rest of the Malorys had style. This, unfortunetly, did not. Johanna Lindsey will always be my favorite author and I love her series books. However I didn't feel The Magic Of You meet the standards of the Malorys before and after. It just didn't have that charming quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped for.","review":"After the other three Malory novels, this one was really disappointing! Amy had no redeeming qualities that would attract an older man like Warren except for her forward attitude towards sex, and even that would wear thin, I know it annoyed me. Never at any point did I see where Warren fell in love with Amy, it is usually easy to point out in these Lindsey books, but with this one it is pretty unbelievable. And yes, Warren was not the oldest brother, Clinton was, and I don't think this book had any scenes in the Carribean either! Check the synopsis, it needs correcting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so looking forward to this book, after I read James and George's book, but what a major let down this book was. First of all they kept expressing in the book the age difference between Amy and Warren which I was trying to over look but couldn't. Secondly Amy was pretty much what we would called in todays society a stalker. Third the hero and his attitude was over the top. The only saving grace for this book was the appearance of the other Malorys James, George and Tony."},{"rating":"2","title":"truely magical","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I have to say, and I don't know if it was just me, but I was laughing and giggling most of my way through this book, I found it thoroughly enjoyable! I am not going to describe the contents of the books, as has been done, but I will say when Amy tells Warren how she feels the first time, that did it for me. Open, honest, and straight forward, it was pure magic. I don't know how anyone with a good sense of humor could not like this book.To Ms. Lindsey, BRAVO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I couldn't believe what I was reading was from Johanna Lindsey, the other books about the Malory family is far more entertaining than this book, I couldn't even finished it.

So when she sets her sights on Warren Anderson, she vows he will be hers. But, this turns out to be almost more thatn even Amy could help. Because Warren was hurt in the past so badly, he trusts no woman, loves no woman, save his sister, Georgina. So, spirited Amy sets out to show Warren what true love can do to save the heart and soul. This is a sweet book, and one of my favorite Malory books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Magic Here","review":"I really enjoy reading Johanna Lindsey's books, especially the Malory series. When I picked up this book however, I quickly realized this is one of her weakest books. \\"The Magic of You\\" is the worst installment in the Malory series; even the bland \\"The Present\\" is better than \\"Magic.\\" Both Amy and Warren are such flat, one dimensional characters it was hard for me to connect to them in any way. The only reason I continued reading this book was because of the scenes that included James and Georgina from \\"Gentle Rogue.\\" I definitely do not recommend reading \\"The Magic of You\\" unless you are a diehard Malory fan and feel like you have to read all of the books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"hot uncle in law?","review":"Here's a blast from the past for me. I used to really love this series. My tastes have changed somewhat over the years so I haven't re-read this for quite some time, but, if nothing else, I think this may have been one of the forerunners in series about a family (both the men and women eventually having their story told.)As I recall, Warren was the James' wife Georgina's brother (whoa, getting complicated.) Actually he was one of multiple Anderson brothers, thus to branch off to their stories later. Warren was the warlike one who ends up with Amy, the gentle one. Overall, not as good or as memorable as earlier books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER WONDERFUL MALORY NOVEL","review":"Johanna Lindsey writes another wonderful book about the Malory's. I love how Amy is so determined to win Warren. This book is a must read when Amy's uncles, James and Anthony ( who can't love it when they get together?) try to interfer with her and Warren. Read it, you'll love it! But make sure you read the others first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically Endearing","review":"Johanna Lindsey has always been one of my favorite authors, and the Malory family has been my favorite fictional family. I don't believe The Magic of You is as great as the other books in the series, but it was real close. (In my humble opinion none of the other Malory books has been able to top Gentle Rogue, though they are all splendidly told). I was delighted that J.L. made Amy the predator. It's about time that a woman rakeishly persued the man she wanted. I loved how Amy was able to bring love and laughter back into Warren's empty shell. I loved every magical moment of this enchanting novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good -- Hard to Start -- Runs Poor","review":"I purchased this Edger Because of the TROY-BILT name.

I know it won't get as dough-like as wheat flour, but this was almost like cooked oatmeal, it was so runny. So we ended up doubling the amount of flour, therefore, 2:1 ratio to regular flour, and the scones came out (a) crumbly and (b) salty. I did add the regular amount of sugar to my recipe but it was apparently not enough to counteract the saltiness of the almonds. Each of us choked down one scone with a lot of milk, and five more were tossed in the back yard for the birds.We will next attempt to make oatmeal-raisin cookies with it, and if that's as bad a fail, then we will not even bother with this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced","review":"why pay $36 here when you can get the same thing directly at the Honeyville site for $28?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flour esp if you are doing the SCD diet!","review":"My daughter has to follow the SCD diet.

As others have mentioned, it lasts at least six months (probably longer) when stored sealed in a refrigerator or freezer. I bought the 5 lb bag on Amazon in July 2012 at the price $29.99. I was preparing to re-order in January 2013 and, to my annoyance and disbelief, the price for the SAME ITEM is $43.00 (plus S & H). That's a 26% increase. Went to Honeyville's site and it cost $36.48--(31.99 for flour, plus $4.49 flat rate s & h). So, what would have been a 5 star review for the product on Amazon, is now a 2 star review due to the exorbitant cost.

The text is necessarily brief, and this adds to it's accessibility and appeal. It is indispensable to any serious student of God's Word, because it contains so much information which other commentaries in recent generations have neglected and to which previous generation lacked access. It should rest opened next to your New Testament whenever the study of a passage begins.

Actually, it makes for 5% of the book \\"maimed\\", since it stops at page 192 e suddenly continues from page 225.

Or maybe a kindergarten teacher on tranquilizers. The actual music sounds more geared to 40-50 year olds to me than to young children.

I fear it's Maazel's fault and the recording engineers as Gutierrez is pretty much playing prominently as he should. But when the orchestra should be quiet it's playing at least at a mf. The lack of dynamics on the soft end cause this recording to be rated 4 instead of 5 stars in my opinion. This is still a worthwhile performance to have but I recommend the Volodos version instead.

Well, all of a sudden, the long spray button stopped spraying long sprays. It started to spray short ones. Ok I guess, because I never really used that button anyway. Then, the short spray button spray got A LOT shorter. The collar started losing its effectiveness. Now both sprays are super short. I am a little disappointed. I ended up just taking the collar off because it is pointless now. Wish that I would have know that it was going to crap out on me within the first month...I would have purchased something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This thing worked for a few weeks tops and then quit.

Effective, but found the battery in the receiver needs to be replaced after a few days. Then, the unit failed at about 4 months. Because it seemed to help training I bought a second unit. Like the first, the second one also failed at about four months. Neither unit was ever wet, dropped, or abused. Nice idea, but product quality is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable product","review":"I am now on the second device and it broke on me again. The remote control stopped working all of a sudden. I replaced the batteries and made sure that the unit was refilled properly.I dealt with the manufacturer directly rather than going through the vendor. Multivet which was based in Canada agreed to send me a new device after a long email correspondences. But before I received a new unit the company was bought by Petsafe and they dropped the ball. Petsafe was kind enough to believe me without proof and send me a new training unit. But after a week that broke too. Now I have to send back the unit at my cost and wait for another unit to arrive. God only knows how long the next one will last.This device is effective but I believe it is too fragile. Mine never got wet or suffered any rough abuse. It's not worth this high price, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spray Commander","review":"I bought this product on July 10th, and it arrived shortly there after. I have had nothing but trouble with Shopzone in trying to correct the problem. They sent me the spray commander and it has two different serial numbers, meaning that the two units cannot talk with each other. We bought this device as a training tool for our puppy. To this date 8/19 nothing has been done on shopones end. I sent back the two units, as directed, and have not heard from them despite 3 e-mails asking for an update to my problem. I am totally disgusted with the company and their lack of professonalism. Do not buy from them, save yourselves the anger and frustration that I'm feeling. I think that you will have better luck with other companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Quink is an exceptionally talented ensemble. With voices clear and defined, they breathe new life into the traditional songs of various cultures. In particular, the arrangements are wonderful--truly lovely music, and every piece is perfectly executed. I would not hesitate to recommend this CD to anyone, however I must make mention of the fact that the title of the CD is misleading--all of the songs, with the exception of one from Israel--are from Europe, and therefore the word \\"world\\" in the title is somewhat of a fallacy. If you like European folk songs, the sound of a small chamber group, and perfect singing, I have a feeling you'll quite love this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with \\"The Plege\\"","review":"The American version of this film is infinitely better. And not just because it has an all-star cast and a newly competent Sean Penn. He redeems himself for the reprehensible \\"Indian Runner\\" and \\"Crossing Guard.\\" No, while those are good and valid reasons to see the American film they are not the most compelling. The most compelling reasons to steer clear of this film are these: 1) It is the only film I've seen that contains a scene where two grown men play patty cake in their underwear. (No this is not a obscere euphemism it is literally what happens. 2) It is the only movie I've seen where a psychopath shaves his genitals on camera. 3. It doesn't have the same ending as the American film. (I currently have the novel on order from Amazon but I don't know how it ends.) If you liked the Pledge as much as I did you probably won't heed my warning, so the best piece of advice I can give you is this: it is available new from a few websites...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always love an update on Dr. LaBastille's life...","review":"JAGUAR TOTEM was a four star for me because nothing tops her WOODSWOMAN.

Without spoiling anything, let me just answer \\"no\\". That family is important. No, this family is pretty messed up. I don't know what it's about AT ALL.

In the dorm I hook up the AC adapter and there's a cool green backlight that lites up the unit and makes the track number and time cool to look at. I connect the Cd player to my Bose Acostimass speakers and either the speakers or CD player kicks butt because the sound just blows you away . The unit looks pretty cool, has a nice metallic silver finish. It's not super thin but the CD player's size is compact. I take it wherever I go to listen to my tunes. with 40 seconds anti-shock II, it doesnt skip at all. Overall, I would go for Panasonic.

Occasionally, the scan won't include the first inch or so of the glass until I unplug the scanner and plug it back in.I have books I've collected over the last 30 years, I'd like to scan before downsizing my home for retirement - this seems ideal - and is still the best solution, but the workmanship is shoddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad software, no support","review":"The software that accompanies this scanner (PrestoPageManager) is junk.

The singing is terrific, stylish and you can understand every word. Some of these performances are better than any others on record (the Pish Tush and possibly the Pooh Bah, although I hate to think anyone could outdo Kenneth Sanford in the role). But it is the conducting that drives this recording. The tempos are spirited, the transitions seemless. The orchestra plays superbly, with lots of little instrumental solos sounding better than I have ever heard (the bassoon run in Three Little Maids). This recording is great because of the brilliant conducting of Charles Mackerras. It is really too bad the funding dried up.

I'd say the hunting rifle is my personal favorite especially when zooming in and going for head shots it looks like something right out of the new Dawn of The Dead or Romero's Diary of The Dead.

And not expect much else from the game. There's no looting except for weapons and ammo and med stuff. Pretty much the same thing over and over, but the game is short.

We all love killing zombies & kill them you can.The problem & it is a huge one, is, there are only four small levels, few weapons, no upgrades and little objectives then kill zombies and receive pointless badge rewards. It is more like a game expansion then the real deal. The end result is many people will get bored fast playing this.This could have been so much more but somewhere the plot was left out! If it was sub $20 I would give it one more star.It requires steam (which I do not like as a concept) so you have to have internet to install and play. They will no doubt release extra levels on their Steam site & you will have to pay for each one, so some people will end up paying a huge about for what the game should have contained in its release. Avoid & spend your money on a more complete game."},{"rating":"2","title":"left 4 dead is aamzing","review":"Best game I have played in a long time. I would trade in all of my other games this year for this one; it is that good.The AI is incredible, the coop plays well. you have to work as a team and stick together.

DO NOT buy a used STEAM enabled game. You will be out of luck when the license needs to be validated. The advantage is that the game can be installed in multiple PC's with a single STEAM ID then played from any ONE PC without the original media. Left 4 Dead, for my taste, seems to be too repetitive for single player. I am not able to indulge in multi-player very much. For a single player the most fun Zombie game is \\"Stubbs The Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO IDEA","review":"Well, first off I read all the reviews and it sounds like a fun game so I decided to buy it. Now here's my problem and it could be partly my fault for not researching more. Because this game requires internet activation I simply can't play the game. I am currently stationed overseas and internet isn't the greatest. Had I know this from the start I would never had wasted my money. I was looking for a good shooter to blow off some steam and was left scratching my head wondering why I spent the money for this. Not even in the product description did I see any mention of internet being required. I realize you need it for multiplayer, but you can't play offline either...come on people.

I did know Valve Games required a CD Key just to play the game. And there is a Limit of one CD key per registration and this product was used.

But she does have time to help the bedraggled and broken man who walked into the diner late one night. Little does she know that this man is the superstar country singer, Ashton Raines. He introduces himself to her as Timothy.Ashton Raines doesn't know how to pull himself from the hole left in his heart when his wife died. He learns an important truth from this beautiful waitress at this tiny diner: he can't do it. But he's about to find out who can.From the first page to the last page I enjoyed Stallings' writing.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved Ashton Raines.","review":"The very best part of this story was Timothy Ashton Raines. Reading his healing from deep sorrow to falling in love was pure pleasure. However, I became a bit miffed with Beth in the second half of the story. Her insecurities, though understandable, were given a bit too much rein and dragged on a bit too long. In fact, I disliked her by the end of the story. I also had a minor problem with the \\"You never know what God might do\\" thoughts. In my beliefs, God is good all the time. He does not at any time bring sorrow upon us. I do feel some of the reviews of this book regarding the lack of references to God are unjust. Not every Christian Fiction story needs to tell the Savior's story. This book successfully showed two people just living their lives out for Christ as best as they knew how. A good story with a great male main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific way to spend some time","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I think Beth was a terrifically written charter!

The other reviews have provided plenty of info on the poor storyline so I won't even write about that mess.Talk about political correctness run amok. The filmmakers tried to do a Home Alone where no one got hurt and failed miserably. The whole point of these movies is to do a live action Roadrunner cartoon where people are blown up and keep coming back for more. With that gone, none of these movies is worth watching. If a part five is ever made, here's some advice: kill the Kevin storyline and blow things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A JOKE!!!","review":"I saw the 1997 movie and would give it 1 star, but this movie cannot go below 1 star.

Home Alone 4 is the worst Home Alone movie which 2 is close behind. Something that could of saved this movie is the acting. Yes they brought back Kevin but the orginal Kevin is to old; why not a new charcher like Alex Pruitt from Home Alone 3. Home Alone 1 & 3 are really great movies that you can enjoy. Why bring back the \\"McCallisters\\" when you change the adults too even Merv which the orignal (Daniel Stern) played changed. This movie just dosen't make sense why is Kevien younger in this movie.Home Alone 4 should have been made in 1999 and Alex D.

Yes folks here is the last one. You would think they would try to end on a good note, but no they went straight to video. Wow! From the most adorable loser making millions of dollars a movie that warmed all the hearts in the world, to scraping the bottom of the barrel for ANOTHER Kevin. This kid can't act and yet he grabbed this piece of dump. And he's not even alone there is a few servants and maids in the house. Watching this is suicide.

But this fourth in the series is a dud. They keep the same character names as the first two movies, but they are totally different actors playing the parts. They should have just made up new characters.Secondly, in this movie there is very little of the slapstick humor which made the first three so funny. In the first three, the boy set elaborate traps which the bad guys fell for. In this fourth movie, there are few traps set, and they are not original or that funny.One other disappointing aspect of this fourth movie - in this movie the family is being broken apart by divorce. Although the divorce is not final yet, the husband has already moved in with his girlfriend and is getting engaged. Not the best for family values!Overall, we were very disappointed with this movie, which provided few laughs. Stick with the first three if you want a movie to keep you laughing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfull","review":"This is simply awfull.

The fourth movie is more about broken families, inappropriate sexual undertones considering the wholesome quality of the first movies, and is just not funny.

Stick with the first three movies and you will have a great treat for your family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what we need...","review":"I loved the first two because they were classics (well, Home Alone was a classic, Home Alone 2 was very good though). Home Alone 3, I thought, sucked. It was unnecassary. Two movies was enough for the Home Alone franchise. As painfully bad as Home Alone 3 was, this is, in fact, almost FUNNY because it is so bad! I mean, who could replace Culkin as Kevin and Daniel Stern as Marv and so on. NO ONE! But I guess I was wrong. When will Fox stop making this series suffer?! I mean, it's like beating a dead horse.

Linz, who was forever immortalized in Jim Carrey's \\"Liar Liar\\".French Stewart of the critically-acclaimed TV series \\"3rd Rock from the Sun\\" and Missi Pyle, who stole the screen in this year's box-office hit \\"Bringing Down The House\\" alongside comedic geniuses Steve Martin and Queen Latifah star as the villians in this film.French Stewart plays Marv Merchants, the character played by Daniel Stern in the first two movies.Buy or rent this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE HORRILBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!","review":"From start to finish, this movie was a huge let down!!!!! It acted as if there was no change in the characters or situation and it REALLY took away from the movie. It was a dissapointment and is nothing like home alnoe 1, 2 or 3. A great example of how you cant take a good thing and keep reproducing it. There is hardly any pranks or anything and it is a very slow moving flick. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a negative 5.

The musicianship is absolutely topnotch.The production is strong, even and sensitive to the music and the vocals.She sings about love & life in a very simple and straightforward way.To me, this CD is very very good, and Jana's words and melodies carry the tunes very well.I would recommend this CD highly to anyone who is interested in a laid-back pop/jazz feeling or to anyone who appreciates very high-quality playing in that genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Smoke and Mirrors review at mxdwn.com","review":"check out a review of this record athttp://www.mxdwn.com/article.php?sid=228"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply bland...","review":"Many wonderful and creative rave reviews on this cd, however the music doesn't measure up to the reviews.

Maybe with time and maturity this artist might aspire to be a great piasist he just needs to spread his wings and try other tings, and maybe he won't sound so dull. Until then, skip this one. I give it two stars for effort, and there's no doubt that the man has talent, he's just hasn't found a creative way to present it to us in the cd forman as of yet.Bottom line: This cd should be retitled \\"SIMPLY BLAND.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Piano!","review":"We thought this cd would be good to have playing while entertaining our dinner guests.

After dinner when the music stopped, Mike my neighbor said : What happend to the music? I then hit replay and next thing I knew he got up with his wife for a dance ,to Besame Mucho.

I love songs like Lullaby Of Birdland and Midnight Sun, where in the hands of Dave McKenna would become classic versions, however here they are turned into easy listening wishy washy background music, if you like Kenny G, you'll love this, it's watered down lounge piano music at it's worst, but two stars for effort and song selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think this is a very thought thru album...","review":"This cd just isn't very good, it doesn't take a rocket scientest to figure that out. This cd is typical \\"elevator\\" music, or as I call it \\"department store background\\" music, for shopping, because this is the type of music you hear when shopping at department stores or grocery stores. Nothing at all specail here. Anyone who likes jazz will be insulted by his sickening rendition of \\"Lullaby Of Birdland\\" it doesn't swing, he's stiff sounding on the piano, and sounds incapable of doing anything spontanious.

For those of you who are you will find this cd to be delightful in a Giovanni Marradi sort of way.

Little did I know the old Troy-Bilt went out of business and was aquired by MTD products. Well ten days later I received my trimmer and the oil tube was broken. With fire season on the way I taped the tube in place and used it to clear the brush. I called MTD products and between being keep on hold on the phone and getting the run around I gave up trying to get the replacement part under warranty. I ordered a new tube on line for $15 including shipping. This string trimmer is the old Yard-Man trimmer with a different engine. Last but not least the product worked well it just wasn't of old Troy-Bilt quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts missing / broken","review":"I ordered this mower 2 months ago, and it finally arrived yesterday. The oil intake funnel was broken off at the top, and suspended into the engine. The metal oil dip stick was bent at the tip at an angle of about 45 degrees because of that. There was no oil bottle shipped with the mower, unlike advertized. Troy Bilt (MTD) warranty support declined any assistance with the missing/broken parts, and referred me to Briggs&Stratton's warranty information inside the engine booklet. The only phone number in that booklet refers to a pre-recorded message, there is no way to get a customer representative on the phone. If you plan to order this mower, be prepared to take a gamble on broken/missing parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"One classic, one new and critically acclaimed - the other 2 - just worth it for a giggle!

I found, however, that unless you're within range of the built-in IR illuminators that the light-amplification was somewhat minimal. If you can see it through the binoculars, odds are you can see it unaided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price to quality ratio! I love these binoculars","review":"I purchased this unit almost 9 months ago and use them multiple times a week. They are amazing. Comfortable to hold, battery lasts a long time (AA batteries) and easy to figure out. Some complaining of focus problems just need to learn that it takes a few tries to figure out how to work night vision binoculars, the far dials are for the distance focus you want the Bushnell to and each eye has a focus to make that clear. Once you figure it out, you will be rocking an amazing night view every time.Distance wise, about 100 yards of good view for animal spotting. Their eyes glow in the dark like you can't believe, truly awesome. I know I am sounding like an advert for these googles, but I really do like them. For less then 400 dollars this is a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay in San Diego","review":"Bought these thinking they would be good for nighttime boating. There were not.

The premise of the end of the world was enticing but the 'threesome' factor was over the top for me. I truly hate to be negative about any writer of lesbian fiction but this author has too much talent to waste it on detailing all the permutations of a triangle of lesbian sex.To be fair the summary stated the threesome factor but I bought it anyway hoping the 'end of the world' portion would prevail.Save your money and read Kim Baldwin's Hunter's Pursuit instead (or any Karin Kallmaker novel.)**Remember - if you want your favorite authors to keep writing for us they have to be able to earn a living doing it.

The top my hair looks pretty good, but I would not replace this straightener if it broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I have had the straightener about 5 months now, and use it about twice per week. I have not had any major problems with it, and am pleased the the results. To prevent snagging your hair, don't try to do too much hair at one time and go slowly. Even with these precautions, there are occasional hair catches. But in my opinion, this is very minor compared to the great benefits the product provides - smooth, straight hair. (Better results than I've ever been able to achieve with the hair dryer.) It's a great product for women with curly hair to be able to get smooth, elegant-looking hair without having to go to the salon."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to say NO TO ROGAIN.....","review":"I bought this straightener, and was happy that I could finally not have blow dry my hair straight every day...

I am happy to say that I've finally found something that works! I've had many different straighteners, and this one is by far the best. I have long curly hair, and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes. Much better than the hour I'm used to. Plus, the straightening lasts. My hair stays completely flat all day, instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener. You simply can't get better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I have had this straightener for about a year.

I knew there are hundreds of straightening irons out there and most of them don't really work. But this one is so much better than the other kinds of straigheners. It heats up really fast, and you can adjust the level of heat as you needed. My hair is always so hard to fix or straigten but it does such a wonderful job on straightening. I would suggest anyone who want a hair straightener with a reasonable price should try this. It's a very good price with an excellent quality. I'm not exaggerating and this is absolutely one of the best straightener which I would choose. You would have beautiful, smooth, straight hair in just a few minutes!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great the first time around","review":"Unlike all the other posters, I had this straightener for years. Loved it! I have very thick, wavey hair and it straightened it in no time. Didn't rip out my hair, I loved it. So, when it finally did break (the outside cracked) I decided to look it up online to see if I could find it. Ordered another one off of Amazon. The first one I got started smoking as soon as I turned it on and gave off a horrible smell. It also ripped my hair out because the plates stuck out from the housing. I emailed the company and they were great, sent me out a new one and told me to throw that one away. I now have another one and it also gives off a terrible smell. A real shame because I loved my original one..maybe I got lucky the first time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UNRELIABLE","review":"This straightener seemed to be working great at first .. but then it will just stop working one day. i've only have it for 2 months.

Not to mention the cord continually curls up so bad you have to yank it to get it to your head (or spend 5 minutes trying to uncurl the cord). I have bought it twice, and today it broke again. I have a feeling that Revlon will tell me that it's gone through \\"extreme wear\\" -- it should at least be able to handle everyday usage!

I noticed there are screws running up the sides so I decided to take a look to see what was going on inside. I figured what the heck, we're tossing it anyway, what could it hurt. When I opened it I found two thin wires that had snapped off from where they were soldered. It seems that the repeated opening and closing from the use of the straightener puts stress on these wires causing them to snap off over time. Obviously, it doesn't take much time to cause this judging from past reviews, a month or two. Like I said before, this is a design flaw and the manufacturer needs to evaluate this product and correct this problem. All I can say is buyer beware.

The next day, i wanted to try it but the same thing happened and then suddenly the light went off and it just wouldn't work anymore. It completely burned out. This is a horrible straightener. It also pulls your hair out. If you want a good straightener, I'm afraid you might have to pay a bit more, but it's worth it. The best kinds are Ceramic Tools or Hot Tools and i recommend a ceramic one because its a lot better for your hair. Whatever you do, don't get Conair or Revlon.

My hair is very curly and this straighter would get my hair pin straight and would keep it that way even in a club environment where it can get very hot. However, almost a year later and the one side of the straightener does not heat up like the other side does. I'm disappointed because i really liked this straightener until it decided to break on me.

When buying this product. We have went through 4 of these in the last year. If left on for a period of time like an hour, it starts to slowly(over a period of a few months) melt the outer plastic until its burnt and black becoming a fire hazard before you know it. The outer side becomes as hot as the inner straightener heating up the desk or carpet that it is sat on. I find myself making sure it is off before I leave the house. We even thought that buying two at a time would solve this problem but it just delayed it. Why would I have bought four you ask...well we thought the first was defective so we bought the second one that fell apart after about three months so I bought the third and forth.

Add this one to your collection now."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a dandy album!","review":"In this album, old and good songs seem to have been revived by Bobby's excellent vocals which touch a chord within us. when I listen to Frank.S.(such as \\"The Rat Pack\\"), it reminds me of old&good days of USA, but when I listen to this album, I feel something \\"today\\" on the gorgeous bigband jazz tunes, even though some of these songs use the same arrangement as Frank's original style's. When Bobby sings these masterpieces,these become Bobby's love songs,his vocal sounds like the picture of his heart there. So I feel the breath from all the songs. It lets this album be something contemporary ....... That's amazing! This album shows us he is a really superb vocalist.Good songs are succeeded like Bobby, like telling story.... What a dandy album he made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New breed of Male Vocalist","review":"Good production and selection of material.

I love it.More please Bobby Caldwell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bobby tried to give us the great performance, but ......","review":"This is the second Bobby Caldwell cd for me to purchase. I keep hearing glimpses of what i'm looking for, but it seems to me that something is still missing. Maybe it's the after burner that fails to kick in. I know one thing, I really like Bobby's voice. The man can sing up a storm.For this particular cd, the song selection was good. I think that perhaps were the short circut occured was in the arranging. Bobby used a lot of old arrangements with a few new ones sprinkled in. Some of the old historic arrangements I liked and others i could never warm up to. I guess to be blunt, I'm an arranging freak. I pay more attention to arrangements than most people. This is my opion makes a song or breaks it more than anything else.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay.....umm....this is beyond bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"yeah I agree with myself... mmm this is beyond bad, why settle for this when you can buy a cd by the real thing.

It cobbles together the offerings of many fine and varied artists, but the association implies that there is a \\"new thing\\" here - in the sense of the original bossa nova or tropicalia, which isn't the case. Rather being something new, it is an example of unassimilated influences. Some North American influences have been \\"eaten,\\" perhaps especially by artists connected with Bahia, but that's not really on the table here. Virginia Rodrigues career has been stalled from day one because she is essentially unable to use her great voice - she simply can't move her butt stylistically - thus, her inclusion here is a bit of unintentional irony. Brasil has a tremendously complex folk and pop musical reservoir and a sophisticated modern music industry - this stuff is definitely not the sharpest tooth of the cutting edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"I have been a long time fan of Brazilian music and own a huge collection of cd's from ballads to pulsating carnaval music. I agree with the reviewer who said this was garbage. This is NOT Brazilian music. It is repetitive, electronic \\"sound\\" that can become annoying and very boring. It does not do justice to the mastery of the Brazilian musicians most of us admire. If you are searching for a better representation of Brazilian music I would recommend the cd \\"Chill Brazil\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I own over 100 Brazilian CDs and this is simply the worst of the lot. I should have known when I saw Bebel Gilberto included. This is simply a collection of Brazilian musicians who are ashamed to be Brazilian and have to incorporate this electronic garbage from North AMerica into their music. If you are new to Brazilian music, don't even consider this CD. Look for a collection of samba, axé, forró or something truly Brazilian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real disappointed, passed on item","review":"I am looking to buy a MP3-CD capable boombox with good sound.

I have learnedthat I rarely put in more than one CD, so multi-changers are unneededcomplexity as far as I'm concerned. The first thing I noticed is that when you open the CD tray, it completely blocks your view of every button! What idiot thought that up? The second thing was the incredibly gaudy display. I like having the artist & title displayed, but I HATE the insanely bright moving displays. I wish the Japanese would figure out that grownups buy this stuff, not just preteens. The unit sounded great, but after I looked at the manual and realized you can't turn off the frequency/volume graphical displays, leaving the artist/title info, I had to pass on the item.

From the photo, description and price I was expecting at least a moderate-quality bag.The leather was extremely thin and looked and felt more like faux-leather, but that aside, the craftsmanship of the bag is what really made me return it. The fabric lining was smaller than the outer leather, causing the leather to pucker and fold in a way that looked terrible. I tried to see if putting things in the bag would fill it out and make it look better, but that didn't work. Too bad, because the yellow color was actually nice.Even for $20, this bag would be completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leather Loses Its Shine","review":"I purchased this bag in black in the spring. I have used it quite a bit, but definitely not everyday. By the end of the summer, the leather at the top of the back started looking old and worn. Much of the leather lost its shine. It is definitely not worth the money. I am already looking for a new bag to replace it and it has only been about 4 months.

Its full of nice photos. However, there is far too much curse words, and attention on his sexual life, thus making the book into a 500+ page tabloid! Sinatra is a man of music, but lets not forget he was a brilliant actor as well. The book hardly focuses on that aspect of his career (the films) Instead, the author devotes much of his energy focusing into Franks love life, which I don't think should be looked too deeply. Why, because you or anybody else (including the author) would want his/her love life on the spotlight. The book would have been alot better if the author devoted his energy on taking out the sleezy jazz, and concentrate more on his films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really comfortable","review":"No matter what other manufacturers offer, this is the best, most durable and comfortable runners' choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only socks i'll wear","review":"Bar none these socks are all i will wear.

It was difficult to get the battery in, and required a small flathead screwdriver to pry it back out (the screw is a phillips, so you need to take an extra flathead with you). Not what I would call \\"a snap\\".The original nintendo battery goes in and comes out of the battery compartment easily.#2 - The packaging claims \\"up to 3 hours extra play time\\".

But, hey, it was about Mechs, and it was getting better, so we tolerated it.Sure, there were some rough points (Far Country, anyone?), but both the concept and the writing improved. And life was good.Then WizKids got their hands on it, and everything is dumb again. Does Stackpole really expect us to believe that whole planet could be conquered by terrorists in a single city? Or the planetary militia could be overcome by only a handful of Mechs? Or that two more would turn the tide of battle?The main character just annoyed me. He was so macho, and so tough, and so perfect. If he was any more two dimensional he'd rupture a singularity in the space time continuum. Maybe it was meant to be youth fiction.Read David R.

One jump in the air, and they flew off my ears, onto the the floor. The sound would be good except for the fact that the leak so much sound that everyone within about a 15 foot radius of me can immediatly identify what song i am listening too.

They are comfortable and easy to put on and feel like you're not wearing them. That's about all that's good about them; the sound is very poor - it cannot support a large amount of bass. At high volumes the sound is intrusive and scratchy. Also, they extrude far out on your head, so you don't really want to wear them in public.

And by the way, the bass wasn't so good to begin with. For headphones supposedly \\"designed for the house and trance fan,\\" these are a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent product - if it fits your ears right","review":"PROS:* Powerful bass, and crisp treble* Cool, stylish design* Price ($20.99)* Sony qualityCONS:* Fits the ears loosely; tends to fall off easily* Most of the bass is lost because of the mediocre fit* Everyone in the room can hear your music* Clip tends to deform over timeOverall, I don't recommend this type of headphones.

And the little turning rivets in the brackets keep it from ever slipping out in use. The little rivets rotate down and LOCCk the pentagram shaped end in place.HOWEVER... how many people have ever had the problem of a chin-up bar slipping UP and off the brackets while in use? I think this is a feature put in more for liability purposes than any real-world need.The upshot is, you have to wrestle with the thing EVERY single time you take it down. Since I have it up in a regular doorway we need to use, this is a serious drawback. The mechanism is very effective -- meaning it just fights you every time you want to take it down. It's not a lot of fun and frankly not something you would want to wrestle with every day.

For what it is, a door jam mounted pull up bar (versus other bars that hang from your door trim), its the best I've seen. Its very thick steel tubing, unlike what other reviews have stated, it comes with quality neoprene grips with velcro for easy moving or replacing. Though the mounting can be a bit effort full (5 screws per mounting bracket), it those 5 screws that make this bar as strong and quality as it is. Other bars including the perfect pull up ($100 bar) use only 2-3 screws per bracket. The screws included are very high quality screws. The bar can fit a very very wide or very slim door way.I give this bar a 5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"This bar and all the parts that come with are all really solid. This thing is awesome...if your having any doubts about purchasing this..don't. Unless you live in a home that bars you from putting anything like this up in your home, or you weigh over 400 lbs, you have nothing to worry about. The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars, is the fact that when you have the bar installed into those slots you screw in, it can be hard to get out if you want to place it somewhere else. Otherwise...great product. I highly recommend it if your trying to get into shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what you'd expect it to.","review":"The product is perfect considering its price (24.99 at the time I bought it.)

But after a bit of jiggling I managed to get it secured. Neoprene handgrips are adjustable and reduce stress on hands significantly. My only recommendation is to be prepared with a drill to make holes in your doorway to install this sucker, but aside from that I'm completely satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of equipment, but overpriced.","review":"I bought this bar a few weeks ago and it works great for my needs.However, last week, I found the exact same bar, hardware, manual, etc for sale at my local Walmart, but being sold in a \\"Gold's Gym\\" branded box, instead of Altus. This bar was being sold for $13, instead of the $24.99 I paid on Amazon.

Like the Tintner recording of the 9th on Naxos, Lopez-Cobos can barely handle this massive score and neither can the Cincinati Symphony Orchestra. The 2nd movement \\"Scherzo\\" is played at too slow of a pace. The handling of the tempi ruins the whole performance for me. Pathetic actually, especially compared with Gunter Wand's Colonge Radio Symphony/RCA and Berlin Philharmonic/RCA readings, Giulini's Vienna Philharmonic reading, and Chailly's Royal Concertgebouw reading.There are much better recordings than this sad excuse for a recording.

Perhaps it was because he wrote for television. This book changed that notion. James Person goes behind the scenes and gives a compelling interpretation of all of Hamner's writings, how his work evolved, and how he was able to adapt artistic ideas to highly successful prime time television--from the Twilight Zone to the Walton's to Falcon Crest.

Were Homer alive today hew would no doubt be plotting out the next Buffy the Vampire Slayer storyboard as we speak.

He manages both to be faithful to the original rhythm and feel of the poet and also inject modernity into a work which changes meaning for us paralell to the changes in our own history.

In fact, one of the pleasures of A Maiden's Grave was the deluge of surprises and the insights into the workings of hostage situations. In the DVD, virtually everything about the story changed, including the title. The situations and character descriptions that made the book a fascinating page-turner were missing. The actors seemed to have little interest in making this a stimulating story (screenplay or direction challenged, perhaps? These are excellent actors).

Instructions were painfully repetitious (12 repeats of slow technique, then a bunch more a little faster, then a bunch more a little faster, then finally regular pace). A good exercise DVD will spend only a few moments with each new movement and then move to regular pace. The bulk of this DVD is slow, instructional repetition of standard moves. There is no need for such extensive instructions, as the techniques are easy to follow. So, actually losing weight (as the DVD title suggests) is highly improbable.

If you want to get excited about something just listen to the amazing opening of this Italian symphony. It has an energy and presence like a bullet train. Levi conducts Mendelssohn's Italian with verve and clear understanding. I am not so sure that he hits the same mark with the excerpts from A Midsummer Night's Dream. This music has delightful tempi, great sonic presence and balanced orchestral playing but seems lacking in the dramatic department. They are not exactly rigid but they are by no means the delightfully elastic show pieces Mendelssohn intended them to be.

No poems at all are included by such modern masters as e.e.cummings, Allen Ginsberg, John Crowe Ransom, or Theodore Roethke.

In addition, they act as an excellent FM antenna for my Sony SRF-M37W AM/FM/Weatherband pocket radio. The extra ~1/2 m length of cable makes a very big reception difference on FM stations in comparison to the original Sony quality earphones that came with the SRF-M37W.

It's also light and the clip does not hurt my ear after long periods. The problem with them is that it takes a bit longer to put it on because you have to make sure the clip is securely fasten behind your ear or it will come off.

They are bit thick but I can deal with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Years an still loving these headphones !!","review":"Let me restate the title...5 YEARS and still loving these headphones!! Talk about durability. It would have been 7 years but the first pair was lost. The sound quality is Great! Nothing more to say about that. Did I mention I use these headphones everyday at work and on the train."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE these","review":"I'm buying these to replace mine of the same model. I've had them for probably 6 or 7 years and they've finally started to give out. That's eons for a pair of >$20 headphones. The sound's been great - it's not going to compare to high end products, but it's the best I've found for the price range. I've worn them for hours at a time without any discomfort and fallen asleep with them on several times without breaking them or hurting myself. They're really awesome headphones and I loved them so much that I'm buying them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headphones for the price","review":"I'm a long-time Sony consumer and fan, so I'm a bit biased, but it's because, for the most part, they make quality, durable products that last and sound great. These headphones are no exception. Considering the price, I wasn't expecting much in sound, but they are very clear, balanced and precise and they're a great alternative to ear buds for people who like to listen to music on the go or when exercising. I'm told the sound can bleed out a bit, but that would be my only complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diffucult to put on and uncomfortable","review":"Most of the reviews stated that these clip on headphones were comfortable and had great sound. They may have had good sound, however they were difficult to put on and were uncomfortable when you finally got them situated. I would not recommend these ear clips."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],C={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-57efc5e0"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/20.md","filePath":"guide/20.md"}'),j={name:"guide/20.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
