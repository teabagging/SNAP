Too many random images of random image glitches/sparks when using this HDMI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for the Money","review":"I got this HDMI cable to connect my Mac laptops to TV (separate adapted required). HDMI cables have become a de-facto standard for high-definition video and audio, replacing a whole host of cables with one simple interface. One other great advantage of using HDMI cables is that they are highly tolerant of different material quality standards. In other words, you don't need to get a \\"high end\\" HDMI cable in order to get a perfect picture. This cable worked just fine right out of the box, and the image quality was as good as the TV allowed. It's a relatively short cable, so you couldn't use it to stream content from one room to another. However, for local setups it provides you with more than adequate length.Overall, this cable works exactly as advertised, and it's a great value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente.","review":"El proveedor cumpli�� con las expectativas, llego a tiempo el envi��. gracias.

I tested this by pausing a picture on the Blu-ray disc of the movie \\"Cars\\" and switched between the two cables. WOW. The cheaps ones showed more pixelation around the edges of characters and the colors were NOT as vibrant. I then tried the Monster 1000HD cable and immediately was taken back by how much better the picture was. The same goes for HD Cable channels.I then tested video games on my Sony PS3.

Tried again with the second cable, same results - doesn't work.Since the price is inexpensive for these cables, I knew I was taking a chance on inferior quality products, and the results validated that assumption.

The good thing is, you do not need gold plated connectors for lossless transmission. If damaged it wont transfer data at all, so you can not get blurry/ hazy or unclear picture due to an HDMI cable.Now about this cable: It is affordable and it works. If you want to constantly plug and unplug this from say your laptop you may notice that plastic and connectors feels cheap, but does its job well.

This inexpensive cable is much thinner than the $30 one I bought so can't be of the same quality.

It doesn't happen very often but I noticed it right away. When I first tried the monster cables no popping or switchover sound, I then tried these and another brand of cheaper cables and the sound is there.

It's a shame that most people aren't getting the most of their HDTVs because no retailer will carry an HDMI cable without 650% markup. I have a purchased two of these to connect my amfm receiver, DVD player and tv. Everything works perfectly.

I have since borrowed an HDMI cable from Acoustic Research from a friend and it's had no problems, so today I just bought the Acoustic Research HDMI cable used from Amazon.Oh, and another problem, once the cable was hooked up, if I moved the cable, the signal would \\"break\\" and both audio and video would completely cut out-maybe I had a defective cable, and maybe I went TOO cheap with this vendor, but I had a lot of problems with this cable from this vendor.To conclude-this cable DID work, but just not 100% of the time and \\"rebooting\\" my XBR6 is not acceptable.

The cable is not as thick, which makes me question whether or not it is highly shielded(I cannot really judge since I literally have no other cables around it) and also it's durability over the long haul especially if I move my PS3 around for LAN parties, etc. But for the price I could care less cause it works, although if you are crazy serious about your A/V equipment, I would scrutinize the item before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described","review":"HDMI cables work perfectly fine.

After changing to another HDMI cable, the flicker problem went away.The cable does look like it has quality construction and has HDMI 1.3 printed on the cable wall. But don't be fooled by the looks which can be deceiving. From what I experienced, the internal construction of the cable may not be up-to-par, leading to the flicker problem.It did not work for me so it's a total waste of money.

I love the HD picture using component cables but don't care for all of the wires so I thought I would get rid of all of the cables plus get a better picture too. Didn't happen. Could it be the TV? (both HDMI plugs), the DVD player and the satellite receiver? or maybe the cables? All 3 work great on component cables. My limited experience shows me that cheap cables don't work well and the expensive ones cost too much to make HDMI a viable option at this time.

I set up my laptop to my monitor and I got a terrible flickering and distortion. Okay, I thought, it's probably my new monitor. So I hooked up my laptop to my Vizio TV and lo and behold it said 'not supported'. I had ordered two cables and both gave me this issue. Thinking my computer may have fried I tried ANOTHER HDMI cable I had ordered through monoprice and ZING, it worked on both devices.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Get What You Pay For!","review":"These cables are low priced for a reason: they do not work on most applications! They are \\"improper format\\" for PS3, XBox, HD DVD, Blu-Ray, and most other High Definition applications. They will work fine in low-grade DVD to flat screen applications and they actually prove valuable when you want the convenience of a single-cable setup in a basic setup, but you're better off spending more money on better cables for more serious home theaters. They are compatible w/ DirecTV digital DVR to TV setups if this is what you're looking for. I can't speak for cable, U-Verse or Dish Network. Overall, I'm sorry I bought these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality Cable","review":"I recently bought this cable because of the price but it is one of those \\"you get what you paid for\\" kind of things.

I asked a friend if he could help me fixed it, all he did was to replace the cable with a higher quality one to fix the problem. avoid this cable at all cost and pay the 10 - 15 dollars for a higher quality one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality but ruins Wifi","review":"This works great if you do not plan on using it with the internet. My whole purpose of owning this cable was to watch streaming tv and movies from my laptop on my flat screen tv.

It's actually much more robust construction than I expected. It even came with sturdy plastic protective caps on the connectors.I could have paid 6 to 10 times as much at a retail store for the same thing.

Cable is nice quality and I don't expect it to break anytime soon. Only thing that bothers me a little bit is after hooking up to the back of my TV (51\\" samsung) it only makes it about 3 ft away from my TV and I'm using it hooked to my laptop so I need a cable quite a bit longer, but hey i suppose that isn't the cables fault, only my own for not realizing I need one at least 15 ft long.

I later confirmed they were damaged since I ran to Walmart and spent over [..]for just two cables. I was warned that Best Buy charges even more for these.Customer service person was actually helpful and remarked that the cables are made in batches therefore a few could be damaged all at once. They gave me a refund with no hassle.I opted not to exchange and just bought locally since I was leery of quality and didn't want to wait another week for shipping.Honestly I ended up paying a lot more elsewhere.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed when the signal to my TV would cut out randomly for 10 seconds at a time. This makes the movie/gaming experience something to be desired when you are missing dialogue or a good action scene. I tried troubleshooting the problem by changing the cable to a different HDMI port, but still no dice. Switching the cables out was the only thing that worked.

Unlike cables used for analog audio and video where poor quality can affect the quality of the signal, digital signals either make it through the cable or they don't. In the case of the DVI Gear HDMI cable I bought for less than $3 (including shipping!) it worked, so it is as good as any other cable for a fixed installation. I use the term \\"fixed\\" because there is an argument for spending more money on a higher quality cable if it is used for portable equipment that is going to be connected, disconnected, and wrapped up many times. In my case however, this cable meets my needs while saving me lots of dollars that would otherwise be wasted on a name-brand (do I hear Monster) cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 3 weeks","review":"From all the positive reviews, I thought I was getting a nice product.

After countless hours troubleshooting, I finally realized the issue was with the shielding on the HDMI cable. I thought the Apple TV was maybe a little more finicky with the content protection (DRM) and all, so I swapped it out with a HDMI cable connecting my DirecTV box. Lo and behold, my Apple TV worked flawlessly again. I'll be getting one from monoprice next, as I've had good experience with it.

This was so cheap that I decided to give it a shot, and I can tell you that this is an awesome deal. The picture quality is excellent and the cable is thick and sturdy.

The image of the HDMI cable in this review has lower quality (you can see green dots in the screen for no reason for example) and the speed of sending the image is slower (for example, I switch from word to excel and it lags).My other HDMI cable (which I don't know the brand) has perfect image quality and doesn't lag at all.

As for 1080p, its better to buy a more expensive cable like Monster to get high picture quality. I have a monster cable for my blu-ray player and tried out this HDMI cable to see if there was a difference and there was. The picture quality was a bit grainy and was not as sharp.

At first I thought it was the recording but I soon discovered that it was this cable. I switched cables to one of the Phillips brand cables and it cleared the picture.

Went to Walmart and bought their cheapest cable, which wasn't cheap ($27). It worked perfect on both TVs in 1080p. I wouldn't get anything out of returning the cable since all the price is in the shipping. This cable must work for some applications, as some have claimed it to work.

I actually had read in other reviews that this cable was a Category 1, but I figured since 1080i was the most I was going to be using it for, that it wouldn't be a problem. WRONG! Like several other reviewers, I too experienced an annoying flicker of the picture. It wasn't a constant problem, but it was just often enough to annoy me. I tried everything from jiggling cables to trying the other 3 HDMI ports on the tv. Nothing worked.I ordered theMediabridge - 6ft Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Rayfor less than $10, and the annoying flicker magically disappeared. There is absolutely no reason you need to pay $50 or $100 on some overpriced cable, but you should definitely make sure the cable you get is a Category 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"great price...save $$$ buy this cable","review":"Living in Europe, I had to bite the bullet and buy an overpriced (approx $50) HDMI cable from the store that sold me my TV. I ordered this HDMI cable from Amazon and picked it up on a recent trip back to the US.

Good fit and the standard 6ft length was all I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, it delievers GREAT results.","review":"Apparently, according to my science teacher, the difference between prices is the quality of the conducting metal inside the cord, which lets it last longer. However, for at least a month, $1 is amazing quality compared to $60 - $250. It plays accurately, little/no lag at all, great sound/picture quality & has perfect length. Even if it does die, another $1 is alot more affordable. Anyone would be stupid not to grab a couple of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I figured these were cheap enough to give them a shot, but it turns out they are not worth the money. I bought 4 to connect my laptop to my tv and 2 of them don't work at all and the other 2 work but have horrible quality.

The ones they sell in big box stores are marked up by as much as 1000% for the exact same end result. The signal is digital so as long as the signal makes it to the device you are all set.

Great product!!!10+yr Engineer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Very happy with this purchase. At the time, the cable were 17 and 21 cents.

Tested them all with my PS3 and 32\\" 1080p LG TV.I do not believe in buying high quality cables because from first hand experience, it does not make one lick of a difference.

The shipping might cost more than the HDMI cable itself. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cable","review":"I use this to plug into my laptop and watch movies.

There seems to be a correlation between the temperature of my house and the connection in the cable (my house gets really cold where the TV is, near a window and on an exterior wall).So if you're in SoCal or Florida or Texas or somewhere that doesn't go below 50, buy the cables!

This book has no illustrations of the techniques described; all it has are verbal descriptions of how to form the stitches, etc., and for a craft book, that's an inexcusable oversight. It is very difficult to explain handwork with words, and the author's descriptions are completely insufficient to the task.2. The author has failed to consider her target audience. Though the book is supposedly for beginner to expert levels, the author skips over many explanations needed to make these techniques clear for less experienced stitchers.3. When describing each stitch, the author refers the reader to the photographs of finished pieces--unfortunately the photos are of such poor quality that it's difficult to see any detail, and as the projects have no keys to help you tell which section or line is which, it's often difficult to tell which part of the project the text refers to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This is a great book for any NASCAR fan.

The main male character suffers the same horrific attack as one of the Outlander characters, they both share a first name and they both survive. And they both use the British Isles Fairy Stones or Druid Stone formations as their centerpiece and build the plot around them. This book, however, set in the 1200's, seems likely written by a child. The author make reference to plaster on a stone cabin's interior walls, the smell of mown grass and King Arthur as someone's father, even though he would have to be about 600 years old to have accomplished that feat. It's a light fluffy beach read at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it....","review":"I hate to go against the grain in a forum of so many positive reviews...But I tried to read \\"Wild\\" and just couldn't get into it. I guess I'm not a big fan of books with 'psychic healers.' This has been done to death in historical romance, and is an instant 'hook' writers use to make the heroine sympathetic. Wild is no exception. I liked the idea that the heroine was a recluse. But the heroine constantly referring to the hero as \\"English\\" wore on my nerves.Worse still, the hero Roger was your typical drunken womanizer. <Yawn.> Unfortunately I couldn't muster much interest in finishing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"All romances should be this good!","review":"I have never read a book by Jill Barnett that did not end up on my keeper self -- WILD was no exception.

Although not based on a fairy tale, WILD has a beautiful, very romantic, fairy-tale feel to it. The heroine, shunned by the town because they fear she's a witch, lives in a tiny isolated shack and spends her time caring for wounded beasts. When she stumbles across an injured man (who turns out to be a knight), she can't help but drag him back to her home to heal him. Her honesty, gentle ways and lifestyle change him forever and make him look at life differently. This story has some very funny moments as these two very different people get to know each other, but it's also one of the most tender and loving romances I've read in a while and I thought it was extremely sensual. Their love is apparent in every word, touch, look and action they share and there are lots of moments to \\"sigh\\" over.

If you have any knowledge at all of history, this will be a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and Comprehensive","review":"There is not that much footage available from WWI, and this 6 hour+ UK produced set contains an extraordinary amount of it, along with great insights about what led up to the war-to-end-all-wars. Most importantly, it deals with these factors prior to U.S. involvement, and so the perspective is something different than a U.S. made doc would present.Year-by-year, the program looks at the developing technology that led to changes in how the war was fought. It additionally contains three chapters that address the military machines on LAND, in AIR and at SEA.I had chance to see this program in final production. It's truly well assembled and greatly informative. Nothing on the market rivals it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This has to be one of the worst documentaries ever written and edited. I say edited and not filmed because the original film footage used is excellent. It's biggest problem is it fast gets caught up in the horrors of the war and spends very little time on the history of the war. You almost get the feeling the producers and writers set about to do an anti war documentary and decided to use WW1 as a vehicle.With all of the great WW1 documentaries out there don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I buy quite a few books and CDs and DVDs each year, but this is the first time that I have felt impelled to write a review. Anyone who has seen the excellent series on the Civil War by Ken Burns can't help but gag at this boring work on the First World War. It is nothing but a chronological presentation of the battles, with the same film clips used over and over and over. After seeing the same film clip used for the 6th or 7th time I got pretty tired and even irritated, and had to turn it off from pure boredom. There are countless excellent photographs from that war. Why were they not used rather than re-using the same film clips a dozen times? One wonders what kept the makers of this documentary from using other sources (letters from the soldiers for example) rather than droning on about the rudimentary information on the battles? I am sorry I paid money for these DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"As a history teacher, I've collected several historical DVDs to use in the classroom as instructional aids.

Keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great War: not a great DVD","review":"I was very disappointed with this series. There maybe heaps of footage, but we see it all again and again and again throughout. The images are often inappropriate to the action being described, and the sound mixing of audio commentary and background battlefield noise is often completely out of balance, making the commentary inaudible. Some interesting scenes, but the constant repetition diminishes their impact. I almost sent my boxed set back, I think you could do much better elsewhere. I should have trusted the other reviewers, can't say I wasn't warned! You have been too."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY REALLY bad","review":"This collection of 6 DVDs is essentially about 1 hour of WW1 footage (repeated throughout the 6 DVDs) + some canned sound of machine gun and artillery fire + uninteristing and uninformative narration + really annoying and loud background score (at times much louder than the narration itself!)This is a brilliant example of bad sound editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Treatment of the Great War","review":"The Great War, The Complete History of World War I, a three-DVD set by Koch Entertainment, is a poor production on the Great War compared to The First World War - The Complete Series (a Major Channel Four series). The main upside is some interesting footage mainly about the Western front. The main downsides of this series lie in the disorganized narration, a lack of context, minimalist maps, and a deeply annoying and repetitive (machine) gun noise effect. To summarize, this series will be at best of interest to viewers who have an advanced knowledge of the main events of WWI to help them better appreciate what Koch Entertainment was trying to accomplish in putting this DVD set together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Waste of Time","review":"I had high hopes ordering The Great War, too bad it's a Great Waste of Time enduring it.

COULD NOT STAND STOCK FOOTAGE RERUN RERUN AD NASEUM which had not relationship to narration.

It was super tight to try and fit 3 tapes, the power cord, and AV cables all in with the camcorder. It worked, but if I was to do it again I would buy a bit bigger bag. I would rather it be a little too big than too small. Next time I will scope them out at the store before ordering on Amazon. But that was my bad.

You can choose mode of carry: handle, shoulder strap (included), or the belt strap. This does not have a waist strap- just the strap that fits over your belt. This thoughtful detail closes with velcro for simple on/off. You also get side pockets for fast access to small items you may need right away-batteries, tapes, etc. The bag is durable and made by a well-known company.Cons: Somehow, the texture of this bag just attracts dust. Fortunately it is easily removed with a dry cloth, followed by a moist one after the bulk of dust is removed. And of course since the bag is black, the dust shows up quite well, too. Might want to store it in a plastic bag if you're not using it every single day. Also, this bag is small. It's fine for anyone who just has a camcorder, extra tape, a battery and maybe a charger.

You will not have room for the manual. The only way I made everything fit was to store the USB cable at one end pocket, the DC power cord in the other end pocket and camera and charger w/AC cord together in the main compartment. This created a very tight fit and every time I wanted to get the camera from the bag I had to remove the charger first which is good way of leaving something like that behind in a busy or crowded room.The bag is made fine and seems very durable.

If you had other things like a car charger, spare batteries, firewire cable, you would need another bag for that stuff. As it is, just carrying the charger and a few tapes in it, the pockets bulge and the velcro seems to hold only precariously.I am keeping it only because it is inexpensive and it does the important thing, it keeps my camera in a safe place.

The show featured them together and separately. If you haven't seen it, then by all means find somebody who has a copy. Back to the album. Chet dazzles on the opener Cascade in which he seemingly makes the guitar laugh and run circles around you. Amazing. The next number, West Memphis Serenade, a haunting, yet beautiful melody, will seduce you. Long Long Ago, features Lenny Breau, and he and Chet make a formidable duo.

That was on December 13 and today is December 23 and still no response, even after 3 other emails from me. This company is very, very poor in customer service as well and misleading in their ads.

The arms can technically fit a large variety of sinks, but the longer you extend them the less stable your cutting surface.Also, the bamboo surface will scratch heavily if you use reasonably sharp knives.

The swivel monitor is very useful. The images taken by this camera are also real good. The balance of flash is extremely good eventhough it seems to be a bit of reddish saturation. 3D , filters , and panorama are fun to use. I used the rechargeable NIMH (AA , 2000 mAh) with no problem.All in all , I love this one and carry it with me whenever possible. The only complaint I may have is that it lacks of date imprint mode.

I prefer being given the tools, the goal and the obstacles.. I would then work my way to success, not that a few hints or examples will not be an inspiration..An important issue to address is that digital recording, editing and sound manipulation are now available to the masses.. The young today are very much in a hurry and often get trapped between little knowledge and powerful machines.

Both have manages to suss out some information on even the rarest of the silents, and of course, Barne's book is much more up to date,making it up to the Cumberbatch TV series. (Can you believe there have been at least four Holmes SINCE this recent show: Jonny Lee Miller (Elementary), Gary Piquer (Holmes & Watson: Madrid Days); Igor Petrenko in a new Russian Sherlock series and a fellow named Costas in Sherlock Holmes versus Frankenstein; and let's not forget the three cheapy knock offs made in the wake of the success of the first Downey picture: Ben Syder, Kevin Glazer and Anthony D.

Guess what, take a HP laptop, pentium 4 running XP and it will not even install! That's something new for me but I'm not talking about 1 CD that won't even install, all 3 CD's included in the box will not install. I have never had that problem with any other software.

The game itself does appear to work, however the lack of audio during the introductory parts of the game was very disappointing. Even after running the game in the recommended compatibility mode it still failed to work properly. After looking at the [...] website I learned that the sound doesn't work on XP systems with service pack 1 or later on them. So, if I still ran windows 98 or windows Me on an older system this might be ok. Unfortunetly I've moved beyond the 90s in software technology.

I bought SS Baby deluxe, SS Preschool and SS Toddler for my 2 and 4 year olds. My little girl was SO excited to play these games but Uh-oh. The small print says several of the disks DON'T WORK on Windows 2000 and they were developed for XP before the program was released so it is shaky on XP machines too. The bottom line - we can't run most of the CD's - some will install but not play. Some won't give the sound, some won't install. Very disappointing. Also Encore (who produces product) says on their web that they don't do refunds - you have to go back to the original store. Also they don't have an 800 toll-free number so you have to pay for support calls. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM SESAME STREET.

I'm sooo glad I got myself a copy as well and received it before him. I told him not to read it and send it on to the library or chapel because I found many of the stories full of anger or hopelessness and down right scary. I do think the book would be good for anyone thinking about doing prison ministry work because it gives a good glimpse into the life and feelings of some inmates. But if you are looking to give someone incarcerated hope and inspiration, keep looking.Oh, and as another reviewer mentioned, my son did get kidded about the book because the title is written in a purple/pink color.

So, I end up having to shove the toothbrush in and get whatever I can. This toothbrush lets me brush both the sides and the tops of my dog's teeth at the same time, which means I only have to get the toothbrush in once on top and once on the bottom of each side, instead of getting him to open his mouth AGAIN so I can brush the sides of his teeth near his tongue. It fits really nicely all the way around his canine teeth, too. Only drawback is that it's really hard to rinse.

We saw a few stars, but we couldn't see the moon, it was full the day we try it.If you're starting in astronomy, I would recomend this telescope, it's a very complete product and has good quality, for this price I really doubt I could find something similar, plus, you can buy more accesories that adapt to it, I find that quite useful.Great buy, my boyfriend was really happy -still is- so it was worth the waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a gift","review":"I give it 4 stars now because the person I gave it to has not yet assembled it so I figure it might be a lot of work.

It could not go in any further as it was designed. Thus, there is no Latitude Adjustment or control of the telescope. I contacted the seller and left a very detailed message. I have had no reply or response from the seller so far. I filed a complaint with Amazon. I will update as the process continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I purchased this telescope for my 9 yr old daughter as a Christmas/Birthday present. I had no idea what to get but the reviews of this seemed like a good buy. It came in a huge box with directions for set-up that looked darn right scary! I am not mechanical and the directions are limited - no step by step pictures and some key pieces aren't labeled at all. With that being said I still managed to get it together without incident! It took me at least 1 1/2 hrs - as I said I'm mechanically challenged. I did make 1 call to the help desk - the tripod required installation of a piece that wasn't actually listed at all in the diagram - once I found that it made more sense. The telescope is so NEAT - it looks amazing and the view is spectacular. For the money it can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Telescope","review":"Very disappointed.

However, it is missing one key feature that would have stopped me from ever buying it if I had known ahead of time: You cannot reassign a device function to control a different type of device.

This is the 2nd book about how to use traditional needlelace in a new and contemporary way- Mozart,farmers with their sheep,gardners and even Henry VIII and wives. Jane N's books focus on long and short stich for small and intricate work. This book is larger scale and creates 3D pictures/landscapes as seen on the boxes in the VA Museum but with a 21C twist and humour. It is a challenging book as you need to bring your own skills to the work as it does not provide patterns or lists of materials but does show clearly the techiques required."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I ordered this book on an Amazon recommendation and went straight to the post office to return it the same day. I have both Jane Nicholas' books and the designs in this book are nothing like the colourful ones in hers or other stumpwork books.

I dont know how he calibrated his EQ but I would like to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut Classic","review":"I've heard horrible comparisons and blaming Jackson for copying other artists such as Daft Punk. This album IS house, but very very original at that, and probably the greatest debut album I've heard from any artist in years. Each song is put together brilliantly with montages of samples and glossy 80's texture. The album has a general dark atmosphere, but the end result isn't depressing at all but ecstatic.Smash isn't just your old house album, it feels like an album. The only regret is the album seems to be a little short, but each song really seems to have its fullest effort, with some short fun in-betweens like \\"MOTO\\".

Catherine Hutter to me is the best translation of 3 translations I have read. Werther is a most wonderful book full of introspection and reflections of life. Napoleon read it 40 times! and was his chosen book to take when he visited Egypt. Thomas Mann read it over 10 times and I have read it five times already. After reading Werther, the reader must read Goethe's Reflections on Werther ( in the same book) to really understand the reason why he wrote this book. This is one of my favorites.

Obviously, this is true.The greatest sin caused by this is that Americans aren't ever realy exposed to Goethe more than to read 'Faust, p. 1' once in college. This book, even in translation, is one of the most powerful books ever written: Goethe here created a psychological kind of novel that was never again equalled (though Gide's 'Straight as a Gate' and Flaubert do come close....) and NO Americans EVER read this.....Buy this book. It is haunting, beautiful, and every other adjective that you might want to lay upon it.

Isabelle Huppert floored me with her portrayal of a young lady trying her best to escape the ravages of a controlling parent. She comes across as not a vindictive person but one caught in the throes of a life that one needs desperately to escape. Consequences be damned, she must set her world aright.The Girl from Paris - I had never seen Mathilde Seigner act before now. I thought she did a super job of portraying one who desires to escape from an urban lifestyle and take up the seemingly quaint lifestyle of a farmer. She learns along the way that things don't occur easily. When something needs to built, cared for, repaired and nurtured, the farmer is the sole source of comfort and skill. One learns not to rely on the outside for assistance but to care for onself, care for the animals, and deal with one's loneliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some reservations.","review":"The motor portion was larger than I expected, and although the fan seemed loud, it was effective--until I stuck it in my pocket at a carnival and lost the fan blade somewhere.

This is not the top-shelf Haydn of the symphonies and the string quartets. I bought this because I think whatever Harnoncourt does is usually worth having a look at, but I agree with the reviewer who thinks this is simply boring. The silly and over-the-top production quickly becomes annoying, and after the first thirty minutes, one seriously starts to wonder whether there is actually any real music in this piece... it seems to be an endless chain of recitativos. Even the overture isn't very interesting, nowhere near the quality that Haydn was able to crank out at other occasions. The whole thing just doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word - Boring","review":"I purchased this BluRay DVD months ago based on 5-star reviews, but didn't watch it until yesterday. I know that musical taste is just that and quite personal, but this was one of the most boring performances I've ever watched (in spite of the slapsticks antics). First of all, the music is hardly first rate. Haydn wrote magnificent masses, but as an opera composer (in my opinion), he was not at the top of his field. This production tries hard to overcome this second-rate music and in doing so, makes the music even more trivial.I've watched it once and now it will stay on my shelf until I decide to bring it to a second hand store and get some money for it.So much for Amazon's star-rating system."},{"rating":"1","title":"three hundred and fifty dollars????????????

The book's most annoying feature is its mindless repetition. Quotes and anecdotes that appear in one chapter are re-introduced in another chapter (see Simpson's public humiliation of Craig Baumgarten in an 1985 Esquire article) or, worse, in the same chapter (see Fleming's \\"where are they now\\" summary of Bonnie Bradigan).What's worse than Fleming's shoddy writing (pick a tense, Mr. Fleming, any tense) is his utter lack of insight into Simpson's admittedly repellant character. The author is content to spread unsubstantiated rumors and dwell on the most minute detail of Simpson's bizarre sex life without even once delving into the psychological reasons/motivations for such repulsive behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, terrible book!","review":"This is a book that needed to be written.

The book is entertaining in a very voyeuristic way. \\"Oooh, did he really do this?\\" \\"Ugh, what a scuzzball\\". But after awhile it all becomes long and boring. While the underbelly of Hollywood isn't for the timid, Fleming seems to take great relish damming Simpson and all his kind to the hell that they have created.

This book was recommended study material. I found the basic neurology review quite helpful, but the discussion of individual diseases/conditions were mixed. It seems as if Kaufman has overstepped his areas of expertise. The lit review for many areas was sparse and he presents things as solid facts when, in fact, the empirical literature is quite mixed (and not having citations in the text makes it all but impossible to do fact checking). Other information is just plain wrong. The material in this volume is too wide to have been written by a single author.

However, it may be a good starter book for those who want to just learn something about Islam and then head off to other more robust books on the topic should they have further interest.

These nefarious actions were carried out by churches and religious figures that full well knew the Bible and the teachings of Jesus.

I don't like the silicon skins nor the hard cases. I saw this case and decided to go with the brown version. It actually looks surprisingly good with my black nano. The interchangeable fronts (one comes with a belt clip and the other is just flat) work very well. The bottom of the front cover is attached by a metal button (much like on a jacket) that is pretty sturdy and the top is held closed by a magnet. The magnet holds it tight and I do not have any problems with it coming open while clipped to my pocket or messenger bag strap. I run with the nike+iPod kit, so I am constantly pulling the nano out of this case and putting it in an armband. The case has held up to the wear and should last a lot longer.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this case (or a color variant) to anyone who is interested in a nice, cheap case with interchangeable covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fashionable Ipod Leather Case","review":"The wow factor is back with this great looking ipod nano case.

(I've done this before and fixed it). The original wrench was all metal, and has been in use since I purchased it new in the 70's. The new wrench has a plastic handle and locking mechanism that I was able to easily defeat. Contrary to the ad, YOU CAN TURN THE HANDLE AND CHANGE THE TORQUE SETTING WHEN LOCKED, particularly easy under stress of gripping the handle and pushing the wrench. Please note, THE WRENCH DOES NOT TORQUE IN THE CCW (left-hand thread) DIRECTION. The new wrench is also much larger (longer and greater diameter throughout) than my original, so fitting into tight places is going to be difficult. My advice would be to spend the money for better quality, an all-metal body, and a flex head if one can afford it. I intend to fix my old wrench and have it recalibrated, using the new one as strictly back-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vendor review","review":"I ordered a used book - it was mailed promptly and was in the condition indicated so I was fully satisfied with my order"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD...","review":"This dvd is awesome.

These Thorlo socks were getting consistently high ratings, so I ordered a pair. They are worth every penny and I'm going back for more. It's such a difference that I'd rather rotate just a few pairs of these than have a drawer-full of cheaper ones.(If you're a larger woman trying to decide between these socks and the Thorlon wool-blend hikers: I ordered one pair of each just to see which I liked better.

Their road trip to Napa Valley has some nice scenery, but that's the only redeeming quality in this painful disaster. I did like the indie soundtrack, but those are a dime a dozen these days.

It's like saying 'red' and 'read' must have similar meanings and etymologies since they are - gasp - pronounced the same.Another thing which turned me off was the constant attempts to link things without citations.

The voices of these two women are pretty much what makes the music so powerful for me. Soft as silk sometimes, yet sometime harsh as flint. More than the music or vocalics involved, I found that the meaning and amount of expression were also very very engrossing.

On the third week it quit working all together.I thought it might be defective so I bout a new (same brand-type). Again worked okay for about a week and two weeks later this one quit working two.

I bought a 5 gallon tank from Petsmart and it came with this filter which is appropriate for a 10 gallon tank (hence the 10i). Needless to say the filter is WAY to powerful for anything OTHER than a 10 gallon tank. It LITERALLY sucked my Mystery Snail OUT of it's shell, if that's any indication for you. Nuff said? It's good, BUT way too strong for small fish, frogs, snails, etc. DO NOT BUY FOR SMALL AQUARIUM INHABITANTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does a poor job","review":"This filter came with my 5 gallon tank kit. At first, I thought it would be good because the filter packs are easy. After the first week, a gunky film developed at the bottom of the tank.

This 2 record album has the following tracks:Jumbo - Rob Rives & Francois K. Main Dish, Jumbo - Future Shock Worlds Apart Mix, King of Snake - Straight Mate Mix (album version), King of Snake - Fatboy Slim RemixThe Rob Rives & Francois K. Main Dish remix of Jumbo opens a lot like the album version, then builds towards the end to a chunky house beat which is perfect to mix in some progressive house stompers. The Future Shock Worlds Apart Mix of Jumbo is a chilled warm-up track which has some jungle ambience. The King of Snake mix by Fatboy Slim is exactly the type of big beat mix that Fatboy Slim is known for, mid-set stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fono.......a band in the making","review":"I think that Fono is a band with a lot of potential, even though they are just starting out.

This is 80's music at its best, with strong, catchy rythmns, fantastic keyboard and synthesiser sounds, and great lyrics. To enjoy Nell' Aria C'e'though, one need not speak Italian!'Maria No' is an emotive yet funky tune,which sets the tone for pop music, with depth, to be found on Tozzi's album. And the wonderful anthem 'Hurrah'is particularly memorable, impossible not to chant along with.Nell' Aria C'e' comes highly recommended, as a certain Classic. Every tune delivers its own interpretation of the 1980's genre of popular music, and demonstrates Umberto Tozzi's extraordinary vocal ability.

In this book the words do not mean much either.\\"Do not buy this book. Buy \\"Out on a Limb\\" instead. According to Prof. Sussmann, it's \\"much more entertaining and has a vision.

This text fulfills my requirements, and replaces my previous favorite (Lapin) as the stat book I reach for most often. In support of one's ability to pick up reading in the middle of the book, the text is readable, the notation is pretty standard, you can usually find the definitions of the variables in any equation without looking too far back, and the examples are very helpful. Also, the book has the only section on circular statistics that I have ever found in a general statistics text. Note this is a review of the 4th edition, which I picked up used, and I don't know what changes were made in the 5th edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginner's viewpoint","review":"Frankly, I am aghast that the publisher calls this book accessible and appropriate for beginners. I purchased it as the required text for an introductory biometry class, and it has contributed very little to my understanding of biostatistical analysis. After chapter 7 (at best), it is simply incomprehensible. The mathematical notation requires far more than a high school algebra background, and the wording is extremely terse. Yes, it does offer real-world examples, and yes, it does offer a large range of statistical tables, and I am sure that it is good reference for people who are already working as statisticians and who have advanced degrees in statistics. However, it is misleading to call Zar a good introductory text - it is completely inappropriate for beginners. It is too concise in a situation where more words would be useful.

This book does include virtually everything you'd need as a biological statistician, but I have found most of it totally unaccessible. It's far too verbose which makes it difficult to plow through and I feel it's mostly obsolete since it makes no reference to computer software. Since statistics is now a field based almost exclusively on computer programs, a book based entirely on doing statistics by hand is not helpful! I'd say, save your $100 and look elsewhere (like the literature and an SPSS manual)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concise but not beginner friendly","review":"This book is very concise and very mathemically based.

It literally would not work anymore. I tried everything. Maybe it's defective.....but from other reviews I read, I think it's just a really bad attempt at a great idea. Too bad....she is very disappointed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOURSELF 15 BUCKS","review":"We purchased this for our daughter as a Christmas gift. What a nightmare. First of all, the scissors it came with...well let's just say my teeth cut better. This scissor is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it. It cuts NOTHING. This sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something. It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle. The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch. There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch together. We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter's dolls...wishful thinking! The minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you have NOTHING. My daughter just walked away. We can't believe Singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete junk!","review":"Do not buy this! Needle is terrible difficult to thread, can't get it to stitch after working with it for an hour. Such a disappointment for my daughter. Follow the old adage, you get what you pay for. Singer should be embarrassed to have their name on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I recently purchased this product for my 7 year old daughter. She wanted to learn how to sew and I thought this sewing machine would actually work since it was a Singer product. Well, I wish I would have read the reviews instead of buying on impulse. We tried making a purse and it was a horrible experience. The machine does not work. The only think that works is the pedal. The stitches unravel as soon as she stops sewing. I became frustrated as we tried to stitch the same piece over and over again. The machine is awful! It was a waste of money and it's going back to the store. I am giving the product a one rating because she did understand how to make a simple purse. I will be researching other machines. I will make sure there is a bobbin this time! Save yourself the headache and don't waste your money on this one! I'm avoiding plastic this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read the reviews...","review":"Like other people I was hooked in by the price and the fact that it's SINGER, and my young daughter only wanted to do some basic sewing, nothing fancy.We got this for Christmas for our daughter and thought she'd be able to make something small - no such luck.Luckily we had purchased a few other things on her Christmas list. But we're taking this thing back and will gladly double or triple our budget for something that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesson should be: \\"Research\\"","review":"No fun to have your child discouraged. The only lesson this provided me was to NEVER add something to my childs wish list that I have NOT researched. Geesh! Who would have thought a childs sewing machine would be so difficult. What is the point REALLY? Singer has the perfect opportunity to prepare for future customers, but NOT like this.This was a gift for my daughter and she was so patient, preparing and reading all the details only for it to come un threaded after the fourth stitch. Have rethreaded and followed ALL trouble-shooting.No fun. Durable, only in the fact that is doesn't do anything so, it will last forever doing NOTHING! Overall, the toy is a gimmick and only provides a educational value of what NOT to spend your money on. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had the receipt..","review":"Please please please do not waste your money on this thing. We purchased it on clearance, thinking it would be great for our 5 year old daughter to sew with while Mommy sews. Yeah, no. It is INCREDIBLY noisy, and doesn't work at all. I am very familiar with sewing machines and machinery in general and this piece of junk is worthless. If you can get it to make a stitch at all it doesn't hold after you take it off of the machine - it instantly falls out. Save your money and see if you can find a 2 stitch sewing machine at a yard sale or something for probably the same amount of money. I ended up just breaking out my old 2-stitch Singer for my daughter to sew on since my she was so disappointed that this piece of ^&%* didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"As everyone else has said, this thing is horrible. My daughter was sooo excited about sewing, but it won't be happening on this thing. If I can't find a kid's machine that works, I'll just teach her on mine. I just get nervous about little fingers and fast moving needles.I had a kid's machine when I was little, but I don't remember the kind. It was red and yellow, I believe and had some 70's flowers. It was purchased in the late 80's at a thrift store, so no clue when it was made, does anyone know what this machine could be? It worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of JUNK!!!","review":"I, (the Mom) have been sewing for 20+ years and know the ins and outs of sewing machines very well. We've followed the instructions perfectly and this thing simply DOES NOT WORK! It has consumed a huge amount of time and producted an even larger amount of frustration! My 8-year-old would be far better off learning to sew on a basic, possibly used, introductory, REAL sewing machine-- which is preceisely what I intend to purchase after I throw this piece of junk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Worthless Sewing Machine even for KIDS!","review":"Bought this machine for my daughter. Yep, it was cheap, but I thought at least she can start somewhere and it had a needle guard so she wouldn't accidentally get her fingers under the needle. This thing NEVER EVEN SEWED! It would stitch, but the stitches always came out. Not sure how it can sew if there is no bobbin. I went over and over the directions trying to figure out if there was something I was missing, but nope I wasn't ! So it went back and they almost didn't take it back b/c I threw the box out!

Almost impossible to thread the needle, It took me 15 minutes, my granddaughter couldn't even thread it with her small hands. I have been sewing for 35 years and have had many singer sewing machines. Could not believe singer put their name on this piece of junk. The tension is useless, does not hold stitches and jams every minute. It is very hard to believe that the piece of sample sewing that comes with the machine was actually done on this machine. Such false advertisement. My granddaughter wants nothing to do with this and has discouraged her from want to learn to sew. SINGER PLEASE TAKE THIS MACHINE OFF THE MARKET....."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST A TOY","review":"I would have liked to know that this sewing machine didn't really work and was simply a toy (a pretty expensive toy at that). We've tried every way possible to do a simple chainlink stitch doll pillow, but the fabric gets bunched up in the machine and the stitches just fall out. I do have my own sewing machine and purchased this because my daughter always wants to sew when I sew so I thought this would be perfect to show her how it works (and let her sew on her own in a limited way). I've followed every trouble shooting tip and nothing has made it work. It's a cute toy, but please do not be misled to think that you will be able to show your child how to sew on it because it does not work and is pretty expensive for just a toy. I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but barely","review":"I got this toy to work, you have to set the needle deep into the fabric to get it to hold the fabrics together. Maybe they improved it after all the complaints the past few years? The stitches it makes are pretty loose and come apart easily if you don't have the tension just right. Don't count on it to make anything too sturdy, it really is only good for a toy for a beginner who just wants the satisfaction of sewing a line or two pieces of fabric together. So far, that's all my daughter wants, so it's okay by me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This sewing machine is garbage. Of course the stiches unravel--you only have the one thread. There is no bobbin or bottom thread. The real issue is the machine itself. This is more than impossible to re-thread the needle. Big disappointment for the Singer name. Don't buy this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I too bought the machine since it was simple and \\"Singer\\" brand. But it's horrible. In theory, to \\"lock\\" the stitches the instructions say to sew the item, remove the item from the machine leaving extra thread, and then use a needle to sew a few stitches back. Even if I do all of that, the middle stitches come loose. My 7 year old just wanted to make simple crafts but this was a headache. I'll just let her use my real Singer machine - it was FAR easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"This was a deeply disappointing experience for my daughter (and for me). Whoever at Singer approved putting that respectable name on this piece of junk ought to be fired. As others have said, even the pre-sewn stitches on the piece of fabric pulled out instantly, and it was not possible to produce any stitches that held. Do not waste your time or money on this pitiful piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute for a young girl","review":"Picked up this sewing machine for my 7 year old daughter who loves to make things and draw/design clothes. She was thrilled. Hadn't read the reviews until now, but I'm glad I didn't because it would have probably prevented me from buying it. True, threading the needle isn't the easiest thing in the world, but it certainly isn't impossible, like some of these reviews imply. Is threading ANY needle ever easy?This little sewing machine is a good tool for teaching a little kid patience and also how to sew on a sewing machine. The stitches DO hold, as long as you are careful when you finish a piece and you pull the stitch through to the backside and complete it as they show in the instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"child's singer sewing machine","review":"Singer Chain Stitch Sewing Machine SetThis sewing machine sewed maybe 5 stitches before stopping, I put in new batteries and it sewed two stitches then never again.

It's a terrible first sewing machine for anxious little ones who just want to sew like a grown up!All of the past posts have said it all!

The worst part was that she thought that the fault was hers when it was this horrendous pretense of a Singer sewing machine!After an hour of frustration, I told my little one that we would be shopping for something else to teach her sewing on. As for this one, I told her we could yank the thread and she could \\"pretend\\" to sew on it. The action, noise, and semblance of the real deal will appeal to her imaginary play!Please don't bother with this sewing machine!p.s.

Even though it was a child's machine, I thought it might chain 2 pieces of fabric together somewhat decent. It would stitch about 6 inches, then bind up.

There are a couple that are pretty good, but overall it wasn't a good book. The fact that before each story proclaims for almost every single writer that they are not or do not want to be called a \\"splatterpunk\\" kills the book. There was only one writer in the whole book that the author was able to say was a splatterpunk. Every other writer said they don't wanna be called one or the author says they aren't one.

Her lyrics are only good. Her emotional range is thin. Her songs sound alike. At times fingernails and a chalkboard come to mind. This CD has even less soul than her last release. Don't get me wrong she *can* sing. In a few years maybe she will find something worth singing about. Until then she's a good Napster candidate but not worth any $$.

My favourite would be Souls but that's almost like choosing one's favourite child; the whole thing really is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"even better","review":"When I bought Under These Rocks and Stones, I listened to it non stop for months.. until I saw Chantal live. After that, listening to her on CD was not the same. NOTHING compares to Chantal live... just her and her piano. This CD, however, awakens in me the feeling I had when I first heard \\"Under...\\" It is SO good to hear Chantal again performing new songs. She is a consumate song writer and the songs on this CD are exceptional. Still, I long to hear just Chantal and her piano, and I hope she tours again soon and performs the same incredible duet (Chantal, piano). Please, please, please release a live CD of Chantal. She needs no additional accompaniment and is nothing less than extraordinary live. I love hearing her songs as they were born, just Chantal's voice and that beautiful piano. Aside from that... this CD is fantastic, and I am so pleased to get the bonus CD. I was not expecting it, and \\"Feels Like Home\\" is worth the price of the whole CD. Thanks again, Chantal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Colour","review":"Chantal Kreviazuk's second album is a lean collection of songs that evoke warmth and hope. The record's highlights are the catchy 'Before You,' and the tender 'M'. The album is let down only by the ordinary 'Soul Searching.' Colour Moving And Still does teeter on the edge of sentimentality, but Kreviazuk's glorious, pop-infused tunes are unshakable. There are countless female musicians in the industry who could learn a thing or two from this young talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful album","review":"I hadn't heard anything by Chantal before \\"Dawson's Creek\\" but now I've bought this album I know what I was missing. Every track is sung beautifully and captures the essence and originality of Chantal's style and grace. The melodies are haunting, uplifting, charged with emotion and entirely unforgettable. My favourite and strongest tracks on this CD are \\"Eve\\", \\"Far Away\\" and \\"Dear Life\\". Every song tells a story, the music and lyrics are well written and Chantals truly fantastic and different voice does them justice. My advice to any fans of music featured on \\"Dawson's Creek\\" is, instead of going out and buying the soundtracks get this CD instead it's a far better reminder of the show, and I can guarantee it has something to please everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an Amazing CD!","review":"I' from Canada and I know Chantal since I thnk three years and that Cd Is amazing!

It's really an amazing Cd and go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One album that deserves a listen!","review":"Being a dawsons creek fan i often hear songs on the show that i like, if they're really good i'll follow it up by checking out who the songs are by and listening to them. Whilst doing this Chantal Kreviazuk came up more than once, so i decided to try the album. Now the music on it might not be everyones cup of tea but it is excellent. Chantal has an amazing voice and her songs are orginal and great to listen to, i think you might need to give it a few listens before you really get to like it but it is definately a good album. She really deserves more recognition as a very gifted and talented artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite under these rocks and stones","review":"Chantal Kreviazuk's \\"Colour Moving & Still\\" is a gorgeous album but moves at an undeniably slower pace than her debut effort, \\"Under These Rocks & Stones\\". Nevertheless, slow can still be beautiful. Watch out for heartbreaking tracks like \\"Little Things\\" and \\"M\\", which includes the album's title phrase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than her first album...","review":"Most of the reviews here say that while this is a good album, it's not as great as \\"Under These Rocks and Stones\\". I disagree. Both are good albums, but i think this one is a little easier to get into, and the songs stick with me more than those on the other album.

The package included shims and high temperature brake grease and was packed in foam to prevent damage.

He kept the baby's attention and she loved playing with his \\"crinkle\\" wings and sucking on his face. Other similar toys just didn't cut the muster compared to Jacques. He was her first love.

However, the next time I introduced it, during regular play time, and more cautiously, he LOVED it. Now it is his most entertaining toy of all. And I have always loved how super cute it is!

At first (2months) he just loved to look at him and maybe grab his feathers and crinkle them. Now (at 3 months) he wants me to take the toy down so he can grab it and chew on the crinkly wings. The bright colors are great, he loves the mirror and squeaker too.**ETA: one thing I am not liking is the clip. It hangs it a little to high in his carseat and it is a little difficult to take on and off, I might prefer an alligator type clip instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey & my baby ignores it","review":"The peacock looks cute on net. In reality it is rather small. Also it is not that much fun, as it does not play music (the orange button plays an awkward sound - that's about it).

Worse case if your baby doesn't like it, you can return it (you can return to amazon too, but it's a hassle to go to print the return label , ship it via ups store + Amazon gives you only 30 days to return)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like :(","review":"We have a couple other similar Lamaze toys and really liked them, but this one was big and rigid compared to those, just wasn't a favorite for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this!","review":"This toy is perfect for hanging from the top of the stroller for my daughter to reach up and grab at. It has bright colors, a mirror on one feather, and the feathers have some sort of crunchy material in it that makes a great sound for her when she squeezes it. It keeps her occupied for a long time so its perfect for when we're trying to find a place to warm her bottles up without her getting fussy."},{"rating":"2","title":"cuddly friend and activity center all-in-one","review":"This cute little peacock sure keeps my little one busy. She makes it crinkle and crunch and just loves the baby mirror. I would definitely recommend this product for a developing baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of baby's favorite toys","review":"My son has loved this toy since he was first born. He really liked the black and white side at first, now he loves the front. Every time Jacques comes \\"flying\\" in my son lights up. There aren't many toys that he responds to that much to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves Jacques","review":"I registered for Jacques because I thought he was cute and colorful, and he had good reviews. He was bigger than I anticipated, so I didn't give him to her right away and instead hung him from her activity mat. He was her favorite toy to bat at and inspect. Now she holds him (and eats him!). It is a well made toy and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"Our 6 month old baby loves this toy since he was a month old. With the colors and texture it is a great toy for infants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Infant Toy","review":"I purchased this for my daughter when she was a newborn. She loved to stare at it and once she was more inclined, it became a great noise maker and later teether. The picture is accurate for color. However I will note it's fairly good sized. On her infant carrier, it took up most of the span of the bar and majority of the area between my daughter and the bar. The material wipes clean easily. Overall a great product and durable- I would recommend for any infant/baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacques is a favorite with our baby","review":"Our daughter loves Jacques. He has several different black and white patterns on the back of his tail feathers, which are entertaining for younger babies. Lots of pretty colors, fun patterns and crackly sounds keep older babies happy. The tail feathers are a good size for chewing, too. Our baby loves this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating attention grabber","review":"From day one, my daughter has loved to look at Jacques from all sides. When she was old enough to grab him by herself she delighted in the crinkling of his feathers. She grew attached to him to the point where he had to go everywhere with her, but with the nice Lamaze link that's not a problem! As she gets older and interested in flashier toys Jacques has taken a bit of a backseat but when it's wind down time or she wants a bit of comfort Jacques seems to do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for six-months and up","review":"I gave this to my son when he was six months old and he grew bored with it within three minutes I also found it a bit scary-looking so he might have felt the same. Maybe younger babies might like it but we might as well buy something that a baby will be interested in for a longer period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at 1st Sight","review":"I took my daughter to the store to see what her preference was before buying on Amazon. From the moment she saw Jaques she had to have him. She's 15 weeks old and cannot get enough. She sits and just stares at him. She loves to stick him in her mouth more than any other toy. She likes to lick his head. Luckily, the toy is made well and this isn't an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I got this for my shower and thought it was a great gift based on reviews ... but my little one never really noticed this toy when she was a new born and not mobile -- she is 6.5 months now.. all she wants to do now is to crawl around, grab stuff and put it in her mouth and this rarely gets her attention... overall i like it coz its cute ..thats the only +."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute and Colorful!","review":"Just as cute as he appears in the picture. The backside of Jacques has black and white patterns on him which we are currently using with our newborn. He is able to \\"sit\\" on his own and looks darling displayed on our baby's bookshelf when not in use. The clip will come in handy when we take the toy out and can clip it either to the diaper bag or stroller.

My 6 month old just loves playing with it, chewing it and loves listening to all the different sounds it makes. She is so amazed at the different color's.... I highy recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not practical for us.","review":"We initially bought this toy because of the raving reviews, however, it was disappointing. Our daughter (3 months at the time) did not seem to be interested in Jacques, plus it was hard for her to hold/grasp. The tag that is attached to the toy says it is machine washable, but after washing it and lightly drying it, the mirror became foggy. We returned it and bought Mortimer the Moose instead. Our baby loves Morty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THE PEACOCK","review":"This thing goes everywhere with us. My granddaughter loves it. She loves to stare and smile at it all the time.

This was one of the only toys he could play with for at least 1/2 an hour at a stretch.

We wanted to get him something to stimulate him to reach for things and this toy did it...we attached it to his play yard and within days he was mesmerized and batting at it, yay!! Great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toy but better Lamaze ones","review":"Jacques isn't a bad toy but my son loves the octopus and beaver one better. I personally think the octopus is awesome (Captain Calamari) because baby can chew on all his legs. There's also a mirror underneath him so if you hang him from the carseat, baby can see themselves. Love this brand of toys so wouldn't say not to buy, however, my son just wasn't thrilled with it compared to the other animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as easy to grab","review":"We have both the Lamaze Jacques the Peacock and the Lamaze Freddie the Firefly. The baby instantly took to the firefly absolutely loving it from 3 months to 6 months. The peacock was much harder for him to hang on to and despite being similar in style was ignored. If I had a choice I would go for the firefly instead...Lamaze Freddie the Firefly"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a hit with a 6 m/o","review":"We bought this for our 6-months-old son. It's not a hit. The problem is that the tail consists of very hard and large pieces that barely bend. The kid has a hard time grabbing the toy and cannot really manipulate with any elements. Nothing here can be stretched, squeezed, rolled, pulled -- unlike, say, those long legs or necks or tails in other similar toys. Our son can't even stick any part of this toy in his mouth! So, he understandably doesn't want to play with it. The peacock looks pretty, but you don't really want to touch it. Our kid loves the elefant, the giraffe, and the monkey made by Tiny Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertaining Toy","review":"My baby loves Jacques. Very entertaining toy, colorful and if you shake jacques it's almost like you're making his wings flap, which my daughter really enjoys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky for carseat","review":"With all the reviews, thought it was a great gift. Turns out, my baby boy has no interest. It's too bulky for my Graco Snugride carseat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy","review":"I think that this is one of the cutest toys for little once I ever saw. A kid can spend a long time studying all the colors, mirror, the sound and the whole cute thing. Great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's Favorite Toy","review":"We bought this peacock based on amazon reviews and have not been disappointed. This is our baby's favorite toy. He started taking interest in the back of the peacock (which has the black and white contrast design) around six weeks of age. We held it up for him to stare at during car rides (which he used to hate). It can also be hooked to the car seat handle. Our baby is now four and a half months old and this has been his favorite toy for the past month. He never seems to tire of moving the different parts around to hear the crinkling paper sound and fingering the different textures of cloth. He often uses the white plastic hook to chew on. This is such a good toy for keeping our baby occupied that we've turned the car around twice to retrieve it when we headed out for errands and forgot to get it into the diaper bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"my baby looooooves Jacques","review":"My 3 month old really loves him, he was his first friend at 1 month old. he stares at the white and black part an giggles and \\"talks\\" to him, its so adorable. He also likes the front part specially the wings, and tries to put it in his mouth. I really recomend this toy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Baby Toy--what's with the giant brand label?","review":"I love the plastic hook, it makes this toy so easy to hang from any stroller, car seat, baby carrier, etc. But unlike other hanging toys with strings, I'm not afraid to let my three-month old daughter play with it by herself, because the \\"hook\\" is really a flexible ring. She likes the crinkly sounds, textures and colors, not to mention the big eyes. This is really her favorite toy, even though I like the wooden geometric toys better. If only it didn't have such a big brand label right on the belly, I would give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacques is GREAT!","review":"I got this for my baby when he was 2 months old. He wasn't that interested in toys yet, but he was quickly drawn to Jacques. The color and scale of this toy is just right. I keep it clipped by his car seat. If we have to go in anywhere, he is the perfect length to clip to the stroller clip on my diaper bag and not touch the ground when I set it down. And he's still very entertaining 3 months later. We have a Freddy the Firefly too, but I think my kid prefers Jacques, which kinda surprised me because Freddy looks a little more interesting to me. But Jacques is definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"jacques the peacock","review":"great toy. very colorful. lots of features: squeaker, crinkly noise, etc. my newborn loves to look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this tough bird","review":"He is a fantastic toy for my 4 month old daughter, who is fascinated by him.

While the opening dream sequence was amusing, it ran too long and the episode relied too much on the theme it set and exists as several underwelming fast forward that tells us that Will and Grace had no contact with each other for close to 20 years and are only reunited via an absurd and totaly unbelievable coincidence. The closing scene of Will, Grace, jack and Karen drinking a toast many years from now would have had considerably more power had it not been for the preceding hour.

It confirmed what we all knew: The writers ran out of ideas some time ago. To begin with, a 20-year estrangement was just NOT believable, given what we (used to) know about the characters. They should have done an \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\"-type series finale, which didn't try to be \\"cute\\" but instead managed to neatly encapsulate all the major themes of the series without resorting to a bloated hour-long \\"special\\" with flashbacks, flashforwards, dreams, music (much as I enjoy Jack and Karen's abilities in that area) etc etc etc. W&G, sadly, outstayed their welcome.

I thought it was a horrible way to end a great show."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Have GOT To Be Kidding Me!","review":"The finale for this show is really bad. It totally unbalances what took many years for this show to keep balanced. We are really expected to believe that Will and Grace stopped being friends for a few years? Come on! Every episode of this show was about how their bond became stronger. And Jack and Karen ending up together? Oh, please! This finale keeps jumping around to different events in their lifetimes. And Vince and Will together? I can't stand Vince! This finale was a total bomb. I gave it 2 stars because of Karen's amazing singing voice near the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finale Already??","review":"Hard to believe that the Finale is being offered when the entire series has not yet been released.

The series seemed to have been better scripted and acted, and hand picked by creators who knew of or even read the comics, and that is commendable. Mark Lindsay Chapman does a very nice job as the evil Dr. Arcane, and now, I can easily say that he did better than Louis Jourdan, even though both actors chew up the screen with their portrayals,imo.

It is simply a \\"must-have\\" for anyone interested in Liszt, the piano, and classical music.

( I demand a reprint! ) It is everything James Harrington has it written out to be. Simply and utterly impressive. No finer treatment of any person of note, could be granted than at the hands of author Ernst Burger. He writes, \\"Liszt was rare among musicians in that he was receptive to every aspect of art...\\" It is readily apparent the same could be said of Burger as well. His grasp of the art and the physical world of Liszt's time, as well as a profound appreciation of the music, make this presentation truly in depth and a sheer pleasure to study."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie ever, and you sent me two, one is all i ordered","review":"NO GOOD.WASTE OF MONEY, wouldn't ever keep this movie in my house, gave it to a friend, he is from scotland hope he will make somthing out of it. but i think it going to be a frizbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, just a photo of candles?","review":"I really love the fireplace videos and thought I would like this one, but it isn't a video of flickering candles, as I expected.

For those that are not familiar with these, they are essentially a very long sock. The item is treated with silicon to protect the weapon from moisture and smells like a gun too. The odor is not an issue and does not extend much beyond the sock in the open. These are ideal for long term storage in or out of a gun safe since it takes little extra space and prevents damage from moisture and inevitalbe dings. You would not want this item if you needed quick access to the weapon but would be better served by a quick opening case or no case at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fit.

Both my mini 14 and my Remington 870 fit just fine in these, although it took a little \\"inching down\\" on the shotgun due to a side carrier. Once on, the protection seems good. I couldn't really detect much of a silicon coating, so it's slight and subtle (which is good, if it does its job).

He, in true hero fashion, covers her body with his to stop the blast from hitting her. They both awaken in hospital, his whole back of his body covered in a green slime ( aka Golden Years - though this was written BEFORE) and her hands were also covered. Later, Daniel began to get a few mysterious powers. Great fun!!!!!!!! and tribute for the Invisible Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Characters were not interesting.

Obviamente debo decir, este disco suena un poco mas acustico q los anteriores, pero d todas formas lleva mucha energia y mucho sentimiento; y claro, ya estabamos acostumbrados a escuchar bastante energia y mucho ritmo y fiesta. De todas formas, este disco es chevere para escucharlo durante una noche en la playa con tus amigos; y tambi��n, demuestra q Fey es buena en ritmos diferentes y sabe poner sus canciones en un buen orden, sin llegar a aburrir.

Por eso di 4 estrellas"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is wrong here?","review":"I guess that in an attempt to prevent sounding old Fey has gone out and lefte behind the energy that has brought her to where she is at now. The whole album has mostly acoustic sounds and has very few dance beats. If you like fey's upbeat and energy filled songs then you probably will be disapointed with this album. Diselo con Flores and Vuelve are the most upbeat songs in the album. The rest sound like they lack in effort and as if they were made just to put something out there. But maybe if your leaning toward the more acoustic pop this is probably great for you especially for a Fey fan. It also has some good romantic songs. If you like the old school fey then leave this album alone unless your a hard core fan. And if you love romantic songs get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is AWESOME!!","review":"I had never heard Fey's music, but decided to buy the CD on a whim.

I promise!!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE! This CD Rocks!","review":"Fey once again has created a fantastic album. So many of her songs are upbeat and have great sounds. Her ballads are also great. She really knows how to make music.

Her music cannot be compared to anyone's! She has an interesting, original voice (which, after hearing parts of the last two albums, has defiantely grown and improved in preparation for this album) that captures and mystifies you. \\"El Color De Los Suenos\\" has a great mix of techno/dance, pop, with a few songs that can almost be considered ballads.

Well this is not young adult fiction but it's the best space opera I have ever read : funny, exciting, intelligent. The characterization is very good, and if characters are not exactly what they appear at first sight, there are quite enough clues for the carefull reader, and it's part of what makes the books so vivid and intelligent.The only problem with this series is how ridiculously difficult it is to get all 5 of these books. A reissue would be nice, a book 6 even nicer - book 5 wrapps up almost everything, but there is definite room for another sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect blend of folk and early music","review":"Midnight Sun by Ens. Polaris is one of the best discs that I have heard in a long time. The tunes are from the Scandinavian countries and Estonia, Scotland, and Canada. But the sound is very unique--a blend of many early and world music traditions. The wonder of the disc is that each song receives a unique treatment and arrangement that an ensemble of various instruments (from jews harp, hurdy-gurdy, and clarinet to you name it!) can create--each arrangement seems so perfectly matched to nuances of each song. The result is incredible variety in all respects and a collection of sounds that is strongly rhythmic or gorgeously melodic-- predominantly an early instrumental music sound, but with various influences of celtic, klezmer, middle eastern and blues! Plus there are six haunting vocals by two guest female vocalists. I'm hoping for more great stuff from this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"I guess going for a low priced travel humidor is risky, as you can tell this is cheaply made.

Viewing the capture can be a second or two behind the video on the TV, but everything is captured in very good quality. Capture from the DirectTV DVR makes near commercial quality DVDs, even at the lowest bit rate (2.5 Mb/s).

This gun lasted me about 7-10 wars and 1 month and it is extremely flimsy. It is super inaccurate. If you want to shoot the guy i front of you, you have better luck shooting the guy next to you The fps stinks and this gun isn't powerful. I shot my 5 year old brother in the neck from 5 feet away and he didn't even notice. When it broke I disassembled it and the gears and the gearbox is very cheap plastic. there is not one metal part in the gun exept for the spring. Now I have a Tokyo Marui mp5 with 300 fps with .20s.

Carnival music and funky sounds texture involved lyrical themes of racism(Black and White) ecology(Rollover) and wasted lives(Lost). Impossible to believe, but this extraordinary live act actually improves on their concert performance with the tune Sing a New Song. Great trippy production adds to the moody performance. The 4 different singers within the band have stepped up from previous discs and bodes well for the future of this incredibly talented band. ......Agreed that the batik stained bluegrass touch is sadly lacking(except on the final cut, Up the Canyon)and this is the cause for the CD to lose 1 star...perhaps that twinkle of innocence is hopefully not gone forever. Definitely a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is a great album and the Cheese is a great band.

This album has some great playing and sounds better than their previous studio albums thanks to the production work of Steve Berlin(Los Lobos).In the past few years, SCI has grown as one of the best touring bands in the US and the average Amazon.com consumer has never heard of them. Many of the bands that are great to see live don't translate as well in the studio......not the case here.Take a chance and you'll become a fan of this wonderful and innovative band!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"this DVD is complete garbage.

That's significantly less than I would pay for a composite leather basketball in a sporting goods store.

It has a nice cover which doesn't cause small cuts on your fingers, which happens with the cheaper rubber basketballs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Travelouge -- entertaining and informative","review":"As an Indian reader my strong conviction is that Mr. Wimmel has done justice to the subject with lot of research and supplementing it with first hand experiences while serving in various parts of Asia including India. Of course I do wish if Nepal and Bhutan was also included it would have been of a greater interest to wider cross section of Asians interested in such informative travelogues. The author has really done justice to the subject. Inclusion of historic pictures depicting the active participation of Cartographers of \\"Survey of India Department\\" of Govt. of India has really added to the authencity of the travelogue.

I must admit, when I first bought this CD, I wasn't TOTALLY into it...but the riffs are infections...and the songs stay in your head. I found myself putting back in the CD almost everyday until I grew to love it.It's a refreshing change of pace from the typical thrash you hear...but it's still heavy as heck. It's really hard to describe, but I definitely put it in my top 10 of the year. The songs are good, but there are about 5 or 6 REALLY badass songs that justify buying this. From the 2nd song to about the 7th...it's just great music! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"No, Grip inc. can't be compared to Slayer. Indeed, the man behing the band is the singer: Gus Chambers. He does the job (music and lyrics) and then Waldemar and Dave play it. I read it could resemble Tiamat. No way! Just listen to the two last releases of Tiamat (excellent by the way!), it has nothing to do with this. Grip inc. is probably one of the best metal bands ever because it does never follow what the standards are and plays its own music. It's really creative with many ambiances mid-tempos and various crazy arrangements. I would rather compare them to Machine Head for that reason. Well, overall this album is one of the best of 2004. It takes several times to really appreciate it, because it's very rich and unusual. Nothing compares to this! Just try it, please!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one Portuguese accent away from being Chaos A.D.","review":"The Devil's main man in his marching band Dave Lombardo once again provides his supersonic death chops to another project. This time it's his long time band Grip Inc. Tracks like \\"Curse of the Cloth\\", \\"Endowment of Apathy\\" and \\"Skin Trade\\" are total double bass fury mixed with powerful, clean and thick guitars and vocalist Gus Chambers who enunciates like a private school Lit professor. The truth of the matter that this thing is only one Portuguese accent away from being Chaos A.D., that's how good Incorporated, is. It dive bombs, kills all the kids in the village and leaves no trace of regret: hard, heavy and no frills. The standout track though is \\"Enemy Mind\\" with its tribal percussion, acoustic guitars and all out goodtime death feel. Think Jack Johnson if his day job was driving a Sherman tank into schoolyards. Beach music for the napalm border that Robert Duvall was gonna surf in Apocalypse Now. Charlie doesn't surf but he sure can rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst album till now - 2,5 stars","review":"This is by far their worst album.

The performance was broadcast, but I have yet to hear this performance in a decent sounding edition, regardless of the company that has circulated it. This is very frustrating because it could have been an invaluable addition to the Callas legacy. As it stands now, however, I cannot recommend this performance even to Callas and Corelli fanatics --- because the sound is so putrid that the voices of these great artists cannot be heard properly. Let it go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK FOR ANOTHER VESTALE","review":"This is the worst of the Opera d'Oro recordings that I have heard. No doubt that the stars are wonderful but the sound is SO AWFUL it makes the whole experience terrible. Since I wouldn't give this to anybody, I exchanged it at a CD exchange store.

I always have such high hopes for a new Steve Reich release, remembering the excitement of discovering modern masterpieces such as Music for 18 Musicians, Octet, and Different Trains.

It is a one trick pony. He has nothing (new) to say. Sit down at a keyboard, pick a sequence of notes, and play them for 20 minutes. bring in a cello or other instrument to help you out, add some variety, and keep playing your sequence. it is sophomoric, simplistic, passing for erudition and complexity. it is not.

Steve could use a few lessons and ideas from the master."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrant garbage","review":"Others who have said that piece is poor and boring are correct.Reich, just like Philip Glass, has lost his original style that we all loved to hear in the first place.

It's designed specifically for people who are willing to do high-volume cold-calling (four hours of dialing a day) to find and secure business.So if you aren't behaviorally suited to brainless, repetitive tasks, I'd think long and hard before jumping on board with these concepts.As for the techniques, for the most part they are sound in both theory and real-world application.

Most of the dialogues are artificial and lack credibility, and they detract from the main points.There are also many factors in a sales process that are not considered (for example, the approach that is necessary to use in complex sales situations in order to sell to various levels and roles within an organization).This book could have been better written in a similar fashion to the \\"One-minute Manager\\": it would have been shorter, crisper, and easier to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Probability Selling","review":"I've been \\"selling\\" for about 6 years.

This book made me realize that my time is just as important as my client's time, and in some cases, more important than my prospect's time. It made me re-evaluate my product and boosted my confidence in it ten fold. I have increased my closing ratio from 1/10 to 2/3, and I've got a lot more free time. Read this book and you will see how.

This book provided neither to me.There was a whole series of technical mistakes (like a nuke being able to explode in an airplane crash) that made it clear the author did not do very good research. So no authenticity.There was also the goofy idea that Libyan intelligence could easily penetrate the blackest of US black ops with relative ease. So no plausibility.That ruins it for me.I got to the point where the author started talking about millions of tons of plutonium being naturally available, and that was it for me.It had a good premise and a bunch of 4 and 5 star reviews that convinced me to acquire it when it came up for free recently, but the sheer number of technical mistakes and total lack of plausibility made it something I just did not want to pursue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps them fresh and firm.","review":"This pouch has done the intended job for me.

The first mission was very challenging and took a lot of getting used to. Unlike virtually all of the other games in the series, in CODUO, you are supposed to follow Sgt. Moody and do what he tells you to do and move when he says to. There seem to be more enemies in the first level and less health scattered around. Fortunately, the later missions play more like the original game and overall the expansion pack is fun. The game is more similar to MoH-Allied Assault (but has some unique twists of it's own), and has become my favorite game of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The thing wrong w/ this game is","review":"THE HOLE TIME. i am a very big fan of the call of duty games in fach i have the first one for my pc.

No game has ever done that. Also, the squad based action made you feel compasion for the men fighting alongside you, fighting together, it was so different to medal of honor.

His tone also does not reach the level of brilliance that his former teacher, Eugene Rousseau, shows on the Heiden \\"Fantasia Concertante\\" on his own CD. I would recommend this CD only if you are a young student who wants to play the pieces with a metronome and along with the CD at the same time, as Fischer does not know the meaning of musical nuance. Maybe he will ask himself whether or not it is time to stop recording and focus on teaching. I will praise Fischer for one thing, This CD does not hurt my ears nearly as much as the first.

Years later, I wanted it in hardback to make it a permanent part of my library, did a uwed book search and found one in good condition out of Mass. My point? It's just an excellent read. By the end of the book I'm sure that some may have fooled themselves into thinking that they might actually know enough to fly a helicopter! The author really conveys a lot of information very well. In about a year or so, I'll pick it up again and read it all the way through. It's just that good a book.I salute you Mr. Mason."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for pilots","review":"I got this book the day I started flight school, and I can say that that author \\"enlightened\\" me on a few things to expect out of the training. Some parts of it can be a little technical for anyone that doesn't have an aviation background, but the whole book reads excellent. It doesn't romanticize war as many have done in the past, it gives the first hand accounts of what it was like to be a AIR Cav pilot in Vietnam in some of the worst years there.I can tell you that I, as a helicopter instructor have taken some of the tequnices mentioned in the book from when the author was in flight training, and incorporated them into my teaching style.All-in-all I must say that if you are even a little bit interested in helicopters and Vietnam history you will not be upset in the purchase of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chickenhawk deserves a Pulitzer Prize - don't hesitate - just read it!","review":"I never thought it possible that another book could grab my attention the way \\"A Rumor of War\\" did - that is, until I read Chickenhawk.

I have read at least 12 different books based on the Vietnam war and find Robert Masons Chickenhawk the most inforamtive and enthralling book on the war that I have ever read. From the flying of grunts into hot LZ's to medi-vac, and supply hops, you feel like your a passenger riding in the back seat the whole time. He has succeded in painting the whole pitcure of life in Vietnam, and I would highly recommend both of Robert Masons books on his life during and after Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"The consummate book on helicopters in combat anywhere!","review":"I found by reading Chickenhawk that Mason was six months in front of me in flight school.

If this book doesn't make your hear beat fast, nothing will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn to fly! Learn to live!","review":"Robert Mason just wanted to fly helicopters - and this terrific book puts you so closely into his mind as he learns to fly that you feel as though you could fly one too. Sadly, he paid a high price for his love of flying. This is a great and moving story of how one man was forever altered by Vietnam.Rather than trying to make a statement about the war, Mason sets out to tell his own story. He does so with such honesty that you end the book feeling as irrevocably changed by events as he was. You share his growing panic and trauma as he comes to the end of his tour in Vietnam, and you share his guilt and bewilderment as he tries to cope with living in a peace-demonstrating, hippie-torn America.When you re-read the book - as you induitably will - you'll notice Robert Masons' compassion and humour, his sense of camaraderie, the combination of bravery and reluctance that make him and his comrades 'chickenhawks'."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to read the finest book about 'Nam heli pilots....","review":"...this is THE one!Mason takes you from his training days in Texas, to the jungles of Nam. He learns the tricks of the trade used by the good heli pilots to get in and out of 'hot LZ's', plus makes up a few along the way.An honest book, with descriptions of the war, the people, and the struggles, which make it easy to be drawn into the story.A great read, I recommend it to all my mates that love helicopters as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic!","review":"I bought this book 9 years ago and been reading through it for more than 20 times!. What catched up my eyes at the first place was a comment on the back cover saying \\" A stunning book about the right stuff in the wrong war\\". Honestly, it really is. Bob demonstrates everything in there, starting the first day he dreamed to fly to the last day he suffered from the flying. The story is well arranged and realistic. I could say I knew all basics of how to fly a chopper from this book. It even includes the HU-1 General Arrangement diagram and Instrument Panel diagram in there. The only frustration is that only at the end, leaving the reader just curious what went wrong with him after he was sentenced by a charge with smuggling. Anyway, it later continued in the Chickenhawk: Back to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing, insightful view of the Vietnam War","review":"Robert Mason, the author of this book, tells a chilling story with treasured words and experiences about the Vietnam war. He was an expert helicoptor pilot in the middle of a hell called the Vietnam war. This should be a must-read for all generations today. WHEN WILL A SCREENPLAY BE WRITTEN AND THE MOVIE MADE? As a teenager (female) of the 70's, I learned a life lesson about the war through Mason's visions and experiences. Mason is a great writer with a razor-sharp memory, a keen insight to mankind and a wonderful soul. I highly recommend this book to everyone. It will take your breath away. This is definitely on my \\"top ten\\" book list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Flawed Classic","review":"A book doesn't have to be perfect to be a classic. James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales are a good example. But for its time, this book hit the mark and remains today as an example of what young men go through in the course of exercising their countries political agenda, expecially young men in what was emerging technology in its day--the Huey helicopter. I can still see the scene where they landed in the river to wash the blood and vomit from the deck of their Huey, and I don't think I'll ever forget it. But I too, having been there, was disappointed in the ending. I wish Mason could had done better, but I didn't walk in his moccasins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a war story....","review":"The early part of this book was informative on how the hueys flew and what you had to know to fly them. Some of the early narrative covers the authors clearly courageous action in the Ia Drang battle at LZ X-ray...although poorly compared to Hal Moore's classic. From there it is downhill and soon degenerates into a lurid tale of hookers and booze and shenanigans. Sorry, couldn't finish it. Thanks to the author for his service...in a later part of the war I was one of the grunts in the back of the Huey. Still have a ringing in the ear from the door gunner's muzzle blast on a combat assault with the 101st Airborne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and thought provoking","review":"Mason's honest and poignant memoir of his time as a helicopter pilot during the Viet Nam War provides tremendous perspective from a very personal point of view, not only of how the conflict was pursued, but also the effect on the individuals involved.

I briefly scanned two other reviews and am quite amazed at how some readers missed the point of this booklet entirely. 40/30/30 Phenomenon is clearly meant to be an overview of this diet program, not a dissertation..

It then tells you to blend the cottage cheese until smooth - what cottage cheese - it was never on the ingredient list? Finally, right when you now know something is definetly off with the recipe and your assembling the noodles, etc. - IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE PAN.

The beginning of the workout had to many squats and there were little recovery time from one different exercise to squats. Overall this is a good video. Comparing it to other videos Billy lacks in the stretching department especially in the end of the workout. I was taught dynamic stretch should be performed in the beginning and static stretching in the end. Billy did static stretches in the beginning which wasn't too bad, but in the end there were hardly enough stretching to compensate for such an intense hour"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt Kicker!","review":"I have been doing Tae Bo for years and I absolutely love it!

Proof was in seing how Buck and his 25th Cent. buds behaved towards each other. What I didn't like this time around was seeing Erin Grey (Gray?) unemotional/underemotional--or underacting? in response to emotional situations. I wasn't taken by how she asked their captors to let Buck and the girl go and they can do anything to her. There were other scenes in which I did like her. Also, the fighting scenes are a little dated. You can tell the actors have little experience with judo or kung fu. Definitely pre-Xena for Wilma Deering! I still enjoy Buck Rogers.

With that said however there is really nothing else available on DVD of Mott The Hoople, so I ordered it anyway realizing it would likely not be particularly great.

It is a book you shed no tears over even though you feel grief for a family parted by racial intolerence; rather you feel elated that the story is being told at all because such a history was often a hidden history.Thumbs up to Shirlee Taylor Haizlip, she has written a real eye opener, especially with reference to the first US President George Washington.

The concept of the book was special - each story would stand on its own, yet together they wove an intricate story of complex characters [ more complex than one can get with just a short story]. The charaters come to life quickly, they are engaging - you want to know more and like some more than others. I particularly liked each of the children for different reasons - the son because one rarely hears about the life of a male heterosexual dancer; and the daughter because, well you'll have to see for yourself.

The first four chapters were pretty good explaining about forms and properties etc. As an Access 2/97 trainer most of this was already familiar. However, as soon as you get into the 'Programming' area it begins making assumptions about your level of knowledge. It provides few step by step examples and little explanation of more complicated concepts.

The printer tries to track ink usage, but doesn't do so accurately. Then, once it \\"thinks\\" you may have a low ink cartridge, it stops working altogether until you pony up the money to replace the allegedly low ink cartridge. The issue is that the cartridge may not actually be low. An even bigger issue is you can't SCAN, or do anything else until you pay up. Why do I have to have 6 full ink cartridges to SCAN a picture? (By the way, you can't print in black and white either.)I will never buy another Epson product because of this foolishness.

This is a common issue with most inkjet printers, but the amount of color ink that is wasted is unbelievable to me when I print nothing but black-and-white documents (using the \\"black ink only\\" selection) for four months at a time.

Right now, I have an almost full black cartridge, but because I ran out of magenta, I can't print at all. What a great way for Epson to make money! Also, the option to print in black only is hard to get to. You have to go into the advanced printer settings to change it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent quality, but handles ink dishonestly. (Really.)","review":"Perfectly dishonest: not only does it INSIST that a perfectly functional cartridge is empty, but you are not allowed to print ANYTHING until every cartridge is present and full.So, if it's an hour before your flight, and light magenta is empty, you won't print that boarding pass unless you've got that cartridge on hand.And, no, you can't print \\"black-only\\", because that would mean less money to Epson!Not a bad printer to use.

The song is just a bunch of whining and towards the end that's when Mariah starts her squealing and shrieking. Annoying! Did you see the video for this song? Hasn't that theme already been done a million times before? Jon Secada used it for his \\"If You Go\\" video back in the early 1990s. And just because the song mentions Babyface and The Deele (\\"Two Occassions\\") and Bobby Womack (\\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\") that doesn't make the song deep.

This definitely isn't the right CD for a first time listener, but I know for me as a fan it really helped me to appreciate the original recordings more. The musicianship on this CD is definitely top notch. They manage to play through all the songs without the need of drums for extra background! My ownly complaint, besides length, is the lack of dynamics. As a musician and lover of music I know and can appreciate the importance of crescendos and decrescendos, and that's one reason I love DMB so much. They do a superb job of building and winding down throughout the song which adds a lot to the energy. This Breathe CD, on the other hand, is very musical and creative and together yet it seems to lack that original DMB juice. It is a pretty cool CD that's worth the 15 bucks, but don't expect it to be as great as Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"What a great CD. I've never particularly enjoyed blue grass music, but one spin of this disc changed that. I'm not saying that I want to move to Kentucky(no offence), but listening to DMB being played on moonshine bottles definitely re-established my love for the melodies, which often get over shadowed by the heartfelt lyrics. This CD is a definite buy for the above average DMB fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to DMB AND Bluegrass Roots!","review":"This little-known CD is a must-have for DMB fans. While it can be difficult to play Dave as background music (because the words are so worthy of hearing) Breathe is a wonderful background piece. I run it at the office and have received many comments about it - all positive, even from people who would have sworn they aren't bluegrass fans. The music follows the notes written by DMB and even evokes the same emotional reactions (though softer to be sure). For those of you who are already familiar with bluegrass music, you'll recognize the presence of some mighty talented musicians here. For those of you who thought you hated bluegrass because of the whiny vocal qualities it can bear, rest assured that this one is strictly music without distracting vocals. And, finally, for those of you who are unfamiliar with bluegrass, this is a great introduction to music with down home roots cloaked in the DMB music you already love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"This is a well done representation of Dave Matthews Band music. If you expect it to be totally bluegrass you may be disappointed. If you are looking for great instrumentals, this is it.

For example, he divides the Bible into the Old Order and the New Order, quotes from the imaginary book of Mission, and speaks so much of the Breath of the Anointed it makes me wonder if the Anointed used mouthwash. It is very difficult to slosh through his private language. Reading this book is like listening to someone speak with a mouth full of mashed potatoes. He fancies himself a latter-day Zamenhof, I suppose, but I have better luck reading Esperanto than this linguistic nightmare.I certainly hope this book comes out in English translation, because what little of it I can decode seems good.

The second one is hard to find. I know this sort of stuff because I spent a lot of the 1990s listening to techno. Luckily for those who own these records, this is a CD only release. Aphex Twin released many records as Richard D. James, but as AFX, it was reserved for often more experimental works, and more obscure. This record documents the early AFX. It often mixes odd drum breaks with the sound of children talking. It's not too different from the recent \\"Rubber Johnny\\" record.

It makes it distracting and over emotional way to much. Like a bad teenage action adventure movie trying to have *dramatic* parts. I thought throughout the series that it would get better. Instead of tone'n it down as the series progresses it doesn't. The audio over acting becomes distracting. The story and plot is only OK it isn't grown breaking and doesn't overly draw you in. If i could only rate the book it would be a low 4-3 stars. The series is ruin for me because of the audiobook reader. The dialect of the kids for that time is incorrect. If they have (CD players and internet) they don't talk like kids from the 90s they talk like kids from the 60s with (dude) thrown in there from time to time to sound modern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book was not at all how I expected to be. I had gotten good feedback from some friends who had read it, so I tried it. I didn\`t even get to 10% before I gave up.The Kindle format is horrible. Every time a word is italicized, there is no space between the word and the word before it, which made it a drag to read. But the writing itself is clearly not well thought out. There is no suspense and the story happens so fast that it is dull. Bobby Pendragon kisses a girl, misses a basketball game, and is on a motorcycle running from a guy named Saint Dane in the space of five pages. Not my kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre shlock","review":"Writing this bad's not worth your money.

Unfortunately, it is merely a mediocre hanger-on of the Harry Potter genre. Meet Bobby Pendragon, our 14-year-old protagonist: he is often conceited, stuck-up, plagued by an inferiority complex, a whiner, and none too bright. Just before he is to play in his school's basketball game, as their \\"star player,\\" he finds out that he is a Traveler, who will be swept into a tunnel across time and space to save another planet from destruction.

This is a fairly new fantasy series that is slated to run 10 books, the fourth having just been released as of this writing.Though this series may not be the finest work in literary history it is surely entertaining with a fun story and characters. The idea of traveling through time and space to save the universe (or \\"halla\\" rather) may not be original, but the execution sure is.Of all the young reader's fantasy and sci-fi series I have read recently this series sticks out as one I would recomend despite the less then perfect writing (technically speaking).

Its fun, exciting, gritty and real, despite being a fantasy novel. The reason I say not to compare this book to the Harry Potter books is because I don't view them as being in the same class. Sure, they are both young adult fantasy novels, but there is one key difference: Harry Potter reads more like a cartoon. Many of the things that occur and characters involved are deliberately \\"fluffed\\" (for lack of a better word). Most things come across as cute or charming.McHale has no such compunctions. He leaves things dirty and real. He doesn't idealize his characters or the situations in which they find themselves. Its an incredibly refreshing twist in the young adult genre: a genre that I believe is becoming bloated with cutesy, \\"Potteresque\\" spinoffs. (read: A Series of Unfortunate Events or The Magickers. What a stinker!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the best series in the whole world","review":"The book has many twists and turns and I really liked the book. When you think it's over it's not.

I could not read past the first chapter. The writing style, which I think was meant to help the reader relate to the protagonist, grated on my nerves. The overuse of slang did not help either. I found very little to like about the main character within the first chapter and, as the book is written in the first person, an engaging protagonist is required.There are many better fantasy choices. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Riftwar Saga, the Discworld Series, Good Omens, and if you like the premise of someone being pulled out of the real world to a fantasy world try and find \\"A Two-Edged Sword\\" by Thomas K.

Though I can sometimes be harsh, I have to say that this book is fantastic. It is tied for my favorite series with a couple other series such as the Redwall series by Brian Jacques and the His Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman. Now, about the book. Bobby Pendragon is a popular 14-year-old jock at his high school, until right before the county semi-finals for basketball, his Uncle Press tells Bobby that a group of people require his help. This is the start of a wild adventure with doors with stars that open flumes, quigs, an angry girl named Loor, Travelers, and tak. Be sure not to miss this incredible series by D. J. MacHale.P.S.

I read the first one in only 6 days(I had a lot of homework plus I play with my friends a lot too). I couldn't put it down. This is like no other book I've ever read(and I've read many books). I would recamend this book to anyone who likes interesting and really good stories. This book has a good plot, vivid scenes, and imaginative places.(Note to teachers:Please don't ruin this book by making it some lituature assignment. Lituature is dumb. This is a good book to just read instead of saying well, what's that mean, or making predictions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT appropriate for 10 year-olds","review":"In the first few pages of the book, I read a kissing scene and language that were not at all appropriate for my nearly 10-year-old. The kiss / crush was too descriptive and he doesn't need or want this much detail. The language included swearing and words with a lot of attitude that I don't like. For e.g., the character was \\"jacked\\" somewhere.

I had high hopes for this book, but I was so disappointed after reading so many great reviews and hearing about how good it was.It starts out strong, but by about page 75 I was bored with the generic fantasy caricatures (not actual characters) and the generic fantasy setting. The last straw was a series of atrociously written pages wherein the author explains a plot point, and then explains it again, and then explains that he's explaining it. Give tween readers a little more credit.

Given the number of books in the series, I was surprised at the shallowness and triviality of this premier entry.I'm not going to expand on the professional and the higher quality 1- and 2-star user reviews: I agree with most of their points.

Milkyway bars? L.L. Bean? Give us a break! Um, Equinox litterally means 'equal night', and refurs to the tine twice a year when the night and day are exactly the same length.

It is relatively large based with soft rubber feet for stability. They protect your table or counter from damage. The lighting and adjustment is easy, and the only limitation is the lowest flame is too much for just a simmer.Best not used for small pans or skillets as the rack will not hold them without being prone to tipping over. Use medium and large size for best operation.In my opinion not durable enough to be kicked around and abused. Has vulnerable areas. Use the original cardboard box for storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go Coleman!","review":"I have used every kind of camping stove ever made and found myself with none for my first lone trip in years. I really studied the stoves available and wasn't sure I would be happy with this. I knew I wouldn't need two burners and I wanted to save money so I gave it a shot. My favorite quality is the ease of moving it anywhere to use. I even used it inside my tent when it was pouring; heated up some soup and took the damp out at the same time. The things I worried about: WIND - figured I would block with storage containers but only had to provide a wind block a couple of times. This little burner never blew out in weeks of use. SIZE - proved to be larger and more accomodating than I expected. STABILITY - The most stable stove I've ever used. Bottom line...if I needed more burners I would just get another of these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe single burner","review":"I already have both the 2-burner rectangular stoves with lid & windscreen and also the burner-on-bottle product, both from Coleman.This single burner filled my need for something that packs much smaller than the 2-burner, is way safer than the burner-on-bottle and can share a 30x30in dining table.I just used it today for a mini-picnic, cooking hamburgers at the table and it suddenly occured that, duh, its very sociable to cook right in front of your guests.That would not have happened with the other stoves because of size and risks.I skimmed the other reviews and yes, the diameter is larger than expected, verging on a disappointment since I was trying to pack smaller for (small) car camping.I found the smooth continuous flame adjustment to be a much welcome improvement over the notchy adjustment of the burner-on-bottle product from coleman. I'm missing piezo electric start but a butane wand was a competent substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"So compact","review":"For some strange reason, Coleman have decided not to import this single burner stove to Australia. In fact Colemen have decided not to make ANY single burner camping stoves available in Australia, so I had to import the PowerPack myself from the USA, and I'm glad I did. This stove is a compact, highly efficient and stable unit. Too large for the backpacker and hiker or motorcycle tourer, but ideal for all others who have a little more space. Packs away neatly, can be put into action very quickly, and provides abundant cooking heat. The enamel surface is easy to clean, and the product seems well made. No complaints so far.

Use it on the boat in the summer and can be an emergency stove at home in the winter. A deep skillet fits perfectly in the holders. Great for using the pressure cooker at both places too.

They have known and cared for each other since childhood but because Mark overheard a malicious comment of one of their guests he believes himself unworthy of the girl he loves and begins a downward spiral of self destruction. The story is too long. Billy is a charming kid who loves Marilyn and Mark and gets involved unwittingly in a crime that involves Mark quite accidentally. Billy's scheming to right all his wrongs gets tedious but the way Marilyn and her family love Mark and the way Ms Hill uses her Father to reach and restore Mark makes the book worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"CABALL�� IN HER PRIME AS NORMA","review":"Caball�� is in her prime in this live radio broadcast from Moscow.

It works, but now I wish I had bought a real Denon link instead. The problems are as follows: output is strictly analog, the remote is slow, the menu interface doesn't allow rapid movement through a list of songs, the composite video output is low resolution (of course), and has a vertical orange line on the left side of the display.I control the unit with a Logitech Harmony programmable remote, and that fixed the range issues with the original remote, however, the device reacts slowly to button presses. It seems that the least frustrating way to use the unit is to place it in shuffle mode and let it go.The bottom line, is that this unit really doesn't provide more functionality than the Apple dock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Save your money and get yourself something that works. The controls are extremely sluggish. I find myself pressing the same key on the remote more than 3 times at times. Also the video portion did not work with my 120GB iPod Classic.

If you have a plasma be vary cautious with this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, NO VIDEO PLAYBACK..","review":"It clearly says you can play video on this thing right on the box, and I tried it. You have to change your video on iTunes to music video as video type to even get it to show up on the menu. Then it just proceeds to play it like a song with no option for video playback available.Besides that, the scrolling is terrible. Very slowThe look of it is sweet and it looks like it would be a cool product.I would have even been satisfied with any kind of video like a visualization would have been awesome but its actually just easier to get a cable to hook up to your receiver and control straight from your ipod.The remote control is cool too.. Man, this would be a cool product if they just could play videos... I don't get it. Maybe that's why this product is discontinued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving My iPod Content on the Big Screen","review":"Although it took a bit to get the video to work (the instructions could have been a bit more clear), I'm loving this thing! The other multi-media dock options I considered didn't offer Internet radio -- and this one did.I do wish that the display for the video options was on the TV screen, rather than on the iPod display. And, I also wish there was a way to reset the TV Out option from the TV screen. I'd prefer to not have to physically touch the iPod, when I have the cool little remote in-hand.What surprises me the most is the quality of the image. I fully expected pixelation and a less-than-clear presentation. What I found was a good picture, and the ability to see some details on the larger screen that I had missed on the hand-held version. In particular... it's so much easier to read the translation text on Heroes (one of my favorite iTunes TV show purchases)."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs major improvement","review":"I bought this instead of the official apple video dock only because this product supports internet radio stations. Big mistake. I have an iPod Video which I want to show movies/videos on my home theatre, and although this has both an S-video output and composite video output, I can't get it to display any video from the iPod. The video output is just for the menu system. But... if you don't care about displaying video then it's not that bad of a product. The remote control is a little weak but will work from 10 feet away. The aluminum/silver finish is a great match to audio system components, and the dock itself is heavy and feels well made. Audio quality is decent, and the video quality of menu system is nice and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Damn Good.","review":"This is a pretty good cd.

If you are not sure about adding this CD to your Spice Collection than you are nuts!! I think that the Spice Girls rock all over. Even if it is hard rock or really slow music or upbeat music.

Now that Geri has left I'm sure that their next album will be even better than their first two. This song reminds me of Viva Forver another of my favorites. They seem to have matured alot and actually put some clothes on (Watch the MTV music video to see this) I recomend this song for anyone- even people who don't like the spice girls because it is alot differnt than their other music.Oh also alot of people think that this song is for Geri and they want her back but it's not the song is saying that everyone looses friends in their lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was different!!!","review":"I've always liked the music that the Spice Girls sing, but this touched my heart.

This song has very complex lyrics... they compare situations and use various sayings (example, the line : \\"Look for the Rainbow, In every storm. Find that for certain, love's gonna be there for you, you'll always be someone's baby. Goodbye my friend...\\") That line tells you to look for goodness and relief in every coarse action, and that no one's worthless and you'll always be loved. When Emma and Mel B say: \\"You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear\\", they tell you gotta do what's right for you and not to force yourself into something that's not comfortable to you. You Must buy this CD Single. This is the most beautiful song ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Amazing and thriller at the same time","review":"This is the best song I have ever heard...HAS TO BE #1...buy it, you're not going to be dissapointed.

I actually think that they are doing better without Geri, but I still wish Geri didn't leave, because she was my favorite Spice Girl(She still is!). And also, if you don't like the Spice Girls, you should still listen to this song because it is totally different than all there other songs, and you *never* get tired of listening to it! The Goodbye video is also, I think, there *best* video.

It will definetely be a hit. It's simply beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saying Goodbyes To The Spice...","review":"While the Girls may have released an album since this single release, this was what signaled the end of them as a relevant pop act, in the United States at least. A ballad, the vocal is well done, the lyrics both sad and uplifting. Being as the track was released around a holiday season, the b-side is a cover of the Waitresses' beloved Christmas chestnut \\"Christmas Wrapping\\". Live cover versions of girl power classics \\"Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves\\" and \\"We Are Family\\" fail to excite, they aren't bad, but I would have rather had another b-side or two in favor of these.

The essays, which are introduced by Peter Drucker, are organized into six main themes: shaping future organizations, new models for working and organizing, organizing for strategic advantage, working and organizing in a wired world, leading people in future organizations and understanding and improving organizational health. Given this approach and more than three dozen authors, some repetition is inevitable, so we [...] wonder if readers will prefer to dip in and choose articles that appeal to them the most. Generally, the book explicates broad trends in structural thinking, almost like a survey of organizational forecasting by top philosophers, authors and leaders in the field. This is sure to intrigue the executives charged with steering large organizations to and through this complex future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying Addition to the Genre (or Ow My Arm Hurts)","review":"Knowing what will happen never lessens the fun when a protagonist is out to even a score. In fact, that's what makes these kind of films so enjoyable. But this well-crafted and smartly cast thriller never amounts to much. It is so reserved in delivering its payoff that one of the victims is actually left with an achy arm. That's the revenge! Gotcha - your arm hurts! I won't ruin the fate of the principal character, but the delivery of her comeuppance is also wanting. While I'm not a fan of our lack of subtleness here in the States - a remake would probably have Melanie running around with a machete - this thriller could have been greatly improved with a racier denouement. Instead the film walks to a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The script never really sells the story","review":"Spoiler warning: Why this young lady would hold such a vendetta, including promoting physical damage of a youth, over a slight at a piano competition is proposition that outstretches credulity.

Catherine Frot gives a good performance despite the adversity of working with such a lame story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most entertaining book about programming I have ever read","review":"This book talks about corner cases of Java that you probably won't be facing every day, but are very good to know. And besides, it was very very entertaining reading. I enjoyed every single page of it. I hope more puzzlers will come with next versions of Java.I've also submitted own solution to one puzzler and authors replied and accepted that, definitelly made my day :)Effective Java is more usable, but this is more fun. Go and get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and funny","review":"This book presents several problems that maybe even expert Java developers never thougt about.

If you're looking to become a better programmer, or simply to be entertained, this probably isn't the right book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not puzzles, just silly trivia","review":"This is not a fun puzzle book--it's just a bunch of strange Java programs that produce unexpected output because of, in the authors' opinions, problems with the Java language. There was one puzzle in the entire book the I fealt was fun to work out and provided real-world insight into programming and testing. The vast majority of the code samples are so bad to start out with that it doesn't matter what they produce--anyone that writes them in a production app should be fired.The rest were all weird edge conditions, not fun puzzles to solve. With every example the authors talk about how Java could have been written better so these samples wouldn't produce such unexpected results. Really it's more of an advertisement for .NET than anything else because many of the weirdest samples would produce exceptions in .NET whereas in Java they just do strange things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geek fun!","review":"First, let's get this out of the way: you're not as smart as you think you are. Seriously. You don't know everything about Java. It's possible, however, that these authors do.\\"Java Puzzlers\\" shows you more tricky corners of the Java language than you ever expected could exist. Not odd behaviors of obscure API classes, not failings of a particular implementation, but known consequences of the language specification itself. Each puzzler, written in an engaging and often humorous style, gives you a chance to figure things out for yourself before lowering the boom to let you know that, once again... you're wrong.If you read this book and take its message to heart, you'll learn to avoid the dark alleys of Java, making sure your programs will never inadvertently become puzzlers for you or those who come after you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What? Aha..... Uh-oh!","review":"\\"What is going on here? Aha, I think I got it. Uh-oh, the output is not what I expected.\\"This is what often happened when I was reading and running the code from this book. If you think you know Java well, prove it by going thru this book. It will surely make you go and look again at the Java Language Specification; you learn, relearn and never cease wondering how the authors came up with some of these examples. A gem of a book, it's so interesting that it makes you turn pages, one after another, late into the night. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. It tries to cover far too much ground in too little space. Not only is the book not a \\"people's history of Iraq\\" it is not even really a history of the Iraqi Communist Party.This is definitely not the first book anyone should read about Iraq or the Iraqi left. The first thing to read is Tariq Ali's Bush in Babylon. Reading this book first will only confuse you. If you read Ali's work and want more, read Hannah Batatu's classic the Old Social Classes and the Revolutionary Movements in Iraq, a 1,300 page monster filled with first hand accounts by Communists and Ba'athists, as well as tons of statistics and other empirical data."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"more of a concept album than anything else.

The plastic that the light glows through effectively illuminates the entire page almost completely evenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a carbon copy","review":"Although this book was good -it is almost thouroughly impossible to miss with Paul Zindel- it was very much like his most famous book, The Pigman. In The Pigman, two high school friends, Paul and Lorraine, befriend an extremely lonely elderly man and live out his last days with him. In A Begonia for Miss Applebaum, two high school friends, Henry and Zelda, become closer friends with their lonely elderly high school science teacher. Both are good reads, but it was annoying to read the same book in a different guise.Overall, A Begonia for Miss Applebaum was a good book. It was poignant, gentle and somewhat funny. However, the similarities to The Pigman were so glaring that it interfered with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i fear for my life","review":"i found this book offensive for the follwing reasons:1) after miss applebaum's unfortunate ... in a purely inconceivable way. the young children, no older than many who read the book, ....well... that's basically it, but that is extremely disturbing! i couldn't believe what i was *reading*. it was the scariest thing i have ever in my life come across!!!! i was expecting a good, wholesome family book, but now i am constantly haunted ....steer clear! and i once thought that return to oz was creepy. this book is more terrifying than veggie tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"A legend in his own right","review":"Phil Hartman was easily one of the funniest people to be on SNL ever. Why he left to be on the less funnier Newsradio is beyond me. Ususally the best of collections dissapoint me, but I found this to be rather entertaining, You've got Clinton, Sinatra, Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, and the analretentive chef. The 5 second bits were also highly hysterical, im suprised they dont do that more on other SNL best ofs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought the DVD hoping to see one skit -- the funniest one my family had ever seen on SNL. We had it recorded on VHS many MANY years ago and somehow lost it. But we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where Phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits -- \\"Smiling Laughing Joking Around Man\\" ... \\"Man Who Reminds Me Of My Doggie\\" ... \\"Hair Head!\\" I thought for SURE that THE funniest skit in all of SNL history would be on there, but no...it was just a 20 second clip. I was SO disappointed!!And it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety...They just weren't funny.On a positive note, there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the DVD that was so sweet, it brought me to tears. And the bonus featuring Phil's audition was quite interesting. But overall, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Great Hartman Skits Missing","review":"This is good for a few laughs, but overall is a major disappointment. It does not do justice to all the hilarious Phil Hartman moments on SNL. The first half of the tape is decent, but the last few sketches on the video are flat out unfunny. Purchase the video with your expectations low or you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ping Pong Match!","review":"Phil Hartman is one of SNL's best, and this DVD does a fair job of capturing his talent, but, like most of these recent SNL DVD releases, it is definitely lacking. If you're a big Hartman fan, you should buy this, but if you're looking for a DVD packed with non-stop laughs, you may be disappointed. This one starts out strong, but dwindles in comedic value by the end. The extras are OK at best, although I did really enjoy the audition extra, which again, if you're a huge Hartman fan, you'll definitely want to see. Overall, there's nothing wrong with this DVD, I had just hoped for more going into it. It would be a definite buy for less than $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend is Back","review":"I have to say that Phil Hartman ties Will Ferrell as the funniest cast member ever on Saturday Night Live and comes in at #1 for the classiest.

Also look for him on Newsradio and the movie \\"Greed\\" with Michael J. Fox. We all miss you Phil!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is a cut up mess","review":"I was looking forward to the DVD.Man, a let down.DVD starts out with some classic funny bit The Frank Sinatra with Sting as Billy Idol, Bill Clinton & the fast food.

Multiple cut up sketches.Then, the rest of the sketches THAT WERE COMPLETE were not best of sketches.Any SNL or fan of the late Phil will be disappointed in this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"some of it is good. but they should have filled this up with about 3 hours of material. im very dissapointed in it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but Could Have Had More","review":"Phil Hartman was a master impersonator.

He's crack about O' Connor are hilarious!Compulshion-he slaps Dana Carvey, heh.Sprokets Bachorette-\\"House on fire! House on fire! Put it out! Put it out!\\"Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer-he's just a caveman, really.Matlock-brilliant!Anne Boleyn-how many ways to kill a queen.Love Is A Dream-okay it's not supposed to be funny, but they did a great job making it look like an old film. Great little dramatic closer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil Hartman was a superb comedian, but this DVD does not do him justice","review":"I really loved Phil Hartman's work, and I really miss him in that sense. Unfortunately for me and many SNL fans overseas, it is impossible to replay SNL skits outside the US (on the internet), so we have to rely on DVDs like this one.This DVD contains some wonderfully funny skits. However, most of the rest of the material is horribly chopped up - it is much too short (sometimes just a few seconds), taken out of context, and thus very frustrating. It also includes some really crappy skits that don't do justice to the hundreds of great skits they did NOT include...I am truly disappointed that SNL ruined this DVD by terrible editing. They should keep in mind that Hartman is not with us anymore, and let us remember him with a DVD that really shows how talented and supremely funny he was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started My Robyn Carr Reading Campaign!","review":"I picked this book up by chance off a free books rack at the local library. It was a medieval romance and I am not much into that period but read it anyway. I'm still not a medieval romance reader except for those by Robyn Carr.

This is vanity publishing at its worst. I would say no stars but you don't give me that option. This is not a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Excellent Album","review":"Several people are quick to dismiss the Live In New York series because of poor audio quality, poor playing, or both. This is not the case when it comes to volume 2.The quality of the audio is fine, you can hear everything clearly and the audience never over powers the music. The balance is good and remains consistent throughout.These albums were recorded near the end of Jaco's life, when his health and mental state were deteriorating. However, this recording captures some of Jaco's best playing. It is top-notch on every song.The songs presented here are incredible. This is the best version of Teen Town I've ever heard. Continuum is hauntingly beautiful. I Shot the Sherif and Dear Prudence are both excellent as well.In my opinion, this is the best of the Live in New York series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except the cowbell","review":"My bass teacher lent me this album so I could get familiar with Jaco's playing, and I love it! This and the Birthday Concert are the only albums I have. I love everything about this CD except for one thing. In \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" there are 8 of the WORST cowbell hits I have ever heard in my life. I don't know what he was thinking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"Forget this whole series of releases-they only taint the image of Jaco that we should preserve-as the best there ever was!I am certain Jaco's spinning around in his grave by the thought of this cd representing his playing skills.The playing on here is drunken,loud,insensitive and generally resorts to being based on a very small bag of tricks of licks.And, oh yes-he's playing a fretted bass for more reasons than one!His chops are so depressingly low that the bright moments on this disc(very few and short to be sure)seem to occur during straight'rhythm section-playing'.Choice of songs is desperate at best...Listen to Bright Size Life,Trilogue-Live,Shadows and Light or his selftitled debut or even the Birthday Concert you want a clear image of who this guy was and why he will be the inspiration of genrations of musicians to come...Stay away from this...no foolin'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Real... So glad it's back in print!","review":"I am ecstatic this book is back. I \\"borrowed\\" my copy from a friend in approximately 1983. She has never quite forgiven me. Then my copy got lost somewhere. I have read this book so many times, I feel as if I know every word. I have always loved the vivid details in the description of life in the late fifties in a small New Hampshire town. I have always felt somewhat sorry for Snowy- she seemed so lonely. Bev was not a true friend and she did not seem very close to Puddles. Perhaps that is why she became so attached to Tom.

After that I just kept it to myself). I never heard of this author's other books, which now I will search out."},{"rating":"2","title":"High School Nostalgia","review":"I borrowed this book from my older sister when I was in Junior high. She had gotten it from the senior high school library. After I read it, I couldn't wait to get to Senior High school so I could read it again. There is something about this book that invites the reader to suffer the pangs of adolescence along with Snowy, the main character. You are excited when she is asked out by the boy of her dreams. Now, about 20 years later, I was happy to find this book at Amazon.com. For some reason it has been on my mind again. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of all time!","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 or 14 and am now in my 30s. I loved this book then and still love it.

Now, if we could get just get Snowy in re-print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite when I was in High School","review":"This book meant a great deal to me when I first read it in High School, during the 1970s. I am from a small town in New Hampshire that bore a resemblance to Snowy's hometown. In fact, I think Ruth Doan MacDougall lived in my town at one point as an adult. Anyway, it really captured teenage angst, as well as New Hampshire angst, and I re-read it so many times that my copy fell apart. I was very happy, while browsing through Amazon.com, to find that a sequel exists (\\"Snowy\\"), detailing her experiences after high school. I can't wait to find it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read.","review":"I read this book several years ago and just loved it. I would recommend it highly.

This book was circulated within our inner circles of girlfriends in the 1970's. We lived by the actions of Puddles and all the other girls. We could relate to what they were experiencing and we all knew someone like all the characters in the book.It also was a little racey for our time, but now it is the norm with most teenage girls.I used to own a hard back copy and I loaned it out and it was never returned. We had a list in the front of the book of all the friends who passed it on to read. It was our bible, so if the person who stole it is reading this. . . please return it to the rightful owner.

It gives a particularly illuminating glimpse into living conditions for foreign families in the Soviet Union of those times. The children's descriptions of their school experiences are extremely interesting, since such information is not readily available elsewhere. Jerrold's contributions to the book tend to stick mostly to the political events behind the stories he was covering (ho hum), but Leona writes about life as an expat mother trying to deal with extraordinary circumstances.

The only reason I gave it two stars was because it was part of the Pink Panther series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abhorrent.","review":"Possibly the most distasteful mainstream Hollywood film ever, this features a clearly-ill David Niven in his final role, in a film that continues a series whose star died a film ago. Imagine the corpses of both Niven and Sellers being squeezed in a giant mangle, and you have the level of revulsion this film engenders. 'Trail' was interesting as a collection of out-takes, although the thought that people paid money to see it in the cinema is mind-boggling; this, on the other hand, is actually offensive. Worse than that, it's neither funny nor interesting, and Blake Edwards' subsequent attempts to resurrect the franchise smell of desperation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curse of the Pink Panther","review":"Of course Peter Sellers was the best pink panther but I found this movie quite enjoyable.

The result was this morbidly unfunny farce, with a mind-boggling cameo by Roger Moore as Inspector Clouseau. A 1983 summer flop, \\"Curse of the Pink Panther\\" remains deservedly forgotten. Sadly, David Niven's final film (a pity he was unable to reprise Sir Charles Litton for \\"The Return of the Pink Panther\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst film I ever seen in my life.","review":"IDIOTIC. Thats all I have to say. Blake Edwards in his worst direction of his entire career.

I saw it with my parents but it really stuck with me and my Mom and we would often, over the years talk about the funnier scenes. We would giggle and laugh till we had tears in our eyes. I love the Pink panther film series with Peter Sellers and this one is just as good. It has a lot of cameo appearances of actors who starred in the previous Sellers films, and it's just really funny. I can't explain it. Just that you're really missing out if you haven't seen this film. I can watch it over and over again, and not grow tired of it. When I discovered it was available for purchase on VHS (used) I bought 2 copies. One for my mom and one for me.

Although the book has a great deal of sex with various partners and fantasies about being spanked throughout its contents, the first spanking does not occur until page 84. Then the next is at least 15 pages later. I ordered this book because I thought it was a novel about adult spankings. I didn't want a novel about a woman wishing someone would spank her and then occasionally it happens. Plus there are hundred's of fiction books detailing sex and sexual encounters, if that is what I was looking for, this book would not have been among my choices. \\"Brat\\" is disappointing and not fully worth the money, better to get this paperback in the library or a used book store.

Basically it's a 20 page story that is dragged out in tedious detail until you hit a very unsatisfying conclusion. He wimped out and did a Poirot ending. Which I hated, needless to say! I wish he would have not written this book at all, or waited until he could have done a better job. If more sins are committed in the future, I will certainly read them, and hope they are better than this trite, deadly dull outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The goddess Erin Gray","review":"Erin Gray, in her tight spandex outfits, is the reason to watch the late 70s Buck Rogers.

It was an enjoyable read.Mr. Wallace starts the book by giving the reader a number of questions that will need to be answered. Like who is the guy in the closet, what is his relationship to the people who he is visiting and most importantly, what is his goal behind his visit.As the story progresses the reader gets a peak at the lives of a number of different people through the use of flash backs and how one event changes their lives.Throughout this book there a number of twists and turns, which keep the reader guessing and wondering what will happen next. The twists and turns start early and keep coming until the end of the book. These plot twists are what makes this book fun to read. I have also found that the characters that Mr. Wallace has populate the world with are rather interesting and many seem to have there own backgrounds and histories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Awaited \\"Dearly Beloved\\" by Stanley Turrentine","review":"Anyone who is a Stanley Turrentine fan will cherish this one.

We are heavily reliant on the recording industry to hear them.This recital was recorded in December 1980 when Kiri was at the height of her powers - and her coiffure bore resemblance to a battlement. There is a creaminess to her timbre that is breathtaking. Better still, her diction and vocal acting are exemplary. She is gracefully accompanied by Fischer and the Wiener Kammerorchester.In terms of the music itself, there is at least one masterpiece here: \\"Vado, Ma Dove?\\" (K 583). My favourite aria in this recital however is \\"Oh, Temerario Arbace ! Per Quel Paterno Amplesso\\" (K 79). What is one to make of a mere ten year old who pens such melodies?

For people who didn't discover Bon Jovi until their breakthrough SLIPPERY WHEN WET, their self-titled debut album is a surprisingly durable blast of 80's pop/metal.NEW JERSEY received a far less favorable critical reception than SLIPPERY, but it's hardly a dud album. There are 5 hit songs, and even the filler isn't as bad as cheesy SLIPPERY cuts like \\"I'd Die For You\\" or \\"Social Disease.\\"But the real treat here is finally getting a remastered version of BLAZE OF GLORY. All the Bon Jovi catalog titles have been remastered, up through 1995's THESE DAYS. But Jon Bon Jovi's solo project, tied to the film YOUNG GUNS II had been largely ignored until now. Only two hits, the title song and the all-but-forgotten gem \\"Miracle,\\" are here. But the disc itself is more focused and listenable than much of the band's output from the 90's.If you don't already have the remastered discs, this is a reasonable investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh Uh","review":"Despite previous reviews stating so, Blaze of Glory in this set is NOT remastered. \\"Bon Jovi\\" and \\"New Jersey\\" are indeed remastered, but for many, the real draw of this set would be the thought of Blaze of Glory being so, too. There is no value added to this set. The CD's and CD booklets are thrown in directly from the individual packaging with nothing additional save for the pictured box which has CD holders that keep far too firm of a grip. If you need remasters, buy the two remastered albums separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd collection","review":"As a Bon Jovi fan, this is a disappointing collection. There is nothing new, and the choice of albums is strange. \\"Bon Jovi\\" and \\"New Jersey\\" are both remastered, but to my dismay, \\"Blaze Of Glory\\" is NOT remastered.

I had been holding my breath for two years for this record, and when I put it in, I was blown away; but not in a good way.

There are too many ideas and styles here and none of them are mature enough to be considered for an album. This sounds like random selected Anathema songs that did not make it on to previous albums. This cd is boring just like A fine day to exit was. If they listened to it Beavis would probably turn to Butthead and say hey you fell asleep dude. Sounds a lot like Radiohead in many places.

It doesn't always work but it works often enough that it is already worth the price. It is a great way to play with your baby.I don't mind the limited music library as I can make up my own tunes and the baby doesn't care if you're off key.The only thing that is bothersome is some of the legs are hard to squeeze to make sounds even for adults which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to squeeze!","review":"My (very strong and big for her age) 10-month-old wants to make music so badly with her octopus but the legs don't toot so easily--it takes a strong (adult) hand to make music.

Both kids initially liked the look of it (it's really cute, brightly colored and sturdy, and big for a baby) so they grabbed it, but it's too heavy for a baby to lift and the legs are too fat for tiny hands to squeeze. So after a few pats and pokes my babies grew bored of it and moved on.

She kept staring at it as soon as it was put in front of her. Its near on impossible for a young baby to get a tune out of the arms (more for adult than even a one year old), but all the same, its brought lots of amusement, has a lovely vanilla scent to it and my daughter gets very excited when I play 'twinkle little star' to her on it. She's now nearly 6 months and its one of her favourite toys. She also tends to frequently lay on her tummy talking to him, always goes towards him when on her playmat and plays with his black and white frills on each arm. Money well spent as when other children come round they also seem to take a shine to it, ranging from 2 year olds to 5 year olds! Another great toy from Lamaze."},{"rating":"2","title":"so cute!","review":"This toy is adorable! It is colorful & pretty big!

If we lay it on the ground and she steps on it she can get some sound out of it. The legs are so wide.

I've played the songs that come on the tag (yes, squeeze the right color and you can play children's songs), helped her squeak the tentacles and encouraged her to wrestle with it, but she just doesn't care. She simply glances at the goofy thing, looks at her other toys and creeps right past the Octotunes to her little piano or her Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Puppy.

Very kind and very simple to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never buy this brand again","review":"I bought two sets of Pike Street sheets for Christmas presents and decided to wash them first before giving them to my mother and daughter. I washed them three times as there was soooooooooo much lint. I had handfuls all three times and lint everywhere. What a disappointment. They also are pilled. Haven't even tried to put them on the beds yet as I have been washing them so many times. Well, I don't know if anyone else had this problem but I know I will never order them again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Price but not great quality! Really Thin Flannel","review":"These sheets were alot thinner than I was expecting. I have bought Flannel Sheets from Amazon before and loved them. But I was disappointed with these, they did NOT wash well either and do not overhang my bed as much as I would like. Definatly need to iron after washing them (although I'm not wasting my time ironing when I won't put them on a bed again) unlike the others I have they are just CHEAPLY MADE but to be honest I didn't expect a whole lot with the PRICE I paid.. Under $10 for KING SET so can't complain too much. Will end up using for rags, dog bed etc. so I suppose I got $10 worth of fabric that can be used for something. Just don't expect these sheets to be good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Zero Stars an option???","review":"Because if it was, that's what I would give these sheets. I ordered these on sale for $9.99. Yeah...I know. I should've known at that price. Ordered Queen Size sheets and washed them once before attempting to use them. I washed them in cold water using the delicate cycle. And I tumble dried them on low. Alas...the sheets don't fit our Queen Size bed. What's up with that? We tried and tried...but the fitted sheet won't fit (no pun intended). Steer clear of these sheets. You get what you pay for!! Unfortunately, my wife threw away the original packaging, so I'll probably just have to use these for rags. Amazon shouldn't sell junk like this, no matter how low the price is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the purchase price","review":"I have six sets of these and have used them for 2 winters, The quality is good and they are very soft. My matress has the pillow top and I have never had any trouble with the sheets not fitting or flipping off the corners. I've also given them as gifts, for bridal showers as well as for Christmas and have received many compliments on them. Well worth the purchase price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm, but you get what you pay for","review":"I bought these for the bargain $15 because I had never owned a set of flannel sheets and wanted to try them out. As stated above, these sheets are warm compared to the Egyptian cotton sheets we usually have on our bed. My husband complained that they were itchy on his skin, but I didn't notice any itchiness. The queen flat sheet was a little narrow, but that may be due to the down mattress topper we have on our queen mattress. After a second washing, I noticed that the flannel has begun to \\"pill\\". Perhaps a better quality sheet would not pill, but these are okay for this winter season, but I don't know whether we'll be using them next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I chose these sheets because my daughter's favorite color is red. I ordered 2 other sets at the same price point from other merchandise options for twin sheet sets. This set is by far the least thick, soft and visibly well-made. The package they were in came torn up and there was a small amount of adhesive near the top of the top sheet that won't come off. I would have sent them back, but it wasn't worth the cost of shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there an option for NEGATIVE stars?","review":"I bought two sets of these sheets. One set is the sky blue in the queen size and the other is the redwood, also queen size. The sky blue set is about what I'd expect for $5.99 (that's what I paid for each set on sale). They're soft but not luxe, but they get the job done (i.e. I don't have to get into a cold bed at night during this icky Maine Winter). The redwood sheets, however, suck. They suck bad. There is nothing flannel about these sheets at all. Seriously. It's like they forgot the flannel. They are VERY rough. They fit the bed fine, but I can't bring myself to sleep on them. The underside of the fitted sheet is softer than the (\\"right\\") side that would touch your body, but it's still not flannel. I know it's only $5.99 and I had decent luck with one set, but I don't think I'll risk buying these again. I'll be lucky if these sheets (the redwood ones) hold up enough to use as rags. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"too much lint","review":"This is the first time I have used flannel sheets so it's nice to climb into bed and it's warm, but when I get up we are covered in lint, and when they are washed and dried the dryer screen is loaded with lint...not sure how long this will last they have been washed a couple of times..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have spent th $50!","review":"These sheets shed their skin! Do not lean on your bed when you're wearing your black suit - you'll need to go through your entire lint brush. Also, you don't want to wake up with lint all in your hair.

I guess they are okay for a guest bed or your up north cottage but I would not buy them again for everyday use..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I should have realized that when the price is too good to be true, there is a reason. It's not that these are bad sheets, it's that they are bad FLANNEL sheets. I'm not sure what the '135-Gram' applies to - 454 grams equal one pound, so that's about a third of a pound, and the set of sheets weighs more than that. They'll be OK for regular sheets, but I wanted warm, cozy sheets, and these won't fit that bill.

I found the jokes more disturbing then sad as the movie progressed. This is a very adult film, not something any age kid should be watching. From the hardcore porn playing in the backround, to the full frontal nudity. Somehow watching a old guy getting blown up with all the kids watching was supposed to be funny.I found my self feeling bad for the kids being in a film like this.They take the shock value we see in movies like, wedding crashers oldschool and dodgeball. Then they put it in a movie with a bunch of little kids. Instead of adding in some funny inendo, or word plays, like the other films. They show hardcore porn, nudity, and really disturbing behavior.There is a line between funny, and WTF. They stayed firmly on the WTF side the entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh No!","review":"My 6 months old child starts to cry when this CD starts to play.

It seems they focus more on traditional love poetry mostly from England. There are many famous love poems included in this collection.My dad was looking for a book on love poems, and I saw this and figured it would be a nice book to have for that.

It was okay at first because i didn't know much about taking care of a tank, but now i know better. There is a lot of cleaning, making sure all the waste is gone. But it gets really annoying when your tank filter is full of the waste. There's many places you can't even get to, you just have to trust that you got all of it. If you own any animal, you know you probably didn't get it all but it's best you get most of it. The tank i have right now is way better. You really only have to rinse it and change the filter every month. It lasts a lot longer than this one. I had to change the filter every week and even than it didn't seem to help.

It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish Killer","review":"I purchased a tank 6 days ago that had a smaller version of this same designed filter. This was a replacement home for a fish that my girlfriends kid won at the fair. The flaws are the intake holes are too small for how much water is drawn in by the pump and that creates strong suction. The fish swam too close to the water inlet of the filter and got sucked right to it.The suction was so strong that it held the fish there and ripped the tail off the fish. I hurried up and unplugged the filter. The fish swam a little bit and sat on the bottom. I was going to return the tank the next day and get something a little safer for the fish. I rechecked the fish later only to find it died. I would not recommend this filter for anyone. It is unsafe to use with fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought this filter to go into a turtle tank. The design suggested that it would be suitable for this application. I have also had good experiences with other Whisper filters I've owned in the past. I have not been putting up with it for about 1.5-2 months. I loath this filther. First, the suctions cups don't stay on so the filter continuously falls into the tank. There should also be at least 4 suction cups. Having 2 placed in the center of the filter means it rocks back and forth and is not secure. Second, the bracket you can use in place of the top suction cup doesn't fit on the lip of my tank. So again, it keeps falling into the tank. If I can't return it because it's been used I may actually just throw it away. If you're looking for a good internal filter check out Ovation or Fluval.

His long standing, playful musical relationship with Will Lee really comes through on these tracks. Lee, of course, is arguably the finest bass player recording today. (Watching them jump up and down on stage is a must see).
