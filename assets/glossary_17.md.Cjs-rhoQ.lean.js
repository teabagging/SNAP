That's why a lot of these older shows get caught up in limbo, legal fights over royalties, and the way some of the contracts were written back then, one person can hold out for whatever they think they can get.

A normal TV show DVD colection comes out in FULL SEASON and you can always get it for under $30 to start. So by the time the second half of this comes out we will have to pay $50 plus to get all of season one! Lets hope the following seasons come out in full.

And God only knows when you will decide to release seaon one, vol. 2 and how long it will take to release the rest of the 9 seasons this series ran. Where are the extras?? All you included was promos for each episode and not even a cast comentary on at least one or two episodes. Also why weren't the three pilots for this series included?

I think I'll wait for the full Love Boat season 1 before I purchase it.My advice, unless you want to spend double the money, skip the half season and wait for the full season.

They either sat speechless at saloon tables or spent the better part of the hour listening to some ridiculouus saloon girls sing and dance about the west.

Although Jacque was asleep when it arrived (he spends 14-18 hours a day asleep and only really gets up around the hours of dawn and dusk...as most ferrets are prone to do), once he awoke, he was quite surprised. In fact, I would describe his reaction as \\"knocked for six.\\"The only problem I found is that this hat is not really \\"one size fits all\\".

Like most women of their generation, their choices were extremely limited.While this book is part of the excellent Polish and Polish-American Studies Series from Ohio University Press, there is barely any mention of the girls' ethnicity outside of their last name. I was expecting much more information on the girls' connection with their Polish heritage. While this is an interesting account of the last stand of the pre-feminist era, ethnicity doesn't even play a minor role. For those who thought it would, especially given the book's inclusion in the Polish and Polish-American Studies Series, The Grasinski Girls is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"home owner","review":"The product did nothing to help my fish lice problem in my 3000 gallon pond. the instructions are not clear or accurate.

In its three incarnations as animation, I always found the 60's original superior where the best characters were introduced...Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Molecule Man.

To Marvel's credit.. they did improve it.The 2nd season (which contiues from the 1st) is GREAT. The animation, voice acting and stories make a dramatic improvement. It was much better developed than X-Men and Spiderman of the 90's. I would LOVE to see it put to DVD. I would buy it.

The TV show was nearly unwatchable. Why didn't they just issue some videos based on the 1967 Hanna Barbara Fantastic Four series that is occasionally shown on Cartoon Network? At least the old series had great voice actors and adapted the good comic book stories. This version of the Fantastic Four is an insult to the existing fan base, and an insult to the intelligence of any new audience. Yecch!

Sadly, they'll never get to it because the first season episode will NEVER sell.

(Fortunately, with them, you don't pay until THEY find!!!) Anyway, my reunion was more than I could have hoped for and am pleased to have a good relationship with my birthmother.The stories in this book were very interesting but this book is hardly an in-depth, insightful look at the emotional roller coaster of search and reunion. I found it quite shallow when it came to dealing with the gut level feelings of the members of the adoption triad. All I can say is that these stories could have been condensed and published in Reader's Digest, which I also find skims the surface in their articles. I would not recommend this book at all as a major resource for searching adoptees or birthparents.... This was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"sales pitch for \\"reuniting\\" company","review":"I ordered this book just recently and found it to be an \\"infomercial\\" for the company who published it.

Once I realized who published it, I felt taken to have paid money for this book and truly doubted the honesty of the stories. Don't waste your money on this one.

My entire view of suicide has changed due to reading this book. It explains with scientific precision why people arrive at suicide and how to help them in ways that will have a positive effect. So much of the literature explains suicide as a choice and blames the victim for being weak or somehow different from the averge person. This book gets to the heart of why people commit suicide and shows how prevailing views can actually make the victims burden greater at a time when they should be understood and helped.

Some nights its comfortable, some nights its too hard. This is after sleeping on it for a month. I also have to flip it daily as the springs shift a little. And if you buy this you will need a JUMBO pillow case.January 31, 2013 now and I like the pillow even less. Too hard. Sometimes the springs feel like I'm sleeping on a brick.

It was just getting a little soft for my taste. I was all excited when I saw these. I am very disappointed in these pillows. These have a gusset in them whereas the original one did not. This pillow is TOO soft and squishy. If you push hard enough in the very center, you can feel the coils but they are not big enough inside and they used too much padding around the edges to fill up space. I have to fold the edges under so that my head can hit some of the harder stuff closer to the middle otherwise it flattens out too much and it is worse than an old feather pillow. If you have older pillows like this, do not waste your money thinking they are going to be the same as what you have. They are totally nothing like what you are used to sleeping on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original pocket Coil pillows were THE BEST!","review":"I agree with at least other two reviewers who said that the original version of this pillow was better.

I bought two new pocket coil pillows in March (2009) and already in Sept 2009, the pillows are worn out. The current version of the Beautyrest pocket coil pillows is of poor quality and probably explains why they are on clearance.

They are made in China with inferior materials. They are NOT extra firm as advertised.All of quality control at Beautyrest should be terminated for allowing the manufacture and sale of such inferior quality goods.I originally bought these pillows 2 years ago and they were of the highest quality. I just received 2 new pillows in early June of 2009 and they are pathetic.There is hardly any stuffing in these pillows so they are practically flat to begin with and a Queen size pillow is the size of a standard size pillow. The pocketed coil in the middle is much smaller now than it was previous.Everything made in China is of shoddy material and craftmanship. Beautyrest STOP having your pillows made in China!!!

It might work for some people, but this was the worst pillow I ever tried sleeping on. I went to Macy's and bought a pillow last night for around the same price that is perfect for me.

Knight wears his victimization on his sleeve and his chip on his shoulder. \\"Cry Lonely\\" would more aptly be named, \\"You Won't Have Me to Kick Around Any More, Then You'll Be Sorry.\\" \\"Enough Rope\\" is decidedly anti-woman, and as a woman I resent that. I was told by a male friend that only guys could relate to Chris Knight; I think only whiny, angry guys can relate. Maybe that's why he's not more popular. Having tried to listen to him over and again, I'm pretty sure that I don't want to spend my time being that depressed. Life to is too short and too good to waste it listening to Chris Knight's fatalism.

This movie has an interesting premise but doesn't fully develop into a well-rounded plot. I blame the writer for that. The talent is there-- Mindy Cohn is excellent as is Julie Bowen (good to see her early stuff), Winona Ryder. However, Simon Baker steals the show with his rather tongue-in-cheek performance. I can see how it would be easy to over-play his character but Baker holds back and let's us see him slowly unravel. For being a \\"heart throb\\" so to speak, Baker is a talented actor and its a joy to see him perform. I suppose he could be considered the thinking woman's sex-symbol.Overall, I liked the movie. Its fun to watch on a rainy Saturday especially if you're a Baker fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very uneven","review":"Bought it, saw it, not impressed.

Roderick Blank gets that information but unfortunately, his fiance is pretty low on the list of 101... and he soon turns into the quintessential ladies man with one hot young babe after another since he knows who is a sure thing now. Of course when he runs into a serial killer with the moniker of Death Nell you'd think he'd rethink his strategy.I really didn't care for this movie and probably would have turned it off about half way through but I like the lead actor, Simon Baker. He just seems horribly miscast and unbelievable. The film oftens veers off into sophomoric humor, which normally I like, but it didn't even do base comedy well. One of the highlights of this mostly unfunny film is \\"Facts of Life\\" alum Mindy Cohn as Rod's secretary.

Only one thing lurks 'Death Nell' (Winona Ryder) a mysterious femme fatale who becomes an urban folk hero targeting men guilty of sex crimes against women.

The product is fine but my first one developed a leak in the outlet arm. I have an external water filter attached to it which pressurizes the arm and a pin hole leak started and sprayed the window behind. It was an obvious manufacturing flaw but I could not find the receipt to get it replaced. The replacement arm was more than 60% of the cost new so I went new again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and rewarding - Highly recommended","review":"This singer is young and beautiful, but she got a record contract because she can sing and write songs. Her lyrics and singing style seem to come from an \\"old soul,\\" someone who understands beyond her years. Her music is relevant to a much broader range of fans than the teeny bopper girls. I am a fan of female singer-songwriters like Cheryl Wheeler and Mary Chapin Carpenter. I rarely find someone who can sing as well as they can write. Cheers to Colbie Caillat for putting out an enjoyable, thought provoking CD and for having a beautiful voice to go with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colbie Caillat ROCKS!!","review":"This CD is wonderful!

Everyone in this home from 12 to 50's loves this CD. Pretty voice and a refreshing sound that soothes yet leaves one feeling good all over. We just received it yesterday, and it went on replay immediately after it was over.A pleasant little surprise for us was the inside of the CD with pictures of our own Hanalei pier and Hanalei beach! I just knew there was something special about this young lady! Get this CD - it will make you feel like you are in paradise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy music","review":"If you like bubblegum pop, this is the music for you. If you, like myself, don't care for mainstream music--but the song \\"Bubbly\\" appealed to you--spend your money elsewhere. I was disappointed by this CD. I'm glad I got it on sale, otherwise I'd be more upset about the purchase than I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my FAVS!! Gotta listen to the feelings she expresses.","review":"The first song I heard on the radio by Colbie was Bubbly and it touched a very special place at that time in my life. Someone very special who made ME feel that way. So, then I started listening to some of her other music and I really enjoy the mellow, adult alternative groovy kinda style. I'm in my 30's, so I don't want that bubble gum pop on the radio, but I do enjoy a WIDE range of genres and she seems to capture a bit of pop, country, folk, alternative, groovy, just make u feel happy inside! Giver her a good listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So relaxing","review":"I can listen to this over and over. When you are in a bad mood, put this on because after a few tracks you are so free from everything.

This is a great CD...perfect easy listening summertime music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked Bubbly, bought the cd, but...","review":"I bought this cd after liking her hit, Bubbly. On first listening to the cd, I thought it was pretty good. But after listening through a few more times, although I like some of the lyrics(though some of them are the 'complaining girl in a relationship' which are deathly annoying), but the music is TERRIBLE.At first impression, as many have said, it reminds you a little of Jack Johnson, but when you compare the two, Jack Johnson beats the music on this cd by a landslide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't walk, run away from this album","review":"Just about every song on this album sounds the same as the last one. As several reviewers have pointed out, this album is repetitive and uninspiring. If I have to listen to Bubbly being played yet one more time on the radio, I think I'm going to scream. I found this album has very few redeeming qualities and don't understand what all the fuss is about. I would definitely recommend Sara Barellis if you're looking for a fresh, new break-out artist. Coco is lacking substance, style and soul. Save your money for a better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday gift","review":"I sent this to my sister as her birthday gift she loved it and her and her children enjoy Colbie's music together as a family cd it arrived on her birthday it was great timming"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar puff","review":"Definitely a fun breezy music, but soon all the songs pretty much sound the same and I wished maybe I just bought the radio hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is wonderful!","review":"I've seen her in person a few times and she is amazing. I love singer song writers when they get it right and Colbie gets it right. She has this effortless style that is a mixture of Sade, Cheryl Crow and James Taylor. Weird I know but I never get tired of listening to each and every song. I have picky taste when it comes to what I will allow on my iPhone. I have to love it. I can tell you this whole CD is on my iPhone."},{"rating":"2","title":"New fan","review":"Great album...great to listen to when you need to relax while at the same time being very enjoyable, hard to choose a favorite song, but its going to have to be Tailor Made. Wonderful album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coco is, well... Caca","review":"The repetitive dronings of a mildly talented cabaret singer has never quite done it for me and this is no exception. Song after song is just plain... plain. There's something to be said for going against the trend of Lady Gaga-esque pseudo-cool donkey-pop, but unfortunately this isn't going to give you anything to inspire, nor to dwell on. It's as bland as a grey wall, in a grey house, on a grey street, on a grey day. The idea that it's light and breezy or mildly original sounds like the reviewing of ex-college-wallflowers who have found a young champion for their insipid lives. Myspace is where she emerged, like a little turtle-head 'tween the cheeks of an unhealthy adolescent, and Myspace is where she should have stayed, unlike the Kate Nash's and Feists of this world.If I had to sum up this type of 'artist' in a word, the word would be - turgid.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring singer/songwriter.","review":"Coco by Colbie Caillat is a bland and uninspired disc. Colbie has a decent voice but there is no power in it, I was expecting so much more from this young artist but this album is not a standout. All the songs sound the same, boring vocals and clumsy guitar playing. Bubbly and Realize make me want to fall asleep. If you want an exciting new artist then I suggest Sara Bareilles, at least her voice and music won't make you comatose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar!","review":"This cd is great!

Both my daughter & I agree, this is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'd never heard of Coblie Caillat before, but I noticed her CD on dispay at Target's breakout artists section and was curious. I listened to some clips and decided to go ahead and buy it, but after I took it home and listened to it I was disappointed. However, the reasons I was disappointed by it may be the reaons other people find it attractive. It was very mellow, but I felt it was mellow in a flat sort of way. There just doesn't seem to be any depth or complexity to it or any real emotion. The lyrics were very predictable and repetitive. Perhaps this album is good to have on in the background when relaxing, but it's not something I enjoy when giving it my full attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I have really tried to like this album but I get bored every time I listen to it. Ms. Calliat's songs are as forgettable as her voice. I'm not sure why so many people are so crazy about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song on the CD is a winner!","review":"This is a beautiful cd. Colbie Caillat sings from her heart in a very sweet relaxing way. Her songs remind me a little bit of the style of Jewel, very folksy and warm and personal. Colbie Caillat is a definite winner in the music industry. I LOVE the song Bubbly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"I have listened to this CD over and over again since purchasing it several weeks ago. I can't say that about many CD's these days. Although \\"Breezy\\" is probably the most well known of the songs, I found that I liked \\"Oxygen\\", \\"Feelings Show\\" and \\"Midnight Bottle\\" even more.A very impressive debut for this 23 year old lady. We will definitely being hearing more from her -- count on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Truly a great first-effort CD.

A little detail would help in decision making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Exciting","review":"I liked this book a little because it showed me how a girl, about twelve years old, lived in the middle 1800's. It has a slight glimps of social history and how she felt about the borning room. I would recommend this book to those who like books which the setting takes place in the 1800's. I rate this book a two because a lot of parts I couldn't understand, and it was very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this book at all!!!","review":"This book was on my eighth grade reading list, so I read it, and was disgusted by it. First of all, the book has NO STORY! it's so dull, that it put me to sleep. a bunch of events happend, like people dieing and babies being born, but it seemed as though all of those scenes were similar, if not the same. they weren't connected in any way that was interesting, it was just like a series of tedious events with no connections whatsoever. I do not recommend it for anyone really, except for maybe younger kids, because it was written at such a begginer level, with such a basic style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"In the fifth grade my teacher (you know who you are)told us that we would be reading a book caled the BORNING ROOM.\\"This sounds like a cool book .\\" I remember saying to myself.I thouht it would be a very good book because my teacher had picked great books for us to read such as the DOLLHOUSE MURDERS.Well,I was wrong.Every one in the class called it the \\"boring room.\\" Once you read this ,you'll see why .If your the type of person who likes to play with thier pet fish on the weekends...this book is great for you.

If you enjoy the soft sounds of having an exhaust pipe of a 71' Nova belch in your ear, then you will love this album. It is worth a good laugh, for as soon as I listened to it I busted out cackeling. They say Ozzy loved this band, and since he is half deaf that is completely understandable. Go buy a good doom metal album, like Cathedral's new release: The Viith Coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh-oh","review":"I seen these guys live, not a kid, just too lazy to create an account. The guitar, bass and drums were rumbling like a freight-train. I was ready for the singer to start howling like so many of the other great stoner/sludge bands but then it happened. The vocalists opened his mouth and all I heard was grrr-rooooraoora-grrrr. Come on man the death metal thing has died. It's plenty heavy, the music is great but the singing kills it. I'll go listen to Orange Goblin, Fu Manchu, Nebula, I may find a use for High on Fire but it will probably be when I am pushing some weights. Outside of that it is too grrrro oorrrror arrra for any other use."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNA PORQUERIA, IN ENGLISH THAT MEANS....","review":"Well, I read a few reviews, listened to the samples here on Amazon, and bought the cd. My God! Awful isnt word enough to describe this. Ok, the songs alone are ok, but when you listen to the whole cd, is when you realize that those guys doesnt know many chords, and that all the songs sound the same (a few variations), and that the vocals ARE all the same, well, you have a patetic album. Very weak, very boring, nothing new. They could do better, the lyrics are ok, but they need help, like, music lessons, even better, composition lessons. Is really bad when all the songs in your album are identical. My fellow metalheads, rockers, whatever name you want, DO NOT buy this, get a friend to loan it to you, then if you still want it, well, is your $$. But if you want real music, get Death, or Rush, hey, even Green Day is better option. In the end, High on Fire should be left for begginers in the metal world of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't know what you're talking about, shut the h*ll up!","review":"First of all, if you have even ONE Green Day song in your collection, even by accident, (I'm looking at you \\"IJ\\" from Puerto Rico) you are beyond help and have zero credibility when it comes to reviewing a metal album, or any album for that matter. Secondly, if you don't know what a death metal growl sounds like, please don't use the term, mmkay? Are the vocals sludgy? Yes. Is it death metal? No way.This album will punch you in the face and make you love it. Pop it in, turn it up and watch it suplex you through your coffee table. This album has actually murdered other inferior albums in my collection - it's just that hardcore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grinding Thunder","review":"Wow, this CD seems to anger some people! I'm not sure why. It is a bit muddy, but guess what, that is by design! This is mid tempo pounding metal. I'm not going to say the lyrics are great; I'm not sure what they are talking about. But I will tell you this - it is pounding metal. It does take a couple of listens to absorb. The drumming is unbelievable. I think the fact that it is not traditional thrash, and also is not death metal, that leaves some people wondering what the he!! it is. And that is what makes it great. If you don't bash your head into a bloody pulp listening to this it is because, in my humble opinion, you just didn't give it a good four or five listens. I've got a buddy who just swore he hated this. Then, about six listens later he couldn't stop. Give this a chance, it will bust your head!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK...","review":"I haven't seen this video, but I have seen the original airing of the first three episodes this tape contains. But know this, this isn't the Power Rangers you might expect. When the series debuted in 1993, it drew the attention of the public because of its fast pace, uniqueness and likable characters. But, despite all that, it was really a kid's show. This fact was vagued with this incarnation of the series.When Power Rangers:Lost Galaxy debuted in 1999, it had a diferent look. It seemed more mature. Yes, the flash and extreme pacing of action was still there, but a sense of a more adult storyline followed suit. Decent storytelling along with a semi-solid science-fiction background, caused this series to be quite enjoyable. In short, this version of the series finaly forced a seven year franchise to grow up a little. With a little open-mindness, adults might discover this tape/series to be a very enjoyable guilty pleasure for themselves and kids alike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quasar Quest","review":"Of all the Power Rangers seasons, Lost Galaxy is my favorite. I was really disapointed that they couldn't release the last 4 episodes on VHS or DVD. Power Rangers has been on for nearly 12 years. The first 2 years it was Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the 3rd season half of it was Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the last half was Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers. Then it became Power Rangers Zeo, then Power Rangers Tubro, Power Rangers in Space was after that, this video is from Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, then it was Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, then Power Rangers Time Force, then Power Rangers Wild Force, now Power Rangers Ninja Storm. Next year will likely be called either Power Rangers Dino Rage or Dino Thunder, something that has to do with dinosours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning for the show!","review":"The video is actually the first three episodes of the current incarnation of Power Rangers...

His style is very readable and the photos and illustrations compliment the written material very well. Detailed information on plant descriptions, cultivation, propagation and recommended cultivars. His vivid plant descriptions are enough to make your mouth water, and he has purposely focused on fruits that are relatively low maintenance and disease free. Plants also vary in size, so there are options for those who use containers to those who have room for full grown trees. I enjoyed the book very much, and look forward to adding many of these plants to our homestead."},{"rating":"1","title":"too technical","review":"this book is way too technical for the common or hobby gardener. i didnt like it. there are a lot better books out there, look for those and leave this one in the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"edible landscape","review":"Mr Reich presents loads of plant suggestions along with the growth habits of some neat plants that I wouldn't ordinarily try.

So I had a look at this book and the problem is obvious: no prefaces! Shaw's plays are meant to be read with his prefaces and they shouldn't be separated. Shaw himself intentionally wrote in that mode, noting at one point, \\"I would give six of the plays that Shakespeare did write for one of the prefaces he ought to have written.\\" That's a little extreme, but the point is taken, and I believe that the general reasoning is valid. Shaw's complete plays with prefaces run to six volumes or so. Take that kind of route if you can; you'll be well rewarded with edification and entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaw is hilariously one of the most thoughtful playwrites","review":"I think that Shaw is generally misread in this part of the twentieth century. In particular, Too Good to be True, is highly outdated, and therefore highly incomprehensible. That makes it even funnier, and more enjoyable to think about. In every one of these plays, Shaw more or less, in different ways, concludes that the world is coming to an end. The death in the Doctors Dilema, the Dynamite in Major Barbara, The depression and outright declaration that \\"The world...is falling down, down, into the abyss\\" in Too Good to be True, and the war and sort of joke of war in Saint Joan, not to mention the portrayal of a Saint, all relate to that dire, but humorous topic. I especially recommend Too Good to be True. Featuring a measles microbe and the Union of Socially Federated States, this is an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his \\"Saint Joan\\" did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a \\"rebel\\" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like I was at a really bad women's retreat","review":"I've never been to a women's retreat (I'm a man), but from what women have told me, this book pretty well resembled a really bad one.

I understand that emotions are important and part of how God has made us, but she made so many baseless assertions about how we \\"overuse\\" our brains in the West that I wanted to throw this book in the trash. If I didn't have to read this for class, I would have.Her chapter on the Bible really bothered me - she talked about how we shouldn't think about what Scripture means (we think about stuff too much in the West anyways!)...we should just repeat phrases from it over and over again until we have some kind of emotional experience.

If you like the race games you must have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"The game isn't really that cool. But, the racing part is. I was looking forward to some accident scenes. But overall, it's OK. I think Need for speed Hot Pursuit might be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Racer for PS3 to Date","review":"I was a big fan of NFSMW. NFSC is the best racer available for PS3 right now.Pros: Tons of customization options. Challenging canyon races, go off the edge and the race is over. Tons of unlockables. Drift challenges are new, fun, and very challenging.Cons: Police pursuits have been made easier than in Most Wanted, and pursuits are no longer mandatory challenges to complete. All races are at night, although, there are seldom changes in weather (ie. rain). Graphics have improved from Most Wanted, but could be better considering it's PS3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"Very fun and good graphics. My only complaint is that I played it so much in the past 2 weeks I've already finished my career.

I didn't mind having team mates that were useless and didn't mind bias cops, but some of these races just don't make sense. I was hoping for more reason to do free roaming, but you can jump to any location which makes me lazy. The upgrades are to cheap and to easy to get. Overall this is a fun game but I really think its boring to vs the same people you just beat in the last stage yet they are like good all of a sudden. Plus I haven't played every NFS game but these chasing the person to get points is stupid to me. I have never seen it and just think it is plain bad. I like racing to be honest not tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet..Need 4 Speed","review":"I absolutely love this Need for Speed!

The drift races are ok but pretty easy to fake after a little practice, the crew option is pretty useless and most of all the game difficulty and length is tragic. beat the entire game over the course of a week of casual gameplay. the only redeeming aspect is quality of the cinematics (not including the acting). I wish I bought ridge racer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What COULD have been the best Need For Speed...","review":"As far as gameplay, this game delivers on several platforms really pushing the player to their arcade racing abilities. this could have been the best Need For Speed ever but there are several aspects that started to annoy me. the first thing is that when you actually do finish the game, even 100%, you do not get the then named Audi LeMans Quattro (R8), you don't even get to choose any prizes from the \\"boss\\" at the end like everyone else! there are also cars and objects that you HAVE to play online games to get! one of my main arguements against this game is that once a race is over the prize money DRAMATICALLY reduces! this makes it next to impossible to buy a new car....actually it just takes FOR-EV-ER! this game has next to no replay value whatsoever. as much fun as this game is once you DO fully modify a super car, it ends pretty much directly after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I ordered this calender when it had no description of the product with hopes that it would suit my needs. It did not, in fact I am returning it. I had no idea it would be so religious. Every page is covered in stictly Christian themes and Bible verses.

They looked like the Benton's maple creme cookies I had gotten in the fall at the grocery store. I thought maybe another company was making them. They are fair. The frosting is tan not white; it is in the very middle of the cookie (a little bigger than a quarter dollop); the frosting taste is good but it is 1/4 to 1/2 in. from the edges of the cookie; the cookie itself is bland and tastes cheap ( shortening wise I'm not sure how to explain it). The only reason I gave them 2 stars rather than 1 is the taste of the frosting is good, what little there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, over priced","review":"These are truly delightful cookies, but happily they are not addictive because this manufacturer (family owned or not) is pricing themselves right out of existence. In 2005, one could find them for less than $17/12 pack. In June of 2010, I bought them from Amazon for about $32 for a 12 pack. Now (Sept 2010) they are listed here at essentially $60 for the 12 pack. Almost a 4x increase in price in 5 years and doubling in a few months is beyond the pale. They've become a caviar that I will live without.9/10/2010 - to be fair to the company, the huge delta on price is because Amazon no longer carries this item but it is now through a seller. I discovered a local supermarket will provide them at $32.50 for 12. Dare Co is not culpable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookie and cream separation","review":"My only complaint is that the cookies I ordered on June 19, 2010 are separated from the cream. I love the taste, but I have to piece together the cookie with the cream in order to eat it. One side of the cream is attached to a cookie and the other side is not. I shouldn't have to piece the cookie together in order to eat it. This may have been the result of a bad batch of cookies, or perhaps occurred during shipping--in any case, I am reluctant to re-order them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dare cookies[Maple leaf]","review":"The cookies are out-standing,made in Canada.

They are not full of creamy white filling. The filling is dark and very thin, no where near the edge of the cookie. The maple smell and flavor is very light. No real maple taste either. I bought these after the Dollar Tree quit selling the REAL original Manning's Cookie Shop Maple Leaf Creme Cookies. These are about like the cheap knockoffs that Interbake Foods produces and sold for a short time at the D.T. These were packaged excellent. Processing was very slow. 8 days for processing, 2 for shipping. ALSO had attempted fraud problems with my c.c. after this order.

Hulk's better (and I'm not saying that just because I'm biased). These cartoons are boring. The only funny thing about them is that, unlike the comic book, the animators tried to make the atmosphere more watery: air bubbles constantly being emitted every time a character speaks and dorky 3rd grade schooler fish which cut across the screen at the most dramatic moments. This is not good storytelling, not good presenting, not good animation. But if you like water, I mean really like water, you might like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy, Unit has a design flaw","review":"I bought this unit with high expections as it was rated very well in multiple sources including Consumer Reports.

The only negative is that it does smell like Old Spice Cologne from the 80s. I use this product on my hair when it's wet, and also daily when it's dry. I use it usually before bed (a dime sized amount), then before styling it in the morning. The product does not cause any build up in my hair, which is a plus, and it is very lightweight. If hair serums are too oily or heavy for your use, this may be a great alternative for you. Also if you have TIGI Bedhead in After Party, I would pass on this product since I get the same results using that product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Chi","review":"The order itself arrived at the estimated time,packing was perfect but...the downside was the product itself.

When my hair is washed it gets very kinky and not easy to get a comb through. I apply a small amount in my palm and infuse it from the roots out, what a difference chi has made. Now I can't wash my hair again without it. This stuff detangles and has almost eliminated breakage. I use to have clumps of hair in my comb now I have to brush small amounts of hair from my shoulders. I am sure with continued use I'll have no breakage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Fine at First...","review":"For the first few weeks or so of using this product, I was really pleased with the results. After a while, it left so much build-up on everything I used... My flat iron had a disgusting brown film around the edges and even my hair started feeling dirty...

Well, I stopped using it at the begining of the summer then purchased it again because my hair was in bad condition (dryness). So, all pumped up and excited to get back to it, I exprienced the biggest disappointment. I realized it was drying out my hair and didnt give it any shine even after flat iron.

It looks like a natural product in the hands, without chemical textures or synthetic appearance. I like the way it feels on my skin, similar to the sensation of rubbing a mixture of delicate oils and fruit on my face. It cleanses thoroughly removing makeup and sunblock lotion. It doesn't strip my skin dry and instead leaves a nice moisture after wash. The only drawback is the scent-- it smells more like old marmalade rather than a fresh squeeze of orange, more stale than I prefer. Overall a good, natural cleanser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine, but wish it also addressed acne prone skin","review":"I am a BzzAgent & received a full-size Burt's Bees Sensitive Skin Facial cleanser to try & review. My skin definitely felt softer & less dry from using it for several days. As a cream cleanser, it is a little harder to wash off & definitely feels different from other types of cleansers. I actually enjoyed it, until my skin started breaking out in cystic acne. My skin is sensitive to products so I do have to be careful with what I use on my skin as I experience itchiness, redness or dryness.

But when i used the astringent soaked cotton pad to wipe my face after cleansing my face, there was makeup residue on the cotton pad.

This product, not so much.With the orange oil in it, it smells fabulous. But it feels awful. The stuff is thick and waxy, not creamy at all. It's kind of hard to smear around on the skin without majorly stretching the skin because it's so thick and stiff. I could, perhaps, overlook that if it seemed to rinse clear, but it doesn't. It feels just like you'd expect after smearing wax all over your face - like you can't rinse it off because water just runs off of it.I found it to be very much not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - Reasonable price!","review":"I have had the privilege to try this Facial Cleanser for my Person opinion provided by BzzAgent.com. I was so excited to get my Kit to try Burt's Bees Products. I have never Tried any of Burt's Bees Products so this review was even more exciting for me. I have extremely sensitive skin so I'm very picky on what products I use on my face. The day the Burt's Bees Box arrived I used the Facial cleanser. I have used it now for a week. So far I have noticed softer skin, less redness and my skin just looks better. My pores are smaller and the skin looks brighter. Overall, I am very pleased with the products in the Burt's Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin line. I found Burt's Bees to offer high quality products at reasonable prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I hated this product. First of all, this product is super hard to rinse off your face. It is really thick. Once finally getting this stuff off my face, my face felt unclean, like there was a film still on it.

I am especially fond of natural products, which has catered to my pickiness, given there had not been many of these products to choose from while growing up. I would have to say that finding this product absolutely came at the right time as my age is getting to a point where I probably shouldn't disregard a skin-care routine any longer. After having tried the cleanser and moisturizer every morning for the past week, I think i have found a product I can stick with for the long-term. It caters to my needs, without too many harsh ingredients affecting seemingly virgin skin. If you are reading this and find what I have said resounding with you, then this product is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick Cleansing Product","review":"I received this product to test from bzz agent. My skin seems be sensitive to products with heavy fragrance. I found this product to be pleasantly thick while stripping off make up without leaving your skin dry. It has a very light scent, not offensive or long lasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Burt's Bees, but not this cleanser","review":"In general, I'm a fan of Burt's Bees products, and I have sensitive skin, so I was really excited to try this product as a BzzAgent (I received a complimentary sample as a BzzAgent). The Natural Skin Solutions Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser is a cream cleanser - it's soap-free and non-foaming. Since I normally use a foaming cleanser (Olay Sensitive), this was a little hard to get used to. The texture of the product is nice and creamy, and it's fragrance free. It goes on nicely, but it seems hard to rinse. Since using it, I notice I'm getting more frequent breakouts. I can't say for certain that it's related to this cleanser, but the breakouts began within a couple of days of beginning to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I received this product along with the moisturizer through BuzzAgent to try and share my opinion. I was really excited to get it because I love Burt Bee's products. After giving it two weeks of use however, I had to call it quits. This is just not a good product. My first complaint is that the face wash is supposed to be sent free but yet smells like school glue and I found that bothersome. It seems to be thick coming out of the tube but did not cleanse my face at all, leaving a residue behind with the make up it failed to remove. Also the moisturizer does not soak in to your skin but only stays on top of it until it eventually dries. After a two weeks and a few break outs I just can't continue to use this product. I really did want to like it and I hope that they can improve on it for the future, but I think I will be sticking to my usual face wash and moisturizer for now. Now, Burt Bee's lip balms and hand lotions? I will always be a loyal fan of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Burts Bees","review":"My first complaint about this product is the smell of the cleanser! Phew, I know there have to be some natural products they can put in to make the smell a bit better. My second complaint it the packaging. Whenever I just try to squeeze out just a little, enough comes out to wash my whole body!!! For the price I wouldn't want to waste that much (even though I did receive this as a sample. The plus sides: My skin did not react to the cleanser or the moisturizer. In fact, I haven't had a break out since I started using it. I just have to decide if that's worth the smell and waste of product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I received this product free as a BuzzAgent. I used it for 3 days and had to quit using it. It made my skin feel unclean and dull. After the second day my skin started becoming irritated and itchy. I like that the ingredients are natural and that it is made by a brand that I love, but it just didn't work for me. I noticed it didn't remove makeup as well as other face cleansers. Overall this was a huge letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural, and didn't break me out...","review":"I'm currently on topical acne meds so my skin is super sensitive and I cannot use my usual glycolic cleanser. I received Burts Bees sensitive Facial Cleaser because I'm a BzzAgent, and it came at the right time. I needed a moisturizing cleanser and I prefer using natural products on my skin and hair when possible. I didn't experience burning like I did with the Neutrogena Naturals products, and being on a differin/duac cocktail my skin tends to need the extra moisture that this provides. I haven't use it as to remove makeup however, it does cleanse the residual makeup left after I use a makeup removal wipe. Doesn't lather up, and because its soap free don't expect that tight \\"clean\\" (stripped) feeling you'd feel with cleansers that contain soap. Overall, I'd recommend this for someone who needs a cleanser that moisturizes and doesn't need that stripped feeling that comes with using soap based products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a cleanser that works!","review":"After almost a month of using Burt's Bees Sensitive Facial cleanser and moisturizer for sensitive skin, I can truly say that my skin has changed for the better. These products leave my skin fresh, clean and moisturized unlike other products that actually cause breakouts and irritation. My skin feels and looks softer. The scent is light and clean and the natural ingredients make me feel like I'm doing something healthy for my skin. I am now a big fan of the Burt's Bees line for sensitive skin. These products were sent to me for evaluation through a BZZ Campaign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't remove all my makeup","review":"I have oily, sensitive skin and I wear foundation every day. Olay Foaming Face Wash for sensitive skin has worked well for me for the past few years, but I have been wanting to try something more natural. I already use Burt's Bees toner, and I was given a chance to try this Burt's Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser for free through BzzAgent. This is not a foaming cleanser; it's more of a creamy consistency. I like the fact that it's fragrance free and has natural ingredients, but this just doesn't remove all my makeup. It doesn't seem to do much more than water alone. It does seem very moisturizing, and could be a good choice for someone with dry skin or who doesn't wear makeup, but it does not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new scences","review":"I have all Michael's videos, I have all Bulls videos..and I thought this one would be different. Maybe the last video we'll ever see about Michael and this dinasty, and the did it with all scences from past videos. Ive seen all before! , nothing new? scences from air time, playground, bulls videos, come fly with me, above and beyond..nothing new!

Michael has been this unique human being. Extremely successful, a perfect role model, a family man and a continuous inspiration for people all over the world. When you look at the young potentially great players coming out of college and not living up to the expectations because money overwhelmed their competitive instinct you wonder how did he maintain his desire for such a long time. The NBA will never be the same. Thank you Michael for wonderful memories.Mondher"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the most Outstanding and unforgettable sports video","review":"This video features a complete summary that documents Air Jordan's remarkable NBA career which I think nobody will ever achieve.

Do not waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight Night fo sho","review":"Fight Night is definitely a game that not only amazes with it's graphics, but also it's game play. This boxing game takes the cream of the crop and is a must buy for boxing fans out there. The control scheme takes a little getting used to, but once you go a few rounds it will become second nature. I can't say enough about the graphics in this game and I know graphics alone does not make a game, but luckily the overall game is worth the purchase. This game definitely show cases early glimpses of what the PS3 can really do and makes me hopeful for future games on this powerful system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need some fun","review":"Well the story mode is pretty good you can create your own fighter, So thats always a plus, If you have friends and are looking for a game to beat each other, I would definately recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy hitter","review":"This game rocks! one of the best games ive played on the ps3, very addicting.

I don't know. they are 10 and 6. graphics are pretty cool, although golden boy didn't look like himself. they seem to play it once in awhile and the screen gets too dark and you can hardly see the guy your fighting against. If it were a great game the boys would be playing it all the time. I recommend to older kids"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"This is a pretty solid game overall. The graphics are pretty realistic, if you don't count the very fake looking spit. The game play is good and it keeps you on your feet most of the time. I prefer to play the career mode, but I did have a hard time getting the guy to look like me. I ve played numerous other EA Sports games and I was able to get the player to look very much like me. Definately a steal at $15"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great boxing game","review":"First as an avid gamer and MMA & boxing fan I really enjoyed this game. Playing career mode you can design your boxer, every feature and weightclass. The graphics are incredible. This is a must have for even a casual combat sports fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"this prize is too cheap for this game","review":"this is one of those games that you can play over and over again because its never the same and you never get bored of punching the hell out of people in this game. the graphics are as good as they can get in the ring and you cant beat the way they set up the controls its like you really need skills to fight in this game thats why its so fun if you know how to fight and counter punch but the only small fault in this game that i saw was that the people outside the ring are boxy and they all do the same movement but who cares whats going on out thier anyway thats why i gave this game 5 stars. i bought splinter cell for ps3 and it was one of the best games ive played but i beat it in 2 weeks so thats the end of playing that game..so that brings me to this conclusion: buy this game because you can play forever and youll never get bored of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOXING GAME SO FAR ON ANY CONSOLE.","review":"NOT 100% PERFECT BUT STILL THE BEST BOXING GAME OUT THERE,EA SPORTS NEED TO BUY THE RIGHTS TO IRON MIKE TYSON AND PUT HIM IN THE GAME,THAT WOULD BE EXCELLENT,ALSO DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW YOU GET THE PRESS CONFERENCES,AND THE TRASH TALKIN,AND FIGHTING AT WEIGH INS ETC, AS I HAVN,T DISCOVERED HOW TO GET THIS,INFORMATION ON THIS BY SOMEONE OUT THERE THAT KNOW HOW TO WOULD BE GREAT,CHEERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"First PS3 boxing experience a disaster","review":"Maybe I'm just a little too picky about my controls, but I found those used in this game to be needlessly complex and extremely difficult to use. While the graphics are very good, I found Fight Night Round 3 to be lacking in virtually all other respects. In the times I've played it I succeeded in little more than being a punching bag for the computer generated fighters. I generally consider myself to be pretty good at video games, but this was one I just couldn't master or even get into. Rent it before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Fun and enjoyable game, although I wish you didnt decline so quickly after reaching the top. One of the better boxing games around."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game sucks dont like","review":"THIS GAME SHOULD NEVER BEING MADE YOU CAN EVEN SEE YOURSELF AND YOU TRY HITTING YOU OPPONENT I DONT RECOMEND"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long load times kill it for me","review":"This is one of the finest boxing games available on the PS3, especially for the graphics and controls. The AI can be rewarding/challenging and you may find yourself picking up on some strategy early on. The 'build your fighter' option is highly customizable and the training can be as fun as the boxing.. kindof like a minigame.What destroys this game is the extremely long load times on the main menu and between fights. It's literally 4 or 5 seconds wait time, ever single time you move to another option in the main menu. This may not kill it for everyone, but I'd warn that you rent this game first to see if you can handle it.I've got Fight Night Round 4 now.. equally good gameplay but without the excessive load/wait times and it does seem to be a more straightforward, professional title over Round 3.-- you can get this game for $10-$15 used just about everywhere -- but I recommend that you use that money towards Round 4 if you have to have a boxing game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now wonder it is selling for 6 bucks","review":"This game is very poorly programmed. The judges make huge errors on the scoring and statistics. The announcer makes incorrect comments during the fight. The replays are completly the opposite of what the announcer is saying. The game keeps saying it can not connect yet all other games and internet work fine. There is no update system. The menu system is very unintuitive and boring. The music stinks unless you like rap. The controller is very difficult to master or sometimes does not do what it is suppose to. The load times are slow. The game has crashed my system a few times. I have still managed to have some fun so I gave it a very generous 3. I could have given more details but with all these flaws it would have been extremely long winded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fight night PS2 Vs PS3","review":"After owning Fight Night 3 for PS2 and playing it a lot, I did 6 career modes in different weights and losing it to a so called friend, I got the PS3 a few days ago and of course one of my favorite games was just there in the stand so I bought it for PS3.I cant believe how disappointed I am, the fighters take time to appear, like after you finish training, there are a lot of glitches, specially when you knock them down, in the store some times is difficult to read, red letters over red background.The only new things are the sweat of the fighters, the models that have tattoos, and new haircuts, and that is it.Save yourself some money and buy it for PS2 and play it on your ps3 you will have a better experience.The game is excellent for PS2 standards for ps3 not that is why I give 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect clamp for gluing up projects!","review":"After having used bar clamps for many years, these are an excellent replacement! They are more adjustable and spread the clamping pressure more evenly than bar clamps. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very valuable.","review":"This book contains a history of evolving religious experience both Christian and otherwise. For anyone interested in the development ethics and religious experience it is one of the best sources (sources on the history of dogma are very common, but this is different).I am convinced that if terminology is confusing that readers will find that they can penetrate the book with a dictionary, and that the book will help them select primary sources to study to enhance their comprehension of the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"In need of an editor","review":"I do not intend to disparage the scholarship of Mr. Fox because as everyone knows, he is an exceptionally talented and well versed scholar. However, this book reads like it is a first draft. He meanders through nearly 800 pages citing reference upon reference, but with little or no coherence. It reads like a stream of conscience novel, and his paragraphs shift focus and theme without alerting the reader. I found myself continuously lost and having to read again each page and the page before in order to find his thesis, if it existed at all. I recognize that certain subjects are complex and reward closer inspection, but there really is no need to write in such a way that you can scarcely be understood at first approach. I would gladly rate his book higher if he would thoroughly edit it, and then offer a second edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"a frustrating book","review":"I read the authors book: THE UNAUTHORIZED VERSION and found it to be well written and enlightening. When I read the book: PAGANS AND CHRISTIANS I found it to be incomprehensible and dull. After reading 170 pages I gave up in frustration. A year later I tried to read it again and got to page 180, before I gave up. Then I decided to go to the second section on Christianity to see if it improved, but it was as meandering and frustrating as the first part."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"This item was sent incorrectly, the contents did not match the product.

I just came from dissing the new Lightspeed Rescue jobholders and now I have to do the same thing to THESE clowns? The Magna Defender was the only reason to watch Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, which in my opinion was very different from the previous follow-ups. Believe it or not, where the first three reincarnations had teens not yet graduated from college (remember \\"Angel Grove\\"?), this one and the seriously reincarnated Lightspeed Rescue puts these former superstars in a whole new role. Here, they work for their masters, and most recently, they even have jobs, but who cares? Can you imagine the ridiculous craze that stormed the world years ago? Make it stop once and for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and inspiring book","review":"This book is beautiful and inspiring, encouraging the reader to think about the entire letter writing and reading experience. It doesn't spend much time on the writing of a letter or its contents but rather explores some of the wonderful ways a letter can be presented: hand made greeting cards, hand decorated stationery, and the like. I recommend it for someone who already enjoys writing letters but would like to add a little fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"[BORING!]","review":"I have read most of all of Nan Ryan's books. This one was terrible! The herione was so boring I found myself dozing off. The \\"hero\\" if you wants to call him that was too cocky and just plain boring as the herione.

I should've listened to the others comments because this book [is bad]!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last Nan Ryan","review":"If this is typical of Nan Ryan novels I don't think I could read another one. The characters Shanaco and Maggie are not well drawn. I had trouble caring about what happens to them. The romance lacks sexual tension - they seem to instantly fall in love and into bed. The bad guys are really bad and the good guys really good - kind of boring and predictable. There seemed to be a few anachronisms in this book - Santa Claus? The setting is interesting with the movement of the Native Americans onto a reservation - would have liked to explore that more. With all the great romance writers out there to read - don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This is truly a funny book.

In fact, I gave up trying one third into the book. Not only are the technical terms not defined, but any attempt to derive their meaning or establish relationships between concepts failed.Much of the argument is enigmatic rather than explanatory. Many utterances seem to be drawn out of context.At least as an introduction to a difficult subject, there's nothing for it but to regard this book as a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"a VERY dissapointing introduction","review":"I have always been interested in these \\"introducing\\" books. at first, I just thought that they were for old philosophers and psychologists. I had always wondered if there would be one of these books with chomsky... then I found it! i couldn't wait to read it. what a fool I was. for almost the entire book, its about chomsky on linguistics which, by the way, MADE NO SENSE AT ALL!!!!! it was just so confusing, which was the whole point of making an introduction in the first place! then when thats FINALLY over they suposedly \\"go over his political views\\" which is HAVE AS LONG AS THE OTHER PART!!! it only 46 PAGES!!! and it still doesn't explain anything! oh well, at least theres \\"chomsky for beginners\\" they do the same thing as the \\"introducing\\" series but I've looked over this one and it does look A LOT better. the back of the cover explained more than this entire book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Funny As I Thought","review":"It wasn't the humor pieces that I liked best in this book but rather the more moving, genuinely emotional short stories. The author has a penchant for characters who are trapped in lives where they are forced to catalog, or keep lists, and they sometimes seem close to suicidal. For anyone who has ever worked in an office, this hits close to home."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Not Sure This Works","review":"I posted a review of this book earlier today, in which I said that I am a longtime fan of Ben Greenman's work. I also said that I think that his mother didn't reall write the other review on this page: that kind of clever self-referencing is exactly what Ben Greenman's work is all about, at least the things he has published on McSweeneys.

I picked up this book because I like the \\"Real Beach Boy\\" title and because a friend of mine had meet Dennis one year while skiing up in Utah and said what a nice guy he was. Of all the Beach Boys, Dennis was the most colorful and the one who would make for the most interesting story. The author did a fabulous job making this such an enjoyable and well-researched read. I wish there was a way to hear some of the music that Dennis recorded, but I don't think they are on CD. Anyways, if you are a fan of surfing, music, or the California sound, then this is a book worth reading. The Beatle and the Stones got so much more adultation, when here underneath our noses in Southern California was a band (especially creatively) that was a near equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surfer Girl From London","review":"Great writing, wonderful photos - it is so good to see Denny get credit for his incredible contribution to this wonderful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural means bleak?","review":"This is another book I purchased from amazon.com, based on client's reviews. I hoped to get something exciting, but, was disappointed. This book presents a \\"natural home\\" as bleak and colorless. The dominating colors are white and green. I don't think nature has only these colors in store. What about the riches of spring, summer and fall colors, the reds, blues, violets, oranges to name a few? The author has an aesthetic eye for displaying pictures. But all in all, I am returning this book for a full refund.

It has no subsegments sewn into it like similar products on the market to keep the herbal materials inside from accumulating in one place. Unless you plan to use this on a completely flat surface (such as your back while laying down flat on your stomach) the heated herbal material inside always tends to fall under gravity and accumulate in the lower regions of the heat pack, making the distribution of heat extremely uneven. This makes the product impossible to use for serious heat therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are fighting over who gets it first!","review":"I gave this as a gift to my brother and sister-in-law.

The plastic packaging was already opened..and the crappy camouflage cardboard that's cheaply glued into the case was peeled off. The knives, all of them, had dirty black finger prints all over them. They weren't clean at all, and I'm not hard to please..but when I buy something NEW I expect it to come looking NEW. Not USED. We haven't used these yet but I'm without a doubt certain that they can't handle any real cutting..they look so cheaply made..I really should have gone with my gut and bought something a little pricier.

I always find her stories lacking something. However, I think this entry in the series is one of her better ones. While the question of how Tomas never realized that Sim was a werewolf is never answered, Sim is a strong hero, having evolved in Tomas' book from a little more than a bitter bully. Tally is just as flawed in the world's eyes, and their romance is a clarion call for all imperfect people. The secondary romance and all the twists and turns add to the story's interest and complexity. Some things are too clear-cut -- even society's dismissal of Tally -- and some are smoothed over -- like Tally's response to the truth of her brother's betrayal. Such things drop the book under a five-star rating. Nevertheless, the story and the characters keep the reader's attention.

The part that squeezes water out of the sponge mop must be unclipped from the mop each squeeze and clicked back into place each time.

Family goes to the Iowa State Fair and each one has their own adventure.The 1962 remake has good actors -Pat Boone, Ann-Margaret and others. However when the studio updated the story to 1962 and moved the setting to Texas, they lost much of what made the original so charming. One example was the song and dance number that Ann-Margaret does. Seemed like it should have been in a Las Vegas casino, not a state fair stage.It's because I didn't like the 2nd version that I rated this at 4 stars.

Yes, it has some of the corniest moments ever put on film -- but isn't that part of the charm of these old movies? The music is lovely (I just can't agree with those critics who call it weak), and even though Jeanne Crain and Dick Haymes look far too worldly and sophisticated to be smalltown Iowa farm kids, the movie has a colorful and homey feeling to it. It is about a time when people got excited about spending three days at a county fair, riding on ferris wheels and eating candy apples.

The notes, which take up much more space than the Word might be confusing to the new student. Old Bible students firmly established in doctrine & the Word might find this Bible useful as a reference tool. Also, some might find the small print hard to read.The most positive thing about this Bible is its size & appearance. I do like the compact size. The durable hardcover is attractive & colorful.

The Kendalls were not around in 1961, or if they were, Jeannie Kendall would have been about 3 years old.However, since I have all the original versions on other CDs, this is a pleasant change, and the music is very good if you like tradional country music.

It throws an enormous amount of material before you.(That is the effect it has upon you as a student--data being dumped on you en masse) Hours later into reading it, you are no better off than when you started. It is also in black and white and every single page is jam packed with material. This off-putting visual style/format is no aid to learning either. Now that I'm steadily improving in Photoshop, I hope I am able to occasionally open this book and learn something I haven't gleaned elsewhere so as to get my [money] out of it.

The stereo system unfortunately has no aux input, so a transmitter sounded like the perfect solution.Setup was easy and I used the RCA-style plug adapter thoughtfully provided to connect to the aux output of the DirecTV receiver. The RV antenna is directly above the cabinet containing the SoundFeeder, so the range is no more than 3 feet.After trying the 88 and 107 MHz freqs, I still got loads of static & distortion. I thought it might be interferance from local (Dallas) FM stations transmitting near the 88 and 107 MHz freqs, but got the same distorted & staticky performance in camp, away from 88 and/or 107 MHz stations.Sound quality is that of a VERY cheap AM transistor radio; we get better sound thru the 13\\" cheapie TV speaker. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality...Don't buy it","review":"This thing never worked properly, its got to be really close to the radio if you want it to work.

However it does not have nearly the 30 foot range it claims to have. It is more like 2 feet. It also has the limited 8 channels, in large cities it can be hard to find a station that works. Despite this, in stations that just come in as distorted static, the product is strong enough to over come this and give a resonable signal. Not quite as clear as a tape adapter. It works well, has a nice sleek design, and easy to travel with. Good buy for the price, however a strong model would be advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoddy construction, poor performance","review":"The battery compartment on my unit was very difficult to open, one of the springs on the battery terminals broke the second time the batteres were replaced, in the Philadelphia area it was almost impossible to find a channel among the 8 available that gave decent sound quality without a lot of interference, could only get good sound quality in the boonies, and even then it drifted in and out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Don't Buy It","review":"Audio Performance was considerably worse than AM radio, sound is muffled and full of static even though the unit features PLL (phased lock loop) tuning to the preset fequencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit came with two major problems....","review":"The unit came with a speaker buzz and a repetitive tick whenplaying CDs, mainly because of manfacturing and designshortcuts.On opening the unit I found two unshielded flat ribbon cablesfolding and tucking these between the circuit boards fixedthe buzz, adjusting the CD's sled trim pot fixed theCD player's (focus?) tick.

Having said that, it is typical Ferry Corsten, and by that measure, it's probably one of his better CDs, but it really is a shame his apparent skills are being wasted on music that makes you believe the moon, the earth, and your car, among other things, are made out of cheese.There are one or two tracks that helped me stop screaming bloody murder, but in any event if you like the \\"cheesy\\" side of trance, you'd probably love this CD.

Corsten, like his stylistic contemporaries DJs Tiesto, Tandu and Armin Van Buuren, specializes in uplifting mixes of intense yet melodic music that manage to elevate your spirit along with your heart rate. Unlike Tiesto and Van Buuren (but very much like Tandu), the quality of his mixes tends to vary considerably. This mix is one of his best. Tracks 2 (Perpetuous Dreamer's Sound of Goodbye) and 9 (Luis Paris' Incantation) are particular standouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great episode","review":"The reason the Kingpin story didn't seem to \\"go anywhere\\" is that this isn't a movie, it's an episode from the 1990s Spider-man TV show on Fox. I liked the show quite a bit; it had pretty good animation and the stories were interesting, even if they didn't always hold completely true to the comic book's stories. Chances are if the sound and animation don't line up in places, it's more likely to be the result of the video production (I've seen it happen before). Spider-man is one of the few cartoons I've watched which had characters that seemed more real and actually developed over time (another cartoon that did a good job with that was the Real Ghostbusters)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful flatware","review":"Beautiful set of seafood forks.

Self-absorbed, pseudo-intellectual, completely disconnected from anything remotely resembling academic or empirical work - in any discipline.

From urban landscapes as human exoskeletons to the corporate drive to control our very genes this historical account is really an intense examination of the progress of matter-energy over the last one-thousand years as the term progress itself becomes questioned along with a great many other things.

And his command of the nuances of strategy and tactics is incredible...I don't know why he isn't a Grandmaster, because he sure writes better than 99.9% of them.

Melissa Wiley puts to rest all doubts of even the staunchest Wilder loyalists.This is a beautifully crafted book. Written in prose that is almost lyrical, the story is expertly woven. With Charlotte, the little girl who will become Laura's grandmother, readers young and old learn lessons of life, love, and loss.There is a dearth of wholesome, meaningful books for today's young readers. This book fills that void to overflowing.I highly recommend all of Melissa Wiley's Little House books.

The shades of \\"Trilby\\" \\"La Boheme\\" and \\"The Moon and Sixpence\\" hover. The word \`deadpan\\" was used by other reviewers and is very appropriate to the way shocking behaviors are described without an authorial nod or wink . The characters are eccentric or bizarre, in the traditional mode of starving artists. People are monstrously vain or childlike with the narrator, even a first person narrator, abstaining from moral judgment, although esthetic ones abound. Janowitz never uses an adverb and the suffix \\"-ly\\" does not occur.A minor irrelevant problem re-reading my Washington Square trade paperback copy from 1987 was that it has the kind of binding misleadingly called \\"perfect\\" that causes the book to split apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"nascar racers # 1","review":"i like the movie i think this video is a greatto wach this time and time againcollect them all"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Bible for you!","review":"This Bible has changed my life!

She's only recently discovered her skills and is trying to develop them by starting her life over. There are, apparently, previous books in the series, but I didn't realize this right away, and it definitely made this story a lot more difficult to understand without the previous information from those stories. Mariana has a negative reading with Umberto Marconi, only to find him dead on the doorstep of the shop where she works after they close up shop, a shop which houses several different alternate healers. LAPD detective David Claybourne keeps an open mind, at least enough to inquire with the alternate healers as to any knowledge they might have in regards to Marconi.

The time and effort required were definitely worth the end result."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works... if you follow the instructions.","review":"I bought a bottle of iDrops directly from the manufacturer some time ago. This small bottle with eyedropper includes enough fluid to treat at least two Macbooks or its equivalent area for iPods if used as directed. If you apply the product as per the instructions, you'll eventually remove all but the most deep scratches from your iPod. But you need three other things: Patience, persistence and lots of elbow grease. You won't see an improvement until about 15 minutes or so of constant buffing, and it will take at least 45 minutes of nonstop buffing to effectively remove scratches. And a soft, used cotton rag will take you there faster than a microfiber cloth. If you can use a rotary tool for this, I think it should work as well.As a bonus, this doesn't work only on Apple products - any item featuring an acrylic-based surface can benefit from scratch removal with iDrops. The manufacturer does not reccomend its use on LCD screens, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product does nothing","review":"This product is worthless.

I should've come up with the idea to put blue water into a bottle with a dropper and say it removes scratches, put up some fake reviews, then sell it, then after making a few thousands or so, pack my bags and leave.

It does take time and a lot of patience. However, I did not sit for hours at a time, as I have read from others. I made sure that my current session was dry before leaving and had no trouble taking up where I left off on my return. I did notice if I waited a bit to let the drops sink in before I started to rub on the deep scratch that it sped the process up. I had a half inch long deep scratch, (I thought the glass might have to be replaced deep,) and it still needs a bit more work, but I can no longer feel the scratch by touch and it's barely able to be seen.

Well I've spent 2.5 hours buffing two small areas with both microfiber cloths and q-tips, moderate to hard pressure across the scratches, and I will say the scratches are less prominent. However, the scratches are still just about as noticeable as before. The area with shallower scratches faded, but hasn't gone away by any means. The deep scratch looks the same. And yes, like other people have noted, it will take off the oleophobic coating making fingerprints stick on the screen very easily, should your screen have had such a coating before application.

The PowerHouse model is a bit brighter and allows the use of dual fuels. The build quality has remained the same compared to my 10 year old single fuel model (still using) so I expect this to last as long. No need to worry about disposing or using up propane tanks. Good fuel capacity and long life of lantern makes this a must have for any campsite. Also great for outdoor emergency use in a power outage. Easy to find replacement mantels.This item would have easily gotten a 5 star if not for the following,1) This should come with a case, for ease of carrying and packing - to protect the glass.2) Still requires a long lighter or match to ignite unlike the northstar versions with ignition (but harder to find mantels)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, reliable","review":"I have had this lantern for the last 20 years and it still works just the same as when it was new. As others have said, this lantern really does light up the campsite (especially when hung up high).I recommend only using Coleman fuel (white gas) since this seems to burn cleaner and I think the lantern (and generator) last longer by doing this. I have burned unleaded gas a few times and the fumes from it were more noticeable than with the coleman fuel. Coleman fuel also has a much longer shelf life than unleaded (7 years if you have a full container).I have to add pressure to the tank about every hour or so to maintain full brightness. Even though it is a little more haste, I recommend it over the propane lanterns since it is brighter, cheaper to operate, and produces less waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid construction","review":"This lamp is quite large, I thought it would be smaller and I really like their construction is quite sturdy and pretty solid. very nice and is quite bright light"},{"rating":"1","title":"won't turn off","review":"The firt time I used this lantern it was great.

This is not caused by the author's style, but by the subject. The amount of personages, the often complex politics and the fact that it all plays in a world that is quite distant from our own make it a book that you must put some effort in.

The curry is not spicy enough to throw you off, and the lentils are a great choice. The taste of the couscous is just right: a hint of curry, and the nutty smoothness of lentils. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because of the 12 cups, three contained a mix that seemed to have gotten moist somehow. All the others contained a very loose, dry couscous mix.These are great to take with you for lunch (as long as you can get your hands on some boiling water). I'd maybe take a chicken breast or a cup of other veggies to toss with the couscous so that it becomes more of a meal, but as a snack?

A bit mild for my taste but it has a nice flavor and is pretty filling.I kicked it up a bit with a little black pepper and some of my own curry powder. That really made it much better for my taste. I'M a big eater so for me it's a nice snack but most people would consider it to be a meal. It's very easy to make. I have found with these kind of products that they taste much better if you let them sit a few more minutes after adding the water then they recomend before eating them. That helps to hydrate all of the bits and pieces and it tastes much better that way. You can always reheat in the microwave. I would recomend this product to my friends.Dean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good & Basic Soup","review":"This soup is good, easy to prepare, stores well, and has healthy ingredients.

I'll just list a few of the worst things:1) Buttons that stick - as in ALL of the buttons on the top of the unit. Even when they weren't getting stuck inside of their circular cutouts, I oftentimes had to repeatedly push them just to get them to work. Awful.2) Poor FM reception compared to the old radio it replaced in the exact same location3) A dial light that ALWAYS comes on when you power on, but NEVER shuts off when you power it off4) A weather warning that interrupts whatever you might be listening to, even for something as unimportant as \\"high ocean waves\\"5) Mediocre sound quality6) Not inexpensive, considering all the issues aboveUnbelieveably, CCrane would not allow me to exchange the unit for a higher price radio, even though I offered to pay whatever would be the difference in price.

I will translate that for you - \\"This radio sounds terrible on music stations.\\" We have a local station that plays oldies music and the audio is terrific on all the other radios mentioned-plus the supperradio and the vintage radios pick up distant AM stations about the same as the CCrane.I would recommend looking at one of the other choices mentioned above - I think you will be happier in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work","review":"This charger did not work and actually when I plugged the playbook in, started to make all of the screens I had open flip back and forth, which is dangerous for the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grand Master Sailor and Navigator","review":"A great book for anyone with an interest of the life and stories of Josua Slocum.I have read & Re-read \\"Sailing Alone,Around The World\\".

While the phone does amplify adequately, it requires you to push a boost button every time you receive a call in order to turn on the amplification. This was not acceptable in our situation nor was it mentioned in the description of the product.

It doesn't bother me that it has been trimmed down from the top and bottom it is still flawless. Of course I'll get this Third Season.

I just finished watching 3. 4 and 5 are in the mail coming to me right now. I forgot how utterly exhausting the Freeza Saga is, but it marked the beginning of serious villains and fighting in my opinion. Definitely worth the money.

Touted as a complete remastering, this release was produced in a (cropped) widescreen presentation with a \\"remastering\\" process by Video Post & Transfer in Texas. Despite FUNimation's claims, the set is indeed cropped (missing approximately 20% of its vertical resolution while only gaining approximately 5% of its horizontal resolution), it is not remastered frame-by-frame from its original film, and the color has been adjusted. Of note is the inclusion of a new audio track, featuring FUNimation's traditional voice track (with minor line alterations where appropriate) played alongside the original Japanese musical score.

The whole series including the Frieza saga is the high mark of Anime.However, the reason these sets deserve a four star rating instead of the five star rating that the series deserves is because the music by Bruce Faulconer is not there. Faulconer's work is greatly appreciated by many fans especially the music during Goku's transformation into a Super Saiyan. This will be very disappointing when the Trunks Saga is released (Feb 19) because Faulconer made full use of his music with the arrival of Trunks, the Androids attacking South City and even 17 & 18 fighting Vegeta. This will also be crucial for Faulconer's Theme for Cell and Gohan's full ascension theme.I hope that the music will be used in the next release, because I miss the show with the music and I don't want to buy those three-episode sets just to get the music because it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Finally there is a cheap way for fans to buy DBZ.

His approach is good, his scholarship is well-balanced, and he has some useful suggestions on how better to address the culture rather than just be carried along on its tide. I think he may be a little too gentle on how Christians need to change their lives in response to the challenge Christ laid out for us, but the book is still an excellent way to begin asking the right questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original recordings","review":"Do not purchase this cd.

I was interested in the section on programming serial ports in visual C++ for a windows XP machine. The coverage amounted to 20 pages with no in depth discussion of problems that that might be encountered, and how to troubleshoot them. The book did allow me to do a little bit with serial port communications, but only enough to get me into trouble. I'm still looking for a book that explains how to do this in visual C++ on a Win XP machine. I give it two stars because it is well written, and it does allow the reader to begin to use the serial port."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Series-Guitar Atlas","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone with a passion for classical guitar and for any world enthusiast. The whole Guitar Atlas series is so informative in terms of guitar techniques, rhythms, and melodies. I enjoy reading about the history of the regions such as Spain. Many of the famous flamenco artists are listed so you can look them up on the internet or buy a CD to learn more about them. Any guitarist with an interest in other cultural music or interest in finding new ways to play the guitar should buy at least one in this series. Overall, I would give high marks on these books and they are not too difficult for an intermediate guitar player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Flamenco - Fraudulent","review":"This is an attempt to teach flamenco the way it was before Camaron and Paco revololutionized it, but even then it's completely wrong. Flamenco was never played like this - ever.This is a classical guitar player faking it.For real Flamenco, only the didactic videos made by the Swiss company Encuentro exist. Some of these are good and others are mediocre, but at least they contain real flamenco played by real flamencos. No one in flamenco ever heard of any of these other people who have written flamenco guitar books.The Paco Pena Toques Flamenco book is the only thing showing the old way that's even close. It's a source of trditional falsetas but the compas patterns are obsolete. PIP falsetas are also obsolete.Don't take my word for anything, go to Spain and find out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item came damaged!","review":"I so needed this item cause the leak in my car's sunroof drainage system made the passenger compartment floor wet! and the mold started to grow on the back seat, right where my kid sits! so i got this product and it came damaged! the filler was on the outside of the pouch - thank god the pouch was in a plastic bag so I didn't get the filler all over myself and home carpet where I opened the amazon box. also, there was text on the cloth pouch that was completely illegible! it has some type of directions on it but I could not read it! very disappointed with the seller! returning this immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to feel good?","review":"No matter who you are, what you look like, what your idiosyncrasies are, just how awful or weird you think you are--read this and a wonderful thing will happen!

My most favorites are Heaven Bound, Live in Me, Body Heat, and Dancing for your Love! The riffs are fantastic and I welcome the sound of \\"real music\\" and instrumentation compared to all of the techno we have today!

I finally made my purchase, and the shoes arrived very fast, but unfortunately, though I've always worn a standard size 7-1/2 in shoes and recently bought a pair that fit fine in this size, these shoes were so big on my feet that my foot didn't even tough the back in the shoe when I put my feet into them. Adding padding or thick hosiery seemed therefore like a pointless idea, so I decided to return the shoes. I am frustrated that ordering in my regular size did not work.I also noticed that while I ordered a \\"Wide\\" shoe, these don't seem all that wide, so overall, this order did not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Windows Mobile 2003 device","review":"Lots of memory, VGA resolution screen, and fast processor make this a good Windows Mobile device.

Lack of any compatible wired add-on keyboard makes it nothing more than an attractive paperweight, though. Wireless keyboards are very sloooow, and this unit won't stay on the wireless keyboard when the unit has the heavy duty battery installed. This unit is only compatible with certain USB keyboards, so that solution is not realistically available either.

In the review they talk about watching a movie on the SD card, well, thro a 5GB Microdrive in the 6000L and watch abpout 12 full length movies.Do yourself a favor, take a look at the 6000L first before going the WINCE route...You may find the WINCE is still more your style and that's cool.

Since I've been through several deaths in the last two years (father, sister-in-law, babies, pet and friendships), I can attest to the accuracy of comments from many of those who contributed to the book through interviews. This is an EXCELLENT reference book for helping those (who don't know what to do) learn what is helpful to support friends, co-workers and even family, experiencing the pain of grief and the stages of grieving. If you're looking for others who've experienced what you've experienced (either through support or non-support) in the death of a loved one...you are likely to find it here. If you are looking for a source of information on what you can do to 'be present' for someone you care about who is going through grief, you'll find that information here.

It also has a lot of insights that are not apparent on a first read that make the book worth coming back to over and over again.If you're JUST looking for info on Zen, don't bother with this book,(it's about Christian applications of Zen). Try 3 Pillars of Zen by Philip Kapleau instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I ever read","review":"I read this book from cover to cover in about 1980. I may have added more comments to the book than there were words in the book.This book lamely attempts to reinterpret Christianity according to the alien philosophical categories of Zen. So, the paradoxes of Jesus are like koans, etc. It is better to realize that Zen and Christianity have entirely different worldviews than to attempt to synthesize the antithetical. Christianity is not nondualistic; it clearly teaches the distinction of God and the univers--unlike Zen. Nor does Christianity claim that one must leave one's rational mind to know reality--as does Zen. God created the human mind to know God, oneself, and creation. The mind is damaged by sin, but not unredeemable. One could go on. For a good book on Christianity and Zen, read \\"Zen Way, Jesus Way\\" by Tucker Callaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent A & C book","review":"Great color pictures with a variety of influences.

This is a great read for lovers of the modern stage and a must for any Pinter collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, okay...","review":"The book is poorly bound, and the content is rather dull after all. I think Pinter is over-rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, played that.","review":"I performed Scene 8 from \\"Betrayal\\" in a theater class, and read the rest of the play in order to form a character analysis of Emma. I found the play intersting, but slightly odd. Some of the wording made no sense, and there were times when the references seemed out of place and just in there for laughs. The play itself was an old idea broadcast in a new way-backwards. It left me feeling bittersweet as I saw how it ended, and then saw how sweetly it started. I recommend the play for its difference in story telling, but I'm not so thrilled with it that I would insist you see a showing. It really seems to come down to the tastes of the person. This one wasn't really my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost too convincing","review":"This play by Harold Pinter is about a three characters who are all cheating on each other. The most interesting aspect of this play is Pinter's technique of telling the story backwards. The audience comes in at the end of the affair. From that point the story basically proceeds back through time. The only problem I have with this play is that I don't like any of the characters. Jerry and Emma seem sleazy, and Robert is just a jerk. It makes it difficult to feel anything for the characters. This definitely does not ruin the play however. If you notice this playing at your local theatre, find time to go; you will have a great time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Play!","review":"Seriously, if your interested in Pinter style, this is a good place to start.

Read a selection of the best, because so much of Chaucer is not the best that one wonders why read him at all. Perhaps the answer to the latter question is because of our obsession with firsts: he is one of the first British poets, and indeed a voluminous amount of his work has survived. As far as medieval literature goes, I find parts of the Decameron and all of Dante infinitely superior. If you really want to invest your time and money wisely, read the Riverside Shakespeare or the Riverside Milton...Leave Chaucer to the \\"experts.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & cool cut","review":"What do you get when you mix great production skills, humourous lyrics, hilarious video, and an accomplished rapper/actor? You get \\"Light ya ass on fire\\" by Busta Rhymes, produced by Pharell, a very interesting, lighthearted track. The lyrics are a little racy, so is the video, but Busta presents it in a comical way, which is okay in my mind. The beat is simple, but interesting because it's very stop & go. This is an entertaining cut with a great video, classic Busta."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good second controller for the Xbox","review":"If you need a second controller for the Xbox (the system comes with only one, the Controller S) and don't want to spend $25-$35 for another Controller S, then this is a more than adequate substitute. This solidly constructed, durable controller is similar in design to the Controller S, with the same kind of dual analog button/control layout and rubber grips that makes the Controller S so user-friendly. It also features Dual Force Feedback, which allows you to feel the action with every punch, explosion, or impact. Plus, it comes in three colors: black, green, and metallic blue. Overall, a pretty good accessory for the Xbox system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading advertising!!!","review":"While the controller looks good and may be well made, I bought it because it was advertised as WIRELESS and IT IS WIRED!!!!This controller is WIRED!!!THis controller is WIRED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good controller","review":"This controller is a high-quality product. Everything works as it should, with just a few minor flaws. The triggers are extremely touchy when they are new, just bump them and you waste a grenade. But if you are careful, it's not a problem. Also, the vibration mechanism makes a very annoying, high-pitched whine, although this may be inaudible to some users, and is not easily noticeable if you're playing with the volume high enough. The invert toggle switch is fully functional, and great for friends who get stuck with the wrong setting and you don't want to take time to change them. This controller is comfortable even for large hands, and the rubber grip makes a nice difference. I definitely recommend this as a good secondary controller. For a good primary controller, check out the FPS Master Controller, by the same company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"[...] This controller has been advertised as being ideal for FPS players due to an invert switch for the right thumbstick. It's a lie. The one I got has a little plastic notch where the picture on Gamester's website depicts the switch.Another reason I've found this controller to be a useless piece of crap is the fact that the left thumbstick button only works when the stick is in a neutral position. This is the dealbreaker for me. Every FPS I've played on the Xbox has used this button for crouching. In Halo 2, there are many places in the multiplayer maps that are inaccessible without crouch-jumping, which is impossible to do with this controller.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting autobiography","review":"This a readable and interesting look at a time and place in Copenhagen, Denmark, a time when Denmark was perhaps less prosperous than is currently true. The story, in addition to being about the author, illustrates the social difficulties for the working class prior to the establishment of the current welfare state.It is a coming of age story, and because the author is a writer, and wrote as a child as well, it conveys a good sense of place and of the experiences of growing up in an emotionally deficient family situation.

The details of the relationship (or lack there of) between Patton and Montgomery are very interesting. How the Allies kept it together with these two ego's leading is a credit to Eisenhower. I also enjoyed the details of the Italy campaign, one part of the war that is not covered much. The descriptions of the battles in Berlin prompted me to get a few books on the topic.

The pros: The overall sound upgrade from my old (non-surround sound) system is a major improvement. The sound quality is excellent and the five disc CD/DVD player is a major bonus not found in many systems this size and at this amount. Now the cons: DO NOT BE MISLEAD, 90 watts a channel as a crock. I'm not sure who does the ratings for Sony but a corporate calibration of all equipment they use to measure output wattage is way over due. My old 45 watt Yamaha will spank this little component right in the amp and never look back. If you're looking for a small relatively inexpensive system with good sound, this is your unit. If you occasionally want to mix it up with the guys and rock the house, save the embarrassment and buy something else. My C770 still has that new toy smell ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment","review":"I paid a lot of money for this system in March 2003. It has been used very little.

It only has two fast-forward speeds (2X and 3X) The only reason I use it is for the 5.1, otherwise (for kids movies) I use the $30 cheapy.The Tuner and Aux ports are fine and I use the Optical to play tunes from my computer (pretty cool)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable and expensive to repair","review":"We purchased this unit and have found it to be highly unreliable. The disc changer failed after less than 70 hours of infrequent use. A warranty repair lasted less than 30 days, upon which the unit was returned. The diagnosis this time was that a motherboard needed to be replaced, at a cost of over $400.Sony customer service is indifferent and ineffective. Two calls totalling one hour and forty-five minutes have resulted in extended hold times of at least 20 minutes and no resolution other than a solution for getting the stuck cd's out of the unit.If you don't plan on keeping this unit for more than the warranty period, it might be an appropriate purchase.

Can't get enough until I heard this crap. Break up Hog molly and reunite Tad. This album is lame!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the songs go?","review":"Any fan of Tad should avoid this like the plague, unless you found Tad's riffs and lyrics too complicated. Sloppy songwriting, simplistic, just plain unfunny and a major let down. There are lots of CD's out there by a lot of bands. If you want to explore some interesting heavy music try The Last Drop, Boy Hits Car, Dern Rutlidge or Christbait. Try anything but this. I paid $2 for this, and the quality was reflected in the price. Not sure who had all the talent in TAD, but I'm pretty sure now who didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit heavy minus tunes equals absolutely nothing","review":"I must be missing something, right? I bought this on the basis of all the fabulous recommendations noted previously but I'm shocked to find this as one of the most boring, leaden pieces of garbage is some time. Song after hideous song, the whole thing drags on with not one memorable riff anywhere. And no, it doesn't rock, mate, and not at any volume. The recording also leaves a lot to be desired. The guitars just sound flat and lifeless. So, it sounds like Tad? Good, glad I missed them also. Believe me, don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folk Music Classic","review":"This outstanding live recording captures not only Simon and Garfunkel at their folk finest, but is a superlative representation of the 1960's folk music scene. The instrumentation is absolutely bare bones(two voices and 1 acoustic guitar), and yet the entire presentation is a sonic and emotional masterpiece, and out-rocks much electric material. Like various recordings by Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Kurt Cobain and others, Simon and Garfunkle show us how acoustic presentations can really cook.What a marvelous release from the vault!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Simon & Garfunkel recording ever!","review":"I purchased this album about a month ago and since then I've had these incredible melodies in my head night and day. I can't get enough of it. I have the boxed set, DVDs, and I've seen them in concert. I've watched them on TV and I've listened to them for countless hours over the years, but this recording is what I would classify as THE album that captures the real magic of Simon & Garfunkel as a duo.The harmonies in this recording are incredible. I Am a Rock is perhaps the most powerful recording on the album as the harmony is perfect and Paul's guitar play is simply brilliant.This is a must-have-album for any Simon & Garfunkel fan. It rekindled my fervor for their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"The music and performance is sublime, capturing Simon & Garfunkel on their home turf on the cusp of broadening fame. This same material has appeared on easy-to-find bootlegs in the past, but not with this crisp, clear sound quality. Skip the \\"deluxe\\" packaging offered on an alternative edition of this CD unless a cardboard digipak sleeve with a shiny finish is important to you; the contents are otherwise the same as the regular jewel-case edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Those Times","review":"Simon and Garfunkel first appeared at UMass Amherst in the Fall of 1965 as the opening act for The Four Seasons. I guess no one knew where it was exactly that they fit. They were folkies but their hit, \\"Sounds of Slilence,\\" was pumped up after the fact to sound like folk/rock. Anyway, I missed that concert but saw them at UMass in the Fall of 1966 as headliners. The concert was very similar to this - Artie, Paul, and Paul's guitar. The audience was very much like the one on the CD, attentive and enthralled. Artie and Paul were also very much like on this CD, in good, pure voice. This CD takes me back to those times, but even if you weren't there, this is one of the best evocations of those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!","review":"I am an avid Simon and Garfunkel LP collector - which I unfortunatly don't get to listen to as often as I'd like, but this is the CD I listen to when I need my S&G fix! I love love love live and acoustic versions of music because to me, an artist is not a true artist unless he or she can perform live and still rock it! This is the CD to buy if you want to hear the true art of Simon and Garfunkel. Another suggestion is the Greatest Hits album which I have to admit, at the age of 22, I made fun of my mom for owning this CD up until I turned 17 and discovered their brilliance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cautivante intimidad.......","review":"corrian los años del amor...del sentir que era posible cambiar algo..y esta edicion refleja simplemente una noche de ese particular año, 1967....nada mas y nada menos...un momento de una de las tantas noches que derramo ese año..y casualmente tocaban simon & garfunkel, derritiendo la apatia, la desesperanza y la monotonia....todo envuelto en una pristina calma y sensibilidad exasperante...canciones fragiles, por momentos arrolladoras o delicadas..pero que al final de cuentas hicieron historia.

However, I've given this disc a 1 star rating because Sony did not present the entire concert here.I believe the producers of this release excised at least one of the performances from the concert. Red Rubber Ball has been cut-out, and perhaps others.

There are 20 tracks performed by eight different obscure polka artists. Recording quality is far from superb. On some of the Deutchmeisters tracks, all the microphones seem to have been placed near the drums, making it difficult to hear anything else. Some instruments on the Polka Padre tracks seem to have been full of water, judging from the gurgling. Watch out for the repackaging. The CD says Polka Dance Party Volume 1, but the cover says Polka's Greatest Hits Volume 1... Don't be trapped into buying Polka's Greatest Hits if you already have Polka Dance Party, or vice versa. A small example of the manufacturer's carelessness is that, on my copy, the back cover (the one that's harder to fix) was upside down. For the best polkas, stick with Joey Miskulin, Frank Yankovic, Jimmy Sturr, and Eddie Blaconczyk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dubstep","review":"This is classic true dubstep at its finest and one of my favorite dubstep records by far.

These rituals and sacrifices are means for realizing it through superimposition, i.e. adding some false semantics over what is to be understood and then invalidating it by showing its inconsistency with what is to be understood. One should hence meditate on them to better dwelve into the difference between the relative and the absolute.This volume is less abstract than the previous two volumes so people that prefer metaphors and more practical stories will be more at ease with this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book enjoyed for years","review":"We have had this book since my daughter was 18 months. Now at three years old, she still loves it as she did the first time I read it to her. It is often one of her preferred bedtime stories- throughout the year, not just at Christmas. The tactile nature of the book and the vivid colors engage her completely. We now have almost all of M. Christina Butler's books. All are wonderful, but this one has such a charm the others cannot match. I highly recommend all of her books, particularly if your child enjoys one of her titles. I am glad we discovered this author and her delightful books."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent children's story...........loved it","review":"Before I sent this on to a child for Christmas I had to read it.........great story..........loved it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors to be useful for study","review":"Reading all the glowing reviews of this book, I wonder whether the reviewers actually tried to use the book to understand the material, or just checked the table of contents. There are so many misprints, throughout, that one wonders if the book was proofread at all. Some of the mistakes will be obvious to every physicist - for example, one of the Maxwell equations on page 56 is wrong - others are subtle, and will confuse the reader. The careful reader, who wants to really understand the material and tries to fill in the details of some of the derivations, will waste a lot of time trying to derive results that have misprints from intermediate steps which have different misprints! Some chapters are worse than others, but the average density of misprints seems to be more than one per page.The book might be useful as a list of topics and a \\"road map\\" to the literature prior to 2003, but that hardly justifies the cost (or the paper) of a whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an online list of errata. Unacceptable.","review":"I am surprised that amidst all the glowing reviews, there is only one reviewer who points out the unacceptable number of errata in this book. A couple of misprints here and there throughout the whole book (or even per chapter) would be acceptable, but I agree with the other reviewer that at times, the misprints are as much as one per page. In addition to the error on page 56 (equation 1.241d should have curl B), here are just a few that I found (I'm just going to list the page numbers): 8, 9, 21, 28, 66, 84, 179, 186, 192, 193, 196, 203, 245, 247, 255.... Look, I could go on and on. But this is not my job. I certainly didn't pay 60+ bucks for this. Physicists deserve better than this.

R. Carlos Nakai has the unenviable job of noodling around on a Native American flute made to sound like an out-of-tune recorder playing Glass's unidiomatic and inane little ditties in a shameless attempt at P.C. multiculturalism that falls flat on its face. The descent into self-parody is complete with the Harpsichord Concerto, a ridiculous trifle of a piece possibly indicating that Philip Glass will crank out a concerto for anyone willing to pay for one.

The ACTUAL joystick sensitivity is so low, that you really have to slam the stick in the direction of what you are doing. I mainly used this in 2D Fighters, (since the Xbox controller is awful for 2D Fighters) and getting my character to do a forward jump is such a task because like most other joysticks, all you have to do is move the joystick in that direction.

The seriousness and skill that Schwarz used in earlier books to examine the writings of High Modernism (Conrad, Joyce, Woolf, Wallace Stevens) he uses here to illuminate the \\"wiseguy\\" world of BROADWAY BOOGIE WOOGIE. With insight and compassion Schwarz re-visits this world of gamblers, gangsters, swindlers, womanizers, and cheats and looks at America's ever present yearning to \\"take a walk on the wild side.\\" The book should appeal to not only students and scholars in American Studies, 20th Century American History, Urban and Immigration History, Working-Class Studies, and American Literature, but also to anyone who simply loves New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"The originals were better","review":"This CD, also titled 60th Anniversary Greatest Hits, should not be confused with a Sony/Columbia release, Frankie Yankovic and His Yanks' Greatest Hits. The current CD was not recorded on the 60th anniversary of anything. It is simply snitches and snatches of material originally released on vinyl in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. At least eight LPs from Columbia, and two from RCA, are represented. The six oldest tracks (3,4,5,7,15,19) are monophonic, except for some recently added reverb. A couple of others, including the mislabeled Ohio Polka (it's really Cherry Polka) are also mono, even though they came from an LP originally available in stereo. The quality of most of the tracks is poor. Compared to the originals, or to most any other CD, you'll have to crank up both the volume and the bass to get a decent sound. There are much better CDs by this artist, notably Songs of the Polka King Volumes 1 and 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonny rocks...","review":"The world needs to wake up and smell the Polonsky.

The part that was the most gut-wrenching was when I read the few last chapters. I loved this book with all my heart. As I was reading through this marveleous book I grew to know the troubles Brooke was going through and you had this certain familiarity with her life as you would read along. I was sobbing throughout this book, and for me that is not a bad thing. You , after you read this book, will know that you have grown with this experience. I think anyone that cares enough about any kind of book should read this, and experience the emotions I felt when I read this book.

I was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some Scriptural truth. Unfortunately, the author was much less interested in a Christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the \\"church.\\" I know that churches have problems and hurt people, but it is not as common as this author seems to assert.He seems very angry at the church (and for some reason, all of western culture - especially America.) Living in N. Ireland could make one suspicious of religion I assume, but despite his claims to be a Chrisitan so concerned about commmunity, he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up.It is a good study of film (not movies - he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person) but not very useful in the context of the church.That's my take anyway.

Valerie Martin also returns to the original by allowing her readers to see the world which Stevenson attempted to write about by emphasizing class/race/gender distinctions and showing the dual nature of England of Stevenson's time. Martin, intriguingly shows more of Mr. Hyde than the original allowed the audience, thus drawing in fans of the original and exciting first-time readers.

Martin's writing is gothic and atmospheric, but it would be a shame to read this book as a thriller, a romance, or a sermon on the evils of the class system in Victorian England and miss out on the main point of the book. What Martin is saying about substance abuse is that the addiction is not to getting high, or to enjoying the substance itself, the addiction is to letting out the inner beast. Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde are both present in all abusers, who use substances to let out the evil inside their souls (not to get rid of it, to enjoy using it). Mary's father used alcohol to let out his demons, and Dr. Jeckyl used his experiments. Women like Mary are bound to them by loyalty, family ties, and love.

It might seem wierd that Byrne stopped to a small Mississippi college town, in the midst of his current musical tour, but the William Faulker (former Oxford resident) influence in this book, he claims, brought him here. This book is a very tongue-in-cheek attempt to show the \\"new sins\\" of our time. This book has to be read to be understood, and even then it can be hard to grasp. If you are a fan of the avant-garde, and David Byrne as a lyrical and prose composer you will be pleased.

I was hesitant because of the price, but finally pulled the trigger and bought one, and I am very happy that I did so.

I had to use my 20V cordless drill to drill the holes, but the Pocket Driver drove the 2\\" screws just fine. The size and weight offer great control and balance. The quick recharge is great.

I needed something that would be small but powerful for doing electrical jobs on the work site. This has proved to be the ticket.

Battery holds its charge remarkable well and then charges quickly when needed.

The worst part of the design (although admttedly I like the size and feel in my hand), is the poor design of the light. The LED light is a great idea, but when using it to install cabinets or use in tight-quarters where it is often dark, the light doesn't shine where the bit end is. I have tried it with 3 different sized (length) bits and none of them are well lit. If anything the light \\"blinds\\" you since it shines just off to the side of where the bit is.Too, bad.

Certainly she was an ordinary everywoman, as intended, but this is exactly the type of character you almost never see in science fiction. She's not a technical uber-guru or a speed-freak street-warrior, but those stock types are hardly a benchmark for realism in characterization. As for the settings, I've lived most of my life in Texas, and could sense how comfortable Sterling was with Texan characters in the first few pages. While I've never been to the other settings, I found the story evocative, and especially felt like he was working from a substantial map of Singapore in his head from having spent a fair amount of time there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read","review":"This was without a doubt the worst book I've ever read. Astoundingly boring, pointless, and then all of a sudden really preachy in the last third or so. Years and hundreds of pages pass and nothing happens, and the characters are completely uncompelling, especially the main character, who for all she goes through does not change one whit. Why was this book written? There's bad and then there's bad; this wasn't even fun-to-read-it's-so-bad bad. If I had had anything better to do with my bus ride, I would have stopped reading it after about the half-way point when it becomes clear that no, the story's not actually going to get exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst I've read.

Purchased it in September and saved it for Christmas. He anticipated its arrival and I did not let on that it had arrived. It was the first thing he put together to play with.

The only thing that was not a disappointment was the way it looked. Everything else was terrible. It was very flimsy, didn't go together the way it was supposed to, and never once worked like it was supposed to. My son thought it was \\"cool,\\" but after playing with it for a while and getting frustrated, even he agreed we should return it and get something else. This was to my great relief, since the thing took up a HUGE amount of floorspace and did not break down easily.

It seems like they hire summer interns each year to invent new toys, and the result is junk, instead of new toys that get better year-by-year and build on over 60 years of experience.This set will entertain your family for perhaps 60 minutes, after you spend 90 minutes trying to get the pieces together. Judging by my kids, it doesn't inspire imaginative play or present an on-going play challenge, and thus they aren't interested in going back to it.You might want to put tape on the tracks to try to smooth out the bumps and get the cars to work.Once you assemble it, don't assume that you can take it apart and save it for a rainy day.

My son said \\"This toy does not work very well, we should sell it!\\" I too wish I had read the reviews before buying this item.

Nice huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and poorly designed","review":"My 5 yr. old son got this from his grandparents for Christmas and although he thought it was very exciting, it has not been a good toy. Some of the track pieces broke the very first time that we were putting it together. You cannot buy replacement parts and they broke in such a way that repairing them is impossible. One side still works okay, but my son only wants to watch his father make the cars go because he cannot hit the lever quickly and precisely enough to keep the car going around the track.

This game is incredibly hard, but that's not a bad thing. The game play, controls, graphics, and sound all receive an 8 or higher on a 10 scale. It's kind of an RPG FPS in the sense that you can build up your character as the game progresses, dividing up skill points you earn during missions to boost your character in several offered fields with noticeable difference once said skill points are applied.Overall I personally am enjoying this game, and if your a die hard FPS fan like me, than it is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good game","review":"I got this game after my son had joined the Army. This is a pretty good game, it can just be a little frustrating at some points because they don't cut you any slack and you don't automatically heal if you are wounded. Not like other shooter games, but entirely realistic for an army game. In battle, if you are repeatedly shot you don't just shrug it off and keep going, you fall down. It can make the game kind of annoying at times but it adds to the realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to the third installment","review":"haven't played the game all that much. i'm hooked on COD4 so it was hard to switch over to play this one. the game play is much different. i would say the weapons are very realistic as far as breathing and trying to shoot steady, but the graphics and game play are lacking compared to COD. however i hear the third one that is coming out soon will be very competitive with todays top 1st person shooters."},{"rating":"2","title":"america's army","review":"I spent 12 years in the Army and this is a very true to life in training and weapons functions.A great game!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect companion to medieval readings","review":"Very pleasant music which would complement perfectly your readings on the period.

The concept and purpose of this album is Iberian musicfrom a time when three dominant cultures coexisted in something close to a golden age. To recreate a bygone time is folly, to remind ourselvesthrough music of the possibilities of peace in our time, is commend-able. The selections are lively, beautiful plus sometimes exotic.

I haven't regretted it.This is a fascinating and very \\"listen-to-able\\" album of instrumental music from about 1200 through around 1700 from countries around the Mediterranean and Middle East. The sound is exotic compared to much Western music, including pre-Baroque music, but I found it quite enjoyable to listen to, somehow both relaxing and energizing.It is well-produced, with great clarity, and whatever device I've listened to it on, the MP3 album has sounded great.

The radio had seen light use, mostly at home and more recently on the boat, but now the entire FM portion of the unit no longer works. In fact, since I've owned it I've never been able to pick up any shortwave signals at all. To be fair, I'm no shortwave guru so I maybe I'm not setting it up right. After going to Sony's repair website, they only offer repair on an exchange basis for $150... a brand new radio is about $130!Otherwise the unit was OK, not great. FM reception was good while it lasted. Bummer, I expected more from Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony's Weak Point","review":"My radio quickly developed problems in the volume control - one of the few non-digital parts - but too late to qualify for warranty repair.At this price level, Sony should increase its warranty and improve quality control.I would think twice before purchasing another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Radio For A Portable!","review":"For the price this is a great radio.Sony quality and performance.Sensitivity is good with the attached antenna and the syncronous detector makes SWL very enjoyable. Recommend it highly, especially to one who is starting with the hobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Portable Shortwave Radio","review":"This one replaced an older version that I had. It is everything that I want for travel and around the house: a carrying case, antenna adapter for better reception(when needed)and it's built very solidly. In Houston, when we were out of power for two weeks due to Hurricane Ike, this little gem fit the bill with great reception and sound, bringing me joy in the dark nights. I just wish that we still got the BBC World Service in North America!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AC Adaptor","review":"I purchased an AC adaptor 6 volt 1300ma to use on a new ICF-SW7600GR and it produces noise. Does anyone use an AC adaptor which does not produce noise? Manufacturer etc... I'd appreciate the info.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bad Shortwave Radio!","review":"After setting up and getting started I was very pleased with the use and quality of reception of this radio! The only setback, is it is obvious that I will need an AM loop for AM reception, but what a minor deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AC adapter **not included","review":"If you order this radio, Be advised that the AC adapter is not included, if you read the discription you are lead to believe that the AC adapter is included. 1st impressions with the receiver, it appears to be fairly easy to operate, I immediately began using without referencing the manual, and was finding short wave stations almost immediately, only knock, is it is a bit overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"The radio gets GREAT reception. The reason I rated it so low is because of the scanning feature.When you try to scan to listen to ANY shortwave band, it will only scan the band and not all availible channels. Trying to guess the band number to start with is a real pain. For this reason alone, I would not buy this radio again (actualy I trying to sell it on Ebay)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Very disappointing after reading the reviews here. I got zero SW reception on any band even with the extended antenna. MW and FM were very poor. Either I got a defective unit or the item isn't worth the price of purchase. The item was returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic radio has it all","review":"About as good as you can get for the money and very high quality. I got this for when I travel abroad, often to remote places, and have been very pleased with it. Back light, clock, alarm, just about anything you'd want to keep you company.When not traveling I'm not a DXer or shortwave hobbiest, so some of its features are lost on me. However, I do listen to NPR hours a day and it makes for a great (albeit pricey) small radio- the reception is the best I've found (and I have a lot of radios!). The built in stand makes it easily rest on a table top.While it does everything, it is darn complicated initially so read and keep the manual. Also, read one of the reviews below to get the appropriate AC power supply (www.universal-radio.com).Wish list? Protective case (pretty standard in this class) and an aux input for mp3 playback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as reviewed","review":"I bought this expecting exellent reception. When I bought this I also bought a Kato shortwave at 25% of the cost. The Kato has a rechargeable battery using a crank and also came with a power supply. The Sony had neither. The topper though is the Kato has better reception. Needless to say Kato stays, Sony goes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Reception - Obtuse Controls","review":"The size is right, its about the size of a paperback. I mainly listen to AM & FM band radio, and the reception on this little radio is awful. Its astounding it costs so much, is from a company with a good reputation, and yet performs so poorly. If you're addicted to all those non-AM & non-FM frequencies, okay, this radio is probably mediocre: bad reception, but inexpensive for what you get. When one considers the actual performance of the device, it really disappoints.If I were stranded on a desert island, Gilligan-style, I'd want one of these, but here in the big city there are cheaper, and better alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to waveband","review":"Overall, this is a good product thus far. However, I am new to waveband radio so there will be a learning curve to use his radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"OverKill","review":"I purchased this radio primarily for AM and FM listening. I guess I should have just stuck with a basic radio without all of the bells-&-whistles. This was definitely OVERKILL for my needs.I have been very disappointed with the reception of this radio for simple AM & FM stations in my area. The radio fades in-and-out on all but very, very local FM stations. I cannot reach any FM stations further than about 10 miles while my other very small transistor has been much more successful in reaching those same stations at about 1/4 of the price of this unit.I have always been happy with all of my Sony products until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"no reception from Honolulu, Hawaii","review":"This SW radio is brand new. I totally get how it works. What doesn't work is getting any reception from the middle of the Pacific pond (Honolulu) to anywhere in the continental U.S. All I wanted when I bought this radio was Seattle, San Francisco or New York stations broadcasting in AM or FM. At this point I will take any U.S. station, anywhere. After spending two hours with Sony tech support, they couldn't get it to work by connecting anywhere else in the U.S. The 7600GR will only connect to other Hawaii AM/FM stations which a mere $10 radio can do anyhow. Internationally I only get Australia and New Zealand so this radio has disappointed greatly. Sony tech support doesn't know so I am asking all of you, am I having this problem because I am in the middle of an ocean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I ordered this Shortwave radio and it was delivered without the AC adaptor.

Suffice it to say that it will do all the things that larger and more expensive radios of similar features will do and then some. Very handy size-wise. Good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior product","review":"I bought this radio a few years ago. I never liked it. I used it very little due to its poor reception and poor controls. I recently sold it pratically brand new for $100. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews. This radio is not what others claims to be. It has very poor reception on all bands. The display window is tiny. The light is dim and cheap looking. The design and technology on this item is not good. If you want the very best you can get, buy the Sangean 909X. Check out my review on the Sangean. I recently posted it on Amazon. If you find the Sangean too expensive, anything from CCradio is good too. Forget about this one. Sure, it is Made in Japan, but not even that can save it! You've been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality","review":"I bought this radio to save wear and tear on my Sony ICF-2010, which is more than 20 years old and still in good working condition. The performance isn't great, but was about what I expected given the price and size of the radio. However, the build quality is much worse than I expected. It has the build quality of a cheap, throwaway Sony Walkman and is not remotely comparable to the ICF-2010 in build quality or in any other respect.I bought an AC transformer on eBay but only got about 6 months use from it before the AC input jack stopped working. Now the Page button has failed. It's the button used in combination with a number to jump to different pages of presets. The Page button is frozen and doesn't spring back, but it still is possible, with difficulty, to change to a different page of presets by pushing the Page button followed by a number."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance but beware of costly spare parts!","review":"I've had the Sony ICS-SW7600GR shortwave radio for almost a year, and it has performed flawlessly. My only hesitation is that the speaker sound is somewhat thin, but it does sound much, much better with headphones.The radio cabinet is very compact and almost too thin. In fact, it is so thin that it fell off my counter with the FM/SW whip antenna fully extended and the antenna got bent and eventually broke. From this I learned that the radio is more stable when it is resting at an angle on its built-in fold-out back support.I called Sony Parts and they wanted $51 plus tax and shipping for the whip antenna! (About a third the price of the radio!). I found an identical Sony antenna on the Internet for $17. I bought this one and it fits perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and crisp","review":"I purchased this radio after reading several reviews. I am pleasantly surprised by the duration of the batteries. I am somewhat disappointed by the controls; they are not intuitive and take some getting used to. Reception for both AM and FM is terrific. I am from the Boston area and enjoy listening to NYC broadcasts in the evening. There is not much choice in retail stores relative to this type of radio; so, its hard to compare fit and feel. My conclusion is that this radio does give more than adequate bang for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trawellers must","review":"Going anywhere?? This is the item to take along so you can stay on top of things at home. Living in Scandinavia as I do and trawelling over Europe, this is a security to have.Newer regret buying this, almost fits in any pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent radio for the price!","review":"Overall I highly recommend this radio if you want to tune into exotic and far-away radio stations. The synchronous detection circuit helps reduce signal \\"fade\\". No other current radio offers this feature as this price. The ICF-SW7600GR is a solidly built radio and offers outstanding sound performance. The only complaint that I have with this radio (hence 4 out of 5 stars) is that it is slightly big and heavy. Nonetheless, the performance it gives makes it worth packing in your suitcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This is my first negative review on Amazon. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR I purchased from Amazon is a huge disappointment. I could not believe how bad the FM reception is. Only a few stations come in clear, others have interference from nearby stations, or can only be heard if the radio and antenna are held in a specific direction. My Radio Shack clock radio, Tivoli Audio, and any car radio have better reception! Using the SW capabilities are hindered by a user interface that is clumsy and non-intuitive, as others have pointed out. The time is not displayed while the radio is on, unless \\"enter\\" is pressed, alarms are called \\"standby\\", the display is too simple and only readable from certain angles, and the many buttons on the side panel are flimsy and poorly labeled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-built machine","review":"Having acquired several other SW radios for my collection over the last year or so, all Grundigs (G8, G6, G3, Satellit 800), the first thing I noticed about the Sony is the quality of the construction. This thing feels solid as a rock in my hands, the weight is just right, button presses are solid and not flimsy, it's just in a higher class than the Grundig radios. The sync detector on the Sony is best in class, as all the other reviews have pointed out. The reception is outstanding on all bands and the sound quality is very good as well.I'm not sure how long ago the 7600GR debuted, but its design feels pretty dated now. The LCD display is bare bones, the switches along the side could be more user-friendly if they were front-facing buttons. What I'd love to see is a completely modern version of the legendary Sony ICF-2010, which this unit really is not meant to be, but it's as close as we'll probably ever get from Sony.Overall, a great shortwave radio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I hated the way it tunes, keyboard only, It would be ok if you know all the frequencies you want to listen to but I like to \\"cruise\\" the airwaves . The scan function was so slow and just didn't seem to work very well.It worked fine when I knew the freq. and keyed it in but that's not what I like to to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good radio","review":"I've been shopping around for a good short wave radio. I have looked at Kaito (1103,1102), Grundig (G5, G6) and the SONY. I liked SONY because of normal rotating volume control, sync. detector, SSB capabilities, dual conversion and reasonable working time from one set of batteries.What I do not like is tunning by buttons. With 1kHz scanning, the buttons work O.K. but it just takes the fun from searching the stations. The telescopic anthenna in my unit is a bit loose. FM reception is just O.K. Display could be more informative,i.e. signal strength indicator would be nice.Overall, I am happy with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for Shortwave","review":"Couldn't tune in anything but a few local FM stations. Perhaps my unit is defective as I read many good reviews before buying it. Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality but a little complicated to use.","review":"This radio replaced a Grundig that I left in Africa with a friend. The Sony is of far superior quality and has much better reception. The Grundig was almost a toy in comparison to the Sony. Sound quality is fantastic. Tuning granularity is great and it really holds a signal. Signal fade was a huge and frustrating issue with the Grundig. My only knock on the Sony is that it is complicated to use. Maybe it is just me but it does not seem very intutive. I recently used it on a backcountry adventure and two of us in camp spent a lot of time figuring out how to get it to work and both of us came away frustrated even though we did eventually get it to do most of what we wanted. So if you are looking for a real shortwave radio at an entry level price this is probably your best bet. But be prepared to invest some time learning how it works or it will just collect dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened Sony?","review":"Despite high ratings in Passport I received two duds in a row which had to be returned. I've been buying Sony products for many years and it's pretty disappointing. Seems like Japanese manufactured goods are going the way of U.S. manufactured good. I hear Sony has decided to get out of the short wave radio business. Can't imagine why. Guess I'll buy a Kaito from China."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"I purchased this to replace an Eton radio that I loved but is no longer made. The Eton could recharge batteries, the Sony does not. The Eton's clock showed in the display window while the radio played, Sony's does not. Eton had the decency to include an AC adpapter, Sony did not. All I can say for the Sony is that it seems to have reception equal to Eton. But for a company with a long standing reputation to uphold, Sony dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I can't pick anything up on this piece of junk.

Listing Sammy Davis, Jr, Gene Kelly and Lisa Minelli on the title description is technically correct BUT they are there to praise this disappointing DVD not to perform except very briefly. What is really annoying is a several minute shot of Ray Bolger sitting in an empry theater telling us just how wonderful it was to watch Astair and Kelly perform their wonderous dual routine AND then NOT show it to us but instead cut to something completely irrelevant. Lisa Minelle is only there to tell us how great Broadway Musicals were not to actually do anything!It gets two stars insead of one only because there are some scenes that are entertaining but it is mostly a self congratulatory collection of the same superlatives repeated over and over for every scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"I don't know what took me so long in buying this film.

My fave is defintley Batgirl tho. And I dont know why people want sick Ken to be batman. that whould be SO ugly! He would NOT make a good batman doll. My mom bought me the poison ivy barbie and the poison ivy barbie was twice the size as my Batgirl barbie! We are going to return it. My mom said mattel is trying to copy sick brats dolls and its true! They made poison ivy not have a barbie ''face'' at all!she had this icky face its hard to explain tho... Overall this barbie is a must have! I would go to a store to get her tho cause at the store shes cheaper. (And im not even counting shipping!) Well I better go now so bye! -Jackie"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DOLL!","review":"This doll is great! Finally they made Barbie a Superhero!

The lotion was nice - light and creamy with some gold glitter. A little of it went a long way. What really made me hate the product was the overbearing smell. After putting it on, I was constantly reminded of my old grandmother. It's not a very good smell and borders on being disgusting. After I put it on, I had to immediately remove it because I was getting sick/nauseous from the smell. I wouldn't recommend you buy this unless you want the old-fashioned scents to bring you close to home. It also cost a fortune for what little I did get..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pwewee","review":"This Stank! This was not what I expected at all! It went right back.

And as stated on another review, they don't seem to \\"hug\\" the glass, as they should. At one point I did receive a \\"refund\\" from Rain-X for the purchase price (took about 3 months), but I will not buy their wipers again.

The 18\\" works great. But the 26\\" blade sticks up at the last 4\\" or 5\\" of the blade due to the curve of the windshield. It hugs the windshield tight when in the fully down position, but as the blade moves it loses contact and at the far position the last 5\\" of the blade is completely lifted off the windshield doing no good at all. This blade is worthless if you have a Murano. I'm trying to find another one that will press down on the glass for the entire sweep of the blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cheap blades out there.","review":"I actually bought these to replace some expensive Bosch Icons that werent worth a darn.The Rain-X Weather beaters clean the windshield perfectly with no streaks in any rainy conditions.The only problems i came across with on these blades are,they squeak a bit when they are new but the sound will go away after a while,also these blades seems to only last about 4-8 months and even after cleaning the rubber off,the blades streaked the windshield even worse,however i do recommend these to anyone.They are cheap and they work well,just dont last very long.I am gonna buy another set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rain X Should be Ashamed","review":"I ordered these Rain X Weatherbeater windshield wiper blades to replace the OEM blades on my 2010 Jeep Patriot. I figured since Rain X was a pretty well known name that they would put out a quality product. Boy was I wrong! Install was easy, as I drive a Jeep it's equiped with the universal mount. These things began streaking immediately, very difficult to see out windshield. i am absolutely disgusted with this product, I removed them and ended up putting on Michelin blades which work so far. Rain X has really let me down this time and I will NOT be purchasing these in the future. I will stick to their anti-fog formula, and so should they. They sure swung and missed on wiper blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these wipers","review":"For the price, you just can't beat them. I've been using Rain-X wiper blades on all of my vehicles for a few years now, and prefer them over the others. They work well and don't streak your windshield right out of the box like other brands. They also last a year if you clean them occasionally and leave the rubber part of the blade facing downwards. I just tap the wiper on and off really quick to get the blades to just slightly move upwards. This keeps the blade from bending upwards and jumping across the windshield."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fit Grand Caravan","review":"Bought these for a 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan in the correct size but we could not get them on.

So long as the price is right, I'll buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit Honda Element 2009","review":"After messing with it, even using a pair of pliers to widen the hole so the wiper arm would fit, the post didn't fit my Honda Element 2009 even though Amazon's Part Finder said it would.

These blades and brackets don't flex enough to cover the entire windshield, and the other shorter Rain-X shown as fitting on the passenger side is both 1\\" shorter than OEM and also doesn't flex enough. You cannot take the blade only and fit it into the Honda brackets either because the back of the blade is too narrow, falls right out. These should not be listed as fitting CR-Vs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit my Chevy Cobalt perfectly","review":"Works fine, but I like the Rain-X Latitude (Rain-X 5079279 Latitude 8-In-1 Premium Graphite Coated Wiper Blade - 22\\") one I got for the driver side better.

The weather beater one does just fine, and honestly, if I hadn't gotten a latitude one also, I probably would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW","review":"I purchased this recently and installed it on the passenger side of my 2004 Mazda3 hatchback. It installed very easily, but a few days later, as I was driving, the blade slipped off the the arm. I was foruntately able to pull off the road and snap it back on. That evening, as I was driving home, it happened again, about four times, and my commute is only 8 miles. The last time I stopped, I tried to stretch the clip in an effort to create more tension, but I don't know if it worked or not. This has happened to me in the past, and it was also on this brand of wiper blade.My husband also replaced his wiper blades with these and as he was driving home from work, 30 miles from home, it also happened to him.I did some research and found others have had simlar experiences with these. I am now never purchasing Rain-x wiper blades again. As far as I'm concerned, these create a grave safety hazard and should be taken off the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"great wipers, easy to install, fit perfectly on my ford focus. minimal streaking and doesnt make any noise. good for the price also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not work!","review":"I got these wiper blades for my 2007 Honda CRV.

Do not buy these!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst wipers I've ever owned","review":"I can't tell if it's this wiper or the other wiper (both are this RainX brand though) that are causing the problem but there's a large triangle int he middle of the windshield that doesn't get wiped at all. Also, the area the wiper does make contact with it very streaky. Instead of squeegee-ing it off the glass, it's just sort of moving it around. Never again RainX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These are terrible for 2006 Acura TSX","review":"These are terrible for my 2006 Acura TSX. The wiper fits, but there is a large section in the middle of the windshield that this wiper misses completely.

Not recommended at all for this application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit rear wiper for 2009 Suzuki Grand Vitara","review":"Didn't fit the rear wiper arm for 2009 Suzuki Grand Vitara, the arm was too wide for the wiper to attach to.

It seemed that I was forever buying new wiper blades and they would work for a month or two and then need to be replaced again. I have now had these on my car about 7 months and am still happy with the way they keep my windshild clear. No streaks and no squeals and I am happy about that. I also used Rain-X on the windshield and that made a great difference in the way the rain literally flies off the windshield. When I need new wipers I will buy these same ones again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Fast shipping. The blades were exactly as described in the posting. Very easy to install. I tried them on very heavy rain and they worked excellent.I am very happy with this product will buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off!!","review":"Okay, so I had previously written a positive review after having the wipers for a few days. Now after having them for a few weeks, my opinion has drastically changed! The wipers started leaving streaks, then the wipers started falling off completely. Everytime I tried to use the wipers they would come off, they're the right size. I had a mechanic friend check them out. He basically just told me that I got ripped off and when my boyfriend first looked at the wipers for me, he took the blade off and my wiper fell and cracked my windshield. haha, awesome! So, now i'm stuck with crappy wipers and a cracked windshield. I should have listened to the negative reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy blades","review":"the weatherbeater wiper blades didn't last too long. it was streakfree only for 2 months, then it became too streaky that I had to replace them (as I couldn't see through the windshield) with a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The wipers did not fit even though I used the vehicle selection process to check.The wipers themselves may be fine, but they don't fit my car.Not worth returning, but I am disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Works great.

Back on the highway they were fine for a few minutes and the same thing happened again- streaks and ice. Nearly got killed because I could not see through my windshield. The defrost, windshield fluid etc didn't help...the blades were streaking everywhere and all I could see was the lights of the cars around me through the white streaked windshield. Truly thought I was going to die. Never again with these blades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon, please","review":"I'm sure the product would be fine if it fit.

It was great in heavy rain but terrible in a drizzle and eventually just snapped off when I picked the blade up to wipe snow off the windshield. for the replacement I bought this blade. I love it! It's very easy to install (I'm taking a girl moment to say, I didn't even break a nail!). It has worked very well in both snow and rain.

I find that these are the only ones that \\"comfortably\\" fit my 06 Honda Accord. All the others (Anco, Michelin, etc...) don't fit well because of this stupid little bracket that's on the car's wiper arm. I did notice that right around that 6 month replacement schedule, the performance quickly deteriorates, so as long as you replace often, then you're good to go.

It got worse and my visibility was so poor that I felt that driving was dangerous. Luckily I didn't have far to go before I could change it.

If the blade assembly had more of an arch, or if it could swivel a bit more at the pivot point on the wiper arm, it would probably work much better.I am going to try bending the end of the blade assembly a little to see it that helps, but I will not be buying any more Rain-X blades for this car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good wipers","review":"Excellent Wipers.

The story features one of today's most fantasized military units, the French Foreign Legion. But in this future, the Legion is created of volunteers of condemned criminals, patients with terminal illnesses, and those who have simply given up on life. So upon death, their brains are removed and installed in high-tech military cyborgs which are armed with all sorts of deadly weapons. These thousands of cyborgs form the \\"Legion of the Damned.\\" Their principle enemy...a highly aggressive race of aliens who want to turn earth into a giant crater. Chock full of action, suspense, and intrique. Definitely alot of fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A roller coaster ride of sex gun's and cyborgs","review":"The human empire spans the galaxy and is fueled bygreed and the lust for power. Until a force of beings decides that it is time to attack the over extended and undermaned human empire. Now trust head long into this galatic stuggel a force of funded by worried business men led by bold leaders, and manned by seemingly unstoppable cyborgs goins the frey.This force is fighting a two front war. The empire fearing colapse attacks these brave rebels and the aliens bent on total domination trust what seems to be an unstoppable blow. But through it all the love of a man and a woman(of diffrent races) survives"},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"Pretty campy with cookie-cutter characters. The legion could (should) have been the main subject of the book but too many meaningless extras are thrown in (does anybody really care at all about the emperor in this book?) Too many angles are suggested and then never properly developed. Try as I might I just couldn't care what was going on. Only the Cyborgs evoked any real interest and they just weren't in it enough.Not quite ... but just barely above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing at first, but falling a little short later","review":"This was the first book I had ever read by Dietz and found it worth the trouble. I was captivated by the concept of a cyborg army with brains, something you don't see too much of on the silver screen. The intimate scenes in the book, especially the one with Mosby and the emperor/emperor were interesting to say the least. The character development in the book was well done and there were a few suprise deaths in the book, which I like. However, for some reason late in the book I became a little bored. To me it became a little too predictable but was still a good read. I am currently reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An answer to a question","review":"To answer the reviewer who asked why didn't humans just nuke the enemy its really simple, if you do it them they do it to you and you both and up dead. And another thing, the hudathen could live on a terra compatable world and humans on most of their world(though not on the homeworld). And then there are the other races to consider, if humans could bomb one race out of exictance then what's to keep them from doing it again? The other races would always bee higly suspicious of the humans and might even band to gether to knock them down. This book is good, great characters and fun action it keeps you reading on even after you should have turned the lights off."},{"rating":"1","title":"An fine introduction to Covenant in the Bible","review":"\\"This is a very readable book treating the theme of covenant/covenant faithfulness in the Old and New Testaments. Hahn's presentation of the topic is clearly written and engaging. A strength of this book however, might also be its greatest weakness as Hahn's reading of the text is overpowered by marital imagery. Hahn's strong convictions regarding the marriage covenant at times seems to truncate his perspective on covenant as if marital imagery is the only adequate imagery to use when dealing with the versatile theme of covenant.\\"The above review was originally offered by me 10 years ago. Since then, I have grown to appreciate this book more and more. It is a valuable resource for introducing (especially) young people to the idea of covenant. And, although the criticism I offered ten years ago still has some merit, the work over-all is to be highly recommended.Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introductory book -","review":"With the exception of Dr. Hahn's premise that the RCC is the holder of the new covenant, this book is an exceptional introduction to Covenant theology. He disappointingly indicates that the concept is entirely catholic, which those familiar with the topic would realize has been a theology in non-catholic circles for years.

He writes in a way that I can \\"get\\" the first time though. This particular volume is an arrow-straight shot through the first six covenants of salvation history. Despite the fact that I have been reading loads of books on this topic, this easy-to-read book STILL has new insights to give me! My favorite is the correlation between the animals that the Egyptians (and many Israelites) worshipped during the Israelites' 400-year stay there and the animals both destroyed by plagues and subsequently ritually sacrificed on Israelite altars. God tries hard to sever the worhsip link between those gods (represented by the animals) and His people. Now all those years of animal sacrifices make sense AND why it was no longer necessary in the new Covenant in Jesus' time. It was a particular discipline for a particular time. Neat!I recommend this book highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have known this wasn&#65533;t going to be dry and ponderous.","review":"Wow! Dr. Hahn has opened up the Old Testament for all of us who haven't the time for years of graduate level theology courses. Finally, Noah and that incident with Ham, his son, made sense. And the Garden of Eden became real and understandable and more than just a puzzling little chapter that starts \\"The Book.\\" He makes it all seem so clear! Understanding the Exodus of the Hebrews was the most meaningful part for me. We all, in our lives, must be stripped of attachment to the goods (and the gods) of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for beginners","review":"This was my fist book about scripture I have ever read.

This is the worst POG album since Life, Love & Other Mysteries! Here, \\"Begin With Me\\" (and 1 other song I cant remember) are the only tracks on this album that are anywhere near good. This album is filled with boring, lame-o, weak-melody junk. And what's to be expected with Nathan Nockles (from Watermark) producing 3 tracks. What are the girls thinking?! They used to be very choosy in picking the songs they record. I don't know what all these reviewers giving this record a 5-star rating are thinking either.

There's only so much more that can be done with this formula--these ladies ostensibly did all their stretching during childbirth, and don't recognize the blatant need for more of it artistically. Granted, you can't beat their harmonies with a stick, but there's so much left to say about the Novocaine factor contributed by the aforementioned harmonies, and the fact that each song on the new record comes off like a cheap planter in a marble lobby, looking--or in this case sounding--good with the rest of the functional decor, but really contributing nothing in terms of taste or intelligence. Ladies, you look and sound nice and you'll probably sell a million records--but it's no excuse for success to become a crutch.

There are so many reasons why it is so good. Every song is so good on the album it could be a #1 hit on the top 20 CCM countdown (kinda like SCC and Speechless). Also, the variety is so good. They use an EXCELLENT selection of upbeat, mellow, fast, slow, deep, and simple expressions of music all over their beautiful voices.Great upbeat songs: PRAISE FOREVERMORE, BEGIN WITH MEGreat mellow songs: YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE, BLUE SKIES, YES I BELIEVEFREE TO FLY is worth 10 stars, so my 5 will simply have to do for now, but if you are a mild fan, a fan, or even are attracted to this group, THIS IS the album of choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JOB WELL DONE !! -- ONCE AGAIN!!","review":"Well, what can I say! Point of grace have delivered it once again!. If you are a fan of PoG then let me tell you that this release is awesome. Their style of singing, which has amazed the world for a long time is even better in this. Tracks like, \\"By Heart\\", \\"You will never walk alone\\" \\"Blue skies\\" are just too good. \\"Something So Good\\" is a great song sung to a rock style.

Now, it is the only thing I've played this week.I cannot say which song is my favorite. I would say \\"Yes, I Believe\\" is one such song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible","review":"What else can I say about these four wonderful ladies. Just when we thought that they could not top \\"Steady On\\", they come back with another exceptional masterpiece. \\"Blue Skies\\" is a triumphant epic of praise and adoration.

Boy, was I wrong.Only two of the essays were really thought-provoking: Lauren Baratz-Logsted's essay on Austen's heirs in chick-lit and Karen Joy Fowler's discussion of Austen's modern audience. However, I also enjoyed Jo Beverly's interesting exploration of women's economic prospects in Austen's period, which brought Elizabeth Bennet's budget into modern terms.Lawrence Watt-Evans' essay on war in Austen (or the absence of war in Austen) was very thorough if somewhat out-of-place.Aside from these stand-outs, the other essays are, for the most part, musings on Austen's relevance to the authors' personal lives -- light, amusing fare. Some of them are rewritings or sequels of part of Austen's own work, and I can't evaluate these: I found them tiresome, but perhaps that's just because they weren't what I wanted from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Pop (so true!)","review":"This collection of dates with Jane Austen has something for everyone, and the diversity of the essays points to the continuing popularity of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Several writers examine Austen as The Mother of All Chick-lit, leading the reader to wonder at the esteem in which Austen is held, while the thousands of books she spawned languish in their pink ghettos. Several writers examine details of Austen's world, while others freely enter in to it, and still others drag her into the 21st century.I don't know when I've enjoyed a collection of essays so much. A few of the writers I've read elsewhere, but many are new to me. Not all of the twenty-five perspectives offered will appeal equally, but all are well-written, informative, and amusing.

I haven't tried this with anything other than trail mix so I can't comment on dispensing of nuts or just candy with this item. It is fairly easy to clean and sturdy enough for daily use.

The careful composition of human body, objects and background, sometimes with cross-reference to classical paintings, invites a surreal, poetic, and miserable feeling.If you only think that his photos are terrible, you need more time and more patience to read his images, through understanding. Extract from what Witkin said - 'When people see my work, there is no 'grey area' of response.

I saw a commercial for the movie first and the next day I was in a book store. I was brosing the shelves and there it was! I bought the book and didn't let it down until I finished it.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie St. Cloud Review","review":"This book is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It went by so quickly I was sad when it eventually came to an end. It's not a girlie 'romance novel' by any means as it is from the perspective of a man and there's much more to it than what's on the surface. Especially recommended for anyone with an interest in sailing! Truly great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is the saddest, most remarkable, touching, inspiring, incredible story of all time.

Best book ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much more than the movie","review":"Saw the movie first, which lead me to read the book. I must say, I enjoyed the book so much more.

After intending to get to it several times, I finally read it last weekend while staying in a hotel in connection with another activity. I found the story credible, and deeply moving. The author is straight-forward: We don't really know what happens to the soul when someone dies, but our imaginations might just reveal the truth. I lost someone important in my life two years ago, and still think about what it means. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a novel that deals creatively with this issue, suggesting new insights. You either buy it or you don't.

Ben Sherwood is an articulate, sensitive author, who leaves no stone unturned in assuring his reader understands each emotion his character experiences.

After seeing the trailer for the movie, I immediately ran to the bookstore to purchase this. What a disappointment! The story had the potential to make a great work of fiction. Instead, it was overly sentimental, tacky, and quite frankly, vain. Love at first sight, sex with a woman you've known for a 24 hours, thoughts of suicide: these are ingredients for a half decent Lifetime movie, not literature. It's an easy read well suited for a summer afternoon, but you may loose a few brain cells along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"Deeply derivative, with vomit-inducing sentimentallity.

I was happy that it is still available."},{"rating":"2","title":"NY Tendaberry by Laura Nyro","review":"The 1969 classic tome from La Nyro not only holds up well, but acts like a clarion beacon to wake up and small the Hailburton in a way that still cajoles, entices and alarms us.Clear as a bell as far as I am concerned.We miss you Miss Laura."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"I didn't give this album one star because the music is poor-- it's not, the music is great.But it is ill-served on this remaster.Be warned that this is NOT a 2008 version of 'Tendaberry', rather it is the 2002 version. The 2002 edition was marred by thin sound, particularly through the middle of the CD.I bought this thinking that the 2008 date meant it was going to be an improvement. I'm not going to send it back (it's so cheap), yet I do feel like a sucker."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album deserves 6 stars","review":"The earth stood still for me the moment I heard this record. Being a youngster ( I am 19 ), I was never really able to appreciate the value of an artist like Laura Nyro. But all of that changed when my mother played the album one day, while we were just relaxing. At first I thought to myself, \\"Who is this mad woman?\\" but then I just closed my eyes and sat back and there I was immersed in all of her pain, joy, sorrow and darkness.I was there with her, I felt her aches and pains and her joys and delights, right from to soft intro of You don't Love Me When I Cry to the emotional ending to an exquisite piece, New York Tendaberry. It moved me so much I had to go out and by the cd for myself.After that point Laura became my sanity and she has and still does continue to see me through my darkest times. If you don not have this album you are missing out on a woman who puts Madonna, Sarah Machlaughlin, Tori Amos and the rest of them to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"This is one of the best albums ever made. It is a sparkling galaxy of emotion in the form of sound. Only a true artist would have had the guts to make this recording. I have been listening to this for decades and I still can't believe how good it is. It takes you in and makes you live every note as if it were coming from inside of you. There has never been a more soulful recording of any kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Love This","review":"Our turntable broke about, oh, I don't know, maybe 25 years ago. It's been at least that long since I have listened to Laura. It was an accident that I stumbled across this CD. It was like an evening spent with an old friend. Laura's voice, range, and energy is unique and powerful. I am not an audiophile by any stretch, I do think the sound on this seemed less rich, maybe kind of tinnier, than I rememebr from my LP. Still, so happy to re-connect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is Surely Gospel","review":"Follow the link to the second part of a three-part appreciation of Laura Nyro's work on jazzadvance.com:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the 2008 VERSION ! ! ! ! !","review":"This review is NOT a review of the great Laura Nyro's \\"New York Tenderberry\\" but of the RECORDING QUALITY! They are telling you that this is the 2008 edition. It is NOT! It is the 2002 issue which has HORRIBLE recording quality. VERY TINNY sounding. Horrible. The label Pure Pleasure Records added the album into their catalog, on 2008. The re-mastering was made by Ray Staff using the original analog tapes, and brings the original artwork in a gatefold cover. Just be aware of the fact that although Amazon is describing this as the 2008 issue, IT IS NOT! I already had the 2002 before I bought this. It's the same one. I FINALLY got my hands on the 2008 version. It is PERFECT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but not the original!","review":"It has been about 30 years since I listened to this album. But even I can tell that some of these songs are not the versions on the original album. For the most part it's great... but there are moments of disappointment when someone's idea of a better arrangement has, for some reason, crept in. I'm one of Laura's biggest fans, and she was instrumental in keeping me on this earth. Messing with the original tracks is a bit like colorizing a black and white movie.

On the back of the book it says the user level is intermediate-advanced. I think this book is for new users who have never used UNIX only. Also I feel the title is misleading. The design model is not explained well throughout the book and the author does not teach you how to think UNIX."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough information","review":".. to be much use in reality. Scant information interspersed with tiresome and even occassionally glib remarks. A very disappointing book for two reasons; the amount of information provided and the style in which author eeks it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unix from the inside looking out","review":"Funny, unorthodox, well organized, this book is a great survey of the unix family of OSes, useful both for newcomers to the system with basic computing familiarity & for those who (like me) have used & learned unix haphazardly for years.The first chapter, rather than teaching you frequently-used commands & their options, describes how to find & decipher documentation! The heart (or possibly the lymphatic system) of unix is figuring stuff out for yourself --not an easy matter if you don't know how to find out what you want to know or interpret what you've found. If you've ever stared at a man page, wondering what was wrong with your brain that you couldn't understand a word of something so detailed & apparently written in English, this book is for you!Subsequent chapters describe files (everything in unix is a file), processes, redirection & pipes, networking, regular expressions, shells, etc. --a holistic overview of unix as a complete system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I bought this book a while ago, but only recently got around to reading it. That's the amazing part about this book... the fact that it's readable! Most Linux/Unix books I've seen are the most boring reading material there is. Not so with this one.Jon really knows how to keep it entertaining, while still providing an excellent introduction to [ li | u ]nix. I found myself wanting to try the examples for sheer interest and challenge. He also goes into using pipes, and teaches you how to use them effectively.Yes, this is a great introduction, that's all it was meant to be, and it fills it's purpose superbly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Supplement for the *nix Novice","review":"After using Linux and Solaris at different jobs for the past year, I had enough knowledge to get around and write my Perl programs. I bought 'Think Unix' to give me the background and understanding that would help me to become a 'Power User' with this OS. I was not disappointed.At first I was a bit wary of how basic the book starts off, but Lasser starts small and works his way up to some incredibly useful explanations of the seemingly endless amount *nix utilities. More importantly, the book lives up to its name, it teaches the reader to use utilities such as sed, awk & vi in a powerful way by incorperating pipes and I/O redirects.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a more effective *nix user, although it's important this person has a prior basic understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think Unix is great","review":"I received Think Unix as a present, and it is absolutely great! there are clear examples of how to perform shell commands and more with optional exercises to test your knowledge of what you have read. Some of the most outstanding information in this book for me was on permissions, piping, shell scripts, & counting loops.I highly recommend this book for people getting started in Unix/Linux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly good product - bad condition","review":"The book was listed as \\"new\\", but arrived as anything but new. The cover was dogeared, the pages were ruffled, and there was markings on the edges of the pages in black marker. It looked like a reject from a lending library. When I contacted the seller, they advised that the book had been only read once. How is this new? Anyway, I returned the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"well detailed, one of the best in collection,a masterpiece","review":"I liked this book very much.It deserves a 5 star rating because it tells a wonderful story of how Rocky Ridge farm started.Anyone interested in Little House would love the Rocky Ridge years and this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect 1st. Drum","review":"I purchased this drum for my son who is seven months old. He loves it and it is so well made and sturdy that he can use it to push up on as he explores standing (this is not the intended purpose of the drum and it is not safety rated for children under 5 so supervision/judgement is required). It has an awesome sound that is pleasant to hear especially with the two included mallets. It is a \\"real\\" drum and will be entertaining for years to come since I enjoying booming around on it myself. Consider giving this as a gift for a unique present that will last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good drum but misleading ad","review":"Ordered 2 sizes of the Remo drum for my grandson. They each came with 2 mallets. Thats OK except due to the misleading ad we ordered another mallet in a \\"Amazon Special\\" Ended up with 2 drums and 5 mallets. To add insult to injury, we had to pay frieght on the single mallet. Grandson loves drums but this is the first time I felt ripped off by a Amazon ad. Also, ad did not give ages for kids. On the large drum it is for children 5 and older. For the smaller drum it is designed for ages 3 and older. My little guy is only 1 but loves the drums. Just needs to be watched."},{"rating":"2","title":"great drum","review":"This drum is great. It is very well made and has a nice strong sound.

We got the rower quickly from Amazon and unit had been dropped, plastic housing was cracked, so I returned it, not wanting to take chances on the innards being defective after such a visible blow. (plus, when I spend this much money, I want the product to be pristine upon arrival) Amazon was great and arranged for pickup and reorder of replacement. Received the second one in a very timely manner, and it had very similar damage. I'm thinking the whole overseas shipment may have been dropped. So we're returning the second one and trying the Kettler Coach. We hope Kettler does a better job with their product packaging!(The machine did feel sturdy and was very quiet, it is very frustrating to send it back a second time.) Thanks to Amazon for fast return and replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality","review":"This is a very good quality machine especially for home puposes. I did not use the heart feature but the machine works very well. Its easy to install. The only thing you may want to take note is that the seat goes in from the back of the machine. ( its a bit unclear in the manual), otherwise the machine works well and is great for a workout for people who like a rowing machine.It stores easily and even rolls on a hard floor, does not roll well on carpet. Its a nice model and they have good customer service. One thing I may point out, if you have hip arthritis, you might want to contact your Dr. first as when you lean forward your knees end up high above your waist line, which would be fine for most, but for someone with bad hip arthritis or someone with a hip replacement this may be something to consider. Enjoy your workout and I hope this helps in your decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 different albums","review":"I see terrible confusion over this album. There were 3 different releases with this title.The one with the lovely pink portrait was her 1989 CD (Signature AK 45256) with all vocals by her, and no Bobby Hackett.Bobby Hackett's was from 1973, with 3 vocals by her. That's a Bobby Hackett album. Apparently it was also reissued as a CD in 1989 or 1990, on Signature AK 40234. The cover picture is Hackett with trumpet.There was also a 1995 Bob Thiele album of instrumentals plus 3 other vocals by Teresa. Red Baron JK 64602 (Sony).Her recordings of the title song are yet another story. It was not on the Hackett album.

I needed an extension cord for the aftermarket type of XBox controller that typically have a very short cord (that you don't find out until you open the damm thing) and don't have the break-away connector like the original controllers do. The connector for this extension ONLY fits the break-away plug so it's useless for my needs, so I was chumped. I need an extension with a connector that has a female connection that's same as the one on the Xbox itself and it's difficult to glean that from the discriptions, so be advised. Now if I could just find an extension with male and female Xbox connectors...but it's not looking too good."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work with S controller","review":"This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller.

I've been very happy with my Sony DAT recorder - it's an older model, but they're very high quality and have all the inputs and outputs you want. Hi-MiniDisk is potentially going to be the final nail in the coffin, however, because tape has reliability issues and doesn't last as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for iPhoto 6","review":"This is a good book.

The Moog series VSTs are somewhat less attractive that, say ARP VST. They all are CP memory-consuming plug-ins that also require sound cards with good latency characteristics (otherwise you have to play the instrument in MIDI mode with a reduced latency, allowing for clicks and pops to appear, and then increase the latency before the recording is mixed down to an audio file). The Moog series have lots of factory settings that mostly out of the range of pleasant and purposeful sounds. It is often hard to use them either as leads or bass sounds, and they need to be tweaked so some extent. Besides, some of the sounds are overwhelming and destroy the rest of the sounds in your recording. If you're after bass sounds, I'd suggest the Arp 2600 VST instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duty and Honor","review":"The underlying theme of honor and respect permeates this fast paced story of a most unusual happening. Stephen Lodge has captured the essence of Texican pride and stubborn persistence as Cowboys chase Nazis across the hard desert mountains of southwest Texas. Using vintage WW1 planes, old trucks and cowboys on horseback, the action never slows. The author's intimate knowledge of the Big Bend country, along with his realistic dialogue takes the reader on a most intriguing journey.Based on a real story during WW2, the touching camaraderie between sworn enemies makes this an outstanding adventure.Shadows of Eagles is destined to become one of the great stories of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinny sound","review":"Cd Radio is styled nicely but quality is poor.

The buttons on the radio aren't named the same as the ones on the remote, so by the time you figure out how to operate it, you have to relearn how to do the same thing on the remote.

The second half deals with contemporary authors dealing with the inheretance, no pun intended!I would suggest Romanides' \\"The Ancestral Sin\\" for a more detailed telling which also takes into account the Eastern Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Sin: Origins, Developments, Comtemporary Meanings","review":"I'm not really all that far into this book, but the Introduction literally captured my attention. I am most impressed with the author's(Tatha Wiley) approach to discussing the subject. I choose it because I wanted a fair reading on the doctrine of original sin, particularly its relevance in early Christianity and how it evolved into doctrine which is a foundation of Christianity, without which Christianity appears to have a very weak base for the purpose of the life of Jesus. But it does require a fair hearing without personal prejudice to grasp the subject itself. I've enjoyed what I've read so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad craziness in sheep country","review":"I think the reviewer who called this book a \\"Big Dissappointment\\" is too concerned with politics and not concerned enough about keeping the buzz alive.Which is what this book is all about. I would much rather read Fear and Loathing in Elko over Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.As for some of his old writings being rehashed, what's wrong with that? Considering that HST has documented most of his life, and this book is supposed to be a memoir, isn't it natural that some of his old work would show up again?Whip out this book at night over a cold beer, and you'll be glad you did.Did anyone else find the poem that was included on page 242 (Knock, Knock--Who's There?) to be exceptionally beautiful?I did a search for this Edward T.

He has always been a personal fave, but his later books have lacked the energy of the earlier works.But, he can still turn a phrase. \\"Its better to be shot out of a cannon, than squeezed out of a tube.\\"This book has the \\"jumbled\\" story lines that have appeared in his later work. It makes it harder to read than it ought to be.I shouldn't be reading HST while living in my current vortex of anger and frustration. Know where I can get a Kevlar vest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shadow of Hunter","review":"Somehow, I expected this book by Hunter to be edgier than it is. The cover certainly gives the impression (with HST, drink in hand, giving the finger, smoking a cigarette in an elevator with a No Smoking sign above him) that we are really gonna be in for a hell of a ride. The book disappoints.However, I did find his reflections on the day after 9/11 to be quite interesting. Even prophetic. And his trip to Cuba sort of fizzles; we never get to read how the trip ends. Or what his impressions were. Or who he got to meet. This could have really been illuminating---but Hunter just drops the trip. Stops writing about it. Provides no clarity into what his impressions of Cuba were forty years after the revolution.It seems that his lifestyle had taken a toll on his ability to write a coherent book. Compare this to Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail---and you find this book to just be a shadow of the man who so aptly described the McGovern campaign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Smoking in the No Smoking Section","review":"I spend most of my day starring into the oblivion that life has become. After reading this book I had a desire to tour the U.S. I wanted the empty sky to be my only witness. A good writer should be able to inspire the reader. Dr. Thompson was able to stir a real emotion in me. Yes another 20-something who is drowning in the worst emotion, my friends, apathy. Thank God there is a writer such as HST who writes about the truth. Mahlo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius","review":"This is a very strong work by a very strong artist. Even though it is a latter work of his, it's a great place for someone new to or for someone who has never heard of HST to be formally introduced.

Maybe this should be the second HST volume you read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom of Fear","review":"The is the best writing I have ever read from Thompson.

A must have for every Thompson freak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still great.","review":"Having read a good quantity of HST's other works, the amazing Fear and Loathing (in Las Vegas), On the Campaign Trail, Great Shark Hunt and the truly vitriolic Obituary for Richard Nixon (freely available on the Net, and also a must-read for fans of HST), I was really looking forward to reading this. I wasn't disappointed, because I love the surreal (and the political) edge that he brings to everything that he casts his eye over, to the point where the line between fantasy and reality doesn't just blur, it tends to disappear, altogether. A classic example of this, is the chapter where Hunter runs across Judge Clarence Thomas driving two surly hookers through sheep country - Wow! It couldn't possibly be real, but it's so vivid, it's jumping off the page. If you have a taste for the surreal and the original, this is very enjoyable stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gonzo Time Capsule","review":"Sure HST has done this before, but just like any good musician you still return to what you do best. It is a very interesting book, insightful and funny as hell. I recommend this book to everyone, Thompson is still a very important and genuine writer in the U.S. and this book proves that he's still on top of our culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN","review":"Hunter used to be a man who used a pen like a weapon, but a fine weapon like a rapier. This time it's a bludgeon, and Hunter has obviously lost his touch. He comes across as an angry, drunk old bigot.He used to offend in an effort to open they eyes of the naive, but here he is simply a Democratic party hack, toeing the political line. There is nothing new in this book, unless you consider open hatred of those religiously or ethnically different from the author. Pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of his best work ever!","review":"By far simply one of his best collections.

We're promised a revealing memoir here; instead, we get a mishmash of tales told many times before. There are still flashes of the old Thompson wit and narrative power, but the energy and focus he brought to his classic works of the seventies has long since vanished."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"If you must read only one book on Philippine food and culture, this is it! The book is a real tease. It tells you a little about textures of food and the weave of Filipino life and leaves you hungering for more. It contains many vignettes on regional food in the Philippines and the quaint practices of the people who belong to that region. This is not a recipe book. If you have read The Man Who Ate Everything and enjoyed it, then this is for you.

Red Pine's commentary allows the reader to work somewhat directly with this utterly straightforward statement of an impossible reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent companion for those wanting to know more","review":"I read this over the past few wks in conjunction with a 6-wk class on the heart sutra at a local zen ctr. Red Pine has a fluid, informative writing style. He goes thru the relatively short sutra line-by-line, explaining words, their meanings, and interpreting the text. It's helpful that he also includes interpretation of each line from prior authors/historians. There's an excellent, long, well written glossary at the end that explains many Sanskrit and Buddhist words and their meanings. This alone would make the book worth its price. For those just exploring the heart sutra or wanting to study it in depth, this book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prajnaparamita explained to the nth degree","review":"Red Pine is a Buddhist scholar for sure. He does take some very deep looks at a very short set of verse; Prajnaparamita. I can think of no one else that can take 7 verses and spread them out into a tome such as this. Anyway; if you are looking to dig very very deeply into the Heart Sutra then by all means grab this book by Red Pine. If you would like to get a nice gist that covers most of what Red covers in a fraction of the number of pages then I recommend Thich Nhat Hanh's :The Heart of Understanding: Commentaries on the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra. It is much more digestible to the average Buddhist.Overall this is a very deep look at a beautiful set of verses in the Perfection of Wisdom discourses. If you want to hear solid teaching on this by all means grab this book by Red Pine.Thank you for reading my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game's Great, but Guitar Stinks","review":"I purchased the \\"no-name\\" red fancy guitar for my son for Christmas and within 2 hours it started malfunctioning so we sent it back for another of the same.

The record as a whole, though, is lacking any kind of edge or rawness to it. It just seems watered down, and as if the band didn't want to do it and couldn't be bothered. There is simply no energy to it. Alot of people buy La Folie just for the track Golden Brown. If you are about to join that group of people, DON'T!

The sweetest song ever written about smack.Other standouts for me are 'Tramp' 'Pin up' 'Non Stop' and the spoken French title track. Classic Stranglers - melancholy, maverick; world-weary and weird.This CD reissue is marred only by the inclusion of 'Cruel Garden' a later b-side, which although a nice song, sits incongruously with the rest of the collection.

I love the type of mysteries surrounding a character like his Gideon Oliver; an academic and forensic anthropologist rather than a cop. All of the G.O. mysteries are set in interesting places, and all have a good dose of physical anthropology. This particular one is set near a glacier (which holds the mystery) in Alaska. And in terms of suspense, setting, and how the science was used to \\"crack the case\\", I think \\"Icy Clutches\\" is the best of the series. MUCH better than the somewhat dragging \\"Old Bones\\", the one which won an Edgar Award. If you like the mystery genre and want some reading that is quick yet satisfying, I recommend all the Gideon Oliver books; but especially \\"Icy Clutches\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Moody has done it again!!","review":"Sweet Redemption by Ms Moody is a pungent novel about love and the costs and trials can demand from us. The story of Shannelle drawns you instantly into this novel. Her husband Alex is a controller (but rightfully so- given his circumstances). It's to accept what Shannelle has to endure. Ms Viv ( Shanelle's so-called mother) is a character that needs to be reckoned with. The characters are well written in this plot. The novel will keep you reading until you finish. I look forward to \\"Love's Twilight\\" (the sequel) - there has to be some justice for Shanelle.

Very seamless and easy.Now to the watch: I travel overseas and across multiple time zones and this watch was exactly what I was looking for combining function and form. This watch does that well. It looks great (just a tad thick but not too bad) and the way you can swap out time zones is great.

Impossible to download songs onto. I followed the directions to a \\"T,\\" but only one song (which he did not want, anyhow) would download. Nothing else would download.

Having a 1\\" screen does not make this player worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough memory","review":"I purchased this for my 8 year old for Christmas and thought I would be able to store more than just a few songs, but the memory capacity is actually only 109M and will actually only hold about 8-10 songs, no where near the 2 hours promised. I would not recommend this purhcase to any child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy....in my opinion","review":"I brought one for my 14 year old son (at his request) for Christmas and he loves his. I decided I wanted a mp3 player, but decided to get one of these for myself just so that I could get adjusted to the technology. So far, it works great for me. I have about 25 - 30 songs on mine and it still has a little more memory left. I made sure I deleted the video clips that were installed on it before I started adding music since they take up a lot of space. I will admit that it took me about 10 - 15 minutes to figure out how to get the music on in. (thank goodness for a 14 year old to help out) But once I got the hang of it, it was a breeze. I will probably buy better headphones but I think it was a good buy overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment!","review":"This looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself.

Then when I tried to contact Hasbro I could not. Their phones were always busy I couldnt get thru at all. They did not answer my emails.

I listened to each Beatles' song and read the book as I listened. There are hundreds of mistakes throughout the book and the songs are not complete.

I've had it for quite a while and every so often I decided to pull it out to double check the words to a song. I end up spending the next few minutes drawing arrows from one part to another, now they may have fixed this, but from the edition I have practically every song is out of order, and some are flat out missing lines. It'd be as if I just went and decided to write all the lyrics I could remember and not deciding to double check and not bothering to even listen to the songs.I just wonder what on earth happened and I hope they find the body of the editor someday, poor guy, died right before he could get to this... too bad he put it in the \\"out\\" pile.Oh, well, don't even think of buying it unless you like to draw arrows in books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe I got a lemon","review":"This desk seems to get great reviews, but when I got mine (after waiting a little over a month) it didn't have all of the holes drilled into it to correctly put it together.

However the glue must not have held well in transit as the support arms were off when I opened the package... and when I tried to screw them in (it's supposed to be screwed in to start with according to the instructions) it was evident the holes were stripped and the quick fix was glue... not sure if it was the work of a prior owner or the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Disappointed in the quality was not what I thought.

You make a pic with one color, then two and so on.If you are a TRUE beginner , buy this book, You Can Paint Pastels by Marie Blake, and Pastel Workbook by Jackie Simmonds.

Penny Arkade captured the essence of that sound and this disc is the first chance for many people to hear them. While some of the tracks aren't quite as good as others, they're all surprisingly listenable and a couple really stand out. \\"Lights of Dawn\\", for example, should have been on the radio. \\"Country Girl\\" is another one I particularly like, and it's here that you can really feel the folk-country crossover influence of Mike Nesmith.Anyone with a fondness for Byrds/Donovan/etc. (and the later Nesmith-influenced Monkees songs) should give this disc a try. It's a shame the world never knew of the potential this group had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Elegant !","review":"We received this in a timely manner, and it's very beautiful and elegant.

A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Investing techniques written for the layperson...","review":"Steve Wirrick has taken investing for the average person to the next level. This book outlines powerful techniques that will allow you to potentially achieve return you never thought possible. The book does a good job of explaining options strategies, fundamental chart reading, and some ideas of what to look for to stack the odds in your favor. Steve does this thru simple language that the average person can understand, and compliments this with plenty of visual examples. He also does a good job of helping you identify what types of strategies would be more conducive to your personality, so you can find your own comfort area. Finally, he outlines some approaches to determine if options are overpriced, under priced, or fairly priced. Overall, very good information. I would however suggest applying these principles via paper trading before putting your own money on the line...your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Octane Education","review":"Having bought, read & studied many books on the stock market, I finally found one that is easy to understand and USE.

See for instance the reviews between Feb 07 and Feb 11 of 2004. It's amazing how many reviews appear in sequence - sometimes five a day - giving this book 5 stars. Short sentences that appear were written by the same person. Check yourself...That's why I always look at the \\"most helpful reviews\\", before buying a book. I certainly won't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vague lead-in to his other materials","review":"From the authors' website you can pay up to $595 or more for his course, or $129 a month for other materials. So what can you expect from a $29 book? I went through the first 100 pages in about a half-hour. The book takes the angle that you know absolutely nothing about trading. The trading strategies are worthwhile but elementary and nothing you can't find in most beginners books. Intermediate or experienced traders will be disappointed. The book deals very little with the mechanics of trading and is mostly a \\"hopes and dreams\\" lead-in to other courses or materials. The author may have more precise strategies, but you won't find them here."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Octane Options a better name is Lame Options","review":"I have bought dozens of books on trading and options this is one of the most watered down, lame books I have read yet.

Marsalis and the LCJO get a chance to take on the master and they do the DUKE justice.

It is filled with action, lovestories, and suspense. Luke McCan is an everyday cowpoke whose life gets turn every which way as he tries to figure out his lot in life. As one meets McCan, his friends, and the love in his life, one can easily relate to the things that are happening to him. Once you have read Timbercreek, you MUST also read Fiddler and McCan. It is the second part of Luke McCan's story. I really enjoyed these two books and highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a different book","review":"I eagerly anticipated reading this book as Lee Childs had recommended it and I really like his Jack Reacher novels.

But Angel Fire, which I believe is her first book, was only \\"ok\\". I found myself skipping pages in the early part of the book, then it improved considerably.

If you like Marley, and you like electronic music, then this would be a welcome addition to any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think BOB would like this one ....","review":"I bought this CD under the assumption that it would be remixed in more of a dub style. Boy was I wrong! This CD is remixed with a major rave/house music flavor. It just didn't seem right listening to these wonderful songs done in such a manor! I cannot wait to rid of this CD - I am disgusted to have it in my collection. Shame on me for not researching it more before purchasing it ....

This shampoo removes all of the product build up and still leaves my hair really soft. I use it in conjunciton with Joico KPak cuticle sealer and reconstructor to make my hair strong, yet manageable. I also use another brand's deep conditioner and I would recommend everyone use a deep conditoner after using an intensive protein shampoo and reconstructor like the KPak line.Also, as was stated in the review below, you should probably only use the Chelating shampoo about once, maybe twice, a month. It really does strip everything from your hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE PRODUCT! NO BARCODE ON BOTTLE!","review":"This was a bogus joico knock-off.

To help the reader's understanding, the author follows each story with a brief explanation and discussion, along with a personal and spiritual example of the story in the author's own life and writing. Yet, since within the author's worldview there is no division between this level of reality and the metaphysical, her explanations are often as complex as the stories. Though categorized as folklore and mythology, this book might as likely be found in the religious section of any Native American bookstore or library. It will appeal to anyreader interested in the human story.

Most of the film is filmed with the couple lying on a bed surrounded by drapes, plants, and stands in front of a blue screen of psychedulics. The room spins constantly at a fair clip. And you get to see it in 3d...woo hoo. Fact is, for 65% of the film the subject and the massage is obscured by plants, drapes, and furniture constantly spinning to block the people. And the spinning bugged my eyes. I imagine it might even make some people anuseous. It is really quite silly, even stupid. They spend a few minutes on technique, then repeat everythign for several minutes on a spinning bed. Then repeat with 3 minutes of more techniques, spin, repeat. Taoist massage may not be as mainstream as others, but it doesn't have to be of so little substance. The voice over is a bit droning.

Many of the poor reviews for this video are actually for Volume 2.I didn't know anything about massage before watching this video so I found it very informative. It even explained terms from Swedish massage like effleurage and petrissage. The models did a good job demonstrating lots of different strokes on their partners.

It's soft and snuggly and pretty simple (my daughter just wore it over her long-sleeved jammies since it has no sleeves). I would say that this is probably more appropriate for a baby over 3 or 4 months old, because it's a little long, and therefore the top and bottom sort of flop over.

Compare the explanation of Atman as being like an Indian fig tree (the one-tree forest) to Jesus' statement \\"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\\" Compare the verse that Atman \\"Is called the Bright; there is no path to Brahman outside of Atman\\" to \\"I am the Way and the Truth and the Light; none come to the Father except through me.\\"After a while, you might realize that the Upanishads are the source text of the New Testament.Or you may not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"One good track - Betty Carter.

Every time he does a girl's voice, I want to throw up. If this were a children's story, it would be fine. But this is supposed to be a book for adults.

She brings her considerable talents to this album, featuring an excellent variety of songs including \\"Crazy\\", \\"Stormy Weather\\", \\"Round Midnight\\" to her double does of Bond covers, \\"Goldfinger\\" and \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\".Her take on \\"Is That All There Is\\" is sublime as is her take on \\"To Sir, With Love\\" and her Bond covers are perfect for her stellar voice.I fear this album will be overlooked but I hope the positive word of mouth spreads."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thrill Is Gone!","review":"This is just my subjective opinion... I think this collectionof tunes by one of my favorite artists is just ok. It's notnot something that I want to hear more than once in a blue moon.It would have been better had she just done an album only halffull of standards- and then added some fresh new material toround it out. Her voice is raspier than i've heard it, but shedoes add a unique interpretive twist to these old standards.

I listen to it once,and was like WTF. She is not even trying to sing on this CD. I thought her last CD with Prince \\"Come into my house\\" was great. I like her jazz songs,but this CD is her worst. Maybe this is the best we will get out of her now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit&Miss","review":"back in the day I always Chaka Khan but I never really dug Her Solo Albums all the way through. dug Her Singles which have showcased Her Versatility over the years. this Album doesn't really best suit Her. the thing with Chaka is that maybe 2-3 standards on a album is cool,but anything past 5 songs is asking a bit too much. the material here doesn't fit her for a whole Project.

Rock/Jam/World Beat/Bluegrass","review":"This is one amazing band! The fact that this was recorded live at the Telluride Bluegrass festival shouldn't fool you into thinking this is another bluegrass/newgrass band. These guys ROCK ala Allman Bros/Santana/Dead/Pink Floyd etc! Electric and acoustic guitars are surrounded by an amazing rhythm section of drums, congas, Indian tablas and a killer bass player, and supported by an excellent keyboardist. This show is an excellent snapshot of a band destined to greatness (probably sooner than later). Get the album and look for them playing live in your area. They're touring nationally, and the venues are going to get bigger and bigger as people get hip to what these folks can do with Rock/Funk/Bluegrass/Indian/Latin/Jazz grooves.

I recently tried burning the remaining votives in a more traditional container that conformed to their shape and, again, they burned quickly and in an uneven pattern, sometimes with a large flame, to the point that I had to remove them from the table after about an hour because watching them carefully was getting in the way of entertaining. The flames on these candles are scary to observe. Also, there is not even a hint of a honey scent when they burn.

However, it is not very organized. The author is evidently very knowledgeable in the field. The problem with this book is that it does not clearly explain the concepts that it introduces. This book is meant to be an introduction to assembly language, but it is not really so. I don't think the author clearly explains the theory. I have worked with much better written books than this one. This book should be used as reference, if anything, rathen than as a guide or text book for an introductory course in assembly.

I find out the many examples in the textbook are very simple and are not very useful. Secondly, the explanation for the basic concept is pretty hard to understand.

Ever.","review":"This was my only text for a semester course in Assembly Programming. I failed the course. Miserably. The author jumps around all over the place, using advanced concepts in early examples with no explanation whatsoever. nor does the book follow a logical plan of building in one chapter on what was taught in the previous chapter. the completely non-linear design and 'flow' of the book condemn it to being virtually unintelligible to beginners such as myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is TERRIBLE","review":"This is by far the most poorly organized programming book I have ever read. The author repeatedly refers to subject matter he has not yet discussed and asks review questions on material to be adressed in later chapters. Assembly language is described in such a bizzaire, structureless, ad hoc manner that one feels as if they are being subjected to whimsical tutorage. The author presents one topic, and then moves on to something completly different never building upon previous knowledge, and puts the finishing touches on his patheticism by referencing subjects that are not addressed for another several chapters. The worst programming book I've ever read - use only for firewood or paperweights."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference for the CPU and ASM","review":"I've been programming in high-level languages for a number of years and this book took the little bits of knowledge I had of hardware and other obscurities and put them all together.

The only problem I had as a novice Assembly programmer was the few code mistakes and Irvine assumed that the reader knew a little too much in the first couple of chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very organized book","review":"I am in the process of taking assembly language programming now. We are using this book and I find it very confusing and very hard to follow. The author jumps from one thing to the next often referring to things taught in future chapters.

The instructor opted to use this book as the text for the course. First, the book is riddled with typos that are serious errors which can confuse a student into a state of mindless frustration. I would like to write a lengthy review, but for the sake of brevity, I can tell all in the few words that follow. In short, I shelved the book during the duration of the course and read \\"Peter Norton's Assembly Language Guide.\\" I received a 4.0 (A) in the course which others who continued using the Irvine book struggled to make a passing mark. If all the errors are corrected in the text, this might be a worthwhile reference, but as it stands, it's more damaging than helpful.

They wanted me to call around and find someone to repair the Delonghi ac and have that person join their network of service providers so that I could get my ac repaired under their warranty. This is a worthless warranty. They will take your money and then do nothing. Which brings us to J&R Music, the sellers of this worthless product.

They released four studio albums from 1984-88, but for whatever reason never quite found the success that their peers in Ratt and Motley Crue achieved. Musically the band had a sound that was equal parts Ratt and King Kobra. It was definitely L.A. hair metal, but instead of being overly sleazy it had an AOR polish.In 2005, Majestic Records reissued all four Black \`n Blue studio albums with digitally remastered sound. They also released a limited edition box set that included all four albums as well as a bonus DVD. As you can see, the packaging leaves something to be desired, but for those who missed the Black \`n Blue albums the first time around or want to get all four remasters in one shot, it's a pretty good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Punk Rock and a Stolen Band Name","review":"I have heard 4 of the songs on this cd and while they do not sound awful, they are purely recycled blend of a bunch of Epitaph Bands that did this a generation ago. F.Face is probably their best song, which is why they put it first on the album. The overall performance is lackluster and un-inspiring. Not to mention that they stole the band name from someone else and then trademarked it before sending threatening communications to them. The original Cab Assassin formed in the D.C. area and began using the name in 2002. They are not poppy punk rock but more of a post-punk/post-rock sounding project and goes under the name of Lou Albino most of the time.

I was trying to come to grips with several personal issues at once myself: Getting older, changing jobs, past relationships, alcoholism and loneliness. Selleck's character, though older than me, was all too familiar. His performance, as well as the entire cast, brought the story to life in an honest, believable way. The story goes to show that it's okay to have faults. It's also important to recognize who your real friends are and accept their help, too. Lastly, you cannot judge a person by their appearance, either. As Ruby Jean observes, \\"You must be somebody you don't look like.\\" I'm not ashamed to say this movie brings this biker to tears every time I watch it. (Usually on my birthday.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching movie - a slice of life","review":"One of Selleck's great roles and that young girl played a touching and wonderful role as well. She touched my heart, as well as the Joe's girlfriend (another outstanding actress). Excellent through and through and even had an old cowboy (whose name escapes me) who tells Tom the truth about his rodeoing and life. Outstanding. Not many movies touch this \\"oldie but goodie\\" (me) but this one sure did. It struck a cord and I won't forgot it. It was one of those movies I had to IMMEDIATELY search for in hopes of buying it (at this price, no way). Five + stars and thanks to Lifetime TV for putting it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that gives meaning and depth to human values","review":"I saw this movie while visiting my sister in Canada. I rarely watch movies and even less rarely am impressed by a movie. This movie definately has a message and speaks about higher values and the things that really count in life. Ruby Jean is a young girl who has a real innoncence about her, as well as a real strength. Joe is a cowboy who is very much a man, even more so for respecting the young girl that he picks up hitchhiking. A real and lasting friendhip develops, that also has the hint of true love that is to follow. This speaks about our deeper values and the possibilities that we have along life's journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I had never heard of this movie, but I'm glad I found it!

My only problem about giving the book an excellent review was the authors proposition that carp are \\" for the most part evil creatures \\". I found this view to be not only hateful, but completely contradictory to the huge mass of research suggesting the complete opposite.

Nor will I ever own it. I do, however, have it on vinyl. I picked it up cheap from a used record store in Gainesville in the mid 1970s. I have listened to it three times - twice when I purchased it and once a number of years later. While there are a number of excellent musicians on this album, their work is wasted. The songs are trite, with putrid lyrics, and horrible vocals. To paraphrase another reviewer, \\"if you can get past the vocals and the lyrics\\"...I find that IMPOSSIBLE.

Now I'm in my early 50s, and I listened to the sounds on this album for the very first time, thanks to Amazon's sound clips. So, I found out for myself just how awful it really is. Actually, a lot of the instrumental backing is interesting to listen to, and I can clearly hear the influences of these \\"heavy friends\\" in a good way. Unfortunately, the singer is just way too terrible, which ruins the entire thing. But, in a strange way, it was fun listening to these sound clips. This was the album that everyone knew of, but nobody bought, because we all knew how terrible it was, even though we never knew firsthand -- a strange little lp that evolved into a strange little cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cut above its competition","review":"This is an outstanding contribution to the field of publications dealing with Chinese martial arts.

It explains not only the \\"what\\", but also the \\"who\\", \\"why\\" and \\"when\\". In this way, it is not only an invaluable guide to serious students of taijiquan and its sword techniques, but will also appeal to those readers who are interested in the role that martial arts played in late imperial China.

I attended a week-long seminar of Rodell's, and I can say from first-hand experience that he can use his skill with the sword in full-speed, totally unrehearsed situations, which is a very special skill nowadays. \\"Chinese Swordsmanship\\" has clear photos for every movement in two different Yang Family sword forms along with the application for each movement; the applications show Rodell using the jian against a variety of authentic Chinese arms (not just the jian).

I think ill will is going to be the result of this penny minding in construction. Leapfrog could have further enhanced the brand with this product but fumbled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning tool","review":"My 4 yr old special needs daughter loves this game.

My boys, 5 and 3 years old, found this game and checked it out. We got back to the room and started playing, what a great game for learning. The kids almost didn't know they where learning and teaching each other new things. The best thing is when my 3 year old wanted to be incontrol of the \\"spinner\\" and call out the shapes. You know it's money well spent when your kids are having fun and able to learn at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for ages 3-5","review":"My son received this as a gift. It has become the family's favorite game because our son can play too. He works on observation/searching, letters/animals, numbers, shapes/colors, and intro to addition. Our spinner boards were a little warped too but we BENT them backwards and got rid of the warp no problem. The game plays beautifully. Highly recommend to all familys with preschoolers and pre-kindergarteners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even LMN doesn't show this","review":"About to embark on an arranged marriage, the daughter of a Caribbean dictator (Charlotte Ayana) crashes into a poor fisherman (Kuno Becker). Injured, she brings him home to the mansion, where he continues to hurt himself so he can stay and she fights her attraction to the inappropriate suitor while getting ready for her wedding. Meanwhile, the commandant (A Martinez) is off in his own little world since losing his beloved wife, unaware that there is something fishy going on with his government.The acting is pretty bad, with accents all over the place (and a camera fixated on Ayanna's light blue eyes which appeared scary at times). I had a hard time with Esai Morales in this comedy role - he is funny, but not in here - it was like he was channeling Raul Julia as Gomez Adams - a poor imitation at that. It's basically a cheesy Lifetime movie that isn't even good enough for repeat viewings on LMN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Bearable","review":"I rented this film and it sounded somewhat interesting but I was severely disappointed. While the film making was well done for the most part the story itself was very formulaic and a paint by the numbers.

So if you are into prince and the pauper romantic comedies mixed with a little bit of fantasy you'll enjoy it, otherwise pick another film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outside Valentine","review":"I have just finished reading Outside Valentine by Liza Ward.

For example, he says that when Job sat in the ashes that means he went to the dump and sat in those ashes. Since people in that time had fires outside (too hot to be in their homes) for cooking, it wouldn't seem reasonable for him to spend his time at the city dump. Also, he says that Job didn't have boils but probably had elephantiasis. Since the bible tells us that Job had boils and took a broken pot to scrap the wounds (i.e. open up the boils to drain) then it wouldn't seem logical that elephantiasis was his condition since it doesn't involve wounds that can be opened. There are many things like this in the book - things that he can't prove that detract from the book and even the story of Job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"My fiance and I ordered these for our groomsmen as their wedding party gift.

However, despite Whedon's best efforts (or maybe because of them), it still feels like a toothless attempt at TV series.There are no emotional connections deep enough to surprise or shock the reader, although that doesn't stop Whedon from 'shocking' revelations at every turn.The art is better than average, and supports the gimmicky future that Whedon has built.Still, a mildy entertaining (if self-indulgent) contribution to the Buffy mythos, if not to the comic book industry as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiny","review":"I enjoyed Fray. It's not a towering epic, but it's a good story and fun to read. Since it's Joss Whedon, there's snappy dialogue, teenage girls with superpowers, and flying cars. Also a hellmouth, abyssal sidekicks, and a legendary weapon that looks like the angry love child of a spear and a battleaxe.One thing I love about the way this man writes science fiction is, he doesn't get caught up in the technology. Other writers focus on the complexity of their gadgets; Whedon focuses on the complexity of his characters. Not that they're terribly complex, but they certainly clear the bar for the genre by a great deal. Fray is a graphic novel about people, and it happens to contain glittery space things that incinerate worlds. Scratch that-- there's a huge insecty demon, but no glittery world incineration.Anyway, I liked it. It didn't blow up my mind real good, but it was very cool.

Sitting on the carpet in a circle around her, we all cried our eyes out. I have never again read or even seen this book, but can still remember enough of the horrible details to cringe and tear up. I cannot imagine why anyone would subject a child to something like this. I guess it's supposed to be an anti-war message, but basically what I got out of it was that humans are awful, awful creatures, and I haven't really been able to shake that feeling since. So thanks a lot, Yukio Tsuchiya!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This is a ghastly, gruesome, and cruel story that I believe is inappropriate for children. The supposed message of the book is to stop all wars, but it oversimplifies the situation into a cute and heartrending picture book story that is completely ill-suited to its message and content. While based on a true incident, the book omits the full context which is needed to understand why the war had happened in the first place, which is why most people using the book are using it in high school--an age long past the picture book stage. Many personal decisions made during war-time have devastating consequences, but that doesn't make them an appropriate subject for a \\"children's\\" picture book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inappropriate for children...and most everyone else","review":"This book touts itself as a valuable lesson on the horrors of war but there are many more appropriate ways of broaching this discussion with small children than to bombard them with a dreary, depressing and grotesque tale of animal cruelty and suffering. I don't recommend this book for children OR adults. There are many better books, such as \\"Johnny Tremain\\" or \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" that bring home the point of suffering without grisly, needlessly graphic descriptions of animal cruelty that are completely age-INappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese Propaganda","review":"I have used this in teaching about the consequences of War. This book has made me cry. The more I read the book I realized it was propaganda. In the story the workers must kill all the zoo animals. If a bomb hit the zoo they may get out. The zookeepers have no problem injecting poison into all the animals except the elephants. These compassionate zookeepers decide to starve them to death. Why did they not shoot the elephants? They did they have what it took to kill all the other animals. This book is great for the bleeding heart Liberals that follows their emotions not logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abhorrent","review":"I tried to put zero stars, but the computer wouldn't let me. I hate this book. Never in my life have I read anything this disturbing.

DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I am a 21 year old college student, who was forced to listen to this story in my choldren's lit class (used to illustrate what we should NOT read to children in our future classrooms). This book graphically describes the slow, painful, torturous deaths of three innocent elephants at a Japanese zoo. Yes, it did really happen.. and yes, war is awful... but there is no need for this type of book to be purchased or read by ANYONE. My entire ADULT class sat through this horrible book not only crying but also wondering why if these zoo keepers loved their elephants so much why didn't they quickly end their suffering with a bullet? The book implies that American troops are the \\"enemy\\" which is the reason these poor creatures have to die. Great... inaccurate ... message to share!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I use \\"Faithful Elephants\\" with my middle school Halocaust unit.

It also comes with a tipper (beater) with a comfortable and useful \\"ridge\\" that is off center. For beginners this is helpful. When professional Bodhrans go from $300 - $3,000, this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"After playing","review":"This bodhran is a nice bodhran to play around on. I am just getting started, and I was simply looking for a cheap (in price) bodhran to learn on. This served the purpose exactly. It is not tunable, which again is fine with me, and it sounded better than I was expecting. After playing on a percussion instructors tuned bodhran, this one is clearly a cheaper model, but would not sound all that bad if played with the tuned.Overall I love the product and would recommend it to anyone looking to start out on the bodhran!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound and easy to play","review":"This drum (made in Pakistan not in Éirin) has a nice sound and I found it easy to play. The one draw back is that the cross bars are a little too close to the head and my arm is slightly restricted.

Once I got home, I realized what a mistake I had made. This album is great, and evokes the perfect fantasy/myth/epic mood for the movie. There are enough repetitions of recognizable themes to tie the tracks together, but there is also plenty of variation. A favorite of mine is track 3, \\"The Walls are Whispering.\\" Within this one track are about four themes, including a spirited battle theme (which, to this day, gives me goosebumps)and a medieval dance. Track 7, \\"May Angels Fly Thee Home\\" is a beautiful, sad piece. I hear traces of Jones' work in the movie \\"The Dark Crystal\\" (esp. in track 6) reincarnated in this soundtrack (if anyone knows where I can get that soundtrack, please let me know). Parts of this soundtrack also show a distant resemblence to the \\"Berceuse\\" from Stravinsky's \\"Firebird.\\" This soundtrack truly is magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the real thing","review":"I have tried several types of blueberries - Fresh is best, but not always available - Bob's is the Best natural dried blueberries I have tried in over 3 years.

I had attended the festival but missed out on this film. However, after viewing the film, I found nothing positive about it other than it finally ended. Typical film designed to appeal to teens, i.e., it had the typical showcase of teen drug abuse, teen sex and teen suicide, in a very predictable order. I am glad the RiverRun Festival, which was relatively new in 2004, has progressed to the point this film would likely not be accepted today. After suffering through one viewing of the film, we trashed it, rather than allow it to take up space in our collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"So \\"Wrong\\", It's Right","review":"I'm not an AH scholar. Before this recording, I was only familiar with his work in Tony William's Lifetime II and with Bill Bruford (solo & UK). Wow!

If Holdsworth's records were mixed/mastered differently with much warmer and fuller fat sound, all his EXCEPTIONAL music will become even more EXCEPTIONAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"***THE BEST LIVE SOUNDS YET***","review":"I have always been a big fan of this guy's recorded stuff, and have been waiting YEARS for a live record. This did the trick! This guy is as flawless and mindblowing live as on record - and that is saying a lot.

And today he is on the top of guitar virtuosi even if he is not young!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flawless technique, forgot about the music","review":"I should say at the outset, I am a big fan of Holdsworth's '70's work. With a little maturity I've realized that artists often need to exercise restraint. Holdsworth is now \\"free\\" to do what he wishes and the music suffers. This is technically flawless, but I hear no music. I recommend his work with Gong and Bruford. Those albums contain good \\"songs\\". I also feel compelled to remark on another review. Steve Morse often employs pinch harmonics, I don't know if that what was meant by false. Morse hardly uses any effects. Holdsworth is drowning in effects. Neither is good or bad, just noting the difference. The other reviewer stated otherwise. Joe Satriani hardly ever taps, so that's not where his speed comes from and may use power chords here and there in the background to his songs but that's about it. Back on track, skip this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Night Wrong","review":"I have always read about the guitar exploits of Allan Holdsworth but I had never heard him play, so I asked for a Holdsworth CD for Christmas.I have listened to this CD in it's entirety on three occasions over the past two weeks and I have to say that I was not impressed. This is a live album and Holdsworth, although technically proficient on the guitar, is extremely boring here. I was expecting lightning fast jazz licks, but instead he sounds like he is playing an electric keyboard instead of a guitar. I would say that this CD is for extreme jazz fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virginity Lost","review":"i think I expected this to be some light probably humorous reading but instead I got something that I think was meant as supplemental reading for a Sociology course.

The language flow is so beautifully full that it's a little like eating lamb after decades of consuming malted milk balls and pork rinds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally -- a cook with opinions and knowledge of the Holy Bible!","review":"I read this book in an afternoon and then studied it with five other friends (three of which are not cooks but enjoyed the wit, humor, and bibilical knowledge of the author). If you are a person who loves to cook and learn new recipes, this book is for you! To have someone say what they like and dislike and \\"why\\" is refreshing. I learned many things that will be incorporated into the way I prepare and serve food. For example, I just purchased a wavy breadknife, made bread for the first time (Cuban), will only serve nuts as an appetizer for a dinner party, and will allow myself to enjoy a meal. A dream of mine would be to cook a meal for Robert Farrar Capon and have my friends join in for the fun.

Anyone who know P&P at all knows this happened at the Meryton Assembly dance.

HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"I was excited to find out that there were tons of sequels written to P&P. I knew that none would compare to the original but I still searched to find a way of continuing a link with my most favorite book and its charactors. The first one I read was \\"Pemberley\\". Let me just be frank with my opinion of it. This horrible sequel does not deserve to have the title \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" associated with it. The author has ruined my beloved P&P charactors and disgraced Ms Austen by writing such a horrible continuation of her most famous novel. I felt like hurling this book across the room when Miss Tennet depicted Elizabeth as nothing more than an emotional basket case. Lizzy is shown crying at everything. I only gave it 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option.Please do not read this book and if you have, be consoled in the fact that I too wasted a day of my lfe reading this book and that there are many other more fulfilling P&P sequels out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"The writing style of this adaptation, is not at all like Jane Austen's in P&P. Dark secrets in certain character's pasts are not at all likely to have happened. Elizabeth's character in this novel conflicts with the Elizabeth in P&P. Agitating, and painful to read.

I finished the book only out of sheer determination."},{"rating":"1","title":"JANE AUSTEN would ROLL OVER IN HER GRAVE","review":"This book was disgusting! The inacuracies were bad enough, but what Ms. Tennant did to the characters should be considered a literary CRIME. Mr. Darcy changed by the end of P&P and I seriously doubt he would go back. In fact given the comments of the Housekeeper at Pemberly in P&P he came across as more shy than stuck-up. He most certainly would not have had an affair. He thought Wickham was a rake because of his actions. And even more rediculous is Bingley having an illegitimate child? Bingley? Come On! As placid as Jane Bingley came of in P&P I don't think she would just react with such placidness over Bingley's affair. It is wrong to change the characters that much.If you want to read an EXCELLENT sequel to P&P try PRESUMPTION by Julia Barrett.

Instead of watching tennis I thought Id read this instead. What a mistake. The author has written this with the best of intentions but the style does not resemble Austen's, more that of Jilly Cooper or Jackie Collins. While these are competent writers in ther own right, they cannot be compared to Austen. The storyline is incredulous and the ending hard to believe. Lizzy seems to have lost her wit and become plain rude (monstrosities at Pemberley),even Mrs. Bennett would have known not to mention a douche in a public gathering and the ending...well!!

It is inaccurate to not only the time, but Austen's style. Tennant ventures into areas of Lizzy and Darcy's lives that Austen would never even dare trespass into. The novel is almost sacreligious. If you're fond of haughty romance novels that have many twists and turns, I would recommend that you read this book. If you are one of those people, like myself, who delights in reading anything Austenesque (I wouldn't bring this into that category), read at your own risk.

At least, I was thrilled until I read the first 50 pages. Then I was alternately disgusted, appalled, and horrified that anyone could write such trash and acually publish it as a sequel to a Jane Austen novel. It has more to do with Regency Romance than Regency England. The characters bear absolutely no resemblance to the ones we know and love. The plot is sketchy at best, and in several places has to be forcibly pulled together with no attempt at smoothing out the rough edges. Only the title gives it any relationship with Jane Austen's incomparable original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello is anyone in there??","review":"What is this?

Oh and when did Bingly have a mistress.That is not his character in the least. What makes it worse though is that he had a son on top of all that nonsense. Ya right since when.

I was seriously disappointed after reading it however, when I discovered that the personalities of most of the characters were changed dramatically (and not for the better).

It starts out well enough: basically all of Lizzy and Darcy's closest relations are invited to Pemberley for the Christmas season. For a while, the characters are true to Jane Austen's depiction of them in Pride and Prejudice, but the story goes downhill before you know it. It becomes completely ridiculous and inconceiveable. Lizzy is robbed of her wit and independence, which makes her simply annoying.I ended the book feeling annoyed and resentful that the characters that I love had been completely destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad","review":"Thanks to the warning here, I didn't buy the book.

It took only a few pages to realize exactly how ridiculously bad the book was. The characters names may have been retained, but nothing else. The chronology is completely messed up.

After slandering Bingley she then goes on to portray Elizabeth as weak and Darcy as the all conquering hero.

Had I known (oh, if only I'd read the customer reviews first!), I would have never purchased it. Previous reviewers are correct: Although the author repeatedly quotes from the original novel, as though she is very familiar with it, she constantly flubs certain facts that would naturally be perturbing to even the most moderate of Jane Austen fans. How in the world, for example, could Lydia have four children already (unless she had quads??)? And although Elizabeth and Darcy have only been married a year, Jane already has a one-year-old and is about ready to produce a second? And, of course, in order to pursue her unoriginal and dull storyline of Elizabeth's 'big misunderstanding' of Darcy's character and past history, she totally changed the very qualities in both characters that made them so endearing and everlasting in P&P. Perfectly awful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pemberley, no relation to Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am curious as to whether or not this author has ever read Jane Austen's novel in its entirety, or did she just go by the cliff notes. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Nothing, other than names and places, are the same. The characters are not true to the original novel and the timing of events is nothing short of miraculous (four children born to one family in one year, two to another couple).

What garbage...If you'd like to read a fairly good continuation of a Jane Austen novel... try Jane Fairfax: Jane Austen's Emma, Through Another's Eyes by Joan Aiken.

It's the worst sequel since _Arthur 2 On the Rocks_ or _Hannibal_. Not just because of the myriad inaccuracies, the ridiculous plot, or the crude, stupid characters.

I clawed my way through this abomination on principle. But I'll tell you, I was hard pressed not to chuck the thing in the dustbin. If it hadn't been a library book, I would have. Instead, I penciled a warning on the fly page.

Unclean...unclean.Did Tennant even HAVE an editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, REally BAD","review":"ET has made many errors while writing this book such as the ages of georgiana, and the impossible number of lydia's children. i won't go into depth, since so many of you have already done that. Elizabeth in this book is a worrywart, and Bingley has a DArk past involving a \\"frenchwoman\\" and an illegitimate son. Besides, when was Darcy ever a spy during the Napoleonic wars?! Georgiana is a complete brat and is Caroline Bingley's puppet. Darcy continually keeps secrets from Elizabeth, which puts her into jealous frenzies. I thought that the marriage of elizabeth and darcy was a happy one, yet how cant they possibly get along if they don't know how to communicate? Elizabeth's character in this book completely contradicts JA's Elizabeth in P&P.... This book isn't worth your time, and it completely ruins your image of p&P. and if you are going to buy it, don't buy it hardcover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"frightful, flagitious, unworthy, wretched, terrible, monstrous, fearful, horrible, worthless, tremendous, abominable, unspeakabl","review":"I like a previous reader had to force myself to read this book and fortunately for myself I did not and could not make it to the end. This has to be the worst P&P continuance book I've ever had the misfortune of reading. Not only is the time line completely throw off and wrong, Elizabeth comes off as some weak minded sniveling idiot. How is it that Jane as a one year old child and is already 9 months pregnant and unless Lydia had quadruplets there is no way on this earth that she gave birth to 4 children in a year and a half. If I hadn't borrowed this book I will be burning it as I type this review, never ever read this book you would do better having a lobotomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworthy sequel","review":"Another strange P&P; sequel. Other reviews already point out the numerous inconsistencies, so I'm not going to outline all of them. I don't have P&P; memorized, but even I could use common sense and deduce that this book doesn't really follow P&P; it's kind of like the sequel to a different P&P; in a parellel universe.The characters are all completely different, and it is obvious that the author did not research the time period, as anachronisms abound.There are several great P&P; sequels; don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stunning Disappointment","review":"I only wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this book. This is what I get for not shopping online!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it - an immense disappointment","review":"If you are a Jane Austen fan, you'll find this book disappointing. Behind its pleasant packaging is a 2nd-rate narrative that borrows characters, but doesn't fulfill the reader's expectations.Elizabeth has been transformed into a simple worrywort who can't connect with her husband. Darcy doesn't have much personality at all. Mrs. Bennett is made more likeable, but the humor and wit of the real _Pride and Prejudice_ is lacking.All the characters have developed a smallness of mind that is a reflection of a good story in the hands of an incapable storyteller. The entire narrative is imbued with a negativity that Austen fans will find tiresome and juvenile. Re-read the original and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity and inconsistancy at it's best","review":"Like many of the others who have reviewed this book, I have extensively read and watched P&P. I'm not going to be redundant by listing all the incongruencies in the book. In the whole scheme of the book's inadequacy they're only a slight annoyance. What really disappointed me was that Tennant was not true to our beloved characters. In particular poor Mr. Bingley, who is far too good and respectable to do the things the author writes about. If you truely love P&P you will will read it...then really wish you hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful book!","review":"This book was so awful that I, a book lover, literally threw it into the trash. The author certainly did not portray either the Elizabeth or the Darcy that appear in the novel. Anyone who has read Pride and Prejudice would never believe that Darcy would abandon Elizabeth after an argument where his position was defending Lady Catherine de Bourgh! Or that Elizabeth would lock Darcy out of the bedroom defending her Mother! That is just the worst example from the book. Like Mr. Collins would treat Elizabeth badly and not understand that at some point there would be retribution from Mr. Darcy? That Georgiana would become close to Caroline Bingley and turn on Elizabeth (and therefore her Brother) is so absurd that I am amazed that anyone would publish this utter nonesense. I hope this write up prevents anyone else from wasting their money on this ridiculous book. Had there been a \\"no star\\" category, that is the one that I would have chosen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Actually would have given this a negative star rating if that were an option!!! Of all the sequels out there...this one is truely dreadful. I don't even recognize Elizabeth, Darcy and Georgianna. Elizabeth is so self absorbed as to ignore the impact of Wickham on her sister-in-law and we are to believe that Darcy would similarly be as callous as to expect his sister to tolerate her 'seducer' during a family gathering. As noted by others, the dates/births etc don't make sense...don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Witless\\"","review":"What was Emma Tennant about?! I was so disappointed and even angry with this sequel to Jane Austen's superb \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I was first jarred by the playing with facts and then by the total misrepresentation of the characters of Lizzy, Darcy, Bingley, Georgianna, and even Kitty. The smart, acerbic, and funny wit of Miss Austen became melodramatic soap opera in Ms Tennant's hands, no more believable than a Danielle Steele novel. \\"But before I run away with my emotions\\" as Mr. Collins would say, I strongly urge, if you're an Austen fan, that you don't read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away from this one","review":"I've read several Austen sequels/completion, and this is hands down the very worst one. I purchased it along with \\"Presumption\\" by Julia Barret, and while that book was not perfect, it was at least entertaining and half-way true to the original story, something that \\"Pemberley\\" was not. \\"Pemberley\\" is an inaccurate, confused medley of relationships and events that make no sense in either the relation to the original book or in themselves. It's very simply a badly done soap opera with the 'Austen continuation!' tag on it to lure readers in. Unless you wish to waste your money, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book!!!!!!!!","review":"I wish someone would have warned me about this book before I wasted the money. How could every (completely out of character)horrible thing Mr. Darcy did to Elizabeth in this story be resolved in three sentences without any explanation? What a waste. Please do not buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was ok","review":"I, like many of the other reviewers, am a great fan of pride and prejudice. I have read the book like 5 times and watched the A&E movie at least 10 times. I adore the characters, plot, the whole novel. I read this book and well the I did noticed inconsistencies and the flaws. I was upset that she killed off Mr. Bennet, from whom it was obvisious where Lizzy got her wit. Yet, I did have a hard time putting it down. It does not do JA's characters justice. However, as a stand alone book it is not \\"god awful\\", it has its good points. However, by no means will it ever do pride and prejudice justice as a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever read","review":"This is the definitely the worst book I have ever read - and I am a voracious reader.The plot didn't make sense, the writing was bad, and worst of all, it had none of the style and vivacity of Jane Austen. Although it claims to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice, the characters have little in commmon with those of JA's work except name and they act in such a manner that JA wouldn't even recognise them (and neither will you).In fact, this book was so bad that it made me think that it is obviously not as hard to get published as an author as I thought and I am strongly tempted to rewrite it myself!Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and irritating","review":"This book was simply a train wreck--there was no real plot, and the feeble attempts of the author to create tension between her characters were simply irritating. Pride and Prejudice was about a lot more than Lizzy's family being embarrassing, but this element seems to be the point upon which the author based this sequel. Do yourself a favor and give this one a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this book zero stars, I would!","review":"I have read many p&p variations and continuations, and this was definitely the worst! And this is coming from a person who is very easy on judging others, and when others judge jane austen fanfiction harshly, I'm usually less critical. This book was given to me as a present and the only reason I finished it was because I hate not finishing books I begin. Let's just say that I am happy that it was less than two hundred pages long, because if it was longer, I might have burned it. Don't ever read this book! And it's an insult to Jane Austen's beloved characters. This book is an abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"The major inaccuracies are the easiest parts of this book to loathe. Its faithlessness to EB's spirit is frustrating. Probably the worst PnP spinoff I've read (worse than Desire and Duty). My favorite part was that the author claimed to be a descendant of Austen, which is why I suppose she could forego actually reading Pride and Prejudice. She just channeled it, apparently. Badly. I wanted to choose zero stars, but couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Williams Inside The Actor's Studio","review":"I Agree, would have ordered this,but at only 50 minutes long there is a lot missing-I understand the interview actually lasted 4 hours long and thay edited down to 2 hours for Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Episode","review":"If you're a fan of the TV show 'Inside The Actor's Studio' stay clear of this product. Robin Williams hams it up throughout the show & shows little or no respect to the interview he's supposed to be the subject of. He turns the entire thing into an endless procession of gags & skits & reduces the show to a farce. I watched the show when it aired & quickly tired of Williams' dated & annoying antics. Fun for five minutes & then simply grating and dull. Yes, it's what Williams \\"does\\" but he didn't have to do it here. We learn nothing of Williams the man, just gag at Williams the \\"clown\\". Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't expect the normal routine","review":"Whenever Robin Williams is on a talk show or doing an interview, don't expect the normal routine. Williams goes off on so many tangents that it could drive the interviewer crazy!On \\"Inside the Actors Studio\\" Robin Williams does not hold anything back. James Lipton had trouble asking him 3 questions in the span of 30 minutes. For a lot of people, this would be a bad thing, as they would start to get annoying. However, this is what Robin Williams does best. He is hilarious when nothing is scripted.If you are a fan of the Robin Williams style of comedy, you should enjoy this interview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly remarkable","review":"Well Robin may come off at times as an attention seeking coked out spazz, but there are many moments of comic genius to make this worth purchasing and watching more than once. The improvised bit Robin does where he takes questions from the audience is almost worth the purchase price alone. And interviewer James Lipton does manage to get a few questions in edgewise so you do get some insight into Robin Williams the man. Though don't expect any sort of Oprah-like soul baring, just sit back and prepare to laugh. The guy's a mile a second, not everything sticks but there's enough that does to be thoroughly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Inside the Actor's Interview Ever","review":"If one was to buy only one episode of Bravo's \\"Inside the Actor's Studio,\\" then this would be the easiest decision to make. This timeless episode is special because Robin Williams is figuratively the \\"energizer bunny\\"; he is performing through actions, words, and gestures why he is who he is. The interviewer, James Lipton, gives Robin Williams free reign to showcase his talent and enthralls any audience, whether it be the students in the crowd or the fans watching the DVD. \\"Humorous\\" does not even scratch the surface of what this in depth analysis captures. I would argue that if one had a friend with no sense humor, watching this is one of the few recommendations that will change them.

The songs were good on the most part and the tecnical quality was excellent but the way it was put together was no so hot. The first song \\"the meledy\\" was empty. It looked like the band was just testing their instruments. The audience was just sitting there not even getting involved. The introduction to the song \\"I Got a Reason\\" was not needed. On one hand Hezekiah Walker talks about how much he loves the old way of singning and dancing and then at the end of the video he puts \\"Let's Dance\\" which was done with a secular artist. I was a little confused. Although I did enjoy the video \\"Let's Dance\\" it was very well put together. I also enjoyed \\"I Got a Reason\\" despite the long intro.

It had promise in the first few pages. The author does provide a detailed backround for her plot. However the characters are flimsy & cliche. The writing gets very choppy & leaps all over the place. By page 309 (Where I stopped)they had kissed twice, fought about her *maybe* being a witch & then argued about their anulment 100 times. Enough with the tension & agnst already!

More chilling tales of the Ursus arctos horribilis in action. You can bet that anyone who reads this work will think twice about doing a dumb thing around a very unpredictable bear. The book is much more than a blood and guts thriller. It affords the reader an open minded look at the attacks and as you read you find yourself second guessing the victims.

I live in Alaska and spent the summer camping with brown bears in Katmai National Park. I can say from experience that everything in this book is myth, grotesque fantasy, made up nonsense and lore. These types of book feed the false stereotype that bears are man eaters, which they are not. For example, hundreds of tourists a day walk with bears in Katmai National Park. The only fatal bear attack in Katmai, since it was opened in the 1920's, was Timothy Treadwell - and he was mentally ill. When bears are treated without violence, they are peaceful. This book is nothing more than propaganda by the hunting establishment. If people knew that children and the elderly walk safely with bears every summer, it would seem really pathetic to go out and shoot them.

I bought a Kingston MobileLite and it required no more hassle and is working /much/ better (8.3MB/sec on a low price sdhc card).

I downloaded Windows XP because I was determined to get it to work at that point - still nothing. I gave up and purchased a 33-in-1 card reader at Walmart yesterday for less $$$ and it worked perfectly on the first try.

I always like the alternate storylines, and this one did not disappoint. I won't get into the plot and spoil it for everyone, but you don't need to know too much about the X-men to dive in. Although it IS a big bonus. I mean, the person now in charge of the X-men is a HUGE surprise.This run also takes us back to Jean Grey and the White Hot Room, introducing us to hundreds of other Phoenixes. It shows her in the white costume for the third time ever. I can't wait to find out more.If you like this you should read X-men: The End"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible art that does not match the story","review":"This is some phoned in art work.I found the art so bad that I could hardly read the text. After this many years you think Silvestri would improve his art style but you'd be wrong, he has regressed. It seems as if he couldn't complete the required number of pages for the script, squished it down and just sped through the ones he did turn in so they wouldn't be returnable.I think they teach you to drop cross hatching as a shading technique when you are in High School art classes but here it reigns supreme.Poor work from someone that should be better but rather representative of his current shoddy style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Mix Up Mess","review":"I'm a long time fan of the X-Men and I have to admit that this is the worst story line they have ever had.

There's no integrity, no ownership, no responsibility for anything as soon as you say \\"It's an alternate timeline.\\" You can do anything you like with no repercussions.

It was definitely worth the wait. This book is even more complexly gorgeous than the last. I find more to love and get lost in with every reading of her poems. She manages to create a fully real alternate reality with her words -- A reality of jagged breaths, dizzying heights and a spirtuality that's hard to define -- part torture, part rapture. Larissa Szporluk's poetry is wholly unearthly. I've never encountered anything like it before and it is therefore hard to describe.

He stated that if 1 million people sign a petition for him to stop making movies he will abide. I signed it but to my dismay only 350,000 people have signed it.

Oh yeah an unarmed man takes out a bunch of cops, waltches into prison, and servives his brains being boiled. So is this supernatural or based in reality?

The child in the illustrations seems to be having a great time. Kids can really relate to this! The fact that the book is bilingual is an added bonus for Spanish as well as English speaking children in that it allows children to see and (if read to) hear both languages.I read this book to my daughter and her friend. Both of the girls imitated the sounds of the instruments and laughed at the boy in the pictures.

I've liked Roberts in other endeavors(see \\"Runaway Train\\") but he doesn't seem to get a handle on this one. One of the film's few redeeming qualities is the turn by Greta Scacchi as a wily secretary for Coke's Aussie headquarters. She is sexy, coquettish, and hilarious in turns. Alas, she can't make us believe that she's head-over-heels for Roberts' character. Another reason for pause is a scene where Scacchi showers nude with her on-screen daughter.

I strongly feel that the illustration is frightening for the very young children that it is marketed to. This is because it frightened my 2 year old son.Very young children should not be expected to rationalize the illustration in David Smells, as young children are especially sensitive to grotesque-like visual images. Children do not have the cognitive capacity to put what they're seeing in perspective. In addition, I feel the story is portrayed as disrespectful and rough.The 5 senses is obviously a good subject, but this book is exceedingly poor at representing them. Shouldn't children be able to learn about the 5 senses without resorting to defecation? This is not the type of humor I want to instill in my children.

I've used the strap for 2 weeks and found that the straps slip too easily and I even had the buckle slip off the end of the strap and fall on the floor. The equinox Tinamou sternum strap is much better designed. I had the equinox strap on a previous pack for a year with no problems. Unfortunately, when I went to order the equinox strap again it was unavailable so I settled for the Outdoor Research strap.

The trick to attaching it to an existing pack by doubling over the ends of each side of the strap around your packs shoulder straps. You have to check the placement with your pack on so you can locate it right the first time. Then feeding the ends of the strap around the shoulder straps and through the black plastic stays that come with the OR sternum strap. Then you just adjust the tightness as desired. Great for any pack that will carry any sort of load. Keeps the load from shifting out over your shoulders. Very bad for the back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"We have tasted many different kinds of rice, and this is our favorite.

I emphasize 'were'. This CD is a huge dissapointment! I liked Stabbing Westward mainly because of the industrialish angst they were able to portray in their previous releases. In this album we have a VERY mainstream alternative-rock style that lacks any sought of punch. Quite simply, Stabbing Westward have produced a alumn with whinning vocals and B-rate music that gives the impression of being written for a 'hard-rock' (sarcasm) soundtrack to some B-rate college football/romance movie. So weak I could not find one track that I appreciate.P.S. if you like this style of music though, I strongly suggest you check out a band called \\"Powderfinger\\" who should show you how mainstream-alternative rock should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the intermission I've been looking for.","review":"Well, I picked this album up expecting a hard industrial sound and well, let's just say it's not. It's closer to a soft version of Filter than NIN. The lyrics are incredibly good (well, maybe not on 'wasted') but overall it's a soft intermission to some of the harder stuff I listen to. Overall, I like it. If you like a mellow rock experience than I suggest you pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Sorry, but this just doesn't cut it. The success of Stabbing Westward is due to not only the unique quality of the sounds they produce, but also the base aggression running through their songs like an undercurrent. It would seem this free-flowing river of energy has become a trickle. Every album has a \\"Dawsons Creek\\" song on it, but this effort has a few. And seeing as reviews are about opinions, mine is that SW should further pursue the dark side of their abilities, rather than attempting to join in with the rest of world... (Lesson: Watch interview with band members from Tool)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In all honesty, this album is not bad, but it's just not SW. If your a first time listener to SW, then you may enjoy this, but it was nothing special for a fan of such songs as \\"Haunting Me,\\" \\"This is Where it Falls Apart,\\" \\"Sometimes It Hurts.\\"The only song I waste any time with is track one, since a hint of industrial remains on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"speachless","review":"i cant really think of a way to rate this cd. From ungod to WBB+P stabbing westward changed. But the fans were still loyal because WWB+P was such a great cd. And after the arrival of Darkest Days, which was such an excelent cd, most fans were unable to await the next cd. but with the arrival of this .....i cant think of what to say. Maybe they got bored with being a great band that made no money. now they want to follow the rest of the world and go mainstream. maybe i am overreacting and after awhile the new cd will sink in, but the only thing that i can think of is to ask the radios to play this stuff so their change isnt totaly useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of all the groups I thought would never sell out...","review":"I find it more than a little ironic that a group that has had such wonderfully dark music about depression, betrayal and dysfunctional relationships could so horribly betray their loyal fans with this gutless, pop-radio friendly, mainstream .... It's hard to believe this is the same four-member lineup that created the bleak mood on their second album (Wither, Blister, Burn + Peel) that seems to revel in it's own torment. Am I bitter? Absolutely! If you like their previous albums, do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good band gone terribly wrong.","review":"Stabbing Westward is one of my favorite bands of all time. When I first picked up their new record, I was very excited about the possibilities the album possesed. Unfortionately, after the first few tracks, it became terribly evident that the band had completely abandened their old style for the sake of \\"growth\\". When bands try to grow, this is normally a good thing. In this case, however, Stabbing Westward completely rejected everything that made their band popular in the first place. The anger driven, electronic distorted vocals that were the core of the songs had been replaced with a whiny, nasely voice that took away all the feeling in the songs. I heard that shortly after this album was released, the band parted ways with their label, Koch Records. Frankly, I'm not surprized. My recommendation - Stay away from this album. Go buy one of their earlier albums. You'll be thankful you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, oh, did I say horrible?","review":"SW was once my favorite band, saw them in concert at least a dozen times.

All of the above.Unfortunately, that plan didn't include innovation, refinement and what the old fans of the group were looking for in this new album. This album isn't even worth 0.1$, it's a strongly digested product aimed for a market who doesn't know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable","review":"I have to start by saying that I regret buying this CD. Next, let me describe what I felt when I listened to all of Stabbing Westward's albums. Depression. Abject and complete depression. Within the first minute or two of listening to Darkest Days, the happiness of a new Stabbing Westward album had worn off completely and I was completely depressed. Not because the music was bad, quite the opposite. It was so good it was able to completely turn around my emotional state within just a minute or two. Now, this latest album... does absolutely nothing to me. Hell, its almost happy music. Yet, because of the (IMO) poor execution, it can't even carry across the emotion of happiness. Its just noise going on in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure of where SW is headed....","review":"OK, let me start off by saying that I have given this album enough time by now to see if it will grow on me. Some of the songs on this album are ok, dont get me wrong. I think \\"So Far Away\\", \\"Perfect\\", and \\"The Only Thing\\" are decent songs. However many of the songs on this CD are so bland, and are definetly not SW style whatsoever. Some of the songs dont carry a lot of feeling, and change of melody...like most droning rock bands in the music industry today. SW's last album Darkest Days was ground breaking material for the band, but you have to wonder where they are headed with this. So in conclusion, there are a few decent songs on the disc, but I think your money is much better spent on another CD than this one. Check out WBB+P or Darkest Days, they are much more quality CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland pap","review":"Radio-friendly porridge. Utterly forgettable. Where previous albums were dark, seething, angry, hard, this is utterly innocuous, middle-of-the-road, fleeting AOR bubbles. There seem to be no electronics on this album until the last song. Actually the last two songs manage to steer clear of total insubstance, so I'll give them a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Weep For The Future...","review":"Where did it all go? How can wonderland burst into TRL flames? Chris Hall and the rest of his band used to bring me to emotional depths that amazed me - how could any one group accurately describe how I felt? In anxious anticipation of the new CD, I listened to their older albums for days on end. Then,[when I received] my brand new copy of \\"Stabbing Westward\\" and was elated with the seemingly haunting and yet promising cover art. Into the CD player it went, and that's when Camelot burned. Is fame and fortune that necessary? Where is the driving guitar and the infused industrial electronics? The symbolic lyrical lines and the raw emotion? Gone. Poof. Just like that. Now they sound just like every other single alternative band. Please get it together, boys. What would the world be without you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Usual Stabbing Westward","review":"I was so excited when I heard their new CD was due out. I purchased it and couldn't wait to hear it. When I listened to it for the very first time I was blown away with 'Far Away' - the first song. Then I began listening to the other songs. I ended up searching through the CD to find the usual 'pounding, beating music and lyrics' but before I knew it, I had reached the end of the CD... I was disappointed at first - thinking I really didn't like it as much as the other 2 CD's - but the more I listened to it, the more I got used to their 'new' style of music. I miss the heart-pounding lyrics from their other CD's and if that's what you'd buy this one for- forget it. But if you're a true SW fan, their new style will grow on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Stabbing Westward going with this?","review":"Ok, I admit -- people usually only take the time to write something when they have to complain. I've seen stabbing westward live a bunch of times in concert and own all CD's. But if listeners are expecting the same Sweaty, Visceral, Intense, Emotional play that has made this band famous -- its not here. No gems like \\"Violent Mood Swings\\" from Ungod or \\"What do I have to Do\\" from Wither, Blister, Burn and Peel. Stabbing Westward always contained a lot of high-adrenaline energy in their work. Here it is strangely missing"},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL AND REPETITIVE...MAINSTREAM GARBAGE! :/","review":"This songs on this album make this once respectable band sound just like any other clone that is polluting the radio airwaves. This album is lacking the origionality and depth of previous albums. Where the other albums had a melancholy,cold electronic feel,the songs featured in this disk are dull and repetitive with the same old guitar riffs that mainstream rock bands have used for years! The same guitar melodies are found here than are found anywhere on public radio by numerous bands. If deep,complex albums are too much for your simple mind to digest than this is the perfect album for you! Otherwise do yourself a favor and save your money on something more worthwhile like one of their earlier albums. In my humble opinion the only thing this disk is good for is to serve as a cup holder or to play frisbee with.weeeeeeee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Do Not Buy This Album","review":"Stabbing Westward has really changed. Gone are the heavy guitars, the dark/depressing melodies, and the electronics. What fans will find on this disc is MTV TRL caliber alternative-pop music. Stabbing Westward has died with this release. It's only fitting that \\"Darkest Days\\" was their last \\"true\\" release. Don't let the album cover or any other artwork fool you - This album is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opposite extreme","review":"For anyone who expects the industrial alternative sound of past CDs, you will be sorely disappointed by this pop production. I understand a band's need to grow and explore new directions, but all I could think of while listening to this is that the band sold out to commercialism. I much prefer their previous works, dark as they were, and longed to hear similar creativity and edge in this CD. What really drove home the departure was the last song on the CD, which has a touch of the old sound, where the lyrics seem to suggest that they had no option but to submit to television drones (their new target audience?) who prefer this style."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I didn't even know Stabbing Westward had a new album. I am a big fan of their last two albums, and though this quite a departure from those, it is still excellent. There are very few albums anymore that I can listen to all the way through, but this is one of them. My favorites are \\"I Remember\\" and \\"Happy\\", but everyone of them is good. So what's the big deal with people saying they've sold out? To who? They are still powerful songs. It just dosen't have the dark, dreary tone of the first three. Everyone has to grow up and move on, just as bands do musically. Stabbing Westward has done this growing up and moving on quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not stabbing westward... i don't really like it","review":"i first knew about this cd when i saw new SW files on napster which i didn't know. i grabbed them, and well didn't think it was SW. but pretty quickly i recognized christopher hall's voice. well i hoped that these songs (perfect & television) were only b-sides and won't ever be released. in a naive mood i bought the cd. hell what a disapointment. first of all: this cd is totaly radiofriendly. take \\"so far away\\" for instance: you can sing the chorus after hearing at twice. obviously SW wanted to finally make some money on this cd. i'll give it 2 stars due some songs are well-written"},{"rating":"1","title":"should be a zero...","review":"Their previous album Darkest days was a masterpiece filled with metal/industrial/gothic beauty.

Very Uninspired music.","review":"I have been a big fan of stabbing Westward since Wither.., but I cant honestly say I like where they are going with this \\"new musical direction\\" of theirs. The first three songs are really good songs even though they are not heavy at all. \\"so far away\\" has the classic SW sound. \\"Perfect\\", has a nice depressing pop ballad sound to it that maybe new to SW, but ends up being a great song. The best song on the cd is \\"I remember\\". This song is a tear jerker because of its ability to bring out emotions of lost love like classic glam metal ballads of the 80's. It is not a glam metal song, it just captures that emotion. \\"I remember\\" will be one of the greatest SW songs to remember. The rest of the cd is very uninspired and cannot compare to SW of yesterdays. Barely any electronics and heavyness, also goodbye to great songwriting. Darkest days was a masterpiece of depretion and emotion.

I was reading a biography about Hitler titled, \\"The Horns of the Moon\\" when I watched this documentary and both were in agreement as to what Hitler was most interested in, being theater, building bridges, structures, and most importantly, himself. I was especially impressed by the huge statues that were made (horse, naked statues, etc.) and how he must have thought that art and building would progress his cause.

I did notice that the video touched on playing classical music to your belly, and as a psychology student I know that the Mozart effect has since been disproved.

Only two Richie songs show up here and it is missing songs from a couple of key albums. Hint, hint hint.

This book isn't so much an episode guide as it is a compendium of factoids, character moments, and quotes from the show. Rather than go behind the scenes and analyze the series in depth, Howarth and Lyons take a fanboy approach to the series, and as a consequence this book reads like something written by two fans on a drunken lark off the top of their collective memories. Watch the episodes to enjoy and experience the real Blackadder, and leave books like Cunning to the wayside. This book is best avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big-Time is Now","review":"WOW! What can I say about this masterpiece. Every track on this CD is phenomenal. I went to the CD release party for this CD Halfaworldaway, and Mike Farley and the rest of the band put on a show that would compete with big name artists. I bought this CD the day it came out, and love every track more and more each time I listen to them. Do your self a favor and buy this CD. Even if you don't know Mike take a chance on him and you will see you made the right choice. Mike has opened for big bands such as Dave Matthews Band while in Cleveland OH. Mike will make it big and you can be proud to own his CD. Congragulations Mike and to the rest of your band on all your success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Rockin Fun!","review":"Great pop rock for any age to enjoy...

This brush was also hard to hold on to when it's wet and soapy. Something with a handle, or a more ergonomic shape would be better for use in the bath/shower. The bristles aren't as hard as I thought they would be. The 5 rows of bristles on the bottom are much softer than the single row of bristles on the top of the brush.The rust isn't bad enough...yet...to throw the brush away, so it will be demoted to my cleaning bucket to be used on dirt and grime around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!!","review":"It's very hard to find nail brushes with the narrow side brush that gets under your nails.

I have used mine only once and after 3 months the base of every group of brushes shows signs of rust - not just a little rust but a lot. I thought at first it might be some kind of mildew, but a wash with a bleach solution did nothing. It is definitely rust. If you like this rusty look in your shower, then this brush is for you. I can't imagine why any manufacturer would put together a brush meant to be used with water with anything that would rust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tweezrman Dual Surface Nail Brush","review":"After 1 use, the brush fell apart into 2 pieces - Sorry that I trusted the brand name - wish there was a replacement for it - Very disappointed in Tweezerman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Thought the bristles would be firmer.

It took some getting used to the softer bristles, my old nail brush had a similar dual surface setup, but only once I started using this one did I realize that it didn't need to be that firm and that my old one was beating up the skin at the tip of my fingers.Overall this brush does a good job under the nails and the bristles are firm enough to scrub out grease and dirt from dry rough/calloused skin. The only down side is that I go through about 3 of these a year, but they're cheap enough imo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Practical Dual Surface Nail Brush","review":"I love Tweezerman products ... so when I saw this nail brush by Tweezerman, I decided to buy it.I have acrylic nails and need to keep them super clean (I want to avoid any infection, fungus). This brush is absolutely perfect for that. It has the regular surface which is nice but as a bonus it has a single row of bristles that let you really clean those nails.The bristles are not too hard and not too soft -- I think they are just right. This brush is a quality product and I think should last a good, long time.I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Cracked","review":"I only had this brush for about a month until it fell off a shower shelf and the plastic cracked. At that point the brush split into two pieces. I snapped the pieces back together, but a few weeks later it fell off the shelf again causing a few entire chunks of plastic to splinter off one side of the brush. It wouldn't snap back together. I threw half of the brush away and still use the other half. Even before it broke I would have only given this brush 3 stars. The bristles are too soft to do any serious scrubbing. It's my least favorite finger nail brush that I have ever owned and the only one that has ever had the plastic crack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too soft","review":"After reading the numerous positive reviews I felt confident about buying this nail brush... that was a mistake. The brush costs more than most other nail brushes, but I figured it must be worth it... considering the Tweezerman name and the reviews. It is actually awkward to handle and the bristles are really soft and widely spaced... I dislike this Tweezerman nail brush more than any of the other nail brushes I have purchased. I'm still looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tweezerman Nail Brush","review":"I purchase this product and initially it worked very well. I like the design, it fits very well in your hand...that's why it received the stars I gave it. Why only 2 stars..the plastic is very smooth, if you use this in the shower it becomes very slippery and will fall out of your hand quite easily. I had dropped this in my shower and it cracked (very brittle)...once it cracked the it was susceptible to mold (water gets trapped inside). I had to throw mine in the trash. If they make changes to the product I may consider purchasing, but in my opinion not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for everyone","review":"I used to work in an auto shop and grease would get under our nails. We had a nail brush at the sink similar to this one in design, but a little more heavy duty. Don't get me wrong, this looks like it is constructed well and should last.

It will work fine for removing grease and grime under your nails."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"This item was not very expensive and serves its purpose, but I am disappointed that after only a few weeks there are already signs of rust around the bristles.

It taught valuable lessons; like having unconditional love, and that we should always choose what is best, not just for us, but for those our decisions may affect. In each segment there is a message, or moral. It's good, clean entertainment for the whole family.

Ron Perlman made a fantastic representation of Vincent (man-beast) that would risk everything to protect his beloved Catherine.

It is a romantic fairy tale brought to life in New York between Catherine, a wealthy lawyer and the man (Vincent - the beast) who saves her life. Vincent and Catherine are connected on a very deep level and he senses when she is in danger and comes to her rescue. Knight in shining armour. I think Vincent embodies what women look for in men (though they might not admit it). He's strong, compasionate, gentle, reads poetry and has a wonderful voice that will melt your heart. It also shows that true beauty is more than skin deep. It's what's inside that counts.

It's a disgrace to the show that the person didn't spend enough time searching for a decent picture when there are so many to choose from.

On this album you find him paying tribute to some of the great New Orleans Pianists. He covers 'Tipitina' (Prof Longhair) and the title track 'Orleans Inspiration' undoubtably was influenced by James Booker. His New Orleans based playing is very exciting and these tracks alone make the album worth getting.However, Butler is also a modern Jazz pianist as well being a very good classical pianist. So you will find a variety of styles on this album, not all of which will neccessarily be to your taste. The track 'Somewhere' showcases his remarkable vocal abilities as well. Butler is a classically trained singer whose vocal style is somewhat at odds with his playing on this album.Overall though this is a great album to get hold of if you're interested in hearing a variety of different Piano styles (occasionally he uses electric keyboards as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"Good workout to focus on your lower body.

The groups playing is excellent, and on the few tracks where Emma Hardelin lends her vocals, the singing is raw and full of passion yet still eerily beautiful. All of the music exudes an atmospheric melancholy that probably comes from not getting enough sun, and the moodiness is captured affectingly by the players and singer.On the whole, an excellent little album full of wonderful music. For the price, it's highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next to worthless","review":"After reading the review about the errors in the written Spanish, I still bought the product, thinking that its only value anyway for my child would be in hearing the Spanish spoken, since my son doesn't even read yet.

It has no auditory component at all, so all you have is a simple memory game with Spanish words. Would have been a great item if it had been part of Leap Frog Tag or Tag Junior.

It holds up amazingly. An astounding tale of a female Holden Caulfield, a lovable outcast who pursues her anemic English teacher with a sincere, wholehearted, doomed obsession. The story's backdrop is fascinating as well - New York City in the mid-60s, hippie sensibilities beginning to show in the town but her own family mired in snooty Republican affluence.

He refers to the \\"naieve VB programmer\\" who understands little about the interface between the COM object and Windows. Well, I'm proud to say that I am one of those \\"naieve VB programmers\\" who cares little about the behind-the-scenes operations, and just wants to know \\"How do I do X ?\\" I think I'm going to return this book and pick up \\"Distributed COM Application Development Using Visual Basic 6.0\\" by Jim Maloney.

I have read several books but they all had a strong C++ bias and were hard to understand. This book explains VB and COM and other COM based technologies like MTS, MSMQ, and IIS with such clarity and depth that I found the book harder to put down than a best selling thriller. I have gone through the book twice, the second time with a fine tooth comb, and I am amazed at how much useful information the author has included in a book that others could not in books four times its size.

I have to build distributed apps almost completely \\"from stratch\\" in the environment where most developers do not have enough practical knowledge and experience, and so I was glad to find the book that brings some light to this complex issue. There is plenty of good COM books out there. But definite advantage of this one for me is that it is VB-oriented. CD also contains fully searchable electronic version of the book, which I installed and use as a reference. You will certainly need to read more books to learn specifics about such topics as MTS, MSMQ, transaction processing. Do not expect this book to teach you how to program. It is an OVERVIEW.

It lacks the guts to really go for the jugular and the set-up is pure production line stuff - watchable but forgettable, with Raymond Burr's seduction technique leaving the only lasting impression. It's hard to get excited by Kiino's DVD either - no extras and an acceptable but far from outstanding transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of classic film noir","review":"The DVD transfer is second rate. Some of the scenes appear washed out and much of the grey detail has been muddled over. This film would rate higher if someone had worked to restore the picture before putting it on DVD.This movie, marketed as film noir, falls far short of the mark. Yes, there is a murder and there is a mystery but the plot and screenplay keep the veiwer rather bored. The best view of \\"The Blue Gardenia\\" is that it is also a woman's picture with Anne Baxter as the disillusioned heroine and murder suspect. Anne does a nice job here but it is the overall production that keeps the film from being rated higher.Recommended to: Hard-core noir fans who want to see all films in that genre, fans of Anne Baxter or those looking for films about women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Nat 'King' Cole","review":"The Blue Gardenia was a very good copy.

It was a great disappointment. Where to begin? The story is weak and predictable; the dialogue is very cliched; the acting--excepting Raymond Burr's wonderful performance as a sleazy artist--is unconvincing. Don't expect what the DVD label tells you--this is no \\"noir thriller\\" and it doesn't do anything to expose McCarthyism, despite Lang's pretentious comments. One nice touch: there is a brief 5 minute scene with Nat King Cole singing \\"Blue Gardenia\\" in what was becoming a new trend in early 1950's America: a Chinese restaurant. As a period piece, this film has some merit, but don't expect a well crafted noir film like the \\"Maltese Falcon\\", \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", or even \\"M\\" or \\"Dr Mabuse\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I don't understand why anyone would want to use this book to study SR.

You're probably thinking \\"oh good, a physics book that's not dry\\"... before you take the advice of a positive reviewer, check it out from the library and see what I mean. It is so convoluted with silly detail that it's almost unreadable. If you're a high school student interested in grasping a piece of SR then MAYBE this could be of use. If you're a physics student who wants to learn something at a reasonable pace, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spacetime Physics","review":"This book is very thought provoking, and also somewhat difficult.

This book is so good that after reading it I tried by myself to develop a ten parameter group to enclose the Lorentz transformations.

Those who are looking for a laid back, amusing introduction would love this book. Those posters who are giving it 1-2 stars, I have one question - why did you buy the book? Looking at all the negative posts, they have one thing in common, they were all made by people with some exposure to the topic of special relativity (ie, university physics students). Why one earth would someone studying relativity in university purchase a basic book like this? There are text books written on a more advanced level for people like this - and they should know this. If I'm an advanced expert user of Excel, why would I buy \\"Excel for Dummies\\" and complain that it was too basic?

I consider a sparrow falls to be his weakest book. after reading a number of books on south african history, fictionalized or not, i find a sparrow falls to be much fiction, little history, as opposed to lion feeds and sound of thunder. its like this story was made only to finish off the series and tie up the loose ends. my favorite of his novels were the next five courtneys and elephant song. of course, anyone interested in the fictionalized history of southern africa, the worlds most fascinating, also has to read the covenant. try robert ruark as well for eastern africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion this is the best of the Courtney novels.","review":"This is the third novel dealing with Sean Courntney and is the best of the Courtney novels.

What can I say? The mosquitoes had a lot of fun playing chicken between themselves flying as close to the flame as they could, without even having a sneeze. The only thing that the mosquitoes complained about was that the candles didn't last 9 hrs, but something around 5 (and I'm being generous).

The only way to make a scrapbook page, (or any project for that matter), is to start with a predesigned project and then recustomize it to suit your needs. While there are plenty of nice fonts to choose from, I find the clip art to be very cartoonish - way too cutesy for the elegant pages I am used to creating on my own.I think this software is much more suitable for children due to the overall look of the projects. For the dedicated scrapbooker, I would suggest looking around for software that will create a more professional finished project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Useless!","review":"I thought since this was compatible with Windows XP, it would be very advanced with everything I could possible want.

This book doesn't do that. There is no sorting of what is important and what isn't.Chapter 3, for example, is a very muddled discussion of MVC, and only confuses the whole issue of the place of MVC in Swing. The UML diagrams throughout are not very informative, either.I bought this book with the hopes that it would give me a big picture overview of swing, but instead it just gets lost in all the details.

It should not be priced the same as accepted standard engineering texts.If you are doing design work, there is not much you can use from this book because all the information is very qualitative.

While this shouldn't happen, I thought, maybe I was cranking too hard. So another one was bought from a local supplier. After maybe 10 minutes use of gentle use, the mechanism seized. The second unit was exchanged for a third one, and after maybe 10 minutes use, it also seized. Will use my refund to purchase a different model.I've used Dipel BT dust for years.

And the model plane soon became a real plane. But one problem remained - a huge flock of starlings. With all the starlings, the plane couldn't take off. But what could one lemming, one boy and one rat do about it? Although the characters are a bit shallow, the story was very well written, like all of Murphy's novels.

We got this so we could sleep later on weekends, but the noise of the cats batting it about is worse than their begging. They can sense the food inside so the noisy activities start even earlier.The locking mechanism and the timer are on the same side of the door (towards the back), so the front can be pried up easily given the crude locking mechanism. If they had the lock on the front and the hinges on the back it would be much more secure.The timing is very imprecise. We have two cats that we want to feed at once, but it is unrealistic to think you can get the two chambers to open at the same time. They are independently operated and the timing so crude that there is no good way to synchronize them.This is clearly a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great - with a little addition","review":"This auto feeder works great in that it feeds my cat at 6 a.m. so I don't have to.

I must have not pushed the lid down and set it right.So I reset it, jostled it a bit to make sure it was secure, and set it back down. A minute later, there they were again breaking into the next day's breakfast. I bought the 2 meal version and each tray has a lip that extends down front from under the lid. All they need to do is jimmy that a bit and it pulls right out from the lid. See the user photo with the cat demonstrating to you what your pet will do.

No weight loss yet, but he's not waking us in the mornings any more so I'll take it!I've noticed some other reviewers comment that their cat was able to advance the tray ahead of time but that hasn't happened with us, possibly because I only put dry food in this feeder.

If you have a smart bugger, like mine, who wants his food so badly that he'll do anything to get it, they'll figure out how to manually advance the compartments. Gone is your good night's sleep or your ability to go away for a few days. I bought two of them and had to say goodbye to my investment.

However, I have had this for approximately 9 months, and after about 6, one of my smart kitties figured out how to get her claws inside of the feeder, and get it to move, so she started sneaking extra meals. Upon trying to keep her from doing this (by putting gorilla tape over the edge so that she couldn't sneak her nails in between the tray and the lid), the tray occasionally became stuck and the motor died.

Additionally, our cat ate the trays of food in both bowls on either side of the openning right away after I put it on the floor and then he had played with it enough that it jammed and didn't feed him any of the other meals.

That worked better, but eventually again stripped out again.I plan to try once more, this time screwing the feeder to a heavy board underneath. Actually, before I again ordered one, I looked in a local pet supply store for another automatic feeder.

I'm glad to say it has been a success. Our little kitty's self regulator that controls the amount she eats at one sitting broke years ago and the pounds piled on - so we cannot just leave a pile of food and water. She must be fed a small quantity twice a day. This is ok when we are home, but a pain for neighbors who care for her when we are gone. This feeder has solved the problem. Initially, she was skiddish about this new contraption, but like all the other cats she quickly overcame her concern and would run to it when the rotating sounds chimed from the kitchen. Like other owners we sometimes had to be reminded we did not refill the feeder by her pitiful howls of hunger. My husband came up with a great idea of numbering the bowls with a Sharpie so we can just glance at the feeder and know how many meals are left to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked fine until it broke.","review":"My cat needs to eat a special diet, which entails wet food.

I hoped that this pet feeder would enable me to feed her smaller amounts more frequently during the day.PROS: Easy to program. Mechanism is not too loud. Can accommodate up to 5 feeding times.CONS: Be aware that this is not refrigerated, so if you are using wet food then consider shelf life of the food. Also, after just a month of use, the unit started to rotate only part way, so that half of the feeding dish was still covered.

Waste of $!","review":"Don't bother with this feeder unless you don't really care what time it opens. I bought this to feed 2 cats simultaneously, but the timers' accuracy is so poor that it is impossible to get them to open at the same time. The result is that the dominant cat will eat all the food when the first one opens, then the same cat will eat all the food when the second one opens (up to 45 min later!), while the meek cat starves. The thing is also so light that the hungry animals knock it all around the room, making tons of noise in the meantime. I was very disappointed and somewhat in disbelief that for a price this high, this feeder could be so cruddy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wont work for smart animals!","review":"It is a high quality item - probably the highest of all that I have seen. However, this will not work for smart dogs or cats!Granted the dog probably wont be able to open the lid, but they don't have to. The tray on the inside does not lock into position. It only takes a small amount of pressure to push on the side of the food compartment and make it rotate over to the next one! My Australian Shepherd had this figured out in a matter of days, and even my coating the open compartment in apple bitter spray did not stop him.This thing is useless if you have a smart animal.It is now completely useless to me. I'm going to purchase one of the autofeeders with the reservoir bin that drops food into a bowl, cut the bottom out of the bowl, and mount the thing HIGH on the wall where my dog cannot reach it. It'll drop the food onto the floor and he can have a blast cleaning it up. I think this is the only way I'm going to be able to get any of these things to work with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Automatic Feeder","review":"I bought this for my dog, and only needed to use 1 of the trays for his lunchtime meal. The unit is sturdy and the timing dials also are solidly built. The dishes are removable and washable which is awesome! The bottom has pads so it won't skid when my dog is eating out of it. Other reviewers had mentioned that their pets could get into the tray early, but I think my dog is pretty smart and he hasn't found out how to open it up. He's a puppy and you know how puppies love to get into everything.My only complaint (and why I didn't give it a 5 star) is because you have to be careful when you set the dial - there is a little bit of play in the dial and you could easily think you set it for less time than you actually did. I once accidentally set it and it was an hour off. But now I've figured it out and that shouldn't happen again. Assuming you set it correctly, it's very accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't cut it...","review":"Well, I bought this for my 11 week old puppy, even though I had read all the reviews. I thought to myself, she's only 11 weeks old, she won't be able to do all the things the other reviewers explained. Unfortunately, the first day, she flipped the entire thing over trying to get to the food, so it never opened. To avoid a repeat, I wired the entire unit to a 10lb weight so she couldn't flip it over and toss it around. The second day, she managed to get the food trays out as shown in the pictures by other reviewers animals. So then I screwed the tray to the housing. The third and final day, she managed to get her teeth under the lid and just literally ripped it open. I should note, that she's not very big at 9 lbs, so it's not like it was pure brute force. I'm not sure if I just have an exceptionally intelligent puppy or if this pet feeder is just not worth the money. Either way, I'm afraid I can not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last","review":"I have had this product for 2 years and unfortunately it did not last. The mechanism now fails to rotate the tray. I tried everything to make it rotate but it won't work so now I have to buy a new feeder. This machine worked really well but unfortunately it is not durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"After taking out batteries and reinstalling, the feeder now looks like it works. At first the manual advance button would not work, maybe the batteries were skewed. The feeder rotated on time and it looks like it's going to work for the weekend. Glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great for 3 indoor cats","review":"My cats are older and were putting on some extra weight from their grazing habits. This was perfect to cut their feeding back. No problems. Great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An electronic cat feeder got NO ON/OFF switch","review":"Eatwell 2 meal pet feeder- Model PFD11-13706This so-called electronic cat feeder does not have an power switch. Every time when I don't need to use it, I have to use my fingernail to get out the tightly-fitted battery, or else just to let the feeder continue to consume the battery. Getting the battery with the help of my finger nail damaged not only my finger nail but also the battery.An ON/OFF switch which, I assume, is a feature by default for any electronic applicances. Sorry it is no where from the product description that I could be informed of such operation. So you better think twice before buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat broke into it","review":"Like others here have commented, my cat broke into it very quickly. Not that she's particularly intelligent, just that if she wants food bad enough, and has unlimited time on her hands, she can figure it out. She popped it open the first time we left her alone with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work at all","review":"My daughter bought it via amazon and it was not working in brand new. When you buy something, you won't expect it is not working. We could not return it within 30 days as we brought the feeder overseas to use it for our puppy during a long vacation. Waste our money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal, great product!","review":"Great product. Very simple to use and very convenient.I don't have get up at 5 am to feed my cat anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it for cats","review":"We were sick of being woken up by our 2 young kitties, so we went to Petco and picked this auto feeder out. The design seemed simple and elegant, so we were optimistic when we brought it home. Well, to our dismay the flimsy plastic lids took the kitties about 40 seconds to figure out. With almost no effort they were able to get their paws under the lid, push, and crack both lids wide open. In no time they were chowing down, completely defeating the purpose of having the food set on timer, and to add insult to injury once they were done eating they had a great time pulling the feeding trays out of the pet feeder and spent the whole night batting the feeder and its 2 trays around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUCH too large ....","review":"i found this product Much TOO Large ... i have 4 cats and bought one for each .... could not find a place to put them in my kitchen .... and i have a fairly large kitchen ..... 85% is machine .... and returning them was a nightmare! .... shame on amazon ... usually it is very easy but this time i had to spend several hours on the phone ... mostly on hold .... i will not buy anything from amazon but books and dvd's or cd's from now on ......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not robust enough for my cats","review":"This feeder worked well for us for a while to feed our 2 cats over weekends when we were away ... but then the cats figured out how to force the rotating tray around using nose and paws. So they can now get at all the food immediately and gorge themselves.Now I'm looking for a more robust feeder for 2 audacious (and greedy) cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"What I really don't like about this is the dial timer. You can never set it for an exact time to get the animals used to a feeding time. Dials are not the way to go, and electronic timer with portion control is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless cat feeder","review":"Just bought this feeder to help get my cat to stop screaming at me at meal time. Its worthless though! I can't get it to open with any amount of predictability - and that's what I need most. Also, the lid doesn't close tightly as another reviewer mentioned making the temptation to break in that much greater.A waste of money.
